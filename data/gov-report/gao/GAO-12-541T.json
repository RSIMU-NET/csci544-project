This testimony focuses on, among other things, DHS and TSA\u0092s progress and challenges in implementing three key security programs: SPOT, AIT, and TWIC. This testimony is based on reports and testimonies issued from November 2009 through March 2012, and includes selected updates conducted from February through March 2012. To conduct these updates, GAO obtained information on the current status of the programs and progress made related to the implementation of recommendations contained in prior GAO reports."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) relies on layers of security encompassing personnel, processes, and technology to deter, detect, and disrupt persons posing a potential risk to aviation security.

Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT)\u0097full body scanners\u0097are intended to help TSA staff detect explosives and other threats on passengers. Also, TSA and the U.S. Coast Guard manage the Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) program, which employs a federally-sponsored credential in an effort to enhance access controls at Maritime Transportation Security Act regulated facilities and vessels. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and TSA have made progress and faced challenges in implementing these programs.", "SPOT. Additional DHS and TSA actions are needed to validate SPOT and to establish performance measures. GAO reported in May 2010 that TSA deployed SPOT nationwide before determining whether it had a scientifically valid basis. GAO recommended that DHS convene an independent panel of experts to review DHS\u0092s efforts to validate SPOT and determine whether the methodology used was sufficiently comprehensive. DHS agreed and completed this study in April 2011. The study found that SPOT was more effective than random screening to varying degrees; however, as noted in the study, the assessment was an initial validation step and was not designed to fully validate whether BDOs can reliably identify individuals who pose a security risk. According to DHS, additional work will be needed to validate SPOT. Also, GAO reported that TSA has implemented certain performance measures to assess the program, but has not fielded outcome-oriented performance measures\u0097which track progress by documenting the beneficial results of programs\u0097to help assess SPOT\u0092s contribution to improving aviation security. In May 2010, GAO recommended and TSA agreed that to better measure SPOT\u0092s effectiveness and evaluate the performance of BDOs, TSA should establish a plan to develop outcome-oriented performance measures.", "AIT. DHS accelerated the deployment of AIT to identify threat materials and to provide enhanced security benefits compared to metal detectors. In January 2012, GAO reported instances where AIT units were not being used, raising questions about the cost-effectiveness of this acquisition. For example, data GAO collected from March 2010 through February 2011 on all deployed AIT units showed that some deployed units were not used regularly, decreasing their potential security benefit. GAO recommended and TSA agreed to study AIT utilization and address the extent to which currently deployed units are used.", "TWIC. As of March 2012, the TWIC program has enrolled over 2.1 million maritime workers and DHS has established TWIC-related processes and controls. In May 2011, GAO recommended that DHS conduct an assessment that includes addressing internal control weaknesses and evaluate whether use of TWIC would further enhance the security posture. GAO also recommended that this assessment be used to evaluate the costs, benefits, and security risks of the TWIC program prior to requiring its use. DHS agreed and, as of March 2012, reports that it is further evaluating the TWIC program."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making any new recommendations.

For our past work, we reviewed applicable laws,  regulations, and policies. We also conducted interviews with DHS  component program managers and Science and Technology Directorate  officials to discuss issues related to individual programs, visited selected  airports to observe operations and meet with key program personnel,  analyzed available data from relevant program databases, and used other  methodologies. As part of our TWIC work, our investigators conducted  covert testing at enrollment center(s) to identify whether individuals  providing fraudulent information could acquire an authentic TWIC, and at  maritime ports with facilities regulated pursuant to the Maritime  Transportation Security Act of 2002 (MTSA) to identify security  vulnerabilities and program control deficiencies. More detailed information  on the scope and methodology from our previous work can be found  within each specific report.

In accordance with ATSA, all passengers, their  accessible property, and their checked baggage are screened pursuant to  TSA-established procedures at the 446 airports presently regulated for  security by TSA. These procedures generally provide, among other  things, that passengers pass through security checkpoints where they  and their identification documents, and accessible property, are checked  by transportation security officers (TSO), other TSA employees, or by  private-sector screeners under TSA\u2019s Screening Partnership Program.Airport operators, however, also have direct responsibility for  implementing TSA security requirements, such as those relating to  perimeter security and access controls, in accordance with their approved  security programs and other TSA direction.", "TSA relies upon multiple layers of security to deter, detect, and disrupt  persons posing a potential risk to aviation security. These layers include  BDOs, who examine airport passenger behaviors and appearances to  identify passengers who might pose a potential security risk at TSA- regulated airports; travel document checkers, who examine tickets,  passports, and other forms of identification; TSOs responsible for  screening passengers and their carry-on baggage at passenger  checkpoints, using X-ray equipment, magnetometers, AIT, and other  devices; random employee screening; and checked-baggage screening.", "Biometrics refers to technologies that measure and analyze human body  characteristics\u2014such as fingerprints, eye retinas and irises, voice patterns, facial patterns,  and hand measurements\u2014for authentication purposes. inform the development of a second TWIC regulation, among other  purposes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Additional DHS and TSA Actions Needed to Validate TSA\u2019s Behavior-Based Screening Program, Establish Performance Measures, and Assess Costs and Benefits", "paragraphs": ["TSA developed the SPOT program in an effort to respond to potential  threats to aviation security by identifying individuals who may pose a  threat to aviation security, including terrorists planning or executing an  attack who were not likely to be identified by TSA\u2019s other screening  security measures. This program was designed to focus on identifying  behaviors and appearances that deviate from an established baseline  and that may be indicative of stress, fear, or deception. As we reported in  September 2011, TSA had deployed about 3,000 BDOs to about 160 of  the approximately 446 TSA-regulated airports in the United States at  which passengers and their property are subject to TSA-mandated  screening procedures. The following describes progress achieved and  challenges faced by TSA in validating the science underlying the SPOT  program, developing performance measures, and conducting cost-benefit  analysis of SPOT.", "See GAO, Aviation Security: Efforts to Validate TSA\u2019s Passenger Screening Behavior  Detection Program Underway, but Opportunities Exist to Strengthen Validation and  Address Operational Challenges, GAO-10-763 (Washington, D.C.: May 20, 2010). identifying high-risk travelers.effective than random screening to varying degrees. However, as noted in  the study, the assessment was an initial validation step and was not  designed to fully validate whether behavior detection can be used to  reliably identify individuals in an airport environment who pose a security  risk. In addition, DHS outlined several limitations to the study. For  example, the study noted that BDOs were aware that individuals they  were screening were referred to them as the result of BDO-identified  SPOT indicators or random selection. DHS stated that this had the  potential to introduce bias into the assessment, and that additional work  would be needed to comprehensively validate the program.", "The study found that SPOT was more  DHS\u2019s study made recommendations related to the need for further  validation efforts, comparing SPOT with other screening programs, and  broader program evaluation issues, some of which echoed  recommendations we made in May 2010. DHS\u2019s recommendations are  intended to help the program conduct a more comprehensive validation of  whether the science can be used for counterterrorism purposes in the  aviation environment. Given the broad scope of the additional work and  needed resources identified by DHS for addressing the  recommendations, it could take several years to complete. Officials  further stated that it is undertaking actions to address some of these  recommendations, such as conducting additional analysis of the  program\u2019s behaviors and associated SPOT scoring system in  coordination with DHS\u2019s Science and Technology Directorate. According to TSA, a refined list of the behaviors and appearances used in  the SPOT program to identify high-risk passengers will be completed by  mid-2012. TSA is taking actions to refine the program, but questions  related to the program\u2019s validity will remain until TSA demonstrates that  using behavior detection techniques can help secure the aviation system  against terrorist threats.", "TSA developed a scoring system to help determine which passengers exhibited enough  SPOT behaviors to be referred to secondary screening or to law enforcement officers for  additional screening, or both.", "According to TSA, as part of its SPOT improvement efforts, TSA is pilot  testing revised procedures for BDOs at Boston-Logan and Detroit  International Airports to engage passengers entering screening in casual  conversation to help determine suspicious behaviors. According to TSA,  after a passenger\u2019s travel documents are verified, a BDO will briefly  engage each passenger in conversation. If more information is needed to  help determine suspicious behaviors, the officer will refer the passenger  to a second BDO for a more thorough conversation to determine if  additional screening is needed. TSA noted that these BDOs have  received additional training in interviewing methods. TSA plans to expand  this pilot program to additional airports. We will be assessing this pilot as  part of a follow-on review of the SPOT program requested by the  Chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and  plan to report on the results in 2013.", "Performance measures. Our work on TSA\u2019s behavior detection program  has underscored the importance of developing sound measures to  evaluate the effectiveness of TSA security programs. The Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) encourages the use of outcome  measures\u2014which track progress toward a strategic goal by documenting  the beneficial results of programs\u2014because they are more meaningful  than output measures, which tend to be more process oriented or a  means to an end. Congress also needs information on whether and in  what respects a program is working well or poorly to support its oversight  of agencies and their budgets. As we reported in May 2010, TSA had  established output-based performance measuresprogram, such as the number of SPOT referrals to law enforcement  officers and subsequent arrests; however, it had not fielded outcome- oriented performance measures, such as identifying individuals who may  pose a threat to the transportation system, to evaluate the effectiveness  of the SPOT program. With such outcome measures, TSA could more  fully assess SPOT\u2019s contribution to improving aviation security.", "As noted in our May 2010 report, SPOT officials told us that it was not  known if the SPOT program resulted in the arrest of anyone who is a  terrorist or who was planning to engage in terrorist-related activity.  According to TSA, in fiscal year 2010, SPOT referred about 50,000  passengers for additional screening and made about 3,600 referrals to  law enforcement officers. The referrals to law enforcement officers  yielded approximately 300 arrests. Of these 300 arrests, TSA stated that  27 percent were illegal aliens, 17 percent were drug related, 14 percent  were related to fraudulent documents, 12 percent were related to  outstanding warrants, and 30 percent were related to other offenses. As  highlighted in our May 2010 report, we examined the travel of key  individuals allegedly involved in six terrorist plots that have been  uncovered by law enforcement agencies. We determined that at least 16  of the individuals allegedly involved in these plots moved through 8  different airports where the SPOT program had been implemented. In  total, these individuals moved through SPOT airports on at least 23  different occasions.", "In May 2010, we recommended that to better measure the effectiveness  of the program and evaluate the performance of BDOs, TSA should  establish a plan that includes objectives, milestones, and time frames to  develop outcome-oriented performance measures. DHS concurred with  our recommendation while noting that it is difficult to establish measures  for a deterrence-based program. According to TSA, the agency has  recently developed a metrics framework, which includes process  measures, output measures, and outcome measures, that will allow  SPOT programs at each airport to measure their improvement year by  year. After the framework is validated by DHS\u2019s Science and Technology  Directorate and subject matter experts, TSA expects to roll out this  metrics framework as part of TSA\u2019s general performance management  system in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012. We plan to assess this  framework as part of our recently initiated review of SPOT.", "Cost-Benefit Analysis. As we reported in May 2010, TSA did not  complete a cost-benefit analysis before deploying the SPOT program.  According to the DHS National Infrastructure Protection Plan, security  strategies should be informed by, among other things, a risk assessment  that includes threat, vulnerability, and consequence assessments;  information such as cost-benefit analyses to prioritize investments; and  performance measures to assess the extent to which a strategy reduces  or mitigates the risk of terrorist attacks. cost-benefit analyses help congressional and agency decision makers  assess and prioritize resource investments and consider potentially more  cost-effective alternatives, and that without this ability, agencies are at  risk of experiencing cost overruns, missed deadlines, and performance  shortfalls.", "DHS, National Infrastructure Protection Plan. In 2009, DHS issued an updated plan that  replaced the one issued in 2006. would include a comparison of the SPOT program with other TSA security  screening programs and existing security measures as we recommended.  As of March 2012, TSA has not conducted a cost-benefit analysis, which  could help the agency establish the value of the program relative to other  layers of aviation security. Moreover, a cost-benefit analysis could also be  useful in considering future program growth. The program\u2019s budget has  increased from $198 million in fiscal year 2009 to a requested $227  million in fiscal year 2013, a 15 percent increase over 5 years. In March  2012, TSA officials stated that TSA has developed a \u201crisk and cost  analysis framework,\u201d which has been applied to several different TSA  programs, such as its AIT. TSA is refining the framework in order to  complete the risk and cost analysis work for SPOT BDOs, which could  provide TSA management with additional information on whether its BDO  allocation is a prudent investment.

We analyzed TSA\u2019s utilization data  collected from March 2010 through February 2011 on all deployed AIT  units and found that some deployed units were not used regularly,  decreasing their potential security benefit. During this time period, some  of the deployed AIT units were used on less than 5 percent of the days  they were available since their deployment. Additionally, some units  were used on less than 30 percent of the days available since their  installation. Moreover, we reported that at some of the 12 airports we  visited, AIT units were deployed but were not regularly used. For  example, at one airport we observed that TSA had deployed 3 AIT units  in an airport terminal that typically handles one flight a day of  approximately 230 passengers. TSA officials reported that 2 of the AIT  units were seldom used because of the lack of passengers and stated  that they believed the AIT units were deployed based on space  constraints in areas where they could be placed. According to the Federal  Acquisition Regulation, acquisition begins at the point when agency  needs are established and includes, among other things, the description  of requirements to satisfy agency needs. The limited use of some of  these machines may indicate that there was not a clear need for them at  the time they were acquired at the locations in which they were deployed.  Each AIT unit costs approximately $250,000 to acquire and install.  Additionally, each AIT unit is budgeted for five full-time equivalent (FTE)  personnel, each of which costs approximately $63,000 per year.

As of March 20, 2012, the  TWIC program has enrolled over 2.1 million maritime workers and issued  nearly 2 million credentials. The TWIC is to be used by individuals  requesting unescorted access to MTSA-regulated facilities and vessels  and currently is to be visually inspected by facility and vessel operators.  The following describes progress made and challenges faced by DHS  related to the TWIC program\u2019s system of internal controls and DHS\u2019s  efforts in assessing the effectiveness of TWIC.", "Internal Controls. DHS has established a system of TWIC-related  processes and controls to assist in implementation of the program. In May  2011, we reported that internal control weaknesses governing the  enrollment, background checking, and use of TWIC potentially limit the  program\u2019s ability to meet the program\u2019s stated mission needs or provide  reasonable assurance that access to secure areas of MTSA-regulated  facilities is restricted to qualified individuals. Key program weaknesses  included an inability to provide reasonable assurance that only qualified  individuals can acquire TWICs or that once issued a TWIC, TWIC holders  have continued to meet eligibility requirements.", "As we reported in May 2011, to meet the stated program purpose, TSA\u2019s  focus in designing the TWIC program was on facilitating the issuance of  TWICs to maritime workers. However, TSA did not assess the internal  controls in place to determine whether they provided reasonable  assurance that the program could meet defined mission needs for limiting  access to only qualified individuals.  For example, controls that the TWIC program had in place to identify the use of potentially counterfeit identity  documents were not used to routinely inform background checking  processes. Additionally, controls were not in place to determine whether  an applicant has a need for a TWIC. Further, TWIC program controls  were not designed to provide reasonable assurance that TWIC holders  maintained their eligibility once issued TWICs. For example, controls  were not designed to determine whether TWIC holders have committed  disqualifying crimes at the federal or state levels after being granted a  TWIC.", "We further reported that internal control weaknesses in TWIC enrollment,  background checking, and use could have contributed to the breach of  selected MTSA-regulated facilities during covert tests conducted by our  investigators. During these tests at several selected ports, our  investigators were successful in accessing port facilities using counterfeit  TWICs, authentic TWICs acquired through fraudulent means, and false  business cases (i.e., reasons for requesting access). Our investigators  did not gain unescorted access to a port where a secondary port-specific  identification was required in addition to the TWIC. TSA and Coast Guard  officials stated that the TWIC alone is not sufficient and that the  cardholder is also required to present a business case. However, our  covert tests demonstrated that having an authentic TWIC and a legitimate  business case were not always required in practice.", "In our May 2011 report, we recommended that the Secretary of  Homeland Security perform an internal control assessment of the TWIC  program by (1) analyzing existing controls, (2) identifying related  weaknesses and risks, and (3) determining cost-effective actions needed  to correct or compensate for those weaknesses so that reasonable  assurance of meeting TWIC program objectives can be achieved. DHS  officials concurred with our recommendations. As of March 2012, DHS  reported that it had initiated a review of current internal controls,  established a working group with executive oversight to develop and  implement solutions to these recommendations, and completed a number  of short-term actions to partially address some of the weaknesses. We  plan to assess these actions as part of our review of the TWIC pilot and  will issue a report on our assessment later this year.", "TWIC\u2019s Effectiveness. As we reported in May 2011, DHS asserted that  the absence of the TWIC program would leave America\u2019s critical maritime  port facilities vulnerable to terrorist activities.has not assessed the effectiveness of TWIC at enhancing security or  reducing risk for MTSA-regulated facilities and vessels. Further, DHS has  not demonstrated that TWIC, as currently implemented and planned with  card readers, is more effective than prior approaches used to limit access  to ports and facilities, such as using facility-specific identity credentials  with business cases (i.e., reasons for requesting access).", "However, to date, DHS  According to TSA and Coast Guard officials, because the program was  mandated by Congress as part of MTSA, DHS did not conduct a risk  assessment to identify and mitigate program risks prior to implementation.  However, internal control weaknesses raise questions about the  effectiveness of the TWIC program. Moreover, as we have previously  reported, Congress also needs information on whether and in what  respects a program is working well or poorly to support its oversight of  agencies and their budgets, and agencies\u2019 stakeholders need  performance information to accurately judge program effectiveness.  Therefore, we recommended in our May 2011 report that the Secretary of  Homeland Security conduct an effectiveness assessment that includes  addressing internal control weaknesses and, at a minimum, evaluate  whether use of TWIC in its present form and planned use with readers  would enhance the posture of security beyond efforts already in place  given costs and program risks. We further recommended that the internal  control and effectiveness assessments be used as the basis for  evaluating the costs, benefits, and security risks of the TWIC program  prior to requiring the use of TWICs with card readers. DHS concurred with  our recommendation. As of March 2012, DHS reports that it is further  evaluating the TWIC program using its risk assessment model.
