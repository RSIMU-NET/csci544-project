On October 30,  2001, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) developed standards  for success in each of its five governmentwide management initiatives,  including the strategic management of human capital, to show how well an  agency is executing the initiatives.  In December 2001, the Office of  Personnel Management (OPM) released a human capital balanced  scorecard to assist agencies in responding to the OMB tool.  While GAO\u2019s  human capital model was developed independently of OMB and OPM, we  provided drafts of the model for their review prior to publication to help  ensure that the three efforts are conceptually consistent.  We hope that  agencies will find the perspective and information in our human capital  model helpful in their efforts to respond to the administration\u2019s  management initiatives, get to \u201cgreen\u201d on OMB\u2019s management scorecard,  and use the tools developed by OPM.", "Over the coming months, we will continue to work closely with OPM, OMB,  Congress, and others to explore opportunities to develop a more fully  integrated set of guidance and tools for agencies to use to address their  human capital challenges.  Consistent with that collaborative approach, we  are issuing this model as an exposure draft as a way of seeking further  advice and feedback.  We also hope to identify additional examples of specific and practical steps agencies are taking to make progress.

An  organization\u2019s people define its character, affect its capacity to perform,  and represent the knowledge-base of the organization.  As such, effective  strategic human capital management approaches serve as the cornerstone  of any serious change management initiative.  They must also be at the  center of efforts to transform the cultures of federal agencies so that they  become less hierarchical, process-oriented, stovepiped, and inwardly  focused; and more flat, results-oriented, integrated, and externally focused.", "In January 2001, GAO designated strategic human capital management as a  governmentwide high-risk area.  As GAO\u2019s January 2001 High-Risk Series  and Performance and Accountability Series reports make clear, serious  human capital shortfalls are eroding the ability of many agencies, and  threatening the ability of others, to economically, efficiently, and effectively  perform their missions.  Plainly, the major problem is not federal  employees.  Rather, the problem is the lack of a consistent strategic  approach to marshaling, managing, and maintaining the human capital  needed to maximize government performance and ensure its  accountability.  Our High-Risk report outlined four pervasive human  capital challenges now facing the federal government:   Leadership, continuity, and succession planning  Strategic human capital planning and organizational alignment  Acquiring and developing staffs whose size, skills, and deployment meet   Creating results-oriented organizational cultures These challenges are longstanding and will not be quickly or easily  addressed.  They require sustained and inspired efforts by many parties,  including the President, department and agency leaders, the Office of  Management and Budget, the Office of Personnel Management, Congress,  and others.  Comprehensive human capital legislative reforms will likely  be needed, but agency leaders must not wait for them to happen.  Much of  the authority agency leaders need to manage human capital strategically is  already available under current laws and regulations.  Therefore, we  believe the first step toward meeting the government\u2019s human capital  challenges is for agency leaders to identify and make use of all the  appropriate administrative authorities available to them to manage their  people for results.  The use of these authorities often will need to be  undertaken as part of and consistent with proven change management  practices.  The second step is for policymakers to pursue incremental  legislative reforms to give agencies additional tools and flexibilities to hire,  manage, and retain the human capital they need, particularly in critical  occupations.  The third step is for all interested parties to work together to  identify the kinds of comprehensive legislative reforms in the human  capital area that should be enacted over time.  These reforms should place  greater emphasis on skills, knowledge, and performance in connection  with federal employment and compensation decisions, rather than the  passage of time and rate of inflation, as is often the case today."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "A Model Of Strategic Human Capital Management: A New Tool For Agency Leaders", "paragraphs": ["The human capital model highlights the kinds of thinking that agencies  should apply, as well as some of the steps they can take, to make progress  in managing human capital strategically.

In addition, we considered lessons learned from GAO reports on  public and private organizations that are viewed as leaders in strategic  human capital management and managing for results. Additional GAO  reports highlighting the progress and shortcomings of individual federal  agencies in these two areas were also consulted (Appendix A).  Our model  was further informed by the findings of external reports on strategic human  capital management and managing for results from academia, OPM, the  Merit Systems Protection Board, the National Academy of Public  Administration, and others.", "We also reflected upon our own experience in strategic human capital  management and lessons learned from our use of flexibilities available to  GAO for maximizing the performance and accountability of GAO  employees.  Since maximizing performance and assuring accountability  are at the heart of our mission at GAO, we believe it is our responsibility to  lead by example, especially in the human capital area.  By managing GAO\u2019s  workforce strategically and focusing on results we are helping to improve  our performance and enhance accountability.  By doing so, we also hope to  demonstrate to other federal agencies that they can make similar  improvements in the way they manage their people.", "Individuals who made key contributions to this product include Stephen  Altman, Martin DeAlteris, Ellen V.

Taken together, the eight critical success factors embody an  approach to human capital management that is fact-based, focused on  program results and mission accomplishment, and incorporates merit  principles and other national goals.  When considering the human capital  cornerstones and the critical success factors, it is important to remember  that they are interrelated and mutually reinforcing.  Any pairing or ordering  of human capital issues may have a sound rationale behind it, but no  arrangement should imply that human capital issues can be  compartmentalized and dealt with in isolation from one another.", "All of the critical success factors reflect two principles that are central to  the human capital idea:  People are assets whose value can be enhanced through investment.

To understand the progression  from level to level, it is best to keep in mind the two central human capital  ideas just discussed.  An agency at Level 1 is unlikely to have effectively put  these two principles into practice.  At Level 2 an agency is clearly taking  steps to apply them.  An agency at Level 3 has made these principles an  integral part of its approach to doing business, and can see demonstrable  results from having done so.  Progressing to Level 3, which each agency  should strive to accomplish, will take considerable time, effort, and  resources on behalf of agency leadership to successfully manage the  required organizational change.  The use of this model requires a long-term  commitment to valuing human capital as a strategic asset.", "Agency leaders view people as  costs to be cut rather than as  assets to be valued.   Management decisions  involving the workforce are  often made without considering  how these decisions may affect  mission accomplishment.   Similarly, business decisions  are often made without due  consideration of the human  capital needs they entail or the  human capital approaches that  may be needed for successful  implementation.", "Agency leaders acknowledge  the importance of human capital  to mission accomplishment, and  have informed managers at all  levels of the roles they need to  play in acquiring, developing,  and retaining people to meet the  agency\u2019s programmatic needs.

Agency leaders, career and  political alike, should be held accountable and should hold others  accountable for the ongoing monitoring and refinement of human capital  approaches to ensure continuous effectiveness, constant improvement,  and increased mission accomplishment within the agency.  Moreover, a key  factor in the success of any specific strategic human capital initiative is the  sustained attention of senior leaders and managers at all levels of the  agency to valuing and investing in their employees.

Career executives can provide the long-term commitment  and focus needed for the agency to achieve strategic human capital  management. Two mechanisms for fostering a committed leadership team  are an executive development program and comprehensive succession  planning which are linked to agency goals and objectives. The executive  development program can include planned developmental opportunities,  learning experiences, and feedback for candidates.  Support for and use of  government and nongovernment executive development programs can  help agency leaders in establishing an active executive development  program.", "To hold managers accountable for human capital management, agency  leaders can make an effort to select managers who have the ability to  manage human capital and can see the connection between that  responsibility and the organization\u2019s ability to achieve its long-term goals.  Performance appraisal feedback for those managers selected should  include a review of human capital management competencies, technical  skills, and the accomplishment of program results.  Furthermore, agencies  can modify incentive systems to emphasize the consideration of long-term  consequences of human capital management decisions in addition to  immediate results.", "Agency leaders have other opportunities for displaying their commitment  to human capital.  Continuous learning efforts, employee-friendly  workplace policies, competency-based performance appraisal systems, and  retention and reward programs are all ways in which agencies can value  and invest in their human capital. The sustained provision of resources for  such programs can show employees and potential employees the  commitment agency leaders have to strategic human capital management.", "To demonstrate its commitment to human capital, agency leadership at the U.S. Mint (Mint) has supported several initiatives involving the use of human capital  flexibilities.  According to officials at the Mint, the full support of agency leadership  was attained for these initiatives that were pursued for their strategic value and  alignment with business goals.  The Mint has pursued approaches in the areas of  recruiting, hiring, developing, and retaining talent, increasing the flexibility of the  workforce, and respecting and rewarding employees.", "The U.S. Mint is facing considerable challenges to recruit and retain a high quality workforce and, in response, has begun to explore ways to take advantage of all the human capital flexibilities currently available under existing laws and regulations.  Recognizing this challenge, the Office of the Chief Financial Officer obtained the full support of agency leadership to assign two full time employees and provide budget resources for a Human Resources Flexibilities Team that was formed to do a two- phase study concerning human capital flexibilities.  Phase one included an extensive review of all human capital flexibilities currently available to the Mint under existing laws and regulations.  Phase two included an analysis of the Mint's current use of flexibilities and the development of recommendations to agency leadership for increasing their effectiveness as recruitment and retention tools that were prioritized against the Mint's strategic goals.  Many new programs have been initiated or are planned as a result of this effort.  For example, the Mint has implemented an Information Technology Pilot Study to facilitate the hiring process, which has resulted in the Mint hiring six new IT employees in an average time span of 15 days.  Still in development is a Single Agency Qualifications Standard with the purpose of collapsing 13 occupations into one occupation to provide management and employees with the flexibility to move from one job to another. Also in development is an Occupational Training Agreements program in conjunction with the Competency Based Careers initiative.  Under the Mint's competency based job description, an employee can sign an occupational training agreement stating that he or she will acquire new skills which will allow for promotion without the one year time-in-grade requirement.

High-performing organizations also recognize the need for leveraging the  internal human capital function with external expertise, such as  consultants, professional associations, and other organizations, as needed.", "For human capital professionals to begin acting in this new capacity,  agency leaders must ensure that they have the competencies and  experience to effectively take on the expected role. One tool available to  agencies for identifying the appropriate competencies is the International  Personnel Management Association\u2019s Human Resource Competency  Model.  The new role of the human capital function will require agencies to  recruit new professionals and train existing professionals in the  competencies to help align human capital management with the specific  needs and circumstances of each agency.  It will also require agencies to  constantly reevaluate their internal procedures so that fewer staff  resources are required for processing transactions and more resources can  be dedicated to meeting the strategic needs of the organization.

While reviewing outsourcing  options, it is also important to consider whether or not the agency has the  expertise available to manage the cost and quality of contractor activities.", "In response to the Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 (Restructuring Act), the  Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has taken several steps toward modernizing its  organizational structure and its performance management system.The  Restructuring Act led IRS to adopt a new mission statement that places greater  importance on serving the public and meeting taxpayer needs, developing and  implementing a reorganization plan, and enhancing taxpayers' rights.  In responding to the requirements of the Restructuring Act, IRS has begun to align human capital  approaches to assist in accomplishing its strategic goal of improved customer  service.", "In the first 3 years since the implementation of the Restructuring Act, IRS has developed an integrated modernization strategy and implemented a new  organizational structure with four customer-focused operating divisions to meet the needs of the taxpayer segments it serves and reflect the agency's strategic plan. The four operating divisions that have resulted from the modernization strategy include: large and mid-size business, tax-exempt and government entities, small business and self-employed, and wage and investment.  This new direction, reflected in the strategic plan, outlines three strategic goals and corresponding balanced measures, including a strategic goal of providing service to each taxpayer that is measured through customer satisfaction data.  To achieve this goal, IRS has recently implemented a customer service employee-training program that offers employees specialized training geared toward the taxpayer segment they serve.  In addition, IRS's new performance management plan calls for each operating division to have complementary goals, objectives, and measures for front-line managers to develop plans identifying the actions they need to take to support operational objectives. To assist in this effort, IRS implemented a realigned performance evaluation system for executives, managers, and supervisors in February 2000."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Data-Driven Human Capital Decisions", "paragraphs": ["Concepts: A fact-based, performance-oriented approach to human capital  management is crucial for maximizing the value of human capital as well as  managing risk.

For example,  agencies may have data on the number of people receiving training and  money spent on training, however to measure the real impact of training,  agencies should develop additional indicators to determine the relationship  of training efforts to the accomplishment of agency goals and objectives.   This effort should include developing a knowledge, skills, and  competencies inventory for employees and updating it regularly to  determine if there is an increase in the inventory of skills for which  employees are being trained.  Organizations should also consider collecting  and using performance data to identify gaps in performance, skills,  competencies, workforce shape, and other areas.  Just as human capital  approaches are aligned with strategies for accomplishing programmatic  goals, so should performance measures of human capital approaches be  aligned with performance measures of programmatic efforts.", "The types of data that can inform workforce planning efforts include but  are not limited to: size and shape of the workforce, skills inventory,  attrition rates, projected retirement rates and eligibility, deployment of  temporary employee/contract workers, dispersion of performance  appraisal ratings, average period to fill vacancies, data on the use of  incentives, employee feedback surveys, feedback from exit interviews,  grievances, or acceptance rates of job candidates.", "The Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) has taken steps toward improving the  collection and use of its human capital data to manage the risk it faces in light of  retirement eligibility projections and the potential loss of institutional memory by  developing plans for reshaping its workforce to meet its future business needs.  The  mission of AFMC, the largest employer of civilians in the Air Force, is to develop,  deliver, and sustain the best products for the Air Force.", "In October 1998 AFMC began a workforce study, \u201cSustaining the Sword,\u201d so that the  agency's human capital approaches for civilian, military, and contractor employees  could be tailored to meet future business needs, such as depot maintenance and  information management.   The work force study was conducted in two phases.   AFMC reports that Phase I provided an overarching view of the current and  projected 2005 work force and the potential impact of a prolonged hiring freeze and  a workforce nearing retirement.   Phase II was reportedly a more detailed analysis,  focusing on work force data collected from AFMC centers, at position-level detail.   Results were analyzed in support of workforce planning for the purpose of achieving  future business needs.  The study led to the development of metrics for fact-based  personnel management to collect data for demonstrating the successes and  shortcomings of AFMC human capital approaches.  Such metrics include retention  and attrition of new IT recruits, progress made in fulfilling individual professional  development plans, and exit survey data, to name a few.  AFMC reported that these  data and the results of initial workforce shaping activities have led to a more  informed understanding of current workforce gaps and those that may surface as  large numbers of employees become eligible to retire.

Resources may  include funds, personnel, staff hours, information technology, or facilities  and should be provided for in the agency\u2019s budget as appropriate.  When  considering these opportunities, agencies must also consider the  competing demands confronting them, the limited resources available, and  how those demands and resources require careful balancing and  prioritization.

In that regard, OPM has published Human Resource Flexibilities and  Authorities in the Federal Government to assist agencies in identifying  available flexibilities.  Moreover, agencies may develop demonstration  projects through OPM, temporarily waiving selected federal civil service  laws, rules, and regulations for the purposes of developing, testing, and  evaluating new human capital approaches that may have broader  applicability than existing ones.  Demonstration projects can focus on  recruiting and hiring procedures, classification and compensation systems,  incentive systems, or on involving employees and labor organizations in  personnel decisions.  OPM has recently expressed a willingness to conduct  more demonstration projects.", "Educating agency personnel about the availability and proper use of human  capital flexibilities, such as student loan repayment and childcare services,  is an important step toward tailoring these approaches to meet identified  needs.  For example, agencies can explore opportunities to offer  recruitment bonuses and retention allowances, skill-based pay, and flex  time/flexiplace schedules that will enhance their employees\u2019 ability to  balance their work and personal lives.
