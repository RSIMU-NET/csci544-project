This capability is required to assure access to beach- landing sites by combat and support forces. The Navy has had two systems in development since 1993 to address this shortfall. However, their development is currently on hold because the Navy and the Marine Corps are concerned about their operation, safety, and reliability. Since the dedicated mine countermeasures forces are not normally deployed with the ships that make up the carrier battle and amphibious ready groups, the Navy is developing organic mine countermeasures capabilities\u2014that is, systems that are on and deployed with ships, helicopters and submarines, in the carrier battle and amphibious ready groups. Seven new organic systems are in development, and initial units are expected to begin entering the fleet in 2005. Although it has developed and maintains an updated Mine Warfare Plan, the Navy has not decided on a mix of organic and dedicated platforms (ships and aircraft) and systems that will make up its future mine countermeasures force structure. A decision is needed to determine the types and quantities of systems to be procured, help set priorities among systems, and determine the level of resources required for their development, procurement, and sustainment. A congressionally mandated certification of the Navy\u2019s Mine Warfare Plan by the Secretary of Defense has enhanced the importance of mine countermeasures programs within the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Navy.

Because of this shortcoming, the Navy is developing organic mine countermeasures systems for carrier battle and amphibious ready groups. Organic systems would allow naval forces to counter sea mines without having to wait for the dedicated mine countermeasure forces to arrive.

To support a continuing emphasis on developing the desired mine countermeasures, the Congress added an annual certification requirement in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1992 and 1993. This legislation, and subsequent extensions, provides for the transfer of primary responsibility for developing and testing mine countermeasures systems from the Navy to an office within DOD unless the Secretary of Defense certifies that certain conditions are met each year. Specifically, the Secretary of Defense could waive this transfer of responsibility by certifying that the Secretary of the Navy, in consultation with the Chief of Naval Operations and the Commandant of the Marine Corps, had submitted an updated mine countermeasures master plan and provided sufficient resources for executing the updated plan.

The Navy expects the first units of these systems to reach the fleet in 2005. Additionally, the Navy has begun or made progress on a number of other initiatives to improve mine countermeasures capabilities as shown in the following examples: In September 1998, the Navy began undertaking a new effort\u2014known as the Fleet Engagement Strategy\u2014that is intended to facilitate the introduction of organic mine countermeasures capabilities and educate the naval services about the emphasis the Navy is placing on achieving proficiency in fleetwide mine warfare. Among other things, the effort seeks to (1) increase the number of sailors attending classroom and waterfront mine warfare training, (2) increase the participation of the dedicated mine countermeasures forces in fleet exercises and battle experiments, (3) develop mine warfare doctrine and tactics, and (4) promote the fleet\u2019s acceptance of the need to strengthen mine warfare capabilities. The Navy has made some progress in these areas.

However, these weapons system are planned for the new DD-21 class of destroyers, which are not scheduled to begin entering the fleet until fiscal year 2011. The final ship of this class is not planned for completion until fiscal year 2020. Consequently, it will be many years before the Navy will be able to meet the Marine Corps\u2019 fire support requirements, even if the DD-21 development schedule can be executed as currently planned. Any delays in the development and procurement of the DD-21 ships will delay the achievement of needed fire support capabilities.", "The development of the Land Attack Standard Missile is currently on schedule and within previously estimated costs. It is expected to reach initial operating capability in fiscal year 2004. However, the cost of each missile\u2014estimated at about $400,000\u2014and the small quantity of missiles that will be purchased will probably limit the use of this missile to high- value targets.", "The Advanced Land Attack Missile is being developed for the DD-21 and for possible retrofitting onto other surface ships and submarines. The missile is currently expected to reach initial operating capability with the DD-21 in fiscal year 2011. The Navy is currently conducting a congressionally directed Analysis of Alternatives to determine the future course of this acquisition.", "The Naval Fires Control System is a mission-planning system designed to tie together the various sensor and fire-control systems of the various naval surface fire support and land attack weapons.

DOD noted that on the bases of preliminary system performance estimates and studies, the Navy has determined an initial mine countermeasures force level for organic systems. DOD also noted that initial funding plans for achieving this force level are provided in the Future Years Defense Program. However, this force level decision does not address the size and composition of future dedicated mine countermeasures systems and platforms. Furthermore, the Navy has not decided how much of the mine warfare mission can be satisfied by organic systems and how much can be satisfied by dedicated systems. We noted in the report that the Navy is waiting for additional systems performance data and for more analytical study results before deciding on the ultimate size and composition of it organic and dedicated mine countermeasures forces. Until such decisions are made, the Navy will not be able to plan the full extent of its future funding needs for all mine countermeasures forces, from the standpoint of development, procurement, maintenance, and modernization.", "DOD did not agree with our statement that the Navy has not established funding priorities among its various antisubmarine and mine countermeasures programs. DOD asserted that the budget takes into account priorities across all of the military services and war-fighting areas and represents an appropriate investment strategy. Since DOD\u2019s budget represents the outcomes of many diverse constituencies competing for limited resources, funding tradeoffs and compromises are required to achieve agreement. As we have previously reported, DOD employs overly optimistic planning assumptions in its budget formulation, which leads to far too many programs for the available dollars. Optimistic planning provides an unclear picture of defense priorities because tough decisions and trade-offs are avoided.", "On multiple occasions, the Congress has unsuccessfully sought information from DOD on the relative priorities of the programs being funded, the priorities among requirements, and the priorities of programs not funded. For example, the Congress, after directing the Secretary of Defense to provide an assessment of needed antisubmarine warfare capabilities, subsequently directed the Secretary to prioritize the programs discussed in the assessment and provide the estimated costs over time to develop and procure the needed capabilities. The information the DOD has provided to the Congress in its mine warfare certification submissions and its Anti-submarine Warfare Assessment and the subsequent Roadmap did not provide a prioritized ranking of competing capabilities or individual programs within those capabilities. We have also reported that leading organizations follow a defined process for ranking and selecting projects. The selection of projects is based on preestablished criteria and a relative ranking of investment proposals. These organizations determine the right mix of projects by viewing all proposed investments and their existing assets as a portfolio. They find it beneficial to rank projects because the number of requested projects exceeds available funding. If such specific rankings of programs were provided to the Congress as supplemental information, they could serve as reference points from which to view year-to-year changes in budget request amounts relative to the stated priorities.", "DOD also disagreed with our statement that funding for antisubmarine warfare programs has not been at the levels that the Navy deemed adequate to respond to the most likely threats. DOD stated that current funding for antisubmarine warfare is considered adequate when viewed in the context of the total threat to the Navy when operating in littoral regions. We accept DOD\u2019s determination that current funding levels are adequate.
