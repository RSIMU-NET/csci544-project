Tribes also enter into self-governance and other contracting arrangements with two federal agencies--the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and the Indian Health Service--to assume the management of individual services, including law enforcement, education, social services, and road maintenance. GAO also analyzed the relationship between changes in tribes' economic profile and the extent to which they had self-governance or contracting arrangements to perform their own services.

From 1993 to 2002, 143 Indian tribes and tribal organizations received $112 million in EDA grants, but this represented a small portion of EDA's awards to all organizations. Of the total amount awarded to Indian tribes or Alaska Native entities, $54 million was used to fund 63 enterprise projects designed to create income and jobs. Of the 59 projects GAO collected data on, 25 had not yet begun operating, and 3 others had just been completed and no results were available. Of the 31 operational projects, tribal officials reported that about half were profitable or were covering their costs, and the remainder were being subsidized or had failed. Most had resulted in the creation of 10 or fewer jobs, and few had attracted private sector investment. EDA also provided $22 million in grants to tribes for infrastructure projects, such as roads and sewer systems, $30 million in grants to assist tribes with economic planning, and $5 million for loan funds and business development. Almost all of the 219 federally recognized tribes with available data had entered into either contracts or self-governance compacts to operate their own tribal programs and services. Based on GAO's analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data, tribes that had self-governance arrangements or were engaging in higher levels of contracting showed greater gains on average in employment levels from 1990 to 2000 compared with tribes that were contracting less. However, the change in per capita income or the percentage of tribal individuals with incomes above poverty levels over this period was not statistically different for self-governance or high-contracting tribes compared with low-contracting tribes."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Creating employment and raising incomes is a key priority for Indian and  Alaska Native communities, and we have previously reported that over 100  federal programs were potentially available to assist tribes or tribal  members with economic development activities. One agency providing  such aid is the Economic Development Administration (EDA) within the  Department of Commerce (Commerce), which provides grants to  distressed communities to generate new and retain existing jobs and to  stimulate economic growth in areas of the nation experiencing high  unemployment, low income, or severe economic distress, including  American Indian tribes and tribal consortia. Annually, EDA awards  between $200 and $400 million in total grants, but public information on the  extent to which EDA grants are assisting tribes was not readily available. In  addition to financial assistance from federal agencies, Congress has also  attempted to help tribes assume management of their own affairs. Since  1975, the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act has  authorized tribes to assume the management of programs that had been  administered on their behalf by the two federal agencies that provide  services to tribes\u2014the Department of the Interior\u2019s Bureau of Indian  Affairs (BIA) and Health and Human Service\u2019s Indian Health Service. As a  result, tribes can enter into contracts with these agencies to assume  management of individual services, including law enforcement, education,  social services, and road maintenance. Under self-governance compacts,  tribes can receive lump sum funding to assume many of the services that  were previously provided federally. Proponents of contracting and self- governance expect that the experience, expertise, and control that these  arrangements provide should also help these tribes develop economically.", "To assess the success of these efforts, you asked us to review EDA grants,  as well as contracting and self-governance arrangements. In response, we  analyzed (1) all EDA grants made to Indian tribes from 1993-2002 and  determined what economic development resulted and (2) the relationship  between changes in the economic profile of tribes and the extent to which  they have entered into self-determination contracts or self-governance  compacts to perform their own services under the Indian Self- Determination and Education Assistance Act, as amended. We also  identified other advantages and disadvantages to these arrangements and  other factors that can affect changes in tribes\u2019 economic profiles.", "To determine the results of the EDA grants to tribes, we obtained data on  all EDA grants made to tribes from 1993-2002. Over this period, EDA  provided grants to 125 of the 562 federally recognized tribes and also to 18  tribal or Alaska Native organizations. For our analysis, we classified EDA\u2019s  grants by type of project funded, including projects for   producing income (enterprise projects), such as saw mills;   business development, including training;  improving infrastructure, such as roads; and   conducting economic development planning.", "To determine what economic development resulted from these grants, we  gathered information from all 95 tribes that received EDA grants for  enterprise, infrastructure, and business development projects from 1993 to  2002 by (1) visiting 15 tribes to inspect the projects funded and (2)  conducting a telephone survey of the remaining 80 tribes. If these tribes  also received a planning grant from EDA, we also obtained information  about the results for the planning grant from tribal officials. We analyzed  this information to identify the extent to which the projects these grants  funded were profitable or had led to other economic development. Our  survey results reflect the information provided by and opinions of tribal  officials who participated in our survey. We also interviewed EDA officials  in headquarters and regional offices to discuss application and monitoring  policies and procedures and reviewed Inspector General reports involving  EDA funding to tribes.", "To determine the relationship between the economic profile of tribes and  the extent to which they had self-determination contracts or self- governance compacts, we identified the extent to which tribes in the lower  48 states were contracting using a database that shows the amounts from  federal programs received by tribes that received at least $300,000 in  federal assistance. For purposes of our analysis, we placed tribes into one  of the following three separate groups:   self-governance tribes that receive funds to perform multiple services.   tribes whose total contracting dollars exceeded a calculated threshold  (high-contracting tribes), and   tribes below this amount (low-contracting tribes).", "Using data from the U.S. Census Bureau (Census), we compared the extent  to which various economic variables, such as the per capita income of the  Native Americans living in the tribal area, had changed from 1990 to 2000  for the tribes in these three groups. Because we were not able to include  the extent to which other external factors also affected the tribe\u2019s  economic development, our results cannot be used to definitively  determine whether any changes in tribes\u2019 economic profiles are the result  of the extent to which they engaged in contracting or self governance. Our  contracting analysis also included only 219 tribes located in the lower 48  states for which requisite information for our analysis was available and  excluded Alaska Native entities because comparable contracting and  economic profile data was not available. We performed various steps to  assure ourselves of the reliability of the data that we used in the analyses  for this report and we describe these efforts in appendix I. We determined  that the data was sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "We conducted our work in Washington, D.C.; Philadelphia; and various  locations in California, Alaska, Arizona, New Mexico, and Washington from  July 2003 through September 2004 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards.

According to data from the 2000 U.S. Census,  American Indian tribes\u2019 median per capita income of $9,200 in 1999 was  less than half the $21,600 per capita income for the entire U. S. population.  In addition, the percentage of American Indians with household incomes at  or below the official poverty level averaged 30 percent across tribes\u2014more  than double the 12 percent for the U.S. population as a whole. According  to tribal officials and government agencies, conditions on and around tribal  lands generally make successful economic development more difficult.  These officials indicated that American Indian communities often are  lacking in adequate basic infrastructure, such as water and sewage  systems. These communities also frequently lack sufficient technology  infrastructure, such as telecommunications lines that are commonly found  in other American communities. Without such infrastructure, tribal  communities often find it difficult to compete successfully in the economic  mainstream. A 1999 EDA study that assessed the state of infrastructure in  American Indian communities found that these communities also had other  disadvantages that made successful business development more difficult.  This study found that the high cost and small markets associated with  investment in Native communities continued to deter widespread private  sector involvement. Another factor that creates more difficult business  conditions in some tribal areas has been downturns in regionally significant  industries. For example, tribes in the Northwest and Alaska have been hurt  by the decline in the fishing and timber industries in their areas.", "To help address the needs of Indian tribes, various federal agencies provide  assistance, including economic development. BIA is charged with the  responsibility of implementing federal Indian policy. BIA assists tribes in  various ways, including providing for social services, developing and  maintaining infrastructure, and providing education services. BIA also  attempts to help tribes develop economically by providing resources to  administer tribal revolving loan programs and guaranteed loan programs to  improve access to capital in tribal communities and providing assistance in  obtaining financing from private sources to promote business development  initiatives on or near Indian reservations. In addition to the support  provided by BIA, other agencies with significant programs for tribes  include the Department of Health and Human Services, which provides  funding for the Head Start Program and the Indian Health Service; the  Department of Housing and Urban Development, which provides support  for community development and housing-related projects; and the  Department of Agriculture, which provides support for services pertaining  to food distribution, nutrition programs, and rural economic development.", "The Department of Commerce\u2019s EDA is an agency that provides assistance  to tribes specifically for economic development. EDA\u2019s mission is to create  wealth and minimize poverty in economically distressed rural and urban  communities that experience high unemployment, low income, or other  severe distress. EDA fulfills its mission with grant programs, including six  programs explained in table 1.", "EDA has six regional offices that administer its grant programs across  multistate areas. Each regional office accepts preapplication investment  proposals from prospective grantees, including American Indian tribes and  Alaska Natives. Based on established regulations, EDA regional officials  encourage only those investment proposals that will significantly benefit  areas experiencing or threatened with substantial economic distress to  continue with the application process. Before receiving a grant, an entity  must submit a preapplication proposal to an EDA Economic Development  Representative responsible for that area. After preliminary reviews by  various EDA regional office staff, each preapplication proposal is  considered by the region\u2019s Investment Review Committee, which consists  of the Regional Director, Regional Counsel, and Division Chiefs, to ensure  that entity is eligible to receive funds and that the project is likely to  provide benefits meeting EDA\u2019s criteria. The Investment Review Committee  will then recommend whether the entity should be invited to submit an  application. EDA headquarters reviews the recommendation action for  quality assurance. According to Commerce, after receiving quality control  clearance and depending on the type of grant program, the Regional  Director approves the decision to invite the entity to submit a formal  application. After this application is received and found to be complete, the  grant funds will be awarded. During the 1990s, the goals EDA generally  sought to meet through its grants were to fund projects that would create  jobs and produce income for distressed communities. However, since 2002  EDA has placed more emphasis on projects that create higher-skill, higher- wage jobs and that are market based and likely to attract private sector  investment."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Activities Tribes Perform under the Indian Self- determination and Education Act Are Also Envisioned to Help Economic Development", "paragraphs": ["Activities that tribes are authorized to undertake as a result of the Indian  Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, as amended, could help  them develop economically. This act authorizes Indian tribes to take over  the administration of programs that had been previously administered on  their behalf by the Departments of the Interior or Health and Human  Services. In passing the act, Congress recognized that the government\u2019s  administration of Indian programs prevented tribes from establishing their  own policies and making their own decisions about program services. The  act allowed tribes to contract for a range of Indian programs that are  managed by the Interior Department\u2019s BIA and Health and Human Services\u2019  Indian Health Service on their behalf. According to the act, tribal  contractors must receive funding equivalent to what each of the agencies  would have provided if they had operated the programs. The act, as  amended, also provides that tribal contractors are to receive funding for  the reasonable costs of activities that they must perform to manage a  program\u2019s contract\u2014known as contract support costs. Once having  contracted a program, a tribe assumes responsibility for all aspects of its  management, such as hiring program personnel, conducting program  activities, delivering program services, and establishing and maintaining  administrative and accounting systems. Typical programs that are  contracted by tribes include such BIA programs as law enforcement, social  services, road maintenance, and forestry as well as such Indian Health  Service programs as hospitals and health clinics; dental care; and mental  health services.", "Congress has amended the act several times since 1975. A series of  amendments from 1984 through 1994 streamlined contracting  requirements, provided funds for contract support, and allowed more  participation by tribal governments in federal rulemaking. In 1988, a new  title was added to the 1975 act authorizing the creation of the Self- Governance Demonstration Project that enabled a number of tribes to  receive funding for multiple federal programs in one lump sum under a self- governance agreement. This new title to the act, known as Title III Self- Governance Demonstration Project, enables tribes generally to receive  funding for multiple federal programs in one lump sum under a self- governance compact. Tribes operating under a self-governance compact  have the flexibility to administer funds for multiple programs as they see  fit, rather than abiding by the circumstances of single-program contracts.  The 1988 amendment also added reasonable contract support costs to  comply with the terms of the contract and to support prudent management.  The Tribal Self-Governance Act Amendments of 1994 directed the  Secretary of the Interior to negotiate contracts annually with participating  tribes to enable the tribes to plan, conduct, consolidate, and administer  functions and activities that were administered by the Secretary.

As shown in figure 6, most of the enterprise projects  EDA funded for tribes included industrial enterprises, such as wood  products plants, or commercial projects, such as retail businesses and  shopping centers. Most of the EDA-funded enterprise projects in Alaska  involved community or cultural centers, which provided facilities for  community and tourist activities. Some of the EDA grants also funded  natural resource enterprises involving fish, wildlife, or horticulture  restoration.", "Figure 7 describes an example of one enterprise project that EDA funded.  This grant helped a tribe fund the development of a horticultural enterprise  that grows vegetation to improve fishing areas in local rivers.

According to tribal officials, the reasons for failure  included market changes or downturns, lack of an ongoing source of  funding to keep the enterprise afloat, management problems, and  environmental problems. Four of the 7 failed enterprise projects were  funded between 1993 and 1995. However, in recent years, some tribes  reported that they have been able to keep fledgling enterprises afloat by  subsidizing them with revenues from gaming or other tribal enterprises,  and the failure rate for EDA-funded enterprise projects has decreased.  Since 1996, EDA funded 24 tribal projects that had been completed and, of  these, 14 were either profitable or covering their costs, 3 had failed, and 7  were still being subsidized (see appendix II, figure 30 for more information  on the outcome of projects by year of funding).

As shown in figure 10, tribal officials reported direct  private sector investment in 17 percent of the projects, though in some  cases the tribal share of project funding included funds borrowed by the  tribes from private financial institutions. EDA officials recognize the  difficulty tribes face in attracting private investment on Indian lands and  sometimes make allowances for the amount of matching funds they require  or suggest to tribes that they locate projects outside of reservation land.", "The grants that EDA provided to tribes for enterprise projects also  appeared to create limited numbers of jobs. Tribal officials told us that  many of the EDA-funded enterprise projects had resulted in the creation of  jobs for tribal members, although the number of jobs created generally was  less than 10 per project. As shown in the figure 11, 20 (59 percent) of the  enterprise projects resulted in 10 or fewer jobs.", "Although most projects did not create a large amount of jobs, some  projects that EDA funded were more successful in employing larger  numbers of people.

These included the following  projects:  One Northwest tribe received a $1.6 million EDA grant in 2002 to help  fund the opening of a plywood processing plant that uses wood from the  tribe\u2019s own forests. The total project cost was $10 million, with  additional funds coming from other federal and state grants, the tribe,  and a bank loan.

The first two projects were profitable, but the  third project was not yet turning a profit as of early 2004.", "Although the projects EDA funded had only mixed success in generating  revenue and large numbers of jobs, tribal officials told us that the EDA- funded enterprise projects had produced other benefits. In some cases,  tribal officials said that the projects EDA funded resulted in the creation of  jobs and revenue at other entities. For example, one tribe used a $350,000  EDA grant in 1997 to help fund construction of a fish hatchery. This  enterprise did not make a profit, but 15 jobs were created at the hatchery.  The project had indirect economic benefits to the tribe because it helped to  support the local fishing and tourism industry, which employed 15 to 20  tribal individuals as fishing guides and 8 seasonal jobs at a campground.  The hatchery also generated increased business for local restaurants and  motels and enabled tribal subsistence fishermen to catch fish for their own  consumption. (See app. II, fig. 29, for a list of the completed enterprise  projects for which we obtained information.)", "In light of the mixed success that EDA-funded enterprise projects  experienced, tribes may find obtaining EDA funding in the future more  difficult because of the changes in the agency\u2019s criteria for awarding grants.  Since fiscal year 2002, EDA\u2019s criteria for approving grant applications  requires its staff to seek to fund projects that create jobs requiring greater  skills and paying higher wages. Their criteria also emphasize projects more  likely to attract private sector investment. In meeting these criteria, EDA  officials informed us that tribes have to compete with other entities such as  state and local governments and nonprofit organizations for EDA grants.  As a result, tribes in rural areas, in particular, find it difficult to propose  projects that are likely to attract private sector investment or result in jobs  that pay high wages. For example, EDA officials we spoke to in one EDA  region noted that communities closer to urban areas were more likely to be  able to propose projects, such as industrial parks, that were likely to attract  high technology firms than were the more rurally-located tribes in their  region."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EDA Also Provided Funds for Loan Funds and Other Business Development Activities", "paragraphs": ["From 1993 through 2002, EDA also awarded grants to tribes to be used for  loan funds, business development, and training.

About $2.2 million of the EDA  grants were to support RLFs. These RLFs are pools of money loaned out  for revenue-generating enterprises. The repayment of loan principal and  interest replenish the RLF, creating a revolving source of capital to finance  additional loans and further develop the local economy. Of the $2.2 million  EDA awarded for RLFs between 1993 and 2002, $950,000 was to provide the  initial capital\u2014seed money\u2014to get three new RLFs started and about $1.3  million was used to support business development and training programs  associated with two existing RLFs (see app. II for details).", "Tribal officials reported that these RLFs EDA has supported have  successfully funded both tribal enterprises and small businesses started by  individual tribal members. For example, a tribe in Northern California has  administered one of these RLFs since 1977, when EDA originally provided  initial capital of $1.5 million to finance loans relating to the tribe\u2019s forest  industries. Since 1994, EDA provided $285,000 to fund a business training  program to assist applicants seeking funding from this RLF with instruction  on preparing business plans, contract agreements, credit applications, and  on the use of computers and other office equipment. According to  documents provided by fund officials, over the years, this RLF has made  356 loans to businesses resulting in 658 new jobs and attracted $7.8 million  in private sector investment. Among the projects tribal officials told us  had received funding from this RLF included a shopping center, a motel, a  restaurant, a gas station, and a gravel enterprise. Tribal officials told us that  most of the projects this RLF has funded have provided jobs or other  benefits, although not all are operating profitably. To keep the more  marginal enterprises operating, tribal officials reported using profits from  the tribe\u2019s own successful enterprises to subsidize the financing costs of  the other enterprises. By keeping these enterprises in operation until loans  were paid off, their community benefits from the additional jobs and  services, and the enterprises receive additional time to become sustainable  on their own. According to documents provided by fund officials, the total  amount of loan defaults as a percentage of the total loaned out since  inception for this tribe\u2019s RLF was 5.4 percent, and through repayments of  principal and interest the fund\u2019s capital pool has more than doubled to over  $3.2 million. Although we did not attempt to independently verify the  accuracy of these figures, we visited several of the businesses the tribe  indicated had received funding. For example, the gravel enterprise, in its  first year of production since receiving an $850,000 loan from the RLF to  purchase rock-crushing machinery, was in full production, and enterprise  officials expected to turn a profit within 2 years and hoped to add an  asphalt plant in the future. At the time of our visit, we saw that this facility  was operating actively with considerable truck traffic into and out of the  facility.", "The amount of loan activity by the three newly-funded RLFs has been  limited by start-up challenges and the amount of money in these funds.  According to RLF officials we interviewed, there are many challenges to  establishing a successful RLF, including finding additional funds to match  EDA\u2019s seed money and cover operating costs until sufficient interest  income begins to be received. Other challenges include finding and hiring a  competent, experienced loan manager; training loan applicants in such  areas as drawing up business plans; and establishing relationships and  gaining the confidence of financial institutions to leverage the loans. One of  the RLFs took 3 years from the time its EDA grant was approved until its  first loan was made. At the time of our survey, the three RLFs that EDA had  funded since 1998 reported each had made between 7 and 14 loans.  Because new loans cannot be made until older loans are repaid,  considerable time is required for RLFs to grow and become more active.", "Figure 12 shows an example of a resort cabin business that was funded by a  loan from an EDA-supported RLF. EDA also funded a grant that was used  for the design of the project. The tribe operating the project reported that  the project is generating enough revenue to cover its costs despite a short  tourist season, but they hoped that an expansion of the project could make  it profitable.", "In addition to grants to support RLFs, EDA also provided tribes with  funding for training or business development, but according to tribal  officials, the success of these programs has been hampered by lack of  operating funds. Between 1993 and 2002, EDA provided Indian tribes with  $2.1 million in grants to start 6 training programs. The largest of these was a  $1.2 million grant in 2000 to renovate a building for a vocational training  center in Alaska that, according to local officials, has trained 830 students.  A California tribe that, according to a tribal official, lost 150 jobs due to  timber industry closures, used a $66,000 grant in 1998 to establish a training  program that has resulted in 2 entrepreneur classes, 100 individual  business counseling sessions, and 5 start-up businesses. All 6 of these  programs sought operating funds from other sources, such as state and  federal agencies. However, 4 of the 6 programs reported difficulties getting  on-going operating funds\u2014two closed down due to lack of funds, one  transferred its facilities to a university program, and the fourth reported  that its program was in jeopardy.", "In addition to training programs, EDA also provided about $500,000 to six  other Indian tribes and organizations for business development activities  between 1993 and 2002. In most cases the grants were for one-time training  workshops or conferences on business development related topics. In two  cases, the grants were used to recruit several businesses for  business/industrial parks. One tribe, which received a $75,000 grant in 2000,  reported finding one current and two future tenants for their park and used  part of the grant to conduct a seminar on how tribal businesses can apply  for government contracts under the Small Business Administration\u2019s 8(a)  minority contracting program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EDA Infrastructure Grants Reported to Have Facilitated Development", "paragraphs": ["About 20 percent of the funding that EDA provided to Indian tribes  between 1993-2002 was for projects to improve infrastructure for tribal  lands.

A 1999 EDA study cited lack of funding  as the overwhelming reason why tribes were not making the infrastructure  investments needed to facilitate economic development. The tribal  officials we spoke with said that obtaining sufficient funding for  infrastructure development was particularly difficult because such projects  do not always offer an immediate return on the investment. However, in  some cases tribes with revenues from gaming and other tribal enterprises  were able to use these sources in addition to funding from EDA and other  federal grants to finance improvements to their infrastructure.", "Our analysis indicated that EDA provided $22.1 million in grants to 23  tribes for 26 infrastructure projects between 1993 and 2002.

Nineteen of the 25 projects had  been completed and, according to tribal officials, all have led to economic  development for their tribes. For example, one tribe received a $1.1 million  EDA grant in 1995 to upgrade and extend their water and sewer systems,  which enabled the development of a resort, hotel, and casino complex with  more than $25 million in annual revenues. Tribal officials reported that the  complex has created more than 550 jobs, which helped reduce the tribal  unemployment rate from 37 percent to 11 percent.

To examine further the  relationship between level of contracting and economic indicators, we  compared the total federal contracts and grants received by each tribe with  the total income of Native Americans living in the tribal area. For this  analysis, we identified the total average amount of federal grants and  contracts the tribes in our analysis received annually in 1998, 1999, and  2000 from all federal agencies using the Single Audit Act database. We then  found the total income of the tribe by multiplying the per capita income of  the tribe by the total number of Native Americans living in the tribal area.

We then classified each tribe in  our analysis into four categories based on the level of this ratio.", "By analyzing the results of these ratios across the 199 tribes in the lower 48  states for which data were available, we found that the tribes with a very  high grants-to-income ratio experienced the least amount of improvement  in their income growth on average (see app. III, table 9, for details).

Officials at eight of the tribes we  spoke with indicated their contracting activities provided them other  benefits beyond improvement in their economic profile. Some tribal  representatives and Indian Health Service officials told us that the  experience of running a program helps develop specific skills, which can  be carried over to other aspects of tribal activities. For example, an official  at one tribe said that, as a result of operating their own services through  contracting, their members have developed skills to produce accurate  financial statements, helping them prove fiscal responsibility and attract  additional grants. In addition, a 1991 academic report we reviewed on tribal  activities found that tribes that entered into contracts to manage their own  their forestry activities generally resulted in increased production and  revenue than had been generated when such activities were under BIA  management. One academic who studies Indian issues told us that  contracting also allows tribes to gain experience in leadership,  management, accountability, and organization. He said that the resulting  enhanced leadership and management skills help tribes to receive audits  with unqualified opinions, which can allow these tribes to attract additional  sources of funding.", "The advantages tribes gain from contracting can vary by the type of  arrangement undertaken. Under self-governance arrangements, tribes have  greater control and flexibility in the use of their funds and less reporting  requirements. This flexibility allows tribes to design programs that are  tailored to their needs and set their own priorities. For example, an official  at one tribe that switched from multiple contracts to a self-governance  arrangement said they received greater funding as a result to use as they  saw best given their priorities. According to this official, the tribe was able  to substantially increase their higher education program to provide more  assistance to tribal members who wanted to go to college and also increase  their funding for natural resource services. In regard to regular contracting  arrangements, one tribe told us that the skill sets learned through this  process are a stepping stone to undertaking self-governance, which is the  next phase of self-determination.", "However, a primary disadvantage to contracting with federal agencies was  the shortfalls in contract funding. Several tribal officials told us that the  amount of direct program funding they receive when they contract to  administer their own programs is not sufficient to provide the adequate  level of service to tribal members. In addition, several tribal officials told us  that their contract programs do not receive full funding to cover the  indirect, support, or start-up costs that tribes incur as part of managing  these contracts. These contract support cost shortfalls arise when funding  appropriations for these contracts is less than that required by tribes to pay  for such costs. As shown in figure 20, BIA and the Indian Health Service  estimate that total administrative funding shortfalls arising from the  contracts these agencies funded during fiscal years 1993 through 2002  ranged from a low of about $25 million to as much as $130 million annually.", "The funding shortfalls associated with contracting arrangements can  hamper tribes\u2019 ability to develop economically. Our 1999 report on the  shortfalls in Indian contract support costs found that tribes have had to  cover the shortfalls with tribal resources, thereby foregoing the  opportunity to use those resources to promote economic development. In  addition, these shortfalls divert money away from other important tribal  activities. For example, tribes may not receive enough money to enhance  the management of their programs by establishing educational systems for  leaders, instituting constitutional reform, and developing strategies for  economic development. Several tribes mentioned that they have had to  take steps to subsidize contract programs, which includes using tribal  funds earmarked for economic development, returning the management of  the program to the federal government, and undertaking supplemental  programs of their own to fill in the unmet service gaps.

According to  the tribal and federal officials we interviewed and the various studies of  Indian economic development issues that we reviewed, the location of a  tribe\u2019s reservations or lands can greatly affect its economic development  success. For example, tribal officials whose reservation was located near  an urban area told us that this gives them greater access to existing  infrastructure, including water and power. In addition, the close proximity  of the urban population provides them with a greater potential market for  their tribal enterprises. Another tribe whose lands were located near an  urban area and a heavily traveled highway has benefited from the already  established water sewer systems and power lines for development  projects. Because of its highly visible location, this particular tribe has  successfully developed a hotel, arts and cultural center, golf course,  grocery store, and gaming facility.", "Tribes located in more remote, rural areas lack such advantages. Tribal  officials told us they may have to first develop infrastructure before they  can then invest in development projects. According to tribal officials, this  can be complicated by the need to conduct more extensive environmental  or archeological surveys before land can be developed. For example,  officials for one tribe in an isolated area told us that they had to complete  land and environmental surveys and have water sewer systems, electric  power, and roads built as a prerequisite to development. In addition, Native  officials we talked to in Alaska also noted how the isolation of their villages  greatly complicates their development efforts.", "Another factor related to location that can assist a tribe economically is  whether or not their tribal lands can be developed for tourism. For  example, some tribes in the Pacific Northwest were able to build  campgrounds and marinas that attracted visitors interested in recreation. A  tribe we visited in the Southwest had scenic natural rock formations that  attracted visitors to their tribal lands. However, one village in Alaska that  would like to build a visitor center to attract tourists is located in an area  that is difficult to reach and faces less certain prospects for developing  such an industry.", "Another factor that can provide tribes with an advantage in economic  development is whether or not they have access or ownership to  exploitable natural resources. We found tribes with access to timber or  fisheries often were able to develop these as significant sources of income  for their tribal members. For example, one of the tribes we talked to with  forest lands on their reservation had opened a successful plant producing  plywood and dry veneer, which created jobs for tribal members. In  contrast, some tribes are located in remote desolate areas with little  vegetation or natural resources they can exploit.", "Another factor that can affect tribal economic success is having sound legal  systems and commercial regulations. Because Indian tribes are considered  sovereign nations within the United States, they must develop their own  judicial system and laws for governing operations and business conduct  within their tribal lands. Having an effective judicial system is frequently  seen as a prerequisite for attracting private investments on tribal lands.  This provides investors with confidence that disputes will be resolved  fairly. For example, one expert study examined 67 tribes and found that a  strong independent judicial system reduces unemployment by 5 percent.  Another study states that tribal success can also be facilitated by sound  uniform commercial codes. According to tribal officials, an additional  challenge is having sufficient numbers of tribal members with the relevant  law and graduate degrees to help develop and administer these codes.", "According to tribal officials and studies, another factor cited as important  for economic development was stable and effective tribal government. For  example, some tribal officials we spoke with cited the high turnover among  the members of their governing councils often resulted in abrupt shifts in  economic priorities that sometimes delayed their ability to seek funding or  implement previously planned projects. According to EDA officials, some  tribes\u2019 governing councils are completely replaced very frequently, and this  greatly reduces their effectiveness in achieving economic progress.  According to tribal officials, one effective method was to stagger tribal  council members\u2019 terms over time, which increases the continuity of the  tribal government and its policies.", "Tribes\u2019 ability to develop gaming facilities can also be a significant factor  that can affect their economic development. Tribes that own gaming  facilities near concentrated population centers have been able to use  gaming revenues to develop other projects that have aided their tribes and  produced income. For example, one particular tribe used its gaming  revenues to develop a water sewer system for development projects and  helped it withstand reduced federal and state funding for its activities.  Another tribe told us gaming revenue is used for supplementing education  and health programs. As shown in figure 21, tribes with greater amounts of  revenue from gaming generally experienced greater growth in their total  populations, employment rates, per capita income, and in the percentage  with incomes above the poverty level."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Observations", "paragraphs": ["Efforts to improve the financial well-being of American Indians and Alaska  Natives face many challenges. These challenges can include the isolated  and rural locations of tribal lands and lack of infrastructure, which can  limit their attractiveness to private sector investment.

Although EDA has provided limited  funding to assist some tribes, we found that these grants had resulted in  mixed success in helping develop the economies and improve the quality of  life for these groups. In cases in which EDA grants were more successful in  producing economic development, the tribes sometimes had advantages,  such as resources or proximity to areas with populations likely to take  advantage of gaming or other development. In other cases, EDA provided  funding to tribes without such advantages and at least produced some jobs  for tribal members.", "Overall, we found that the relationship of Indian economic development to  EDA grants was mixed, and these findings could help inform decisions  about how and where to focus future efforts.

Regarding business development activities, our review of the grants that  funded RLFs indicated that some were reportedly very successful, and  others had yet to produce much development. Similarly, the training  projects had produced some benefits but were also hampered by lack of  operating funding. Although our report presents information from tribal  officials that indicates that many infrastructure grants have reportedly  produced economic development, we found that not all projects had yet  done so. In addition, although the tribes receiving EDA planning grants  reported them to be critical to their success, the benefits we reported as  resulting from these planning grants were that most tribes that received  them also received other EDA grants, including for enterprise projects  whose mixed success we discussed, or funding from other federal agencies  for economic development purposes.

For example, EDA was  sometimes providing grants to fund the planning of a project or the  construction of the project using its economic adjustment grant program or  its public works grant program. Therefore, for the purposes of our analysis,  we grouped the various grants into the following categories according to  type of project or activity funded:   Enterprise projects: grants used to develop projects designed to  generate income for the tribe, such as a cannery, a resort, or a sawmill;   Infrastructure projects: grants used for the design and construction of  public works infrastructure, such as roads, highways, and sewers, that  would serve as the foundation for general economic development  activities;   Business development projects: grants used to fund loan funds, training,  and other business development projects, including those for business  incubators, revolving loan funds (RLFs), training and capacity building,  and other assistance that enhances the tribes\u2019 economic development  activities; and   Planning/feasibility grants: grants used for general planning purposes  such as paying for staff salaries or the broad administration of the tribes\u2019  planning departments, as well as for developing plans, analyses of  projects\u2019 environmental impact, and feasibility studies for specific  economic development projects.", "Our analysis of EDA grants was limited to grants provided to Indian tribes.

First, we used BIA data to  identify those tribes that had entered into self-governance compacts. We  then grouped non-self-governance tribes into two groups based on the  extent to which they were contracting with BIA. We grouped tribes into  these two groups based on the extent to which they were contracting on  both a per capita basis and on a total dollar amount basis. To derive the per  capita BIA grants and contracts amount, we obtained data from the Single  Audit Act database on the amount of grants and contracts that were  received by tribes from BIA during the years 1998 to 2000. For those tribes  that did not have available Single Audit Act information, we calculated this  per capita measure based on BIA\u2019s 1998 shortfall budget data.", "An examination of the listing of tribes ranked by their per capita contract  amount, tribes above a threshold of $580 appeared to include those large  tribes with the largest overall contract amounts. We found that some  smaller tribes had per capita contracting amounts that exceeded $580 but  whose total contract amount was not significant compared with other  tribes. Therefore, we only placed tribes into the high-contracting group  whose totals in total contract funding exceeded $300,000, which appeared  to be a reasonable level to indicate significant contracting activity.

For example, tribes in the Pacific  Northwest, which had a combined per capita EDA grant amount of $593,  had the highest per capita, while tribes in Oklahoma and Utah had the  lowest, with per capita EDA grant amounts of $2 and $4. Although some  states received large dollar amounts of funding, the amounts were not  always large given the large Indian populations in their states.

According to EDA staff, this has reduced their ability to monitor funded  projects and provide technical assistance to grant recipients. Also, one  regional official told us cutbacks in travel funds have required some  economic development representatives to forego visiting some projects  and to rely instead on reviewing reports submitted by the private sector  construction engineers. For example, staff in one of the EDA regional  offices told us that one of their field staff is responsible for two very large  states with its grants located in such remote locations that site visits are  seldom made because of the limited travel funds.", "The staffing and travel fund reductions have also reduced the amount of  technical assistance that EDA provided to tribes. According to regional  EDA officials, their economic development representatives frequently  provide one-on-one consultations with grantees either by telephone or  during site visits. These consultations give tribe officials the opportunity to  address concerns or issues with the grant application, construction, or  infrastructure projects.
