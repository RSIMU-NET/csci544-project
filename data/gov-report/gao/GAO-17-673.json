Prior to the establishment of the Department of Energy's (DOE) Supply Project in fiscal year 2011 to produce new plutonium-238 (Pu-238), NASA officials said that Pu-238 supply was a limiting factor in selecting RPS-powered missions. After the initiation of the Supply Project, however, NASA officials GAO interviewed said that missions are selected independently of decisions on how to power them. Once a mission is selected, NASA considers power sources early in its mission review process. Multiple factors could affect NASA's demand for RPS and Pu-238. For example, high costs associated with RPS and missions can affect the demand for RPS because, according to officials, NASA's budget can only support one RPS mission about every 4 years. Expected technological advances in RPS efficiency could reduce NASA's demand for RPS and Pu-238.", "DOE has made progress in reestablishing Pu-238 production to meet NASA's future demand to fuel RPS and has identified challenges to meeting its production goals. Specifically, since the start of the Supply Project, DOE has produced 100 grams of Pu-238 and expects to finalize production processes and produce interim quantities by 2019. However, DOE has also identified several challenges to meeting the Supply Project goal of producing 1.5 kilograms (kg) of new Pu-238 per year by 2026. DOE officials GAO interviewed said that DOE has not perfected the chemical processing required to extract new Pu-238 from irradiated targets to meet production goals. These officials also said that achieving the Pu-238 production goal is contingent on the use of two reactors, but only one reactor is currently qualified for Pu-238 production while the second reactor awaits scheduled maintenance. Moreover, while DOE has adopted a new approach for managing the Supply Project and RPS production\u2014based on a constant production approach\u2014the agency has not developed an implementation plan that identifies milestones and interim steps that can be used to demonstrate progress in meeting production goals and addressing previously identified challenges. GAO's prior work shows that plans that include milestones and interim steps help an agency to set priorities, use resources efficiently, and monitor progress in achieving agency goals. By developing a plan with milestones and interim steps for DOE's approach to managing Pu-238 and RPS production, DOE can show progress in implementing its approach and make adjustments when necessary. Lastly, DOE's new approach to managing the Supply Project does not improve its ability to assess the potential long-term effects of challenges DOE identified, such as chemical processing and reactor availability, or to communicate these effects to NASA. For example, DOE officials did not explain how the new approach would help assess the long-term effects of challenges, such as those related to chemical processing. Under Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government , agencies should use quality information to achieve objectives and to communicate externally, so that external parties can help achieve agency objectives. Without the ability to assess the long-term effects of known challenges and communicate those effects to NASA, DOE may be jeopardizing NASA's ability to use RPS as a power source for future missions."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making three recommendations, including that DOE develop a plan with milestones and interim steps for its Pu-238 and RPS production approach, and that DOE assess the long-term effects of known production challenges and communicate these effects to NASA.

Historically, Pu-238 was produced  domestically or was purchased from Russia. Domestic Pu-238 production  ended in 1988, and DOE has not purchased material from Russia since  2009. As a result, supplies of available Pu-238 to support new missions  have diminished.

NASA officials we  interviewed said that they are currently in the development phase for one  Flagship mission\u2014Mars 2020\u2014and the formulation phase for a second  Flagship mission\u2014Europa Clipper. NASA officials said that regardless of  the availability of RPS, NASA cannot support additional Flagship missions  until after the expected launch of Mars 2020 in July 2020, given their  expense relative to NASA\u2019s overall budget. Mars 2020 has an estimated  total cost of $2.44 billion and will use one RPS.", "According to NASA officials we interviewed, New Frontiers missions,  which are selected through a competitive process, may be good  candidates to use RPS given the types of instruments needed to address  the scientific questions these missions seek to answer. However, New  Frontiers missions have a development cost cap of $850 million, which  could restrict the use of RPS. A single RPS would represent about 9  percent of the development cost of a New Frontiers mission. NASA  documents indicate that the principal investigator chosen to develop a  New Frontiers mission is responsible for fitting the cost of the RPS into  the mission\u2019s budget. In December 2016, NASA issued an announcement  of opportunity for the New Frontiers #4 mission, offering up to three  RPS.", "RPS have not been used for previously completed Discovery-class  missions because these missions had smaller budgets\u2014about $450  million\u2014and shorter mission planning cycles\u2014no more than 36 months\u2014 according to the National Academy of Sciences\u2019 most recent decadal  survey report and NASA officials we interviewed. According to NASA  officials, Discovery-class missions are small, relatively quick missions that  typically rely on solar panels and not RPS as a power source. The cost of  RPS would represent a large portion of a Discovery mission budget,  according to NASA officials. A single RPS, at a cost of $77 million dollars,  would represent more than 17 percent of a Discovery mission\u2019s $450  million development cap. Furthermore, the amount of time DOE takes to  build an RPS generally exceeds Discovery-class mission development  time frames of no more than 36 months and so it is unlikely that  Discovery-class missions can use RPS unless limitations from cost and  schedule can be reduced."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOE\u2019s RPS Production Capability Can Limit RPS Use", "paragraphs": ["In addition to budget factors, DOE\u2019s RPS production capability can limit  NASA\u2019s ability to use RPS to power missions.

According to both DOE and NASA  officials we interviewed, DOE only has the capacity to produce three to  four RPS at a time, given the current floor space dedicated to RPS  development at INL and limits on staff exposure to radiation at LANL.  NASA officials said that they would need to provide additional resources  to scale up RPS production beyond its current levels. To accommodate  DOE\u2019s current RPS production capability, NASA officials said they will not  select two consecutive missions requiring RPS. For example, if NASA  officials know that a Flagship mission will require RPS, they will not offer  RPS for a competed mission that will launch around the same time.

Furthermore, the National Academy of  Sciences\u2019 most recent decadal survey report advocates for RPS  technology developments, stating that it is imperative that NASA invest in  technology for likely future missions, with the goals of reducing costs and  improving scientific capability and reliability.", "According to a report to Congress, in 2010, NASA anticipated using a  dynamic RPS design, such as the Advanced Stirling Radioisotope  Generator (ASRG), for future missions. This design, according to NASA  documentation, would have provided a more efficient power system than  the MMRTG RPS design currently in use. DOE\u2019s initial Pu-238  production goal of up to 5 kg per year from 2001 was reduced to 1.5 kg  based on the assumption that a dynamic system like the ASRG would be  available. The ASRG was projected to be more than four times as  efficient as the MMRTG and would have required just one-fourth as much  Pu-238. However, according to NASA officials, in 2013, the agency  ceased ASRG development due to the cost to complete the project under  reduced PSD funding (see table 1 for NASA\u2019s prior funding of RPS  production activities, including ASRG). Although the 1.5 kg-per-year Pu- 238 production goal was based on the improved efficiencies of the ASRG  and a reduction in the amount of Pu-238 needed for missions, NASA  officials said that the projected production from the Supply Project will  nonetheless meet their demands using the MMRTG, based on PSD\u2019s  current mission frequency. Furthermore, NASA\u2019s fiscal year 2018 budget  estimate indicated that NASA will again invest in dynamic power  conversion systems. Specifically, NASA\u2019s Glenn Research Center  officials said that current work to advance RPS technology would reduce  the amount of Pu-238 needed. Officials told us that they plan to invest $8  million in dynamic RPS technology beginning in fiscal year 2018 and  increase funding to $10 million by fiscal year 2022.", "In addition to dynamic RPS design, NASA\u2019s Glenn Research Center  officials said that they are researching advancements in thermoelectric  technologies that could also increase RPS efficiency. According to these  officials, NASA is currently funding this effort in fiscal year 2017 at $8  million and plans to increase funding to $9 million per year by fiscal year  2022. NASA officials said that new thermoelectric materials can lead to  improved power conversion efficiency and reduce the degradation of  thermoelectric couples over time. Specifically, NASA officials said NASA  plans to update the current MMRTG design using a new thermoelectric  couple material called skutterudite. NASA officials said that this enhanced  MMRTG (eMMRTG) would have a 25 percent beginning-of-life efficiency  improvement and a 50 percent increase of end-of-life power output. The  power output for the MMRTG is about 120 watts, while the eMMRTG is  expected to produce from 120 to 160 watts. According to NASA officials,  for a mission requiring 300 watts of power, only two eMMRTGs would be  needed instead of three MMRTGs. According to NASA officials, using one  less RPS unit would save about 3.5 kg of Pu-238 isotope and reduce the  mission\u2019s overall mass by 45 kg. A NASA official said that the  thermoelectric couple technology for the eMMRTG is currently assessed  to be at a technical readiness level 3 and will be assessed for technical  readiness level 4 by the end of 2017. NASA will determine at a later  date if the technology is sufficiently advanced to use the new eMMRTG  for the New Frontiers #4 mission.", "In addition, NASA officials we interviewed said that they are investigating  the next generation of RPS beyond the MMRTG and eMMRTG designs.  For example, these officials said that they are reviewing a modular RPS  device. A modular RPS would provide a smaller power output, but the  modular units could be bundled together to provide a specific power  output that meets mission requirements. This would allow NASA to use  smaller power increments for missions, thus requiring less Pu-238 to  provide that power. More specifically, NASA officials said that this type of  power system could have a reduced mass and use a more precise  amount of Pu-238 than is required for a mission, depending on the  mission\u2019s power needs. According to NASA officials, the next generation  RPS would ideally achieve up to 600 watts if using two next-generation systems for New Frontiers missions and about 300 watts for Discovery-  class missions. Although NASA officials said that they anticipate the  Supply Project\u2019s Pu-238 production rate goals to be sufficient to meet  their mission demands using the existing MMRTG, if advances in  conversion efficiency of future RPS designs come to fruition, NASA\u2019s  future demand for Pu-238 may decrease. Table 2 compares the current  MMRTG with other potential RPS technologies.", "According to NASA officials, advances in solar technology could increase  the distance from the sun at which missions can operate, making it  possible for missions that would otherwise require RPS to be powered,  instead, by solar panels. NASA officials said they are working with  contractors to focus on overcoming two of the main challenges with using  solar panels that are specific to deep space missions\u2014low-intensity, low- temperature conditions and high-radiation environments. These officials  said that there have been advances in solar technology regarding how  much energy can be captured and converted into electricity, and these  advances could help address low levels of light intensity. NASA officials  said that because low temperatures can degrade some solar cells, the  agency is pursuing solar cells that are better suited for cold environments.  NASA officials said that advances in solar power technology have  realistically expanded the ability to use solar power for missions for which  it would not have been considered before. For example, these officials  noted that NASA\u2019s current Juno mission and its planned Europa Clipper  mission\u2014both with destinations being at Jupiter and its moons and which  would typically have used RPS\u2014have demonstrated that solar power is a  viable power option."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NASA Does Not Anticipate RPS and Pu-238 Demand from Other Users", "paragraphs": ["NASA does not anticipate other potential users to affect demand for RPS  or Pu-238.

As we  stated in an August 2016 report, the National Nuclear Security  Administration\u2014a semiautonomous agency within DOE that is  responsible for the management and security of the nation\u2019s nuclear  weapons, nuclear nonproliferation, and naval reactor programs\u2014through  its plutonium strategy is focused primarily on the fabrication of plutonium  pits for nuclear weapons and has not coordinated with the Pu-238  program about potential modifications planned for PF-4. A May 2015  Congressional Research Service report suggested that moving Pu-238  operations outside of the current LANL PF-4 facility could free up floor  space for pit production operations, and also reduce the amount of  nuclear material at risk in the facility due to the very high radioactivity of  Pu-238. However, LANL officials told us that such a move would be  unlikely because of cleanup costs and difficulties in transporting  contaminated equipment. In addition, DOE\u2019s Office of Nuclear Energy  officials said that they do not anticipate pit production to impact RPS  production. However, LANL officials told us that they have begun  preliminary discussions on this issue but are awaiting the results of a  National Nuclear Security Administration plutonium strategy study that is  focused on nuclear weapons needs. DOE officials added that they have  discussed moving Pu-238 capabilities out of PF-4, where they would seek  to move the capability to another DOE site. According to DOE officials, a  move of this nature would likely be an expensive, disruptive, and time- consuming effort."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Challenges May Put RPS and Pu-238 Production Goals at Risk", "paragraphs": ["The challenges noted above\u2014chemical processing, availability of reactor  positions, target design and qualification, and prioritizing Pu-238 at PF- 4\u2014may put DOE\u2019s RPS and Pu-238 production goals at risk, in part  because of the short-term and incremental segmented management  approach DOE has used to manage the Supply Project through early  2017. In this approach, DOE established short-term segments of Supply  Project work to be connected to time frames over which DOE could more  reliably predict funding from NASA. While DOE officials have known the  general tasks required to achieve full production goals for the Supply  Project, they have been relying on the developments of each segment to  inform specific tasks and activities of subsequent segments. For example,  up until March 2017, when DOE changed its management approach for  the Supply Project, if challenges, such as delays in scaling up chemical  processing, were to be realized, DOE officials said that they would have  shifted Supply Project activities from one segment to the next. DOE\u2019s own  work, however, demonstrates the risks in this approach. For example, an  October 2016 DOE independent cost estimate for another DOE program  showed that deferring activities to later stages in that program may result  in program delays or, if delays are undesirable, future activities may be  compressed and would likely be less technically mature. Delays in the  Supply Project, or the use of less technically mature processes, could put  DOE\u2019s ability to meet NASA\u2019s Pu-238 demands at risk. DOE officials said  in June 2017 that the Supply Project\u2019s early completion of full Pu-238  production was initially planned for 2023. However, DOE officials said  they now expect to reach full production no earlier than 2025 with a late  completion date remaining in 2026.", "DOE officials, acknowledging that some long-term challenges to the  Supply Project exist, said that they recognized that the segmented  management approach was not well suited to dealing with those  challenges. As previously noted, in March 2017, DOE officials said that  the change to a constant GPHS production rate approach was expected  to help provide funding flexibility and stabilize RPS production staffing  levels between NASA missions. In June 2017, DOE officials said that the  constant GPHS production rate approach would also address other  identified challenges associated with RPS production and the Supply  Project and decided to discontinue the segmented management  approach. According to DOE officials, the constant GPHS production rate  approach is designed to ensure stable and predictable funding levels and  allow DOE more flexibility in how these funds are to be used. This  approach, according to DOE officials, will allow the agency to address  high-priority challenges by providing flexibility to use NASA funding  throughout the RPS supply chain, including for the Supply Project, and  will better enable them to sequence work. For example, DOE officials  described how a constant GPHS production rate approach allowed DOE  to prioritize funding for shipping containers to transport Pu-238 between  laboratories. DOE officials did not describe, however, how this new  approach would help address some of the other longer-term challenges  identified, such as scaling up and perfecting chemical processing.  Furthermore, DOE officials provided basic details about the new  approach as well as a memorandum dated March 7, 2017, with  deliverables that DOE states that the new approach will achieve.", "However, DOE does not yet have an implementation plan under the new  constant GPHS production rate approach with milestones and interim  steps for the Supply Project or for RPS production that can be used to  show progress toward implementing efforts, show how risk is being  addressed or mitigated, or make adjustments to those efforts when  necessary. Our body of work has shown that without defined tasks and  milestones, it is difficult for an agency to set priorities, use resources  efficiently, measure progress, and provide management a means to  monitor this progress. By developing an implementation plan with  milestones and interim steps for the department\u2019s management approach  for Pu-238 and RPS production, DOE can show progress toward  implementation, show how risk is being addressed or mitigated, or make  adjustments to its efforts when necessary.", "In addition, DOE\u2019s new approach still does not improve the agency\u2019s  ability to assess the long-term effects of the challenges associated with  Pu-238 and RPS production, such as chemical processing, availability of  reactor positions, target design and qualification, and prioritizing Pu-238  at PF-4. DOE\u2019s previous segmented management approach did not  require that DOE officials assess the potential long-term effects of these  challenges, and it allowed them to defer addressing challenges to later  segments of the Supply Project. The new approach also does not allow  for DOE to adequately communicate long-term challenges to NASA, and  it is unclear how DOE will use this approach to communicate these  challenges. According to DOE officials we interviewed, DOE and NASA  are to develop reports and hold management meetings to communicate  identified challenges. In addition, Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government states that agency management should use quality  information to achieve the entity\u2019s objectives and communicate quality  information externally through reporting lines so that external parties can  help the entity achieve its objectives and address related risks. DOE  officials said they believe the new constant GPHS production rate  approach will aid DOE in identifying and addressing challenges  associated with RPS production and the Supply Project, as well as  communicating such challenges to NASA. DOE officials we interviewed,  however, provided few details on how they would address identified  challenges. Without adequately assessing the long-term effects of  existing challenges identified by DOE officials, DOE cannot develop the  quality information it needs to understand the effects of these challenges,  and this may affect its ability to achieve its Pu-238 production goal or to  communicate that information to NASA.", "Moreover, because DOE does not maintain a comprehensive risk tracking  system for RPS production and, instead, defers to its individual  laboratories to track and manage their specific risks, DOE officials may  not have the necessary information needed to inform NASA about the  effects of these challenges. These potential effects may result in DOE not  meeting its Pu-238 production goal, which could cause NASA to delay  future RPS-powered missions. DOE officials said that they do not  maintain a risk tracking system for the RPS program and that this is  maintained by NASA. However, according to NASA officials we  interviewed, NASA only tracks high-level risks that could directly affect  NASA. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states  that agency management should identify, analyze, and respond to risks  related to achieving defined objectives. Management is to identify risk  throughout the agency to provide a basis for analyzing risks. With a more  comprehensive risk tracking system that allows DOE to identify more  systemic risks beyond the specific technical risks identified by individual  laboratories, DOE will be better positioned to adequately assess the long- term effects of all of the identified challenges associated with Pu-238 and  RPS production objectives."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["NASA is entirely dependent on DOE to supply Pu-238 and RPS for space  missions, and future missions requiring RPS are at risk if DOE is unable  to fuel and provide these RPS. To meet NASA\u2019s demand for new Pu-238,  DOE\u2019s Supply Project goal of 1.5 kg per year was initially established  assuming the use of a more efficient RPS design, which has yet to be  realized. While NASA officials subsequently said that the full production  rate under DOE\u2019s Supply Project would be sufficient using existing RPS  designs, any Pu-238 production shortage, coupled with the use of less  efficient RPS technology, could present a challenge to carrying out  NASA\u2019s future RPS-powered missions. In addition, if any of NASA\u2019s Pu- 238 supply is needed for national security or other applications, NASA  may not have sufficient Pu-238 to support future missions or will have to  delay such missions until more Pu-238 is provided under the Supply  Project. Finally, if NASA intends to launch an additional RPS-powered  mission before the end of the 2020s, NASA officials would have to make  such a decision by 2023, before full-scale Pu-238 production under the  Supply Project is achieved, because it takes multiple years between the  time a mission and its power source are selected to the time of launch.", "DOE has taken steps to reestablish domestic production of Pu-238 under  its Supply Project, and has produced small quantities of new Pu-238. In  addition, DOE has identified key challenges to the Supply Project\u2014such  as scaling up chemical processing and qualifying targets\u2014that put  achieving Supply Project production goals at risk. However, DOE has not  fully assessed the potential long-term effects of these challenges on  production goals. While DOE officials anticipate that their new approach  to managing RPS and Pu-238 production will better help address these  challenges, DOE is in the very early stages of implementing this approach  and has not identified details, including milestones and interim steps, for  how it would address them. In addition, DOE\u2019s plans for nuclear weapons  pit production activities have not taken into account their potential effects  on RPS production and the Supply Project. Federal standards for internal  control state that agency management should use and communicate  quality information externally to help the entity achieve its objectives and  address related risks. While DOE and its laboratories have identified  existing challenges to RPS and Pu-238 production, the effect of these  challenges on expected Pu-238 production goals have not been fully  assessed and thus not fully communicated with NASA. Moreover, DOE\u2019s  risk tracking system for RPS does not track systemic risks, but rather  relies on individual laboratories to track and manage specific risks. Better  information about risks would allow DOE officials to inform NASA about  the effects of these challenges.
