SBA's last major reorganization was in 2004, when it moved loan processing from district offices to specialized centers and assigned district offices new duties, such as small business counseling. But the agency has continued to face long-standing organizational and workforce challenges, including complex overlapping responsibilities among headquarters and regional offices and skill gaps in district offices (which are supervised by regional offices). These challenges can affect SBA's ability to deliver its programs consistently and effectively, especially in a climate of resource constraints. SBA's response has been limited to (1) making incremental changes to some of its divisions such as consolidating functions or changing reporting relationships and (2) offering employees early retirement. SBA committed to assessing and revising its organizational structure in 2012 but has not yet documented this effort. Although a contractor studied SBA's organizational structure in March 2015 and SBA stated it had completed its assessment of the contractor's work as of August 2015, it has not provided documentation of this assessment.

Compensation and benefits\u2014totaling $4.5 million in fiscal 2013\u2014were the largest costs of regional offices, which together had other administrative costs totaling about $235,000 and were co-located with district offices. Because these costs constituted less than 1 percent of SBA's approximately $1 billion appropriation in 2013, closing the regional offices would have a limited budgetary effect. But over half of the SBA managers GAO interviewed (18 of 32) said that closing regional offices could pose operational challenges. First, headquarters, regional, and district managers said that eliminating the 10 regional administrators would require one headquarters office to supervise 68 district directors. Second, regional and district officials were concerned that SBA would lose the overall regional perspective and ability to balance workloads within regions. Third, headquarters, regional, and district managers explained that the agency would be challenged to promote SBA's message without regional offices. They emphasized the role that regional administrators play in explaining and amplifying the President's and SBA Administrator's messages and priorities. However, a few (6 of 28) nonmanagement staff GAO interviewed disputed the importance of regional administrators, some stating that district offices could coordinate directly with headquarters offices. GAO recognizes that regional administrators and offices provide a number of services for SBA. If closures were to occur, there are options available to address these challenges.

In response to  budget reductions, SBA streamlined its field structure during the 1990s by  downsizing regional and district offices and shifting supervisory  responsibilities to headquarters. The 10 regional offices originally acted  as intermediaries between headquarters and the field and served as  communication channels for critical information, policy guidance, and  instructions. SBA downsized these offices and reallocated some of the  regional offices\u2019 workload to district and headquarters offices and created  the Office of Field Operations to act as the field\u2019s representative in  headquarters and help facilitate the flow of information between  headquarters and district offices.

In a January 2003 report on SBA\u2019s  management challenges, we found that SBA\u2019s organizational structure  created complex overlapping relationships among offices that contributed  to challenges in delivering services to small businesses. In 2004, SBA  centralized its loan functions by moving responsibilities from district  offices to loan processing centers. However, some of the complex  overlapping relationships we identified in 2003 still exist (see fig. 4).  Specifically, SBA\u2019s organizational structure often results in working  relationships between headquarters and field offices that differ from  reporting relationships, potentially posing programmatic challenges.  District officials work with program offices at SBA headquarters to  implement the agency\u2019s programs but report to regional administrators,  who themselves report to the Office of Field Operations. For example, the  lender relations specialists in the district offices work with the Office of  Capital Access at SBA headquarters to deliver programs but report to  district office management. Similarly, the business opportunity specialists  in the district offices work with the Office of Government Contracting and  Business Development at SBA headquarters to assist small businesses  with securing government contracts but report to district office  management. Further, some officials have the same duties. The public  affairs specialists at the district offices and the regional communications  directors both handle media relations.

For example, in about half of the 8(a) files we  reviewed we found that district staff did not follow the required annual  review procedures for determining continued eligibility for the  program. We found that the headquarters office responsible for 8(a)  did not provide clear guidance to district staff. In addition, we found  that confusion over roles and responsibilities led to district staff being  unaware of the types and frequency of complaints across the agency  on the eligibility of firms participating in the 8(a) program. As a result,  district staff lacked information that could be used to help identify  issues relating to program integrity. We made six recommendations  that individually and collectively could improve procedures used in  assessing and monitoring the continued eligibility of firms to  participate and benefit from the 8(a) program. SBA agreed with the six  recommendations when the report was issued. As of July 2015, SBA  had taken actions responsive to four of the recommendations.  Specifically, it had assessed the workload of business development  specialists, updated its 8(a) regulations to include more specificity on  the criteria for the continuing eligibility reviews, developed a  centralized process to collect and maintain data on 8(a) firms  participating in the Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program, and implemented a  standard process for documenting and analyzing complaint data.", "Under the Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program, experienced firms mentor 8(a) firms to enhance the  capabilities of the prot\u00e9g\u00e9, provide various forms of business developmental assistance,  and improve the prot\u00e9g\u00e9\u2019s ability to successfully compete for contracts. The two remaining  recommendations yet to be fully implemented as of July 2015 focus on (1) procedures to  ensure that appropriate actions are taken for firms subject to early graduation from the  program and (2) taking actions against firms that fail to submit required documentation.  We maintain that these recommendations continue to have merit and should be fully  implemented. noted that this lack of communication could have not only inhibited the  sharing of crucial information but also caused inconsistencies in the  examinations across field offices.

SBA  determined that its organizational changes had resulted in a  programmatic challenge because employees hired for a former  mission did not have the skills to meet the new mission. Specifically,  before the centralization field offices had primarily needed staff with a  financial background to process individual loans.

As noted  previously, SBA had identified ongoing skill gaps resulting from the 2004  centralization of the loan processing function. These gaps were primarily  in district offices, which are supervised by regional offices. SBA  determined that this organizational change had resulted in a gap between  the competency mix of the employees who had been hired for one  mission (loan processing) and the competency mix needed to accomplish  a new mission (business development, lender relations, and outreach).  SBA noted that the skill gap was particularly pronounced among 480  employees in two job series\u2014GS-1101 and GS-1102\u2014that included  business opportunity specialists, economic development specialists, and  procurement staff.

For  example, a district official noted that a regional administrator might be  aware of a specific issue within a particular district office, see the  similarities with the challenges of another district office, and develop a  solution.", "Fourth, six headquarters, regional, and district managers we interviewed  said that SBA would experience challenges in promoting SBA\u2019s message  without the regional offices. Thirteen headquarters, regional, and district  officials emphasized that as political appointees, regional administrators  played a greater role than district directors, who are career officials, in  explaining and amplifying the President\u2019s and SBA Administrator\u2019s  message and priorities. For example, officials cited the role of regional  administrators in informing small businesses, during the time when the  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was pending, of how the bill  might affect them.", "Conversely, six nonmanagement district staff we interviewed and union  officials told us that they did not see a particular need for the regional  offices. Three district officials said that they could coordinate directly with  headquarters instead of coordinating with the regional offices. One of  these district officials noted that SBA would be more efficient if the  functions of the regional and district offices were consolidated. Another of  these district officials could not identify the impact of the regional offices,  despite the regional administrators\u2019 stated roles in providing guidance and  supervision. In addition, union officials stated that the outreach  responsibilities of the district directors and regional administrators were  duplicative, pointing out that both regional and district officials did  outreach to small businesses in their communities. However, as noted  previously regional communications directors are expected to authorize  all outgoing communication within the region to avoid duplication.", "We recognize that the regional administrators and other staff in the  regional offices provide a number of services for SBA. However, if  closures were to occur, there are options available to address these  challenges. For example, one option could involve adding career senior  officials to the Office of Field Operations to address the challenge of  overseeing the 68 district offices.  In addition, to address the challenge of  the potential loss of flexibility in managing district office workloads, district  directors could coordinate with each other to help distribute the workload  among their offices. Alternatively, this responsibility could be assigned to  the Office of Field Operations. An option to address the challenge  associated with the loss of regional administrators as advocates would be  having district directors collaborate to identify the needs of the various  offices and advocate directly to the Office of Field Operations. However,  before deciding on whether regional offices should be closed or selecting  an alternative option, it is important to carefully assess the feasibility of  these options as well as any others and to weigh the costs and benefits  associated with available options and closure of the regional offices."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We sent a draft of this report to SBA for review and comment.

To assess the reliability of these data, we interviewed SBA officials  from the Office of Human Resource Solutions to gather information on the  completeness and accuracy of the full-time equivalent database and  examined the data for logical inconsistencies and completeness. We  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  reporting on staffing levels.", "For all objectives, we interviewed SBA headquarters officials in the Office  of Field Operations, the 10 regional administrators, management and  nonmanagement staff at 10 district offices, and union representatives.  Specifically, to obtain perspectives from SBA district office officials, we  selected a nonrandom, purposive sample of 10 of the 68 district offices, 1  from each SBA region to provide national coverage. We randomly  selected 7 of the 10 district offices from those offices located within the  continental United States. We selected the Washington, D.C., and  Georgia district offices to pre-test our interview questions because of  proximity to GAO offices. We selected the New York district office to  include an additional large office to better ensure a variety of offices with  both a larger and smaller number of employees. During our visit to 9 of  the 10 district offices, we interviewed the office managers (district  directors and deputy district directors). At the remaining district office, the  deputy district director could not attend the meeting. For our interviews  with nonmanagement staff at the 10 district offices, district office  management invited any interested nonmanagement staff to meet with  us. However, as a condition of meeting with nonmanagement staff, SBA\u2019s  general counsel required inclusion of district counsel in these interviews.  Of the approximately 120 nonmanagement district staff members invited  to speak with us, 28 participated in the interviews. We generally met with  the participating staff as a group. Because participation by  nonmanagement staff members was limited, we provided them an  additional opportunity to share their perspectives via e-mail. Specifically,  we sent an e-mail to all nonmanagement staff at those 10 district offices,  inviting them to share their thoughts on specific topics by sending an e- mail to a specified GAO e-mail address. Nine staff members from 6 of  these offices responded to our e-mail, three of whom also attended our  interviews. The e-mails were used as additional information sources and  to corroborate what we heard in the interviews. The results of our  interactions with the 10 district offices cannot be generalized to other SBA  district offices. The group of union representatives we interviewed was  from headquarters and the field. In conducting this review, we focused  on the role of regional offices. A related, soon-to-be-released GAO report  addresses a range of SBA management issues.", "To review SBA\u2019s organizational structure, we reviewed prior GAO and  SBA Inspector General reports that discussed, among other things, the  effect of the agency\u2019s structure on its human capital management and  program oversight. We also examined documentation on changes to  SBA's organizational structure from fiscal year 2005 to 2014 (the period  after SBA\u2019s last major reorganization in 2004). Specifically, we requested  and reviewed all of the forms that SBA used to document organizational  changes that were approved during this period. We also reviewed  documentation on SBA\u2019s planned efforts to assess its organizational  structure\u2014including its Strategic Human Capital Plan Fiscal Years 2013- 2016, guidance implementing its fiscal year 2014 Voluntary Early  Retirement Authority (VERA) and Voluntary Separation Incentive  Payments (VSIP) programs, and the statement of work for a contractor\u2019s  assessment of organizational structure\u2014and compared these plans to  federal internal control standards.", "To determine the specific responsibilities of the regional offices, we  reviewed position descriptions for the regional administrator and regional  communications director, and compared them to the position descriptions  for the district director and public affairs specialist. In addition, we  interviewed officials at headquarters, regional, and district offices. We  also analyzed data on the 10 regional offices from the field office goals,  measures, and metrics reports from fiscal year 2014 (the most currently  available data). To assess the reliability of these data, we reviewed the  goals, measures, and metric reports for outliers and interviewed officials  from the Office of Field Operations to obtain information on the  completeness and accuracy of the database. We determined that the  data were sufficiently reliable for the purpose of reporting on field  performance.", "To determine how closing SBA\u2019s regional offices could affect SBA, we  analyzed fiscal year 2013 operating budgets and compensation and  benefits data for the regional offices. SBA had to create a report that  separated regional costs from other field office costs, and fiscal year 2013  data were the most recent data available at the time they generated the  report. To assess the reliability of these data, we examined the data for  logical inconsistencies and completeness and reviewed documentation  on the agency\u2019s financial system. We also interviewed officials from the  Office of the Chief Financial Officer to gather information on the  completeness and accuracy of the budget database. We determined that  the data were sufficiently reliable for the purpose of reporting on SBA\u2019s  regional office costs. Additionally, we reviewed documentation on the  tenure of regional administrators and acting regional administrators from  fiscal years 2005 through 2014 to determine turnover.

Prior to  this change, district officials, who are also responsible for providing  business development assistance to 8(a) firms, were tasked with  conducting exams of continued eligibility.
