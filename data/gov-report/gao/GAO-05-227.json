In past years, both agencies have occasionally had to suspend the issuance of guarantees under some programs when they exhausted the dollar amounts of their commitment authority (which serves as a limit on the volume of new loans that an agency can guarantee) or credit subsidy budget authority (the authority to cover the long-term costs--known as credit subsidy costs--of extending these guarantees) before the end of a fiscal year. These suspensions can be disruptive to homebuyers, developers, and lenders. GAO was asked to determine (1) how often and why FHA and RHS have suspended their loan guarantee programs over the last decade, (2) how these agencies manage and notify Congress of the rate at which the authorities for these programs will be exhausted, and (3) options Congress and the agencies could exercise to help prevent future suspensions and the potential implications of these options."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["On 10 occasions since 1994, FHA and RHS have suspended the issuance of loan guarantees after exhausting the commitment authority or credit subsidy budget authority for certain programs before the end of a fiscal year. Specifically, FHA suspended several programs six times and RHS suspended one program four times. The resources budgeted for these programs have not always been adequate to keep them operating for a full fiscal year due partly to difficulties in estimating demand for loan guarantees--a difficulty compounded by the process of preparing the budget request to Congress, which requires that the agencies forecast demand nearly 2 years in advance. FHA and RHS both manage their programs on a first-come, first-served basis, a factor limiting their ability to control the rate at which they use commitment authority and obligate budget authority. However, the agencies have different requirements and approaches for estimating the rate at which they will exhaust these authorities and notifying Congress. For example, unlike RHS, FHA is statutorily required to notify Congress when it has used 75 percent of its commitment authority and when it estimates that it will exhaust this authority before the end of a fiscal year. GAO's analysis indicates that FHA's basic approach for making estimates--applying utilization rates experienced up until the time of the analysis to the remainder of the fiscal year--does not always accurately forecast whether the agency will exhaust its commitment authority. However, FHA officials and federal budget experts said that more complex methods would not necessarily produce better estimates. Through discussions with federal agency and mortgage industry officials, GAO identified several options that Congress, FHA, and RHS could exercise to help prevent future suspensions; however, the options would also have budgetary impacts (such as increasing the budget deficit), make oversight of the programs more difficult, or impose additional administrative burdens on the agencies. For example, Congress could require FHA to provide more frequent notifications about the percentage of commitment authority the agency has used and expand this requirement to include obligations of credit subsidy budget authority. This option, which could also be applied to RHS, could give Congress additional and more timely information to consider whether to provide supplemental appropriations before the end of a fiscal year. Other options for Congress include (1) authorizing FHA to use revenues generated by some of its loan guarantee programs to cover any shortfalls in budget authority for others and (2) providing \"advance funding\"--budget authority made available in an appropriation act for the current fiscal year that comes from a subsequent year's appropriation--for FHA and RHS program credit subsidy costs. Further, FHA and RHS can continue to use or be given additional administrative tools--such as transferring budget authority--to help delay or prevent program suspensions."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s (HUD) Federal  Housing Administration (FHA) and the Department of Agriculture\u2019s  (USDA) Rural Housing Service (RHS) administer loan guarantee programs  aimed at expanding access to mortgage financing for single-family homes  and facilitating the construction, purchase, and rehabilitation of  multifamily rental housing and healthcare facilities. These programs do  not lend money directly to borrowers; instead, the federal government  guarantees loans made by FHA- or RHS-approved lenders. Both agencies  have periodically had to suspend the issuance of guarantees under some of  these programs when they exhausted the programs\u2019 budgets before the end  of a fiscal year. For example, in fiscal year 2001 FHA had to suspend its  Section 221(d)(3) loan guarantee program for nonprofit multifamily  housing developers because of unexpectedly high demand. These  suspensions can be disruptive to homebuyers, developers, and lenders  because they can delay, complicate, or result in the cancellation of  important financial transactions.", "FHA has four funds with which it guarantees mortgages. As of   September 30, 2004, the four funds had guaranteed loans with a total  estimated unpaid principal balance of almost $513 billion. For budget and  accounting purposes, these funds are grouped into two accounts\u2014the  Mutual Mortgage Insurance and Cooperative Management Housing  Insurance (MMI/CMHI) account and the General Insurance and Special  Risk Insurance (GI/SRI) account. The MMI/CMHI account supports FHA\u2019s  largest single-family mortgage insurance program and a minor multifamily  program. In contrast, the GI/SRI account supports a wide range of loan  guarantee programs, including programs for healthcare facilities as well as  multifamily and single-family housing. RHS has one fund\u2014the Rural  Housing Insurance fund (RHIF)\u2014and a corresponding budget account  under which it guarantees mortgages for one single-family program  (Section 502) and one multifamily program (Section 538). As of September  30, 2004, this fund had guaranteed loans with a total estimated unpaid  principal balance of almost $14 billion.", "FHA and RHS loan guarantee programs are discretionary programs that  operate within constraints established through the congressional  appropriations process. In developing their annual budgets, the agencies  must estimate the amount of \u201ccommitment authority\u201d and, when  applicable, credit subsidy budget authority required for their loan  guarantee program accounts. Commitment authority serves as a limit on  the total dollar volume of new loans that an agency can guarantee. Credit  subsidy budget authority is the authority to incur financial obligations to  cover the long-term costs, known as credit subsidy costs, of extending  these guarantees. Credit subsidy costs can be negative (i.e., the present  value of cash inflows exceeds the present value of cash outflows) or  positive (i.e., the present value of cash inflows is less than the present value  of cash outflows).", "The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) reviews the agencies\u2019  estimates of loan commitment authority and credit subsidy budget  authority before they are finalized and included in the President\u2019s Budget  request to Congress. When FHA exhausts the commitment authority for  either of its accounts, it must suspend issuance of additional loan  guarantees for all programs under that account until Congress provides  additional authority. For FHA\u2019s programs with a positive subsidy cost, the  amount of credit subsidy budget authority Congress appropriates also  limits the dollar volume of new loans the agencies may guarantee. For  example, $5 million in credit subsidy budget authority would cover the  credit subsidy costs for up to $50 million in loan guarantees for a program  with a 10 percent credit subsidy rate. RHS\u2019s programs\u2014both of which  currently have positive subsidy costs\u2014are limited by the amount of credit  subsidy budget authority they receive. When FHA or RHS exhausts the  budget authority for its programs with positive credit subsidy costs, the  agency must suspend issuance of additional loan guarantees under those  programs until Congress appropriates additional budget authority.", "You requested that we review issues surrounding suspensions of FHA and  RHS loan guarantee programs, including ways to prevent future  suspensions. Accordingly, the objectives of our review were to determine  (1) since fiscal year 1994 how often and why FHA and RHS have suspended  the issuance of loan guarantees due to the exhaustion of commitment  authority or credit subsidy budget authority before the end of a fiscal year;  (2) how FHA and RHS manage, and notify Congress of, the rate at which  they use commitment authority and obligate credit subsidy budget  authority; and (3) options Congress, FHA, and RHS could exercise to help  prevent future suspensions of loan guarantee programs and the potential  implications of these options.", "To meet these objectives, we reviewed laws, regulations, and guidance  governing FHA\u2019s and RHS\u2019s loan guarantee programs. We reviewed  information pertaining to the agencies\u2019 suspensions of loan guarantee  programs from fiscal years 1994 through 2004. We also performed a  detailed analysis of FHA monthly budget and accounting data for fiscal  years 2003 and 2004. We assessed the reliability of these data and found  them sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our report. In addition, we  interviewed officials from FHA and RHS headquarters, OMB, the  Congressional Budget Office (CBO), and housing industry groups. We  conducted our work in Washington, D.C., from January 2004 through  January 2005 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Our scope and methodology are discussed in greater detail in  appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["FHA and RHS operate a variety of loan guarantee programs, organized  under three budget accounts, that support the financing of single-family  and multifamily housing, as well as healthcare facilities (see fig. 1). The  guarantees substantially reduce the financial risk for lenders in the event  that borrowers default, thereby allowing lenders to make loans available to  more borrowers. FHA and RHS loan guarantees for multifamily properties  are often combined with other financing sources, such as low-income  housing tax credits and tax-exempt bonds issued by states and localities.", "FHA is the federal government\u2019s principal provider of mortgage loan  guarantees and operates numerous loan guarantee programs. In fiscal year  2004, FHA guaranteed over $107 billion in loans under the MMI/CMHI  account, the vast majority of which occurred within the 203(b) program.  The 203(b) program provides loan guarantees for the purchase or refinancing of single-family homes. The other program in the MMI/CMHI  account is the Section 213 program, which guarantees mortgage loans to  facilitate the construction, substantial rehabilitation, and purchase of  cooperative housing projects. Because both programs currently have  negative subsidy costs, neither requires credit subsidy budget authority.  The MMI/CMHI account received $185 billion in commitment authority in  fiscal year 2004. FHA\u2019s GI/SRI account, which received $29 billion in  commitment authority in fiscal year 2004, supports an array of programs.  These include programs that facilitate the development, construction,  rehabilitation, purchase, and refinancing of multifamily apartments and  healthcare facilities. For example, the 221(d)(4) program\u2014FHA\u2019s largest  multifamily program\u2014guarantees loans to for-profit developers of  multifamily apartments, and the 221(d)(3) program guarantees loans to  nonprofit developers. The GI/SRI account also includes several specialized  single-family programs, such as the 203(k) (rehabilitation mortgage),  Section 234 (condominiums), Title I (property improvement and  manufactured housing), and Section 255 (home equity conversion  mortgage) programs. In contrast to the MMI/CMHI account, several of the  programs in the GI/SRI account have positive subsidy costs, which require  credit subsidy budget authority. In fiscal year 2004, four GI/SRI account  programs\u2014Section 221(d)(3), Section 241, Multifamily Operating Loss, and  Title I Property Improvement\u2014received $15 million in credit subsidy  budget authority.", "RHS\u2019s loan guarantee programs, as a whole, are much smaller than FHA\u2019s,  are targeted to rural areas, and have more income restrictions. Under its  RHIF account, RHS guarantees loans through two programs\u2014the Section  502 program and the Section 538 program. The Section 502 program serves  rural residents with incomes not exceeding 115 percent of the U.S. median  income who wish to purchase or refinance a single-family home. In fiscal  year 2004, this program received $2.7 billion in commitment authority and  about $40 million in credit subsidy budget authority. The Section 538  program guarantees loans to nonprofit or for-profit developers for the  construction, acquisition, and rehabilitation of multifamily rental housing  in rural areas that serve households with incomes that do not exceed 115  percent of area median income. In fiscal year 2004, this program received  $100 million in commitment authority and about $6 million in credit  subsidy budget authority.", "In formulating and executing the budgets for their loan guarantee  programs, FHA and RHS must adhere to specific federal budgetary and  accounting requirements. The process of preparing their annual budget  request requires that FHA and RHS prepare estimates of the dollar amount  of loans they anticipate guaranteeing nearly 2 years in advance. These  estimates influence the amount of commitment authority and credit  subsidy budget authority the agencies request and receive. The Federal  Credit Reform Act of 1990 requires the President\u2019s Budget to reflect the  costs of credit programs and include the planned level of new loan  guarantees associated with each appropriation request. Agencies  therefore must calculate and estimate the long-term cost, known as the  credit subsidy cost, to the federal government of extending or guaranteeing  credit and the amount of new loan guarantees they plan on making. The  agencies estimate these costs for each program by calculating a credit  subsidy rate that takes into account factors such as fees, defaults, and  recoveries, and applying this rate to the total dollar amount of loans they  anticipate guaranteeing. When an agency decides to guarantee a loan, it  uses this rate to determine the credit subsidy cost of doing so. Under  programs requiring positive credit subsidies, the agency can issue the new  guarantee only if the budget authority to cover this cost is available. In  contrast, programs with negative subsidies are constrained only by  commitment authority, which limits the amount of financial risk the federal  government assumes each year.", "FHA and RHS receive their commitment authority limit and appropriations  of credit subsidy budget authority on a somewhat different basis. Although  FHA, as required, estimates its commitment authority and credit subsidy  needs for each loan guarantee program under the MMI/CMHI and GI/SRI  accounts, it requests and receives these authorities on an account, rather  than a program, basis. Congress has generally not specified a level of  commitment authority or credit subsidy budget authority for each program.  In addition, FHA routinely requests and receives a commitment authority  limit that exceeds the dollar amount of loans it has estimated it will make, a  practice that helps prevent exhaustion of commitment authority before the  end of a fiscal year. In contrast, RHS receives credit subsidy budget  authority on a program basis. That is, the Section 502 program and Section  538 program receive separate appropriations of credit subsidy budget  authority. For both of these programs, the commitment authority limit is  the amount of credit subsidy budget authority divided by the credit subsidy  rate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Difficulties in Estimating Demand Underlie FHA and RHS\u2019s 10 Suspensions of Loan Guarantee Programs Since 1994", "paragraphs": ["On 10 occasions since 1994, FHA and RHS have suspended the issuance of  loan guarantees under certain programs because the programs effectively  exhausted their commitment authority or credit subsidy budget authority  before the end of a fiscal year.

On  September 16, 2003, FHA suspended the issuance of loan guarantees under  the GI/SRI account until Congress raised the commitment authority limit in  a supplemental appropriations act. The other two suspensions occurred  while the agency was operating under a series of continuing resolutions in  early fiscal year 2004. The first suspension occurred in early December  2003, when FHA exhausted the $3.8 billion in commitment authority  provided in the first of these resolutions. FHA lifted the suspension after  receiving an additional $3.9 billion under a subsequent resolution in mid- December 2003 but suspended the programs again after exhausting this  amount on January 14, 2004.

However, in some cases, RHS was able to  take actions that delayed or mitigated the impact of the suspensions on  borrowers and lenders. For example, in early August 2003, RHS transferred  $3.6 million in budget authority from the Section 523 (Mutual and Self-help  Technical Assistance) grant program to the Section 502 program in order to  delay suspension of the program. This transfer enabled the Section 502  program to guarantee an additional $297 million in loans and delayed  suspension of the program until August 27. Also, during the 4-week  suspension period, RHS continued to accept and approve loan guarantee  applications submitted by lenders and committed to issuing the guarantees  as soon as it received its next appropriation. Further, in March 2004, RHS  anticipated that the Section 502 program would exhaust its credit subsidy  budget authority early in the fourth quarter. In June, RHS increased the  program\u2019s guarantee fee and transferred a total of $7 million in budget  authority from the Section 504 (Natural Disaster), 514 (Farm Labor  Housing), 515 (Multifamily Housing), 516 (Rural Housing Assistance), and  538 programs to the Section 502 program. The increase in the guarantee  fee enabled RHS to issue an additional $100 million in loan guarantees, and  the transfers enabled RHS to issue an additional $531 million in loan  guarantees. Although these actions delayed suspension of the program,  RHS eventually had to suspend the program on August 24, 2004.

Estimating demand for budget purposes is difficult for several reasons. A  primary reason is that demand for loan guarantees is highly responsive to  interest rates, which are volatile and difficult to forecast. For example, due  in part to the decline in mortgage interest rates in fiscal year 2003, the  number of FHA single-family refinancing loans was 60 percent higher than  in fiscal year 2002. According to FHA officials, they could not have  anticipated the interest rate change or reflected it in their fiscal year 2003  budget. As a result, FHA used its commitment authority faster than  anticipated and effectively exhausted the authority for the GI/SRI account 2  weeks before the end of the fiscal year. Similarly, according to RHS  officials, low interest rates in fiscal year 2003 resulted in significantly  higher demand for Section 502 loan guarantees (and a corresponding  increase in the use of commitment authority) compared with the previous 3  years (see fig. 2). Because RHS based its fiscal year 2003 budget estimate  primarily on actual demand levels from these prior years, the amount the  agency requested and was appropriated for the Section 502 program was  not adequate to fund the program for the entire fiscal year, resulting in  suspension of the program in late August 2003.", "In addition, FHA and RHS have implemented program and policy changes  that were not foreseen or whose specific effects could not be known at the  time the agencies developed their budgets. For example, in response to a  statutory change that occurred after HUD submitted its fiscal year 2004  budget request, FHA increased its individual loan limits for multifamily  housing in high-cost areas during the second and third quarters of fiscal  year 2004. FHA officials told us that while they expected that these  changes would result in higher utilization of commitment authority, they  could not have factored them into the department\u2019s budget request.  Additionally, in the beginning of fiscal year 2003\u2014well after federal  agencies had developed their budgets for that year\u2014the administration  established a goal to increase the number of minority homeowners by at  least 5.5 million families by 2010. To help achieve this goal, RHS, among  other things, lowered its guarantee fee, conducted outreach with minority  lenders, and promoted credit counseling and homeownership education.  According to RHS, these actions helped increase loan volume under the  Section 502 program to an historic high but could not have been taken into  account in preparing the agency\u2019s fiscal year 2003 budget.", "Compounding the difficulty in predicting demand is the federal budget  process, which requires that FHA and RHS submit to OMB estimates of the  dollar amount they anticipate guaranteeing in a given year nearly 2 years in  advance. The agencies\u2019 estimates influence the amount of commitment  authority and credit subsidy budget authority the agencies request and  receive through the budget process. Because these estimates are prepared  so far in advance, they cannot be made with a high level of certainty.  Further, the agencies\u2019 appropriations do not always reflect estimates of  program demand because of resource constraints and competing priorities  within the federal budget."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FHA and RHS Manage Their Programs in a Similar Manner but Estimate and Notify Congress of the Rate at Which They Will Exhaust Commitment and Budget Authority Differently", "paragraphs": ["FHA and RHS basically manage their loan guarantee programs on a first- come, first-served basis, a factor limiting both agencies\u2019 ability to control  the rate at which they use commitment authority and obligate credit  subsidy budget authority.

More specifically, according to FHA and RHS officials, neither  agency prioritizes or rejects eligible applications as long as sufficient  commitment and budget authority are available because they have  determined that, with few exceptions, they lack the authority to do so.   The agencies do not, for example, try to reduce their utilization or  obligation rates by placing a higher priority on smaller loans than larger  loans. FHA officials told us that even if they had this authority, they would  not want to be in the position of judging whether loans under one program  should be guaranteed before loans under another program or choosing  between eligible loans under the same program. Consequently, all FHA  programs (those with positive and negative subsidy costs) under the same  account provide loan guarantees until the account\u2019s commitment authority  is exhausted, or, for programs with positive subsidy costs, until either the  account\u2019s commitment authority or credit subsidy budget authority is  exhausted.", "FHA and RHS implement the first-come, first-served approach somewhat  differently. Although FHA makes loan guarantees through its single-family  and multifamily housing field offices, it does not allocate commitment  authority and credit subsidy budget authority to these offices in advance of  using and obligating the authorities. In contrast, under its Section 502  program, RHS first allocates the budget authority to its state offices based  on a formula. Each state office then obligates the budget authority on a  first-come, first-served basis. RHS also maintains a central reserve that can  be used to supplement funding to state offices that run out of budget  authority before the end of the fiscal year.  In addition, RHS may  redistribute budget authority from state offices that have more than  necessary to state offices with shortfalls. For its Section 538 program, RHS  obligates budget authority on a first-come, first-served basis without first  allocating the funds to its state offices.

FHA currently relies on several unintegrated data  systems to monitor its authority balances. An FHA official receives end-of- day activity reports from all guaranteed lending programs on commitment  authority utilization and credit subsidy budget authority obligations and  manually enters the data into a spreadsheet on a daily basis.

To supplement the straight-line  estimates, FHA officials indicated that they also use their judgment and  experience to factor in market and economic variables, such as interest  rates. Although FHA provided us with examples of its straight-line  estimates, it did not maintain records of its more comprehensive estimates,  which incorporated judgments about these other variables.

They also  said that it would be difficult to develop such a method. Officials from  OMB, CBO, and housing industry groups agreed that it is difficult to  estimate the rate at which commitment authority will be used and that a  more complex method may not yield better estimates.", "While FHA maintains data on its utilization of commitment authority, it  could not provide us with complete records of its straight-line estimates. In  the absence of these estimates, we analyzed FHA\u2019s data on commitment  authority utilization and found that a basic straight-line method cannot  always accurately predict whether the agency will exhaust its commitment  authority before the end of a fiscal year. As shown in table 2, by the end of  March 2003\u2014halfway through the fiscal year\u2014FHA had used less than half  of its commitment authority (45.5 percent) under the GI/SRI account.  Assuming the same utilization rate for the second half of the year (i.e., 45.5  percent over 6 months), we estimated that FHA would have used 91  percent of its commitment authority by the end of the fiscal year. However,  in actuality, FHA used 91 percent of its commitment authority by the end of  August\u2014earlier than it might have estimated based on a straight-line  analysis\u2014and was forced to suspend the issuance of loan guarantees under  this account in the middle of September. Even if FHA had conducted this  analysis at the end of June, it would have estimated that it would use less  than 100 percent of its commitment authority by the end of the fiscal year.", "Further, as shown in table 3, straight-line calculations can also  overestimate utilization. Specifically, an analysis conducted at the end of  March 2004, when FHA had used 52.5 percent of the commitment authority  under the GI/SRI account, would have projected that FHA would exhaust  the authority before the end of the fiscal year and that almost 105 percent  of its commitment authority would be needed in order to prevent a  suspension.

As noted previously, for the programs with positive  subsidy costs under the GI/SRI account, the volume of loans FHA can  guarantee is also limited by annual appropriations of credit subsidy budget  authority. FHA\u2019s annual budget requests and enacted levels of commitment  authority for its MMI/CMHI and GI/SRI accounts reflect commitment  authority limits that usually exceed the dollar volume of loans the agency  estimates it will actually guarantee. According to FHA officials, the  \u201ccushion\u201d between the enacted commitment authority limit and FHA\u2019s  estimate of guarantees is intended to minimize the possibility of FHA  exhausting its authority before the end of the fiscal year. The enacted  commitment authority limits are increased periodically to reflect growth in  the loan guarantee programs over time but do not always reflect changes in  FHA\u2019s estimates from year to year. As a result, the difference between the  enacted commitment authority limits and FHA\u2019s estimates\u2014what FHA  refers to as \u201cstandby authority\u201d\u2014has varied considerably. For example,  from fiscal years 1999 through 2004, the enacted commitment authority  limits exceeded FHA\u2019s estimates by anywhere from 5 to 49 percent for the  MMI/CMHI account and 0 to 94 percent for the GI/SRI account.

In that event, loan programs with negative  subsidy costs, such as FHA\u2019s 203(b) program, would, all other things being  equal, increase the amount of negative subsidies available to offset FHA\u2019s  budget but also increase the agency\u2019s exposure to risk. In contrast, loan  volume for programs with positive subsidy costs under FHA\u2019s GI/SRI  account would continue to be limited by the annual credit subsidy  appropriation and so would not be affected by this option.

Under the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990,  the President\u2019s Budget must reflect the costs of loan guarantee programs  and must include the amount of new loan guarantees planned. Federal  agencies must therefore prepare a budget estimate for each loan guarantee  program which represents the amount of credit subsidy budget authority  the program would require or the amount of negative subsidy the program  would generate. For example, for fiscal year 2004, FHA estimated that it  would need approximately $8 million in credit subsidy budget authority for  three multifamily programs under the GI/SRI account. FHA also estimated  that the remaining six multifamily programs under the account would  generate approximately $79 million in negative subsidies. As proposed by  the Millennial Housing Commission in 2002, HUD could combine all nine of  these programs for credit subsidy purposes, which, unless current credit  subsidy rates and levels of program activity changed dramatically, would  result in a single negative credit subsidy rate and thus eliminate the need  for annual appropriations of credit subsidy budget authority.", "Currently, negative subsidies generated by some of FHA\u2019s multifamily  programs are considered as offsetting receipts in the agency\u2019s annual  budgets. Using some of the negative subsidies to, in effect, pay for the  positive subsidies required for other GI/SRI programs would reduce the  offset, all other things being equal. The elimination of credit subsidy  appropriations under a combined multifamily program could compensate  for the reduced offset. However, because the programs with positive  subsidies would no longer be constrained by appropriations of budget  authority, they could experience more activity and higher resulting costs  than they would otherwise, thus increasing the budget deficit (all other  things being equal).

For example, to the extent that the option may be  inconsistent with Federal Credit Reform Act requirements, Congress would  have to provide FHA a limited exception to these requirements. Further,  congressional oversight would be affected because combining the  programs would eliminate the need for credit subsidy budget authority.  Therefore, congressional appropriators would only be able to control the  size of the programs through limits on commitment authority. Additionally,  to maintain its current level of oversight, Congress would need to ensure  that HUD continued providing the estimated cost of, and number of  guarantees under, individual programs in its annual budget requests.
