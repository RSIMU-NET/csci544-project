The Army, in particular, has faced continuing demand for large numbers of forces, especially for forces with support skills. GAO was mandated to examine the extent of DOD's reliance on personnel with high-demand skills and its efforts to reduce or eliminate reliance on these personnel.

After determining which requirements can be met with contractor personnel, DOD then determines how to meet requirements for military personnel. DOD officials charged with identifying forces have not had full visibility over the pool of skilled personnel available for future deployments. For some skills, the combatant commander's operational requirements have exceeded the initial supply of readily available trained military forces. DOD has met demands for these skills through strategies such as reassigning or retraining personnel. However, many of the skilled personnel in high demand are reservists whose involuntary active duty is limited under the current partial mobilization authority and DOD and Army policy. To meet requirements, officials charged with identifying personnel for future rotations developed an inefficient, labor-intensive process to gather information needed for decision making because integrated, comprehensive personnel data were not readily available. DOD is taking steps to develop comprehensive data that identify personnel according to deployment histories and skills; however, until DOD systematically integrates such data into its process for identifying forces, it will continue to make important decisions about personnel for future rotations based upon limited information and lack the analytical bases for requesting changes in or exceptions to deployment policies. Although DOD has developed several strategies to meet the combatant commander's requirements for previous rotations, it has not undertaken comprehensive, data-driven analysis of options that would make more personnel available for future rotations in Iraq and Afghanistan. A key reason why DOD has not conducted comprehensive analyses of options is that its process for identifying forces focuses on one rotation at a time and does not take a long-term view of potential requirements. Prior GAO work has shown that reliable data about current and future workforce requirements are essential for effective strategic planning, as is the data-driven analysis of the number of personnel and the skill mix needed to support key competencies. With data that link deployment dates and skills, DOD could assess options, including using more personnel with support skills from the Army and other services, transferring more positions to high-demand areas, and changing deployment lengths. Each of these options has both advantages and disadvantages. However, without a comprehensive analysis of the options and their related advantages and disadvantages, DOD will be challenged to plan effectively for future requirements and to meet recruiting goals. Additionally, without linking data and options, the services may have difficulty deploying all reservists once before other reservists are required to deploy for a second time, which is a key DOD goal. Moreover, the Secretary of Defense and Congress will not have complete information with which to make decisions about the size and composition of the force, mobilization policies, and other issues."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the Global War on  Terrorism has required large numbers of active duty and reserve military  personnel to deploy for overseas missions, including ongoing operations in  Afghanistan and Iraq. The Department of Defense (DOD) now faces the  unprecedented challenge of sustaining large-scale, ongoing operations  with an all-volunteer military force. As operations have evolved from  combat to counterinsurgency operations, the dynamic operational  conditions in Iraq and Afghanistan have made it more difficult for DOD to  anticipate the number of forces and the specific skills needed in the future.  Thus far, operations have continued to require large numbers of ground  forces. The combatant commander of U.S. Central Command is  responsible for the area of operations that includes Iraq and Afghanistan.  The commanders, Joint Forces Command and Special Operations  Command, are charged with identifying the forces that can be deployed to  meet the combatant commander\u2019s requirement considering global risks.  While DOD has contracted with private companies for a significant  number of support activities, Army forces\u2014particularly those with combat  support and combat service support skills, such as military police and  civil affairs, which reside heavily in its reserve components\u2014continue to  be in high demand.

The 2006  Quadrennial Defense Review Report, which outlines the defense program  for the future, recognizes that the department needs to rebalance military  skills between and within the active and reserve components and that the  reserve components need to be more accessible and ready to meet a range  of overseas and domestic missions. The report did not provide details on  how it will accomplish this. Further, as we have previously reported, the  department faces challenges in transforming forces for the future, such as  meeting increased requirements for high-demand skills. For example, we  have reported on problems in DOD\u2019s mobilization and demobilization of  reservists as well as the issues raised by continuing demands for reserve  personnel to deploy. As we reported in July 2005, the number of Army  Reserve personnel that can be deployed under current mobilization  authorities and deployment policies is declining and many personnel have  been moved among units to tailor forces and fill shortages in those units.", "Further, we have reported that DOD lacks data that would give it visibility  over the health status of reserve members. We also reported that while  DOD intends to move military positions to high-demand skills over time to  provide more capability, the degree to which this initiative will make more  military personnel available for operational missions is uncertain.

The classified report contains additional details comparing  operational requirements to the Army\u2019s supply of trained personnel  available to deploy and examining DOD\u2019s strategies to meet the  requirements for skilled forces. Accordingly, this report assesses (1) the  combat support and combat service support skills that are in high demand  for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and the extent to which DOD has  visibility over personnel available for future deployment and (2) the extent  to which the department has conducted a comprehensive, data-driven  analysis of its alternatives to continue meeting requirements for high- demand forces.

In addition, we observed Department of the Army and Joint  Staff conferences to understand how the department made decisions when  identifying support forces for these operations. To assess what forces  remain available to meet future requirements, we examined documents  provided by the Joint Staff, the U.S. Joint Forces Command, the Army, and  the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), and we discussed with  responsible officials the challenges they face in identifying forces for  deployment. To assess the extent to which DOD has analyzed alternatives  that will allow it to continue to meet requirements for support forces, we  reviewed our work on human capital management, identified and  examined DOD\u2019s initiatives to assess alternatives, and held discussions  with officials responsible for identifying forces. We performed our review  from February 2005 through June 2006 in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards.

In both cases, operations quickly evolved from major combat  operations into ongoing counterinsurgency and stability operations, which  have continued to require large numbers of forces, ranging from about  138,000 personnel to about 160,000 personnel from 2004 to the present.  These operations have required large numbers of forces with support  skills, such as military police and civil affairs.

DOD  policy implementing the mobilization authority states that any soldier who  has served 24 cumulative months during current operations is ineligible  for any further activation unless the reservist volunteers for additional  duty. Further, DOD\u2019s policy is that no reservist should be involuntarily  deployed to either Iraq or Afghanistan more than once, according to senior  DOD officials.

DOD planners are beginning to identify  forces for the 07-09 rotation. Based on our review of DOD\u2019s deployment  policies and our prior work, we identified several options that DOD could  assess to increase the supply of high-demand skills to support future  rotations. Each of the proposed options involves both advantages and  disadvantages, and some options could be implemented in conjunction  with others. Moreover, some options might be more appropriate for  certain skill sets than others. However, without key data and analyses,  such as the amount of time remaining under the partial mobilization  authority for each reservist, decision makers will have difficulty weighing  which option(s) would best achieve DOD\u2019s overall goals of supplying  trained and available forces to meet the combatant commander\u2019s  requirements while considering risks, future readiness, and recruiting and  retention. Based on its challenges in providing personnel with high- demand skills in previous rotations, DOD will be faced with difficult  choices on how to make personnel in high-demand skills available for  future rotations. Options that could increase the supply of combat support  and combat service support skills for future rotations include the  following:    Retraining personnel within the Army and other services in high- demand skills. DOD could consider requiring the Army to reassign and  retrain more of its personnel as well as relying on the Air Force, the Navy,  and the Marine Corps to reassign and retrain available personnel for high- demand Army skills. As discussed previously, the Joint Forces Command  has identified significant numbers of Army and other service personnel  that the Army could retrain for some high-demand skills. As of February  2006, the Joint Staff estimated that over 200,000 reservists from all the  services\u2019 reserve components could be potentially available for  deployment under current policies and might be retrained for high-demand  skills, and the services are attempting to verify the actual availability of  reservists. However it is unclear how many reservists can be reassigned  and retrained to meet Army requirements for skills and rank. OSD officials  said the department would consider waiving deployment policies for  targeted high-demand skill personnel only when the services can provide a  strong business case for the waiver. Instead, the department intends to  rely on retraining personnel and seeking volunteers to meet future  requirements. Joint Staff officials are currently seeking from the services  more detailed data on potentially available personnel, such as their skills  and whether they can be assigned and trained for deployment. A key  advantage of this option is that Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps  personnel who have not deployed already have some military skills and  experience, such as an understanding of the roles and responsibilities of  their senior leaders and knowledge of military roles and missions that  could be useful in supporting ongoing operations. In some cases,  experienced personnel from the other services may have specialized skills  that are similar to the Army skills in high demand; therefore, they would  need less training than newly recruited Army personnel. A disadvantage to  this option would be that the other service personnel would not be  available to perform missions in their respective services. Further,  members of the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps could potentially miss  training and other opportunities to enhance their careers in their parent  services. Moreover, recruiting and retention could be hindered because  potential recruits or experienced personnel may not want to retrain for  missions and skills other than those they originally planned to perform.", "Adjusting force structure through increasing the number of Army  positions in combat support and combat service support by further  transferring positions from low-demand skills to high-demand  areas. Another option focuses on shifting positions in low-demand skills  to high-demand skills, either temporarily or permanently. The Army plans  to transfer some low-demand positions to high-demand skills, such as  military police. In addition, DOD plans to expand psychological operations  and civil affairs units by 3,700 personnel as a result of Operation Iraqi  Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom, according to the 2006  Quadrennial Defense Review Report. However, according to a senior  Army official, the Army is facing challenges in meeting its current planned  time frames for reassigning positions because providing forces to meet the  rotational requirements in Iraq and Afghanistan has created delays in  planned transfers of skills and modular force transformations may require  permanent changes in the numbers and types of skills needed. The  advantage of creating more units with high-demand skills is that  continuing operational requirements could be met with more available,  trained personnel. Further, if more units with the combat support and  combat service support skills that are in high demand were in the active  component, DOD would not face the restrictions that apply to reserve  personnel. A major disadvantage to using this option is that the Army  could encounter further delays in providing personnel with high-demand  skills because, according to some service officials, limitations in the  availability of training facilities, courses, and instructors may reduce the  numbers of personnel who can be retrained in the short term. Many of  the Army\u2019s skills in high demand reside primarily in the Army\u2019s reserve  component. Therefore, if DOD\u2019s deployment policies remain unchanged,  the Army will continue to face limitations on its use of reservists.", "Changing the number of days that active duty and reserve Army  personnel may be in theater for a deployment. OSD could consider  changing the duration of deployment for Army reservists or active duty  personnel in theater, known as \u201cboots-on-the-ground,\u201d from the current 12  months. Current departmental guidance states that Army personnel can  serve no more than 12 months within the U.S. Central Command\u2019s theater  of operations, not including the time spent in mobilization and  demobilization activities. However, because mobilization and  demobilization activities require about 3 months prior to deployment and 3  months after deployment, reservists deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan  typically serve about 18 months on active duty. Under DOD\u2019s policy, the  Army may use reserve members for a total of 24 cumulative months.  Therefore, by the time reservists are deactivated after 18 months of  mobilization, they have only 6 months of deployment eligibility remaining  under DOD\u2019s policy\u2014not enough to remobilize and redeploy for another  yearlong overseas assignment. If the amount of \u201cboots-on-the-ground\u201d time  was lengthened, from the current 12 months to 18 months, the Army could  more fully use reserve personnel under the partial mobilization authority.  A key advantage of this option would be that a longer deployment period  would permit forces to be in theater longer and provide more force  stability and continuity, but individuals could be adversely affected by  longer tours of duty. In addition, a slower rotational pace would provide  force planners, such as the Army Forces Command, more time to identify  available personnel and decide which personnel will best meet  requirements for the next rotation. However, lengthening \u201cboots-on-the- ground\u201d time could have negative consequences for individuals. If  reservists were away from their civilian careers and families for longer  time frames, individual morale could erode, and DOD could face  challenges in recruiting and retaining skilled personnel.", "Alternatively, the Army could shorten the \u201cboots-on-the-ground\u201d time and  involuntarily activate reservists to deploy to Iraq and Afghanistan more  than once. If deployments were shortened, Army reservists would not be  separated from their civilian careers for long periods, and recruiting and  retention challenges could lessen. However, a major disadvantage to  shortening the Army\u2019s deployment lengths to, for example, 6 months is  that the Army would have to mobilize and demobilize more personnel in a  given period. According to Army and Army Forces Command officials, if  reservists\u2019 deployments were shortened without change to the \u201cone  deployment only\u201d policy, the Army would face critical personnel shortages  in many skill areas. Any shortages of available reserve personnel would  likely have to be filled with active duty personnel, increasing stress on the  active force. Further, less time at home for active forces could disrupt  training and lower readiness for future missions.", "Allowing redeployment of reserve personnel with time remaining  under DOD\u2019s 24 cumulative month deployment policy. DOD\u2019s policy  is that personnel should not be deployed for more than 24 cumulative  months under the partial mobilization authority or involuntarily deployed  overseas a second time, irrespective of the number of months served.  However, if OSD allowed the redeployment of reserve personnel the  services could more fully use reservists\u2019 24 months of involuntary active  duty. The major advantage to this option is that the Army would have  access to reservists trained in high-demand skills. Further, changing the  redeployment policy could enable the Army to decrease its reliance on  retraining its personnel or other service personnel to meet the combatant  commander\u2019s requirements. If the Army collected detailed data about the  number of days a reservist served in theater and the remaining time  available under the partial mobilization authority, it could compile a  comprehensive list of reservists who could possibly deploy again and  identify the time frames that they would be available. However, as  discussed in the previous sections of the report, DOD and the Army do not  have detailed data about personnel across the services readily available. A  major disadvantage of this option would be that DOD would involuntarily  activate large numbers of reserve personnel for multiple deployments.  Multiple deployments could disrupt a reservist\u2019s civilian career and  decrease his or her willingness to remain in the military. Another  disadvantage of redeploying reservists would be that some reservists  could be deployed more than once in 6 years, which differs from the  Army\u2019s plan under its force rotation model. The Army\u2019s force rotation  planning model is designed to provide reservists more predictability in  deployment eligibility.", "Increasing the Army\u2019s active duty end strength. Congress authorizes  annually the number of personnel that each service may have at the end of  a given fiscal year. This number is known as authorized end strength. In  the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006, Congress  increased the fiscal year 2006 end strength of the Army by 10,000\u2014from  502,400 to 512,400. Congress also authorized additional authority for  increases of up to 20,000 active Army personnel for fiscal years 2007  through 2009 to support ongoing missions and to achieve transformation.  However, current Army plans project a decrease in personnel to 482,400  active duty forces by fiscal year 2011. The primary advantage of increasing  the Army\u2019s end strength and funding associated positions would be that  the Army could provide more active duty personnel to meet operational  requirements for Iraq and Afghanistan, to accommodate the requirements  for the modular force, and to help meet the Army\u2019s rotational force  planning goal of having active personnel deployed for no more than 1 out  of every 3 years. Budgetary concerns could be a major drawback to this  option. Decision makers would have to weigh the increased cost of  permanently increasing the Army\u2019s end strength. According to Army  personnel and budget officials, in fiscal year 2005, the estimated cost to  compensate, retain, and train each Army servicemember was over  $100,000 annually. Further, recruiting personnel to meet the higher end  strength levels may be difficult because of the uncertainty of how long  operations in Iraq and Afghanistan may continue and whether new recruits  could be targeted to high-demand skills. Additionally, the Army would  require time to organize, train, and equip additional units to be ready to  deploy for overseas operations.", "Using more personnel from the Individual Ready Reserve. Members  of the Army\u2019s Individual Ready Reserve, which is composed of about  112,700 members, include individuals who were previously trained during  periods of active service but who have not completed their service  obligations, individuals who have completed their service obligations and  voluntarily retain their reserve status, and personnel who have not  completed basic training. Most of these members are not assigned to an  organized unit, do not attend weekend or annual training, and do not  receive pay unless they are called to active duty. Members assigned to the  Individual Ready Reserve are subject to recall, if needed, and serve a  maximum of 24 months. As of September 2005, of the total Army  Individual Ready Reserve population of 112,700, about 5,200 personnel had  been mobilized. An advantage of this option is that it could provide the  Army with access to personnel who already have some military  experience. These reservists could be retrained in their active duty skills  or retrained in different skills. A significant drawback to this option would  be the time needed to identify, locate, and contact members of the  Individual Ready Reserve because, as we have reported previously, the  services lack vital contact information. Further, based on the Army\u2019s  recent experience when these reservists were recalled, exemptions and  delays were encountered that could limit the services\u2019 ability to use these  personnel in significant numbers.", "Identifying forces for future rotations is likely to become more difficult for  DOD without comprehensive analyses of options for meeting potential  future requirements. Without complete and accurate data that link  deployment information and skill areas for military personnel to assist in  developing and assessing the options, the department will continue to  have limited information with which to make decisions about how to fill  the combatant commander\u2019s requirements. Further, without a systematic  evaluation of options, the current difficulties in providing personnel with  the needed skills could worsen and requirements could go unfilled. As the  Joint Staff\u2019s limited analyses of options showed, having complete and  accurate data enables planners to clearly identify how alternative options  would affect their ability to efficiently identify forces. Additionally,  without linking data to options, the services may have difficultly deploying  all reservists at least once before other reservists are required to deploy  for a second time, which is a key goal of officials in OSD. If DOD had data- driven analyses of options to increase available skilled personnel, DOD  leaders would have a better basis for considering policy changes and  congressional decision makers would have more complete information  with which to carry out their oversight responsibilities with regard to the  size and composition of the force, mobilization policies, and other issues."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Although DOD has accommodated the continuing high demands for  combat support and combat service support skills, primarily through  retraining and reassigning personnel, the pool of available, trained, and  deployable reservists is diminishing rapidly and could leave the  department with significant challenges to identifying personnel for future  rotations. Until DOD\u2019s planners and senior decision makers integrate in  the sourcing process comprehensive, reliable data that link personnel by  skills and deployment histories, they will have to continue to use an  inefficient and time-consuming process to determine which personnel to  deploy. Moreover, DOD will be limited in its ability to assess whether it  can meet future requirements and to consider a range of alternatives for  meeting requirements for skills that are in high demand. If DOD had better  visibility over the personnel who are available to deploy and their skills,  officials could reduce the amount of time they spend in identifying  personnel for rotations, provide assurance that personnel identified are  appropriately matched considering both the requirements and future  readiness, and better manage the risks associated with moving personnel  from other skills and missions to support future operations.", "In addition, without an integrated assessment that uses data to examine  alternative courses of action, DOD planners and senior leaders will not be  well positioned to make informed decisions on how to meet the  requirements of future rotations, particularly if rotations continue at  roughly the same level for the next few years. To meet requirements for  future rotations, the department intends to continue its strategy of  reassigning any eligible personnel the services can identify until all  reservists from all services have been deployed at least once. However,  there are additional options that DOD could consider that might increase  the supply of personnel for high-demand skills for future rotations,  although each option could have negative effects as well as positive ones.  Data-driven analysis of options could help DOD senior leaders make  difficult decisions to balance the advantages and disadvantages for each  option and to apply the best-suited option to meet the varying  requirements for the range of high-demand skills. Until DOD  comprehensively assesses these options using detailed data linked to  individual skills and deployment histories, DOD officials cannot weigh  what options would be most advantageous to the combatant commander  and whether potential negative effects on readiness for future operations  would be minimized."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To facilitate DOD\u2019s decision making to meet the demands associated with  the Global War on Terrorism and to increase the availability of skilled  personnel, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense take the following  two actions:  Integrate comprehensive data that identify active and reserve personnel  according to deployment history and skill set, including personnel who are  available to deploy, with DOD\u2019s sourcing process before identifying  combat support and combat service support personnel for the next  rotation to Iraq and Afghanistan.", "Conduct comprehensive, data-driven analyses of options for meeting  potential requirements for future missions to Iraq and Afghanistan.

In addition, the department provided technical comments,  which we incorporated as appropriate. In its comments, DOD expressed  concerns that our report (1) does not fully reflect the complicated task of  providing forces for dynamic operational requirements and (2) subtly  suggests that DOD\u2019s flexibility in meeting operational requirements is a  sign of failed force management practices. It also stated that its use of the  total force, not just the Army, enabled it to meet all combatant  commanders\u2019 requirements to date. In addition, the department stated that  our recommendations should more explicitly recognize and support the  use of the newly developed Defense Readiness Reporting System. It stated  that the total force visibility our recommendations call for exists in that  system and that the Joint Forces Command and the Special Operations  Command should use the detailed, individual-level information in that  system to support their sourcing processes.", "We agree that the process developed to identify forces is very complex.  Our report described the process for identifying forces for Army combat  support and combat service support requirements. Moreover, our report  discussed how DOD has met the demands and how officials used multiple  strategies and relied on the total force to meet requirements for high- demand skills. The report does not make a judgment about the  appropriateness of the outcomes of the sourcing process. Rather, the  report demonstrates that the lack of data complicated the force  identification process, and that force planners did not have visibility over  detailed information on personnel or how current sourcing decisions  would affect the readiness of the force. However, we have modified our  report to reflect that DOD\u2019s effort to integrate personnel deployment and  skill data and readiness information in the new Defense Readiness  Reporting System represents a positive step toward providing the visibility  over personnel and deployment histories that would be useful to force  planners. Although this system has not yet been used to support the  sourcing process, when it reaches full operational capability at the end of  fiscal year 2007 and DOD has completed data validation, it could be a  means to provide visibility over detailed information on personnel to  improve the sourcing process, thereby fulfilling our recommendation. We  have not modified our recommendation to require that DOD use the  Defense Readiness Reporting System in its sourcing process because it is  still in development.", "With respect to our second recommendation that DOD conduct  comprehensive, data-driven analyses of options for meeting continuing  operational requirements, DOD agreed that all options should be  considered and said it is conducting a variety of data-driven analyses to  develop clearer options aimed at better positioning forces to meet current  and future operational requirements.

Using the data,  we compared the number of requirements from U.S. Central Command to  the number of requirements that the Army could meet and determined  whether and to what extent combat support and combat service support  skills initially experienced shortages for the 05-07 and 06-08 rotations. To  identify what strategies the Department of Defense (DOD) took to identify  forces in cases where demand exceeded the initial supply, we examined  the decisions made by officials at the U.S. Joint Forces Command and the  U.S. Special Operations Command as documented in their data. We also  compared the U.S. Central Command\u2019s documents, which identified the  specific capabilities and deployment time frames, to the U.S. Joint Forces  Command and U.S. Special Operations Command data to identify specific  instances where the Army reassigned and retrained its personnel or where  personnel from the other services were reassigned and retrained to  perform Army requirements. We also reviewed the Joint Chiefs of Staff\u2019s  analyses of the U.S. Central Command\u2019s requirement and the actions taken  by DOD to meet the requirements for the 04-06, 05-07, and 06-08 rotations.  Since the U.S. Joint Forces Command did not have complete data on how  the department identified forces for the 04-06 rotation, we attributed the  04-06 sourcing results to the Joint Staff. We met with an official in the  Joint Staff Directorate for Operations to discuss our analysis comparing  the combatant commander\u2019s requirements for the 05-07 rotation to DOD\u2019s  05-07 sourcing decisions to ensure our methodology was comparable to  the Joint Staff official\u2019s analysis. We also discussed our methodology of  analyzing the U.S. Joint Forces Command\u2019s data for the 05-07 and 06-08  rotations with officials in the command\u2019s Joint Deployment Operations  Division. To assess the reliability of the 05-07 and 06-08 rotation data, we  reviewed existing information about the data and the systems that  produced them, interviewed officials knowledgeable about the data, and  performed limited electronic testing.

We also examined DOD  documents that contained information on deployment policies and the  partial mobilization authority to understand how they affect the  availability of active military personnel and reservists for future  deployments. We discussed the implications of DOD\u2019s deployment policies  and the status of identifying forces for rotations by obtaining testimonial  evidence from officials responsible for managing these efforts at DOD  organizations, including, but not limited to, the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness (Readiness,  Programming and Assessment), the Joint Chiefs of Staff Directorate for  Operations, the U.S. Joint Forces Command Joint Deployment Operations  Division, the U.S. Special Operations Command Operations Support  Group, the U.S. Army Special Operations Command Deputy Chief of Staff  for Plans, the U.S. Army\u2019s Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for  Operations and Plans, and the U.S. Army Forces Command Plans Division.  Because it did not fall within the scope of our review, we did not assess  how the forces were trained or will be trained and equipped or the effects  on recruitment and retention as a result of continuing operational needs.  We also observed the Department of the Army\u2019s conference in April 2005  and the U.S. Joint Forces Command/Joint Chiefs of Staff conference in  August 2005 to understand the process used by department officials to  identify combat support and combat service support for the 06-08 rotation.  As part of this effort, we observed working group meetings that were  organized by combat support and combat service support skills to  understand how department officials discussed and developed approaches  to meet the combatant commander\u2019s requirements.

The report  describes in detail the structures developed to identify forces and  identifies and assesses major analytical tools used during the process.  Our report also acknowledges that the department met the combatant  commander\u2019s requirements for the 04-06, 05-07, and 06-08 rotations.  However, we believe that the force identification process could  become more efficient if DOD officials charged with identifying forces  relied on comprehensive data to inform decision making.  2.  We agree with the department that dynamic operational conditions in  Iraq and Afghanistan have made it more difficult for the department to  anticipate the number of forces and the specific skills needed in the  future, and we have added text on pages 1 and 8 to more fully reflect  this challenge.", "DOD stated that as a result of the dynamic operational conditions, the  Joint Forces Command\u2014the DOD agent charged with filling  combatant commanders\u2019 force requirements\u2014used a variety of  strategies, such as reassigning and retraining personnel to new skill  areas (both within the Army and across service lines), capitalizing on  joint solutions in like skill areas. According to DOD\u2019s comments, in  every case, these forces have deployed only after having been fully  certified as prepared for their theater missions and have performed  admirably. Our report extensively described the process for identifying  forces for Army combat support and combat service support  requirements and illustrated in detail how DOD officials used multiple  strategies to meet requirements for high-demand skills. Assessing the  appropriateness of sourcing outcomes and how the forces were  trained were outside the scope of this review.  3.  Our review focused on the Army because of the high-demand skills  that were found predominantly in the Army, such as military police and  civil affairs. We disagree that our report implies that DOD\u2019s flexibility  in meeting uncertain operational requirements is a sign of failed force  management. We point out, however, that as rotations to Iraq and  Afghanistan have continued to require large numbers of ground forces,  data demonstrate that the number of available, trained Army personnel  has declined. According to DOD officials, strategies to meet combatant  commander requirements, such as reassigning and retraining  personnel, present their own challenges, such as costs for new  training. Further, while our draft report recognizes the overall Global  Force Management process, it focuses on the part of that process that  identifies deployable personnel and develops strategies to meet the  combatant commander\u2019s force requirements using available personnel.  4.  We believe that the Defense Readiness Reporting System could be a  mechanism to provide force planners the visibility they need when it is  fully operational. We have updated our report to reflect the status of  the system; however, we did not assess the data reliability of that  system.  5.  We do not make a recommendation as to what system DOD could use  to supply force planners with the data they need for visibility over  personnel skills and deployment histories.
