In 2010, following the December 2009 attempted attack of a U.S.-bound flight, which exposed gaps in how agencies used watchlists to screen individuals, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) began using risk-based criteria to identify additional high-risk passengers who may not be in the Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB), but who should be designated as selectees for enhanced screening. Further, in 2011, TSA began screening against additional identities in the TSDB that are not already included on the No Fly or Selectee Lists. In addition, as part of TSA Pre\u00fcTM, a 2011 program through which TSA designates passengers as low risk for expedited screening, TSA began screening against several new lists of preapproved low-risk travelers. TSA also began conducting TSA Pre\u2713\u2122 risk assessments, an activity distinct from matching against lists that uses the Secure Flight system to assign passengers scores based upon travel-related data, for the purpose of identifying them as low risk for a specific flight.", "TSA has processes in place to implement Secure Flight screening determinations at airport checkpoints, but could take steps to enhance these processes. TSA information from May 2012 through February 2014 indicates that screening personnel have made errors in implementing Secure Flight determinations at the checkpoint. However, TSA does not have a process for systematically evaluating the root causes of these screening errors. GAO's interviews with TSA officials at airports yielded examples of root causes TSA could identify and address. Evaluating the root causes of screening errors, and then implementing corrective measures, in accordance with federal internal control standards, to address those causes could allow TSA to strengthen security screening at airports.", "Since 2009, Secure Flight has established program goals that reflect new program functions to identify additional types of high-risk and also low-risk passengers; however, current program performance measures do not allow Secure Flight to fully assess its progress toward achieving all of its goals. For example, Secure Flight does not have measures to assess the extent of system matching errors. Establishing additional performance measures that adequately indicate progress toward goals would allow Secure Flight to more fully assess the extent to which it is meeting program goals. Furthermore, TSA lacks timely and reliable information on all known cases of Secure Flight system matching errors. More systematic documentation of the number and causes of these cases, in accordance with federal internal control standards, would help TSA ensure Secure Flight is functioning as intended.", "This is a public version of a sensitive report that GAO issued in July 2014.

At the time, these watchlists,  which were intended to identify high-risk individuals, included the No Fly  List, composed of individuals who should be precluded from boarding an  aircraft, and the Selectee List, composed of individuals who should  receive enhanced screening at the airport security checkpoint. After  initiating the development of Secure Flight in August 2004, TSA began  implementing the program in January 2009, and completed transitioning  foreign and domestic air carriers to the program in November 2010.

In May 2009, we reported that after initial challenges, TSA had  made significant strides in developing Secure Flight and that risks  associated with implementing the program had been reduced.  Specifically, we reported on TSA\u2019s progress with respect to system  accuracy, which involves activities to ensure that the Secure Flight  system\u2019s automated matching of passenger and watchlist data correctly  identifies passengers on watchlists. TSA designed the system to identify  passengers who are the subject of watchlist records without producing an  unacceptable number of misidentifications (incorrect matches). We  reported in May 2009 that TSA was in the process of taking steps to test  system accuracy, and without this testing, TSA would lack adequate  assurance that Secure Flight would fully achieve its desired purpose and  operate as intended. Therefore, to ensure the system was achieving its  intended effects, we recommended that TSA periodically assess the  accuracy of the Secure Flight system\u2019s matching capabilities and results.  DHS concurred with our recommendation. In 2012, we reported that TSA  responded to our recommendation by establishing a multidepartmental  Match Review Board and its associated Match Review Board Working  Group to, among other things, review performance measurement results  and recommend changes to improve system performance. Furthermore,  TSA reported plans to periodically assess the extent to which the Secure  Flight system did not identify individuals who are actual matches to the  watchlist.", "In May 2009, we also reported that passengers could attempt to provide  fraudulent information when making an airline reservation to avoid Secure  Flight detection. For example, an individual on the No Fly or Selectee  List could submit identifying information not included on the terrorist  watchlist when making travel arrangements and, using a corresponding  fraudulent identity document (such as a driver\u2019s license), pass through the  security checkpoint undetected.

This information, known collectively as  Secure Flight Passenger Data (SFPD), includes personally identifiable  information, such as full name, gender, date of birth, passport information  (if available), and certain nonpersonally identifiable information, such as  itinerary information and the unique number associated with a travel  record (record number locator).", "Since implementation began in January 2009, the Secure Flight system  has identified high-risk passengers by matching SFPD against the No Fly  List and the Selectee List, subsets of the Terrorist Screening Database  (TSDB), the U.S. government\u2019s consolidated watchlist of known or  suspected terrorists maintained by the Terrorist Screening Center, a  multiagency organization administered by the Federal Bureau of  Investigation (FBI). (We discuss screening activities initiated after TSA began implementing Secure Flight in 2009 later in this report.) To carry  out this matching, the Secure Flight system conducts automated  matching of passenger and watchlist data to identify a pool of passengers  who are potential matches to the No Fly and Selectee Lists. Next, the  system compares all potential matches against the TSA Cleared List, a  list of individuals who have applied to, and been cleared through, the  DHS redress process. Passengers included on the TSA Cleared List  must submit a redress number when making a reservation, which allows  the Secure Flight system to recognize and clear them. After the system  performs automated matching, Secure Flight analysts are to conduct  manual reviews of potential matches, which may involve consulting other  classified and unclassified data sources, to further rule out individuals  who are not those included on the No Fly and Selectee Lists.", "After the completion of manual reviews, TSA precludes passengers who  remain potential matches to certain lists from receiving their boarding  passes. These passengers, for whom air carriers receive a \u201cpassenger  inhibited\u201d message from Secure Flight, must undergo a resolution  process at the airport. This process may involve air carriers sending  updated passenger information back to Secure Flight for automated  rematching or placing a call to Secure Flight for assistance in resolving  the match. At the conclusion of automated and manual screening  processes (including the airport resolution process) air carriers may not  issue a boarding pass to a passenger until they receive from Secure  Flight a final screening determination.

In  the event a walk-through metal detector triggers an alarm, the Advanced  Imaging Technology identifies an anomaly, or the X-ray machine  identifies a suspicious item, additional security measures, such as pat- downs, explosives trace detection searches (which involve a device  certified by TSA to detect explosive particles), or additional physical  searches may ensue as part of the resolution process. Enhanced  screening includes, in addition to the procedures applied during a typical  standard screening experience, a pat-down and an explosives trace  detection search or physical search of the interior of the passenger\u2019s  accessible property, electronics, and footwear. Expedited screening  typically includes walk-through metal detector screening and X-ray  screening of the passenger\u2019s accessible property, but unlike in standard  screening, travelers do not have to, among other things, remove their  belts, shoes, or light outerwear.

In 2012, TSA  piloted a joint CAT/BPSS technology from three vendors at a cost of $4.4  million.

However, our prior work and current program  documentation show that the Secure Flight program has used proxy  methods to assess the extent to which the system is missing passengers  on watchlists. For example, we reported in May 2009 that when the  Secure Flight system was under development, TSA conducted a series of  tests\u2014using a simulated passenger list and a simulated watchlist created  by a TSA contractor with expertise in watchlist matching\u2014to measure the  extent to which Secure Flight did not identify all simulated watchlist  records.

The minutes show that Secure Flight, when  contemplating a change in the system\u2019s search capabilities, measures the  impacts of proposed changes on system performance, including the  extent to which the changes result in failures to identify watchlisted  individuals. To make these assessments, Secure Flight rematches  historical passenger data and watchlist data under proposed system  changes, and compares the results with prior Secure Flight screening  outcomes to determine whether any previously identified individuals on  high-risk lists were missed. While helpful for Match Review Board  deliberations, the testing reflected in meeting minutes was performed on  an ad hoc basis and therefore is not a substitute for ongoing performance  measurement.", "In addition, with respect to low-risk lists, TSA could measure the extent to  which the Secure Flight system correctly identifies passengers submitting  valid known traveler numbers (i.e., an actual number on a TSA Pre\uf0fcTM  list) and designates them for expedited screening. TSA officials have  stated that variations in the way passengers enter information when  making a reservation with a valid known traveler number can cause the  system to fail to identify them as TSA Pre\uf0fcTM eligible. For example, TSA  Match Review Board documentation from December 2012 identified that  the Secure Flight system had failed to identify participants on one TSA  Pre\uf0fcTM list because they used honorific titles (e.g., the Honorable and  Senator) when making reservations, and, as a result, they were not  eligible for expedited screening.TSA has a process in place to review and  resolve inquiries from passengers who believe they should have received  TSA Pre\uf0fcTM but did not during a recent travel experience.helpful for addressing some TSA Pre\uf0fcTM-related problems, the process  does not provide information on the extent to which TSA is correctly  identifying passengers on low-risk lists, because some passengers may  not report problems.", "TSA\u2019s fourth goal (to minimize the number of passengers misidentified as  threats on high-risk lists) also addresses system accuracy.

Although GPRA\u2019s requirements apply at  the agency level, in our prior work, we have reported that these  requirements can serve as leading practices at lower levels within an  organization, such as individual programs or initiatives, through a review  of our related products, OMB guidance, and studies by the National  Academy of Public Administration and the Urban Institute. We also  interviewed relevant TSA officials about the current performance  measures for the Secure Flight program and the adequacy of these  measures in assessing TSA\u2019s progress in achieving program goals.", "In addition, to understand how TSA uses Secure Flight-related  performance data, we reviewed documentation related to all meetings  that TSA identified of the Secure Flight Match Review Board\u2014a  multidepartmental entity established to, among other things, review  performance measures and recommend changes to improve system  performance\u2014from the time was the board was initiated, in March 2010,  through August 2013, a total of 51 meetings. To identify the extent to  which TSA monitors and evaluates the reasons for any Secure Flight  system matching errors, we analyzed a list of such errors that occurred  from November 2010 (the point at which the Secure Flight program was  implemented for all covered domestic and foreign air carriers) through  July 2013 that TSA compiled at our request. To assess the accuracy and  completeness of the list TSA provided, we also checked to see if system  matching errors we identified in documentation from the Match Review  Board meetings were included in TSA\u2019s list. We evaluated TSA\u2019s efforts  to document system matching errors against standards for information  and communications identified in GAO\u2019s Standards for Internal Control in  the Federal Government.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2013 to September  2014 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Secure Flight Screening Lists and Activities", "paragraphs": ["In January 2009, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) began  implementing the Secure Flight program to facilitate the identification of  high-risk passengers who may pose security risks to civil aviation, and  designate them for additional screening at airport checkpoints. Since  then, TSA has begun using Secure Flight to identify low-risk passengers  eligible for more efficient processing at the checkpoint. This appendix  presents an overview of the lists and other activities as of July 2013 that  Secure Flight uses to identify passengers as high risk or low risk. The  Secure Flight program, as implemented pursuant to the 2008 Secure  Flight Final Rule, requires commercial aircraft operators traveling to, from,  within, or overflying the United States to collect information from  passengers and transmit that information electronically to TSA. The  Secure Flight system uses this information to screen passengers by  conducting computerized matching against government lists and other  risk assessment activities. As a result of this screening, passengers  identified as high risk receive enhanced screening, which includes, in  addition to the procedures applied during a typical standard screening  experience, a pat-down and either an explosive trace detection search  involving a device certified by TSA to detect explosive particles or a  physical search of the interior of the passenger\u2019s accessible property,  electronics, and footwear. Those passengers Secure Flight identifies as  low risk are eligible to receive expedited screening, which unlike standard  screening, affords travelers certain conveniences, such as not having to  remove their belts, shoes, or light outerwear when screened.", "Figure 3 provides information on the lists Secure Flight uses to identify  high-risk passengers. Figure 4 describes Secure Flight\u2019s activities to  identify low-risk passengers, including screening against lists associated  with the TSA Pre\uf0fcTM Program, a 2011 initiative that allows TSA to  designate preapproved passengers as low risk, and TSA Pre\u2713\u2122 risk  assessments, which assess passengers\u2019 risk using data submitted to  Secure Flight for screening.

With respect to matching  passengers against lists, the Secure Flight computer system first  conducts automated matching of passenger and watchlist data to identify  a pool of passengers who are potential matches to various lists. Next, the  system compares all potential matches against the TSA Cleared List, a  list of individuals who have applied to, and been cleared through, the  DHS redress process. Passengers included on the TSA Cleared List  submit a redress number when making a reservation, which allows the  Secure Flight system to recognize and clear them.performs automated matching, Secure Flight analysts conduct manual  reviews of potential matches to further rule out individuals who are not  included on the No Fly and Selectee Lists.", "After the completion of manual reviews, TSA precludes passengers who  remain potential matches to certain lists from receiving their boarding  passes. These passengers, for whom air carriers receive a \u201cpassenger  inhibited\u201d message from Secure Flight, must undergo a resolution  process at the airport. This process may involve air carriers sending  updated passenger information back to Secure Flight for automated  rematching or placing a call to Secure Flight for assistance in resolving  the match. At the conclusion of automated and manual screening  processes, Secure Flight provides air carriers with a final screening  determination for each passenger. At airport checkpoints, those  passengers identified as high risk receive enhanced screening and those  identified as low risk are eligible for expedited screening."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Maria Strudwick (Assistant  Director), Mona Nichols Blake (Analyst-in-Charge), John de Ferrari,  Michele Fejfar, Imoni Hampton, Eric Hauswirth, Susan Hsu, Richard  Hung, Justine Lazaro, Benjamin Licht, Tom Lombardi, Linda Miller, David  Plocher, and Ashley Vaughan made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
