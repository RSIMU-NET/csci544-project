Despite increased eradication and other U.S. efforts, the poppy crop grew by 50 percent in 2006 to a record level. However, many projects have not been in place long enough to assess progress toward the overall goal of significantly reducing drug cultivation, production, and trafficking. For example, projects to provide rural credit and to field teams to discourage poppy cultivation were not in place prior to the 2005-2006 growing season. The worsening security situation and the lack of Afghan capacity are tremendous challenges to the success of U.S. counternarcotics programs in Afghanistan. The security situation continues to decline; during the 2005-2006 growing season, eradicators were attacked several times and alternative livelihoods project personnel were killed. Moreover, due to Afghanistan's lack of infrastructure, educated populace, and functioning governmental institutions, significantly reducing poppy cultivation and drug trafficking is expected to take at least a decade. USAID and State have made efforts to oversee the use of funds, including the use of self certifications, contract clauses, and vetting, when applicable. However, a lack of official records and reliable information limited efforts to vet Afghan nationals.

To combat opium poppy cultivation,  drug trafficking, and their negative effects on Afghan stability and pursuit  of democracy, in 2005, the U.S. government, working with allied  governments, developed a five-pillared counternarcotics strategy  addressing (1) alternative livelihoods, (2) elimination and eradication, (3)  interdiction, (4) law enforcement and justice reform, and (5) public  information. The overall goal of the strategy is to significantly reduce  Afghanistan\u2019s poppy cultivation, drug production, and drug trafficking.

Opium  poppy, as seen in figure 1, is an annual crop with a six to seven month  planting cycle that starts earlier in the south and later in the north of  Afghanistan. It is planted between September and December and flowers  approximately three months after planting. After the flower\u2019s petals fall  away, the opium, an opaque, milky sap found in the plant\u2019s seed capsule, is  harvested between April and July. The sap can then be refined into  morphine and heroin. United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime  (UNODC) surveys indicate that the primary deterrent to farmers growing  poppy is the threat of eradication. The majority of eradication takes place  after the poppy plant has sprouted and before it is harvested,  approximately a two-month long period.", "According to UNODC, in the three-year period, 2002 through 2004,  Afghanistan\u2019s opium harvest increased substantially. In 2005, the number  of hectares of opium poppy cultivation declined by over 20 percent, yet the  crop yield per hectare rose because of favorable weather conditions. Thus,  the estimated amount of potential opium produced declined only slightly.  In 2006, poppy cultivation increased to 165,000 hectares, yielding a record  poppy crop estimated at a potential 6,100 metric tons of opium, or more  than 90 percent of the world\u2019s illicit opium (see table 1).", "State attributed the reduction in cultivation in 2005 to surplus opium from  previous years, public information efforts by President Karzai and others,  promised alternative livelihoods assistance, and farmers\u2019 fears of  eradication. However, eradication fears were not realized; only an  estimated 5,100 hectares of poppy were eradicated. Further, drug-related  corruption is a problem at all levels of government and remains pervasive  at the provincial and district levels. Conversely, the reasons for the growth  in 2006 cultivation are not fully known, but U.S. officials described a  combination of factors, including the relatively small amount of  eradication in 2005 and pressure from traffickers and the Taliban on  farmers to grow. For example, U.S. officials said that in southern  Afghanistan, farmers reported finding \u201cnight letters\u201d from the Taliban left  on their doors threatening them if they did not cultivate poppy.

The United States used  these funds to train Afghan narcotics interdiction units, construct border  and highway checkpoint facilities, and supply operational support and  nonlethal equipment to Afghan eradication teams. These efforts failed to  have any significant effect on the illicit narcotics industry because of  limited security and stability across Afghanistan. As a result, the U.S.  government made counternarcotics a top priority and developed a strategy  in 2004 to reduce poppy cultivation, drug production, and trafficking. This  new strategy is comprised of five pillars, as illustrated in figure 2. The five- pillar counternarcotics plan is intended to offer incentives to stop the  growing of opium poppy through alternative livelihoods projects,  combined with strong disincentives in the form of forced eradication,  interdiction, and law enforcement, while spreading the Afghan  government\u2019s antinarcotics message.

However, the  Afghan government would not allow the use of herbicides. Consequently,  the United States and Afghanistan rely on manual eradication, such as  police on foot using sticks, sickles, and scythes to knock or cut down  poppy, and mechanized eradication, which involves police using tractors,  all-terrain vehicles, and other vehicles to drive over or plow up the poppy.  USAID also modified some of its projects to specifically focus on  counternarcotics in those provinces where opium poppy cultivation was  greatest.

In all the regions, similar  types of labor intensive, cash-for-work projects were implemented, such  as road repair, as illustrated in figure 4, and irrigation and drainage canal  rehabilitation. The contractors in each region were supposed to develop  longer-term projects more suited to their provinces. A key element of  these efforts was to develop industry \u201cclusters.\u201d For example, dairy,  poultry, and livestock industries were associated with feed development  and production; veterinary services; and milk, meat, and egg products  being packaged, processed, and stored.

Also, in  Nangarhar and Laghman, fruit and nut trees were planted on some 1,500  hectares of former poppy-producing land.", "The deteriorating security situation, the lack of infrastructure, and, in  northern Afghanistan, bad weather all contributed to delays in  implementing the alternative livelihoods projects. Contractors often  reported the security situation in a particular district or area forced them  to suspend projects for weeks or months at a time. For example, in May  2005, four Afghan subcontractors working on cash-for-work projects in the  south were killed, which led the USAID contractor to leave the area until  September 2005. Contractors and potential investors cited the lack of  adequate roads and electricity as deterrents to investors. For example, the  poor condition of the road leading into Badakshan made it difficult to  obtain the use of heavy machinery for construction and other projects, as  many contractors were unable or unwilling to transport such equipment  there.

These efforts were intended  to address the challenges faced by the AEF\u2019s predecessor, the Central  Poppy Eradication Force (CPEF). According to State officials, the CPEF\u2019s  operational procedures and lack of mobility made getting the force into  the field and supplying it difficult. For example, a senior State official  stated that because the CPEF operated as one large unit and traveled in  convoys on the roads, impassable roads slowed or stopped their getting  out to planned locations. Moreover, because the CPEF lacked logistical  support, they had to return to Kabul to re-supply. In 2005, UNODC  reported, but did not verify, that the CPEF eradicated about 210 hectares  of opium poppy and the Afghan National Police eradicated about 890  hectares.", "After the 2005 season, the CPEF was renamed the AEF and reorganized  into four smaller and more mobile units of 150 counternarcotics police  each. One half of this police force provided security while the rest served  as eradicators and support. The teams could be deployed in multiple areas  of the country simultaneously. In order to carry out its eradication efforts,  the force was expected to have the mobility to get into the field and the  logistics to remain there. State paid for a \u201cwet lease\u201d of four Russian- made aircraft and the purchase and operating costs of ten U.S. Huey-II  helicopters (see fig. 5). The leased aircraft were used primarily for troop  and cargo transport to support reconnaissance, establish camps, and  deploy the AEF, while the Huey-II helicopters provided enhanced security,  reconnaissance, and medical evacuation capacity, as well as limited  personnel and cargo transport for the AEF. The aircraft were also used to  provide additional lift and transport support to the PEP teams and  embassy personnel.

Although the AEF eradicated over ten times the amount eradicated by the  CPEF in 2005, its initial deployment was delayed. According to USAID and  State officials, the governor of Helmand wanted additional alternative  livelihoods projects in place before allowing the AEF to begin working.  Moreover, State officials stated that because of the security risks in  Helmand, the AEF needed the Afghan National Police and Afghan National  Army to provide security. However, coordinating their efforts to assist the  AEF proved time-consuming. The combination of these challenges pushed  the AEF\u2019s fielding date back from early February 2006 until late March  2006. Because most poppy growth occurs over a two-month period, the  AEF\u2019s fielding delay prevented them from eradicating as much as it might  have had it been fielded in February, as intended.", "State provided $6 million for equipment and training to provincial  authorities to conduct eradication activities and $24 million to create  seven provincial PEP teams to discourage poppy cultivation in the  provinces where it is most prevalent\u2014Badakshan, Balkh, Farah, Helmand,  Kandahar, Nangarhar, and Oruzgan. Beginning in 2003, at the initiative of  President Karzai, provincial governors were given the responsibility for  carrying out their own eradication efforts with the financial support of the  central government and donors. In 2005, governor-led eradication was  responsible for more eradication than the central government\u2019s efforts.  UNODC reported and verified about 4,000 hectares of governor-led  eradication.", "In response to the larger amount of eradication conducted by governors  than the central government in 2005, State decided to increase support for  provincial authorities by reimbursing governor-led eradication efforts and  creating the PEP teams. In 2006, State began to reimburse provincial  authorities for their eradication expenses at a rate of $60 per hectare of  UNODC-verified eradication. However, when UNODC was not able to  verify provincial efforts, the governor was reimbursed based on his  submitted expenses. According to State officials, they also wanted to  enhance governor efforts to eliminate poppy cultivation by creating the  PEP teams attached to the offices of the seven provincial governors where  poppy cultivation was greatest. The teams were planned to consist of  seven Afghan advisors hired by the Afghan Ministry of Counter Narcotics  and two international advisors hired by the United States. PEP teams were  to assist the provincial governors in discouraging farmers from growing  poppy and encouraging farmers to eradicate their own poppy fields by  coordinating antinarcotics public information messages, ensuring delivery  of assistance projects from all donors, and assisting with verification of  reported eradication. These teams were also designed to be closely  integrated with the public information campaign by helping to identify  local messages and local leaders to assist with the campaign, as well as to  assist central government counternarcotics efforts by reporting on any  obstacles that inhibit achieving provincial poppy reduction goals.", "Even though the PEP teams were not fully fielded, governor-led  eradication, according to UNODC, more than tripled in 2006, to an  estimated 13,050 hectares. Governor-led eradication took place in 19  provinces and was again responsible for more eradication than central  eradication forces. Each PEP team was intended to be fully staffed and  provided security and housing by the end of 2005, however State did not  fully field the PEP teams because its contractor was unable to hire all of  the international advisors and supply each team with the required security,  housing, and equipment in time for the 2005 growing season. As of June  2006, 11 of 14 international PEP advisors had been hired. Moreover, the  Afghan government did not hire all the required Afghan nationals to staff  each team.

For  example, in Nangarhar, monitoring staff must provide U.S. commanders  96-hours notice for trips outside the military camp, and these trips can be  cancelled at any time if sufficient military personnel are not available to  provide security. Poor infrastructure limits the ability to monitor projects.  In northern Afghanistan, many roads are impassable during the winter  months.
