This is GAO's third report in response to the LDA's requirement for GAO to annually (1) determine the extent to which lobbyists can demonstrate compliance with the LDA by providing support for information on their registrations and reports, (2) identify challenges and potential improvements to compliance for registered lobbyists, and (3) describe the efforts the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia (the Office) has made to improve its enforcement of the LDA. GAO reviewed a random sample of 134 lobbying disclosure reports filed from the fourth quarter of calendar year 2008 through the third quarter of calendar year 2009. GAO also selected two random samples of federal political campaign contributions reports from year-end 2008 through midyear 2009. GAO sampled 100 reports listing contributions and 100 reports listing no contributions. This methodology allowed GAO to generalize to the population of 53,756 disclosure reports, 10,928 contributions reports, and 22,572 reports with no contributions. GAO also met with officials from the Office regarding efforts to focus resources on lobbyists who fail to comply with the LDA."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["While there are no specific requirements for lobbyists to create or maintain documentation related to disclosure reports they file under the LDA, GAO's review showed that lobbyists were generally able to provide documentation, although in varying degrees, to support items in their disclosure reports. This finding is similar to GAO's results from last year's review. For income and expenses, two key elements of the reports, GAO estimates that lobbyists could provide written documentation for approximately 89 percent of the disclosure reports. After GAO's review, 15 lobbyists stated that they planned to amend their disclosure reports to make corrections on one or more data elements. As of March 18, 2010, 7 of the 15 amended their disclosure reports to make these corrections. For political contribution reports, GAO estimates that 82 percent of the reports listing contributions could be supported by Federal Elections Commission (FEC) data or documentation provided by lobbyists. Among reports with no contributions listed, an estimated minimum of 3 percent of reports omitted one or more contributions that should have been reported. All of the lobbyists said that they did not report the information listed in the FEC database because of an oversight and plan to amend their reports. The majority of lobbyists who newly registered with the Secretary of the Senate and Clerk of the House of Representatives in the last quarter of 2008 and first three quarters of 2009 filed required disclosure reports for the period. GAO could not identify corresponding reports on file for lobbying activity for about 11 percent of the registrants, likely because either reports were not filed or the reports that were filed contained information, such as client names, that did not match the registrations. The Secretary of the Senate and Clerk of the House routinely review the completeness of registrations and reports and follow up with lobbyists. Most lobbyists felt that existing guidance for filing required registrations and reports was sufficient. However, GAO's review of documentation and lobbyists' statements indicates some opportunities to strengthen lobbyists' understanding of the requirements. The Secretary of the Senate and Clerk of the House update guidance periodically to respond to issues and comments as they arise. In response to an earlier GAO recommendation, the Office developed a system to help monitor and track enforcement efforts. The Office continues to refine the system to meet the requirements conveyed in GAO's recommendation. To enforce compliance, the Office primarily focuses on sending letters to lobbyists who potentially violated the LDA by not filing disclosure reports. No civil actions or settlements with lobbyists have been pursued by the Office since 2005, although it is following up on hundreds of referrals each year."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Questions regarding the influence of special interests in the formation of  government policy have led to a move toward more transparency and  accountability with regard to the lobbying community.

The LDA as amended requires GAO to audit the extent of  lobbyists\u2019 compliance with the requirements of the LDA by reviewing a  random sampling of publicly available lobbying registrations and reports  filed during each calendar year. GAO\u2019s report must also include  recommendations related to improving lobbyists\u2019 compliance with the  LDA and report on resources and authorities available to the Department  of Justice for effective enforcement of the LDA.

The first sample  contains 100 LD-203 reports selected from a total of 10,928 reports that  have contributions listed, and the second sample contains 100 LD-203  reports selected from a total of 22,572 reports that list no contributions.  The randomly sampled reports were selected from the publicly  downloadable contributions database maintained by the Clerk of the  House. In instances where an entry in the LD-203 report could not be  confirmed by information reported in the FEC database, either because  the data did not match or the contribution was not required to be  disclosed to the FEC, we contacted lobbyists and asked them to  provide documentation, information, or both to clarify differences we  observed.

Under the LDA, lobbyists are required to  file their registrations and reports electronically with the Secretary of the  Senate and the Clerk of the House through a single entry point. The LDA  also provides that registrations and reports must be available in  downloadable, searchable databases from the Secretary of the Senate and  the Clerk of the House.", "The LDA defines a \u201clobbyist\u201d as an individual who is employed or retained  by a client for compensation who has made more than one lobbying  contact (written or oral communication to a covered executive or  legislative branch official made on behalf of a client) and whose lobbying  activities represent at least 20 percent of the time that he or she spends  on behalf of the client during the quarter. Lobbying firms are persons or  entities that have one or more employees who are lobbyists on behalf of a  client other than that person or entity.", "Lobbying firms are required to file a registration with the Secretary of the  Senate and the Clerk of the House for each client if the lobbying firm  receives over $3,000 in income from that client for lobbying activities.  Lobbyists are also required to submit a quarterly report, an LD-2 report,  for each registration filed. The registration and subsequent LD-2 reports  must disclose  the name of the organization, lobbying firm, or self-employed individual  that is lobbying on that client\u2019s behalf;    a list of individuals who acted as lobbyists on behalf of the client  during the reporting period;    whether any lobbyists served as covered executive branch or  legislative branch officials in the previous 20 years;  the name of and further information about the client, including a  general description of its business or activities;  information on the general issue area and specific lobbying issues;    any foreign entities that have an interest in the client;  the client\u2019s status as a state or local government;  information on which federal agencies and house(s) of Congress the  lobbyist contacted on behalf of the client during the reporting period;  the amount of income related to lobbying activities received from the  client (or expenses for organizations with in-house lobbyists) during  the quarter rounded to the nearest $10,000; and    a list of constituent organizations that contribute more than $5,000 for  lobbying in a quarter and actively participate in planning, supervising,  or controlling lobbying activities, if the client is a coalition or  association.", "The LDA also requires lobbyists to report certain contributions  semiannually in the contributions report, or the LD-203 report. These  reports must be filed 30 days after the end of a semiannual period by each  organization registered to lobby and by each individual listed as a lobbyist  on an organization\u2019s lobbying reports. The lobbyists or organizations must  list the name of each federal candidate or officeholder, leadership political  action committee, or political party committee to which they made  contributions equal to or exceeding $200 in the aggregate during the  semiannual period. The lobbyists or organizations must also report  contributions made to presidential library foundations and presidential  inaugural committees. In addition, the lobbyists or organizations must  report funds contributed to pay the cost of an event to honor or recognize  a covered official, funds paid to an entity named for or controlled by a  covered official, and contributions to a person or entity in recognition of  an official or to pay the costs of a meeting or other event held by or in the  name of a covered official. Finally, the LD-203 report requires lobbyists or  organizations to certify that they have read and are familiar with the gift  and travel rules of the Senate and House and that they have not provided,  requested, or directed a gift or travel to a member, officer, or employee of  Congress that would violate those rules. Each individual lobbyist and  organization must file a LD-203 report each period and certify compliance  with the gift and travel rules, even if there are no contributions to report.", "The Office is responsible for the enforcement of the LDA. The Office  fulfills its administrative responsibilities by researching and responding to  referrals of noncomplying lobbyists submitted by the Secretary of the  Senate and Clerk of the House.

The officials said that the new system is designed to provide a  more structured approach for assigning resources and to better focus  lobbying disclosure compliance enforcement efforts. The new system is  intended to track and record enforcement activities, record the status and  disposition of lobbyists\u2019 cases, provide automated alerts to ensure timely  follow-up and monitoring, provide the ability to track those who  continually fail to comply with the LDA, and use data to report statistical  trends to track the effectiveness of enforcement activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Documentation Supporting Reporting Requirements Varied", "paragraphs": ["Neither the LDA nor guidance requires lobbyists to maintain records or  documentation to support information disclosed in their reports. However,  similar to our findings in last year\u2019s review, most lobbyists reporting  $5,000 or more in income or expenses were able to provide written  support for certain elements of individual activity reports we examined.  For example, most lobbyists were able to provide documentation to  support income or expenses related elements of their reports. We estimate  that lobbyists could provide written documentation for income or  expenses for an estimated 88 percent of the disclosure reports for the  fourth quarter of 2008 and the first three quarters of 2009. Lobbyists for  all but 11 of the 112 reports that we reviewed from our sample that  reported income and all but 5 of the 22 sampled reports with lobbying  expenses provided some form of documentation for the dollar amounts  reported. The most common form of income documentation provided was  invoices (an estimated 68 percent of all reports with income), followed by  contracts (an estimated 24 percent of all reports with income). Also, we  estimate that lobbying firms were able to provide documentation that all  lobbyists listed on the disclosure report were employed as lobbyists at the  lobbying firm during the reporting period for an estimated 89 percent of  reports that required this information.", "More than half of lobbyists in our sample were able to provide  documentation to support all of the entities they reportedly lobbied during  the reporting period. Lobbyists are required to disclose if they lobbied  covered officials at the House of Representatives, the Senate, one or more  executive branch agencies, or a combination of these entities. For close to  three quarters of reports disclosing House or Senate lobbying activity (an  estimated 70 percent), lobbyists had documentation to support the House  and Senate lobbying contacts they disclosed. However, lobbyists that  reported contacts with agencies were only able to provide documentation  for about half of reports (31 of 66 reports we reviewed) to support the  agency lobbying contacts they reported in the disclosure reports. Too few  reports in our sample disclosed foreign entities, affiliated organizations,  and the names of individuals no longer acting as lobbyists to provide  reliable estimates of levels of written documentation in support of the  reports that required this information.", "Lobbyists did not disclose covered official positions previously held by  individual lobbyists on at least 6 of the 131 applicable reports we  reviewed. Based on this information, we estimate that a minimum of 2  percent of all disclosure reports fail to fully disclose whether the  individual lobbyists for a specific client held a covered official position.  Lobbyists gave several reasons for not including previously held covered  official positions, typically indicating that they misunderstood the  requirements or did not realize the position held qualified as a covered  official position.", "To correct errors or omissions, 12 lobbyists amended 12 of the 134  disclosure reports in our sample prior to our review. Additionally, 15  lobbyists indicated that they planned to amend their disclosure reports  after our review. As of March 18, 2010, 7 of the 15 lobbyists had amended  their disclosure reports. Indicating that a lobbyist held a covered official  position, changing income or expense amounts, or disclosing a foreign  entity were the most commonly cited reasons for filing amendments.", "Although the LDA and guidance do not require lobbyists to maintain  records or documentation to support information disclosed in their  reports, many of the lobbyists we spoke with had systems to track  lobbying contacts and the amount of time spent on lobbying activities. In  an estimated 79 percent of reports (106 of 134 we reviewed), lobbyists  reported having a method or system in place to track lobbying contacts  and activities. We estimate that 57 percent of all reports with tracking  methods monitored actual time spent lobbying on behalf of the client as a  means of tracking lobbying activities. In addition, we estimate that  meetings were tracked to support the information in 75 percent of reports  where a tracking system was used, e-mails for 53 percent of reports where  a tracking system was used, and telephone conversations to identify and  document the work the lobbyist performed on behalf of a client for 49  percent of reports where a tracking system was used.", "As previously noted, all individual lobbyists and organizations reporting  specific lobbying activity are required to file LD-203 reports each period,  even if they have no contributions to report, because they must certify  compliance with the gift and travel rules. As part of our LD-2 report  analysis, we checked the House database to ensure that each lobbyist and  organization listed on the LD-2 report filed an LD-203 report during the  reporting period. For an estimated 84 percent of lobbying reports where  this information was required (110 of the 131 applicable reports in our  sample), the LD-203 reports were filed as required by both the lobbyists  and the lobbying firms during the reporting periods in question. Some  lobbyists told us that the guidance on the LD-203 report was confusing.

Lobbyists or lobbying firms could support all listed contributions with  documentation for approximately 82 percent (82 of 100) of the  contribution reports listing contributions that we reviewed. Of the 100  contribution reports in our sample listing no contributions, we confirmed  that 97 did not have clearly corresponding contributions listed in the FEC  database during the reporting period, while 3 (or 3 percent) of the reports  we reviewed that did not list any contributions failed to list at least one  donation that should have been disclosed.

However, our review of lobbyists\u2019 documentation and some lobbyists\u2019  statements highlights areas of inconsistency in reporting information on  the LD-2 report and the LD-203 report. For example, our review identified  that lobbyists in our sample inconsistently reported \u201ccovered official  positions\u201d previously held by individuals. As stated earlier, covered official  positions are either an elected member of either house of Congress, an  employee of a member or a committee, or certain high-level positions in  the executive branch.", "Guidance published by the Clerk of the House and Secretary of the Senate  advises registrants to disclose new lobbyists who are not listed on a client  registration on the quarterly disclosure report and include any covered  executive or legislative branch official positions the new lobbyists held  within 20 years of that filing. Several lobbyists in our sample disclosed  their covered official positions in a variety of ways. While guidance only  directs filers to list the covered official positions on forms denoting the  lobbyists as new lobbyists, in several reports in our sample lobbyists  reported covered official positions on more than one LD-2 report, even if a  lobbyist was not listed as \u201cnew.\u201d A few other lobbying firms amended the  lobbying LD-1 to include new lobbyists in addition to new or previously  undisclosed covered official positions and therefore left subsequent  quarterly disclosure reports blank. Lobbyists told us that they were  unclear about the frequency with which they had to disclose their covered  official position, specifically, whether they had to disclose the covered  official position on the LD-1, the LD-2 report, or both. The LDA and  lobbying guidance direct lobbyists to disclose covered official positions on  either the initial client registration (LD-1) or on subsequent LD-2 quarterly  reports as lobbyists are added. In addition, some lobbyists cited difficulty  determining whether the previous positions held within the executive or  legislative branches were covered positions.", "In addition, several lobbyists told us that they were unsure about when  and how to terminate lobbyists from LD-2 reports. House and Senate  guidance directs registrants to list terminated lobbyists, or lobbyists no  longer expected to act as lobbyists for a given client, in line 23 of the LD-2  report. Several lobbyists indicated that they were not sure if they needed  to terminate a lobbyist who did not actively lobby on behalf of a client for  a given reporting period, or if they only needed to terminate lobbyists  when they were certain the lobbyists would not lobby for the client at all  in the future. The guidance states that a lobbyist can be left off an LD-2  report (without being terminated) if the lobbyist did not meet the LDA\u2019s  definition of lobbyist for that client in the current or next quarter. The  guidance advises that lobbyists should be terminated if the lobbyists are  no longer expected to lobby on behalf of that client in the future, as the  lobbyists job duties, assignment, or employment status changes.", "Lobbyists also told us that they found meeting the deadline for filing  disclosure reports difficult because of administrative constraints. The  deadline for filing disclosure reports is 20 days after each reporting period,  or the first business day after the 20th day if the 20th day is not a business  day. Prior to enactment of the HLOGA, the deadline for filing disclosure  reports was 45 days after the end of each reporting period.

The letters request that the lobbyists  comply with the law and promptly file the appropriate disclosure  documents. Resolution typically involves the lobbyists coming into  compliance. In response to the 653 letters sent by the Office in 2007, 2008,  and 2009, 163 lobbyists have come into compliance. Because there is a  time lapse between when the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the  House send the first contact letters and when they make referrals to the  Office, lobbyists may have responded to the contact letters from the  Secretary of the Senate and Clerk of the House after referrals have been  received by the Office. As a result, the Office reviews the Secretary of the  Senate and Clerk of the House databases to determine whether a lobbyist  has already resolved the compliance issue before sending out its own  letters. In addition, the Office attempts to verify the lobbyist\u2019s address  when letters are returned or no response is received. Table 5 shows the  status of enforcement actions as a result of noncompliance letters the  Office sent to lobbyists.", "In our 2008 lobbying disclosure report, we noted that the Office had  settled with three lobbyists and collected civil penalties totaling about  $47,000 in 2005. All of the settled cases involved a failure to file. Since then  no additional settlements or civil actions have been pursued, although the  Office is following up on hundreds of referrals each year. Also in our 2009  lobbying disclosure report, we reported that the Office had identified six  lobbyists whose names appeared frequently in the referrals and sent them  letters more targeted toward repeat nonfilers. Four of these lobbyists have  resolved their noncompliance issues, and the Office continues to consider  further enforcement actions for the other two. Officials from the Office  stated that they plan to begin using information from the Chronic  Offenders Report generated by their tracking and monitoring system to  begin targeting additional repeat nonfilers in the summer."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft statement of the facts contained in this report to the  Department of Justice (DOJ) for review and comment.

To assess whether these disclosure  data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report, we reviewed  relevant documentation and spoke to officials responsible for maintaining  the data. Although registrations and reports are filed through a single Web  portal, each chamber subsequently receives copies of the data and follows  different data cleaning, processing, and editing procedures before storing  the data in either individual files (in the House) or databases (in the  Senate). Currently, there is no means of reconciling discrepancies between  the two databases that result from chamber differences in data processing.  For example, Senate staff told us that they set aside a greater proportion  of registration and report submissions than the House for manual review  before entering the information into the database, and as a result, the  Senate database would be slightly less current than the House database on  any given day pending review and clearance. House staff told us that they  rely heavily on automated processing, and that while they manually review  reports that do not perfectly match information on file for a given  registrant or client, they will approve and upload such reports as originally  filed by each lobbyist even if the reports contain errors or discrepancies  (such as a variant on how a name is spelled). Nevertheless, we do not have  reason to believe that the content of the House and Senate systems would  vary substantially. While we determined that both the House and Senate  disclosure data were sufficiently reliable for identifying a sample of  quarterly disclosure reports (LD-2 reports) and for assessing whether  newly filed registrants also filed required reports, we chose to use data  from the Clerk of the House for sampling LD-2 reports from the last  quarter of 2008, first three quarters of 2009, as well as for year-end 2008  and midyear 2009 contributions reports (LD-203 reports), and finally for  matching quarterly registrations with filed reports. We did not evaluate the  Offices of the Secretary of the Senate or the Clerk of the House\u2014both of  which have key roles in the lobbying disclosure process\u2014although we met  with officials from each office, and they provided us with general  background information at our request and detailed information on data  processing procedures.", "To assess the extent to which lobbyists could provide evidence of their  compliance with reporting requirements, we examined a systematic  random sample of 134 LD-2 reports. We excluded reports with no income  or with income and expenses less than $5,000 from our sampling frame  and drew our sample from 53,756 activity reports filed for the last quarter  of 2008 and the first three quarters of 2009 available in the public House  database, as of our final download date for each quarter. There are 3 LD-2  reports in the total sample that indicated \u201cno lobbying activity\u201d but listed  lobbying income for the quarter. We conducted reviews of these reports  because the income was disclosed in accordance with LDA reporting  requirements, but since \u201cno lobbying activity\u201d was indicated, lobbyists  were not required to provide information for all reporting elements on the  LD-2 report. Therefore, in certain calculations these 3 reports are excluded  from the sample. Our sample is based on a systematic random selection,  and it is only one of a large number of samples that we might have drawn.  We sorted firms by the number of LD-2 reports they filed and then drew a  systematic sample of LD-2 reports to ensure that our sample contained  reports from firms of all sizes. Because each sample could have provided  different estimates, we express our confidence in the precision of our  particular sample\u2019s results as a 95 percent confidence interval. This is the  interval that would contain the actual population value for 95 percent of  the samples that we could have drawn. All percentage estimates in this  report have 95 percent confidence intervals of within plus or minus 9.7  percentage points of the estimate itself, unless otherwise noted. When  estimating compliance with certain of the elements we examined, we base  our estimate on a one-sided 95 percent confidence interval to generate a  conservative estimate of either the minimum or maximum percentage of  reports in the population exhibiting the characteristic.", "We contacted all the lobbyists and lobbying firms in our sample and asked  them to provide support for key elements in their reports, including  the amount of income reported for lobbying activities,  the amount of expenses reported on lobbying activities,  the names of lobbyists who had held covered official positions,  the houses of Congress and federal agencies that they lobbied,  the names of foreign entities with interest in the client,  the names of individuals no longer acting as lobbyists for the client,  and  the names of any member organizations of a coalition or association  that actively participated in lobbying activities on behalf of the client.", "In addition, we determined whether each individual lobbyist listed on the  LD-2 report had filed a semiannual LD-203 report.", "Prior to interviewing lobbyists about each LD-2 report in our sample, we  conducted an open-source search to determine whether each lobbyist  listed on the report appeared to have held a covered official position  required to be disclosed. For lobbyists registered prior to January 1, 2008,  covered official positions held within 2 years of the date of the report must  be disclosed; this period was extended to 20 years for lobbyists who  registered on or after January 1, 2008. Lobbyists are required to disclose  covered official positions on either the client registration (LD-1) or on the  first LD-2 report for a specific client, and consequently those who had held  covered official positions may have disclosed the information on a LD-2  report filed prior to the report we examined as part of our random sample.  To identify likely covered official positions, we examined lobbying firms\u2019  Web sites and conducted an extensive open-source search of Leadership  Directories, Who\u2019s Who in American Politics, Carroll\u2019s, and U.S.  Newspapers through Nexis and Google for lobbyists\u2019 names and variations  on their names. We then asked lobbying firms and organizations about  each lobbyist listed on the LD-2 report that we had identified as having a  previous covered official position to determine whether the LD-2 report  appropriately disclosed covered official positions or whether there was  some other acceptable reason for the omission (such as its having been  disclosed on an earlier registration or LD-2 report). Despite our rigorous  search protocol, it is possible that our search failed to identify omitted  reports of covered official positions. Thus, our estimate of the proportion  of reports with lobbyists who failed to appropriately disclose covered  official positions is a lower-bound estimate of the minimum proportion of  reports that failed to report such positions.", "In addition to examining the content of LD-2 reports, we confirmed  whether midyear LD-203 reports had been filed for each firm and lobbyist  listed on the LD-2 reports in our random sample. Although this review  represents a random selection of lobbyists and firms, it is not a direct  probability sample of firms filing LD-2 reports or lobbyists listed on LD-2  reports. As such, we did not estimate the likelihood that LD-203 reports  were appropriately filed for the population of firms or lobbyists listed on  LD-2 reports.", "To determine if the LDA\u2019s requirement for registrants to file a report in the  quarter of registration was met for the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first,  second, and third quarters of 2009, we used data filed with the Clerk of the  House to match newly filed registrations with corresponding disclosure  reports. Using direct matching and text and pattern matching procedures,  we were able to identify matching disclosure reports for 5,489 of the 6,184,  or 89 percent, of the newly filed registrations. We first matched reports  and registrations using both the registrant and client identification  numbers. For reports we could not match by identification number, we  also attempted to match reports and registrations by client and registrant  name, allowing for variations in the names to accommodate minor  misspellings or typos. We could not readily identify matches in the report  database for the remaining registrations using electronic means.", "To assess the accuracy of the LD-203 reports, we analyzed two random  samples of LD-203 reports from the 33,500 total LD-203 reports. The first  sample contains 100 reports of the 10,928 reports with political  contributions and the second contains 100 reports from the 22,572 reports  listing no contributions. Each sample contains 50 reports from the year- end 2008 filing period and 50 reports from the midyear 2009 filing period.  The samples allow us to generalize estimates in this report to either the  population of LD-203 reports with contributions or the reports without  contributions to within a 95 percent confidence interval of plus or minus  7.7 percentage points or less, and to within 2.9 percentage points of the  estimate when analyzing both samples together. We analyzed the contents  of the LD-203 reports and compared them to contribution data found in  the publicly available the Federal Elections Commission\u2019s (FEC) political  contribution database. In our prior report, we interviewed staff at the FEC  responsible for administering the database and determined that the data  reliability is suitable for the purpose of confirming whether a FEC- reportable disclosure listed on an LD-203 report had, in fact, been reported  to the FEC.", "We compared several factors of contributions reported on both the FEC  database and the LD-203 reports, including the number of contributions,  the dollar amount of contributions, date contributions were made, and to  whom contributions were made. We were able to readily verify the  majority of listed contributions using the FEC database. The verification  process required text and pattern matching procedures, and we used  professional judgment when assessing whether an individual listed is the  same individual filing an LD-203. Given the lag time between when a  lobbyist or organization might make a contribution and when a political  action committee (PAC) or campaign might cash or report the  contribution, some flexibility had to be built into the analysis when  examining the dates of entries. As with covered positions on LD-2  disclosure reports, we cannot be certain that our review identified all  cases of FEC-reportable contributions that were inappropriately omitted  from a lobbyist\u2019s LD-203 report.", "For FEC-reportable contributions that could not be readily matched in the  FEC database (perhaps as a result of a delays in a PAC\u2019s or campaign\u2019s  filing of the contribution or discrepancies between the name on the LD-203  report and the name on the FEC filing), we contacted each lobbyist to ask  for documentation of the contribution. In several cases, the contribution  reported had not been processed by the campaign or had been refunded to  the donor and therefore did not appear in a campaign\u2019s FEC filing.  Additionally, we also asked lobbyists to document reports of honorary and  meeting expenses that were not reported to the FEC. Lobbyists were able  to provide supplementary documentation for most honorary and meeting  expenses, as well as the majority of other contributions we asked about, in  the form of invoices, acknowledgment letters, and canceled checks or  other financial records.", "We obtained views from lobbyists included in our sample of reports on  any challenges to compliance and how the challenges might be addressed.  To describe the process used in referring cases to the Office and to  provide information on the resources and authorities used by the Office in  its role in enforcing compliance with the LDA, we interviewed officials  from the Office; obtained information from those involved in the referral  process; and obtained data on the number of cases referred, pending, and  resolved.", "Our objectives did not include identifying lobbyists who failed to register  and report in accordance with LDA requirements, or whether for those  lobbyists that did register and report all lobbying activity or contributions  were disclosed.
