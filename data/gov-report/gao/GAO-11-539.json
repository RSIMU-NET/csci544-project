To address these objectives, GAO (1) reviewed relevant carryover guidance, (2) obtained and analyzed reported carryover and related data at the Air Logistics Centers (ALC), and (3) interviewed DOD and Air Force officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Air Force consistently underestimated the dollar amount of carryover that would exceed the allowable amount in the Air Force Working Capital Fund (AFWCF) budgets from fiscal years 2006 through 2010. In 3 of the 5 years, the budgeted carryover amount underestimated the actual amount by over $250 million. The budget information on carryover is critical since decision makers use this information when reviewing the AFWCF budgets. The Air Force began implementing actions to improve budgeting for AFWCF such as including overseas contingency operations funded orders in the AFWCF fiscal year 2012 budget. These actions have the potential to improve the accuracy of budgeting for AFWCF, but their success will only be known when budgeted carryover information is compared to actual results. GAO analysis of AFWCF reports showed that in each year actual carryover exceeded the allowable amount from fiscal years 2006 through 2010. The allowable amount of carryover is based on the amount of new orders received and the outlay rate of customers' appropriations financing the work. The amount of carryover that exceeded the allowable ranged from $4 million to $568 million. Further, the Air Force increased the allowable amount for orders funded with multiyear appropriations by $115 million and $125 million in fiscal years 2009 and 2010, respectively. Without this adjustment, the AFWCF would have exceeded the allowable carryover by corresponding amounts. The DOD regulation on orders funded with multiyear appropriations only pertains to Army ordnance activities that perform a manufacturing function. Therefore, the provision on increasing the allowable amount of carryover for orders funded with multiyear appropriations does not apply to the Air Force. GAO analysis of ALC reports and discussions with Air Force officials identified four reasons for the increase in carryover from $1 billion at the end of fiscal year 2006 to $1.9 billion--nearly 7 months of work--at the end of fiscal year 2010 on depot maintenance work. First, Air Force underestimated its forecasted workload requirements on the number of hours of work to be performed. Second, because the Air Force believed its depot maintenance workload would decrease, it reduced its workforce in November 2007. While the ALCs reduced their workforce by about 2,000 civilian personnel, the actual workload increased instead of decreased--thus resulting in personnel shortages. Third, the Air Force budget underestimated the amount of funds on new orders received from customers, and the work performed by the ALCs did not keep pace with the increase in funding on new orders from year to year. Fourth, the ALCs could not obtain parts when needed to perform repair work that contributed to the growth of carryover. Air Force data showed that the average monthly outstanding backorders for spare parts at the ALCs grew by about 44 percent from fiscal year 2008 to fiscal year 2010. The Air Force is taking action to address these problems but still needs to compare budgeted to actual information, such as the number of hours of work to be performed, and identify the reasons for the differences."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO makes five recommendations to DOD to improve the budgeting and management of carryover, such as comparing budgeted to actual information on carryover and clarifying DOD guidance on allowable carryover funded with multiyear appropriations.

In fiscal year 2010, the Air Force reported that  in-house work performed at the three depots or Air Logistics Centers  (ALC) included major modifications on 698 aircraft, the overhaul of 320  aircraft engines, and repairs of 330,000 inventory items.", "The three Air Force depots operate under the working capital fund  concept, where customers are to be charged for the anticipated full cost of  goods and services.

Carryover is the reported dollar value of work that has been ordered  and funded (obligated) by customers but not completed by working  capital fund activities at the end of the fiscal year. The congressional  defense committees recognize that some carryover is needed to ensure a  smooth flow of work during the transition from one fiscal year to the next.  However, past congressional defense committee reports have raised  concerns that the level of carryover may be more than is needed.  Excessive amounts of carryover financed with customer appropriations  are subject to reductions by DOD and the congressional defense  committees during the budget review process.

Carryover consists of both the  unfinished portion of work started but not completed, as well as work that  has not yet begun. Some carryover is necessary at the end of the fiscal  year if working capital funds are to operate efficiently and effectively. For  example, if customers do not receive new appropriations at the beginning  of the fiscal year, carryover is necessary to ensure that working capital  fund activities have enough work to ensure a smooth transition between  fiscal years. Too little carryover could result in some personnel not having  work to perform at the beginning of the fiscal year. On the other hand, too  much carryover could result in an activity group receiving funds from  customers in one fiscal year but not performing the work until well into  the next fiscal year.

The DOD carryover policy provides that  the work on these fiscal year 2010 orders is expected to be completed by  the end of fiscal year 2011, and therefore, carryover is only allowed for the  first year.

For the process to work correctly and seamlessly, these  elements must occur and be properly synchronized. If the carryover  becomes too high or low, this is an indication that one or more of the six  elements may not be working properly.", "Of the six elements above, we determined the ALCs encountered problems  that contributed to carryover for four of these elements including: (1)  forecasting workload requirements on the number of hours of depot  maintenance work to be performed, (2) determining the right number of  civilian personnel to perform the depot maintenance work, (3) budgeting  for new orders, and (4) obtaining parts to perform the work.

However, the Air Force underestimated its forecasted  workload requirements on the number of hours of depot maintenance  work to be performed from fiscal year 2007 through fiscal year 2010,  especially in fiscal year 2009. According to the Air Force\u2019s Workload  Review Guidance and AFMC officials, AFMC and ALCs evaluate their  future planned workload and develop workload forecasts by converting  anticipated customer funding into the number of hours required to  perform the work. The Air Force develops two forecasts for a specific  fiscal year. One forecast is 18 months before a fiscal year and another  forecast is 6 months before the fiscal year. Figure 2 shows the Air Force\u2019s  18- and 6-month forecast and actual depot maintenance workload  requirements for fiscal years 2007 through 2010.", "As shown in figure 2, the Air Force anticipated in its 18-month forecast  that its workload requirements would steadily decrease from 22.2 million  hours in fiscal year 2007 to 20.2 million hours in fiscal year 2010\u2014a  reduction of 2 million hours. The reduction in workload requirements was  included in a November 2007 Air Force memorandum. In that  memorandum, the Air Force provided two reasons for the anticipated  workload decrease: (1) the ALCs were more efficient due to the  implementation of transformation efforts focused on improving  operational performance and reducing weapon system sustainment costs  that began in fiscal year 2003, and (2) approved retirements of aircraft  such as the KC-135 platforms would reduce depot maintenance workload  at the ALCs. In addition, Air Force headquarters officials informed us that  at the beginning of fiscal year 2008, the Air Force had not seen an increase  in depot maintenance work as a result of OCO. As a result, the Air Force  directed AFMC to reduce its total workforce to support the forecasted  workload. (Workforce reductions are discussed in the next section.)", "The Air Force anticipated a decrease in workload requirements in its 18- month forecast, but the actual workload requirements increased by 2.1  million hours from fiscal year 2007 to fiscal year 2010. Over the same 4- year period, carryover increased from $1.1 billion in fiscal year 2007 to  $1.9 billion in fiscal year 2010. About 65 percent of the increase occurred  in fiscal year 2009 (see fig. 1). Specifically, the fiscal year 2009 actual  workload requirements exceeded the 18- and 6-month forecasts by 1.9  million and 1.7 million hours, respectively, due to (1) additional depot  maintenance work on aircraft that were not retired as planned and (2) the  2009 actual inductions for aircraft and engines exceeding forecasted  inductions. For example, the Air Force forecasted that it would induct 596  aircraft for depot maintenance work at the ALCs in fiscal year 2009, but  691 aircraft were actually inducted\u2014an increase of 95 aircraft or 16  percent.", "Significant variance to forecasted workload on the number of hours of  work to be performed and the effect it has on other decisions, such as  determining personnel levels, has a direct effect on carryover balances.

Personnel are a critical component in the  ALCs\u2019 ability to repair and maintain an aging Air Force fleet of fighters,  bombers, and cargo aircraft. In a November 2007 Air Force memorandum,  the Air Force stated that \u201cwhile overall workload is decreasing, we are  seeing manpower growth instead.\u201d As a result, the Air Force directed  AFMC to reduce its total workforce to support the forecasted workload.

According  to AFMC and ALC officials, these personnel reductions significantly  reduced the operational capabilities at the ALCs and coupled with the  increase in orders led directly to increased carryover amounts from fiscal  years 2008 through 2010.", "In the first half of fiscal year 2009, the Air Force determined that the  workforce reductions were not warranted because the dollar amount of  external new orders (workload) received by the ALCs increased instead of  decreasing. For example, the ALCs received $3.4 billion of external new  orders in fiscal year 2009\u2014about a $285 million increase over fiscal year  2008 orders. In order to meet higher workload demands and limit the  growth in fiscal years 2009 and 2010 carryover amounts, the ALCs began  hiring personnel in fiscal year 2009. Most of the hiring occurred at the  Oklahoma City and Warner Robins ALCs. For example, the Oklahoma City  ALC increased civilian personnel from 7,073 to 8,848 in a 20-month period  beginning in February 2009\u2014a 25 percent increase. While increasing the  workforce has helped the ALCs to reduce the growth in carryover, ALC  officials informed us that the new personnel lacked the experience of the  personnel who left in fiscal year 2008 and the first half of fiscal year 2009.  As a result, the new personnel were not always as efficient and required  experienced workers to train them, reducing the productivity of the  existing workforce.

Air Force operations have grown  significantly in support of OCO. These higher operational levels have  resulted in increased wear on the Air Force\u2019s aging fleet of aircraft such as  the KC-135 and C-130 and engines, such as the F110-100 and F108-100,  resulting in a greater demand for spare parts to repair them. When  shortages of parts occur, the ALCs (1) work may be delayed until the parts  are available in the supply system or are manufactured by the ALCs,  potentially increasing the carryover amounts at year end, or (2) costs  increase from the time-consuming efforts taken to obtain (cannibalize)  parts from other aircraft or engines to continue the repair process.", "Our analysis of Air Force data showed that the average monthly  backorders for spare parts at the ALCs have grown significantly in recent  years. From fiscal years 2008 to 2010, average backorders at the ALCs  grew by 44 percent.

For example,  Oklahoma City Center officials informed us that the F108-100 engine  program experienced a 60 percent increase for the overhaul of these  engines from fiscal years 2008 to 2009, creating shortages of parts such as  the engine mounts and compressor discharge nozzle cases. In addition,  over the 3-year period the average age of backorders for spare parts grew  in all age categories. Spare parts on backorder can delay work and  potentially increase the carryover amounts. Table 6 provides the average  monthly backorders for the three ALCs by age category.", "In order to perform the required repair work and to minimize the impact of  parts shortages, the ALCs have used other methods to obtain needed parts  such as obtaining parts from other aircraft (known as cannibalization),  fabricating parts, or obtaining parts through the use of their local  procurement authority. While the alternative methods allowed work to  continue, obtaining the needed parts this way was inefficient. For  example, if the aircraft mechanic does not receive the spare parts from the  supply system, the mechanic may cannibalize parts from other aircraft.  According to reports, the three ALCs cannibalized 5,189, 5,447, and 5,667  items in fiscal years 2008, 2009, and 2010, respectively. According to  officials, the ALCs can cannibalize parts in the short term to resolve spare  part shortages; however, in the long term, the ALCs need the supply  system to obtain the needed parts to continue operations.", "We reported in March 2007 that the basic challenge of inventory  management is having the proper amount of items on hand when  required.

Budget estimates could be  improved by implementing effective controls to properly consider and  address the major factors that caused variations between budgeted and  actual carryover amounts. Also, correctly interpreting and applying  criteria in the DOD Financial Management Regulation for determining the  allowable carryover amounts would increase the reliability of such  estimates. While the carryover metric is a management tool for controlling  the amount of work that can carry over from one fiscal year to the next,  the metric can also be used as a tool to identify problems in other areas  such as (1) developing workload requirements on the number of hours of  depot maintenance work to be performed, (2) establishing personnel  levels to perform the depot maintenance work, (3) developing budgets on  the amount of new orders for depot maintenance work, and (4) obtaining  spare parts to perform depot maintenance work. For example, in fiscal  year 2009, AFWCF carryover exceeded the allowable amount by over a  half a billion dollars.

The aircraft was  originally expected to fly through fiscal year 2005; however, the Air Force  decided to extend the aircraft\u2019s service life to fiscal year 2028 due to its  unique mission capabilities.
