As the government searches for ways to do more with less, mission fragmentation and program overlap have become increasingly important issues. The Congress and the administration, as well as GAO, have identified the fragmented nature of many federal activities, coupled with the need to reduce the deficit, as the basis for a fundamental reexamination of federal programs and structures.", "The Results Act presents a viable means to begin such a reexamination. Under the act, agencies are to set strategic and annual goals, measure performance, and report on the degree to which goals are met; based on the agencies\u2019 plans, the President is required to submit a governmentwide performance plan presenting, in conjunction with the annual budget submission, a comprehensive picture of government performance. The Congress intended for the Results Act to fundamentally shift the focus of accountability from a preoccupation with staffing and activity levels to a focus on the outcomes of federal programs. This focus should lead to new information on those programs that cut across agency lines but share common goals.", "As requested, this report summarizes our prior work dealing with mission fragmentation and program overlap and then describes specific ways in which the Results Act can focus attention on these management challenges and help to develop strategies to harmonize federal responses. As agreed with your offices, we did not update issued work for this report, although we did ensure that the work was still relevant and timely."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["In this report, we use the term \u201cmission fragmentation\u201d to refer to those circumstances in which more than one federal agency (or more than one bureau within an agency) is involved in the same broad area of national need. Historically, national need areas have been described by a classification system called budget functions. Developed as a means to classify budgetary resources on a governmentwide basis according to the need addressed, budget functions are, by intention, very broad. Presently, there are 17 national need areas, including such mission areas as international affairs and income security. Functional classifications have been used in the federal budget process for many years to serve a variety of purposes; since 1974, the Congress has used these categories as the framework for the concurrent resolution on the budget. Budget functions will also provide the framework for the governmentwide performance plan that is required by the Results Act to be included with the President\u2019s Fiscal Year 1999 Budget submitted in February 1998.", "Although this type of system can indicate broad categories of fragmentation and overlap, it does not directly address the issue of program duplication. While mission fragmentation and program overlap are relatively straightforward to identify, determining whether overlapping programs are actually duplicative requires an analysis of target populations, specific program goals, and the means used to achieve them. For example, as an indication of duplication within employment training programs, we reported in 1994 on the extent to which 38 separate programs shared common goals, targeted comparable client populations, provided similar services, and used parallel service delivery mechanisms and administrative structures. Thirty of the programs shared characteristics with at least one other program.", "To respond to this request, we compiled an inventory of GAO reports and testimonies dealing with mission fragmentation and program overlap. As agreed, we did not update this issued work, but each identified product was reviewed for relevance and currency. Our goal was to capture the breadth of our published work but to include only those products which described or expanded previous discussions of mission fragmentation or program overlaps, \u201cpatchworks,\u201d or duplications. Products which were very narrow in scope\u2014for example, dealing with a program coordination question within a single agency\u2014were not included unless they were part of a larger body of work on the specific program area. The abstracts contained in appendix I summarize matters relevant to fragmentation and overlap and do not necessarily reflect the entirety of the product\u2019s message."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Mission Fragmentation Is Widespread", "paragraphs": ["Whether approached from a governmentwide perspective or on the basis of individual programs, our work has documented mission fragmentation and program overlap. Although this broad and diverse body of work\u2014covering nearly a dozen missions and over 30 programs and involving most departments and agencies\u2014clearly indicates the potential for inefficiency and waste, it also helps to disclose areas where intentional participation by multiple agencies may be a reasonable response to a specific need. In either case, the Result Act, and its emphasis on defining missions and expected outcomes, can provide the environment needed to begin the process of reassessment.", "In response to requests from the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs and more recently from House Leadership, we attempted to quantify the question of mission fragmentation by using spending patterns to describe the relationship between federal missions and organizations.By mapping department and agency spending against the federal mission areas described by budget function classifications, we showed that most federal agencies addressed more than one mission and, conversely, most federal missions were assigned to multiple departments and agencies. In 1996, for example, most agencies made obligations to three or more budget functions, and six of the budget functions were addressed by six or more executive branch departments and major agencies. For example, seven major federal organizations made obligations in 1996 to the Natural Resources and Environment mission area, and seven to Community and Regional Development. While the use of broad budget functions as a proxy for federal missions cannot yield an exact measure of the extent of fragmentation, our analyses served to illustrate the potential scope of the issue and indicate areas for further assessment.", "We have also done a large body of work reviewing specific federal programs. Again, in program area after program area\u2014from early childhood programs to land management and from food safety to international trade\u2014the picture remains the same: widespread fragmentation and overlap, often involving many federal departments and agencies. Such unfocused efforts can waste scarce funds, confuse and frustrate program customers, and limit overall program effectiveness. Table 1 summarizes the program areas included in appendix I, which contains an annotated bibliography of GAO products covering over two dozen federal program areas including, for example, the following:", "We have reported extensively on federal programs seeking to help people find productive employment. In 1995, we identified over 160 employment training programs scattered across 15 departments and agencies. While about 60 percent of the programs were administered by two departments, the remainder resided in departments not generally expected to provide employment training assistance. Many of the new employment training programs had emerged in these latter departments in recent years.", "We reported in 1995 that at least 12 federal departments and agencies were responsible for hundreds of community development programs that assist distressed urban communities and their residents. Historically, there has been little coordination among the agencies, imposing an unnecessary burden on urban communities seeking assistance. We reported that agencies tended not to collaborate with each other for a variety of reasons, including concerns about losing control over program resources.", "General science, space, and technology", "High performance computing", "National laboratories", "Research and development facilities", "Small business innovation research", "Border inspections", "Drug control", "Investigative authority", "Terrorism and drug trafficking", "Federal land management", "International environmental programs", "Hazardous waste cleanup", "Water quality Notwithstanding the performance problems suggested by this work, a common theme emerges\u2014the evident fragmentation and overlap is the result of an adaptive and responsive federal government. As new needs were identified, the common response has been a proliferation of responsibilities and roles to federal departments and agencies, perhaps targeted on a newly identified clientele (e.g., at-risk children), or involving a new program delivery approach (e.g., credit programs in addition to grants), or, in the worst case, merely layered onto existing systems in response to programs that have failed or performed poorly.", "However, as noted in a recent House Government Reform and Oversight Committee report, \u201ca certain amount of redundancy is understandable and can be beneficial if it occurs by design as part of a management strategy to foster competition, provide better service delivery to customer groups, or provide emergency backup.\u201d Several of our products provide examples of these types of federal environments.", "In some situations, redundancy may be seen as inherently necessary due to the nature of the federal effort. For example, because of security requirements, the Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) processes for planning, funding, and evaluating nuclear weapons development work came to rely on competition among multiple weapons laboratories as a means of ensuring quality.In other cases, the involvement of multiple federal agencies may reflect the breadth of activities associated with a given federal mission. For example, countries formerly part of the Soviet Union have received assistance through over 200 federal programs, some as part of a multiagency approach established by law in 1992. Assistance provided by 23 federal departments and agencies has included food aid, private sector development, emergency humanitarian assistance, disposition of weapons of mass destruction, and democratic reform. Similarly, numerous federal agencies are involved in providing disaster assistance. The Federal Response Plan prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency identifies 27 federal agencies as service providers following any type of disaster or emergency that requires a federal response.", "In some program areas, inefficiencies may be difficult to address because of other, overriding goals. For example, the decentralized structure of federal statistical agencies has been cited as inefficient and contributing to data quality problems. However, the potential advantages of consolidation must be weighed against other concerns, such as the potential for abuse and breaches of confidentiality that could occur when so much information about individuals and businesses is concentrated in one agency.", "Nevertheless, whether seen as the cause of unfocused and confusing program structures or as a necessary consequence of federal approaches in a specific program area, the fragmentation and overlap described by our work inevitably leads to consideration of reorganization and restructuring. In testimony before the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, the Comptroller General noted that experiences in this and foreign countries suggested several basic principles associated with any reorganization assessment. The most important lesson gleaned from these experiences was that any reorganization demands a coordinated approach within and across agency lines, focused on specific, identifiable goals. With its emphasis on defining agency missions, goals and objectives, and strategies to achieve those goals and objectives\u2014and its requirement for involvement of the Congress and other agency and external stakeholders\u2014the Results Act provides a statute-based environment to begin such an assessment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Results Act Holds Potential to Address Mission Fragmentation", "paragraphs": ["The Results Act will present the Congress and the administration with a new opportunity to address mission fragmentation and program overlap. As we noted in our recent assessment of the status of Results Act implementation, the act\u2019s emphasis on results implies that federal programs contributing to the same or similar outcomes should be closely coordinated, consolidated, or streamlined, as appropriate, to ensure that goals are consistent and that program efforts are mutually reinforcing.To implement the act, agencies will need to undertake three key steps: define mission and desired outcomes, measure performance, and use performance information. Each of these steps offers opportunities for the Congress and the administration to intervene in ways that could address mission fragmentation. For example, as missions and desired outcomes are determined, instances of fragmentation and overlap can be identified and appropriate responses can be defined; as performance measures are developed, the extent to which agency goals are complementary and the need for common performance measures to allow for cross-agency evaluations can be considered; and as continued budget pressures prompt decisionmakers to weigh trade-offs inherent in resource allocation and restructuring decisions, the Results Act can provide the framework to integrate and compare performance of related programs to better inform choices among competing budgetary claims."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Define Missions and Desired Outcomes", "paragraphs": ["Perhaps the most important element of the Results Act, at least with respect to the challenge of mission fragmentation and program overlap, is that it creates a framework that enables and expects congressional and other stakeholder consultation in agency strategic planning. This should create the environment needed to look across the activities of individual programs within specific agencies and toward the goals and objectives that the federal government is trying to achieve. The consultation process should present an important opportunity for congressional committees and executive branch agencies to mutually address the extent and consequences of fragmented and overlapping agency missions and poorly targeted programs.", "In many areas, our previous work has shown that emphasizing missions is the best means to cut across organizational boundaries and identify fragmentation. By emphasizing the intended outcomes of related federal programs, our work has identified legislative changes needed to clarify the Congress\u2019 intent and expectations or to address changing conditions that have arisen since initial statutory requirements were established. Examples include the following: In the area of rural development, we reported in 1994 that the patchwork of uncoordinated, narrowly focused programs was an inefficient surrogate for a single federal policy. At the time of our review, a federal interagency group had been established to address service delivery problems, but it could take only limited action because it lacked the authority to make changes in the programs. We suggested that the Congress consider establishing an interagency executive committee with a mandate to report on alternatives to the current fragmented environment, including establishing measurable program goals.", "Following on our work examining federal export promotion programs, the Congress tasked an interagency working group, the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee, with establishing governmentwide priorities for promotion programs and proposing an annual unified federal budget reflecting those priorities. Our work had shown a lack of information on what federal export promotion programs were achieving, whether federal resources for export promotion were being used as effectively as possible, and obstacles to accessing the programs due to the fragmentation of needed services among several agencies.", "Healthy People 2000 is a national strategy for improving the health of the American people. Started in 1979, Healthy People is a series of outcome-based public health objectives developed and updated each decade by the U.S. Public Health Service in consultation with other federal agencies, state governments, and national organizations. Currently, three broad goals are supported by 300 objectives that address 22 priority areas. Over time, the Congress has required that Healthy People objectives be incorporated into other federal programs as a means to ensure that goals and objectives are coordinated to meet federal needs.", "The opportunity for congressional involvement in agency strategic planning could present challenges given the complexity of current committee jurisdictions. To address this, bipartisan teams in the House of Representatives have been established to coordinate and facilitate committee consultations with executive branch agencies. We have supported and will continue to actively support the House\u2019s departmental staff teams as they review and consult on agencies\u2019 draft strategic plans. For example, at the request of the Chairmen of the House Committees on Government Reform and Oversight, Appropriations, and the Budget, we recently developed a set of key questions to be used by the staff teams during their reviews. These questions dealt with identifying relationships among agencies\u2019 strategic plans, determining similar or related efforts across agencies, and noting the extent of interagency coordination.", "The apparent challenge of integrating performance expectations for crosscutting programs with congressional oversight processes and executive management structures should also be aided by an additional Results Act requirement: the governmentwide performance plan. The act requires the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to present a governmentwide performance plan, based on agencies\u2019 annual performance plans, with the President\u2019s Budget; the first plan is required to be issued in February 1998 with the fiscal year 1999 budget. The Congress intended that this plan present a \u201csingle cohesive picture of the annual performance goals for the fiscal year.\u201d While the precise format is left to the discretion of the OMB Director, the plan is expected to be organized around budget functions, thus providing a mission-based, cross-agency perspective. This approach should facilitate identifying crosscutting programs while also supporting integration with the concurrent resolution on the budget\u2014an important congressional oversight tool that also uses budget functions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Measure Performance", "paragraphs": ["The Results Act requires agencies to develop annual plans with suitable performance measures in order to reinforce the connection between the long-term strategic goals outlined in strategic plans and the day-to-day activities of managers and staff. To the extent that federal efforts are fragmented across agency lines, developing crosscutting performance measures through interagency coordination could ease implementation burdens while strengthening efforts to develop best practices. Complementary and, where appropriate, common performance measures could permit comparisons of related programs\u2019 results and the tools used to achieve those results.", "Both the need for and the potential benefits arising from efforts to build a crosscutting perspective into outcome-oriented performance measurement development can be drawn from our previous work. However, the persistent theme from this body of work is that although results-based performance information would help federal managers improve their programs, little information is collected.", "Our work on employment training programs found that many federal agencies did not know if they were really helping people find jobs. For example, in a study of programs targeting the economically disadvantaged, we found that most agencies did not collect information on whether participants found jobs; or if they did, whether the jobs were related to the training provided; and if it was, what wages the participants earned. Without this information, program administrators could not determine if they were preparing participants for local labor market opportunities, whether employment resulted from participation in employment training, or if participants would most likely have found the same types of jobs on their own.", "The challenge of performance measurement development is increased when there are multiple nonfederal entities, in addition to multiple federal agencies, involved in a program area. For example, our work on ecosystem management noted that data needed to test the concept were often noncomparable and insufficient and that a governmentwide approach would require unparalleled interagency and federal/nonfederal coordination.", "Even where efforts are made to develop common performance information across overlapping programs, the information developed can still differ from program to program, hampering crosscutting comparisons. For example, our 1996 review of three agencies whose programs provide economic development assistance found that each cited a \u201cperformance ratio\u201d\u2014computed as a comparison of total dollars invested in a project to the dollars invested by the federal agency\u2014as one measure of how they were meeting their goals. However, each agency defined total dollars invested differently and calculated the ratio for only a portion of its programs. While determining the outcomes of economic development programs certainly presents significant challenges, the use of different methods to calculate apparently similar performance indicators would in any case preclude comparison of the programs.", "Our work also suggests that sustained congressional involvement, in some cases spanning many years, will be required even where a legislated coordinating mechanism exists. For example, the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) was established in 1988 after several previous legislative efforts were unsuccessful in causing development of a comprehensive national drug strategy. ONDCP is responsible for developing and coordinating implementation of a drug control strategy among the now more than 50 federal agencies involved in this program area. Recently, ONDCP began developing national performance measures to be collected in addition to individual agency performance data to help determine whether or how well counternarcotics efforts were contributing to the goals of the national strategy. Consistent with the intent of the Results Act, we recommended that ONDCP complete a long-term plan with meaningful performance measures and multiyear funding needs linked to the goals and objectives of the strategy. In February 1997, ONDCP proposed a 10-year strategy and is making progress toward developing performance targets and measures for each of its goals.", "Lastly, the Congress has a vital role regarding performance measurement development in addition to its consultative role with respect to agency strategic plans. This role can be particularly important in areas of uncoordinated and fragmented missions. For example, assessing the outcomes of science-related programs can be extremely difficult because a wide range of factors determine if and how a particular research and development project will result in commercial or other benefits, and the challenge of this type of assessment is heightened by the involvement of multiple federal agencies. Recently, the Research Roundtable, a consortium of federal research and development agencies, has been considering the extent to which its member agencies can and should adopt a common approach to measuring performance. The Roundtable is one of about 25 interagency groups, many of which were recently formed on an ad hoc basis to discuss common concerns in crosscutting issues, including goal setting and performance measurement. The Congress could work with these types of interagency coordinating groups to ensure that congressional data needs are met within any common performance measurement model. Moreover, this consultation will also reinforce earlier strategic planning consultations intended to clarify and harmonize missions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Use Performance Information", "paragraphs": ["For the Results Act to achieve its objective of improved federal performance and accountability, the performance information made available must be used. Of course, different users will have different needs. Agency managers should use performance information to ensure that programs meet intended goals, to assess the efficiency of processes, and to promote continuous improvement. The Congress needs information on whether and in what respect a program is working well to support its oversight of agencies and their appropriations. In the specific area of fragmented and overlapping activities, performance information can help identify performance variations and redundancies and can lay the foundation for improved coordination, program consolidations, or the elimination of unneeded programs.", "However, developing useful performance information in an environment of fragmented missions presents unique demands, partly because of the number of federal decisionmakers involved. For example, federal employment training programs are not only spread across multiple departments and agencies but are also subject to multiple congressional authorization, oversight, and appropriations jurisdictions. In fact, for the major departments and agencies providing employment training programs, seven different appropriations subcommittees currently review and determine funding levels.", "Ideally, the consultation requirements associated with strategic plan development can help address these concerns. In particular, the House departmental teams, composed of representatives from relevant House authorizing committees as well as the appropriations, budget, and oversight committees, were specifically established to help coordinate committee consultations and simplify the provision of congressional views on agency strategic plans. These actions should help promote clarity and consistency of congressional information needs, thus setting the stage for subsequent congressional interest in collected performance information. But the performance measurement challenge of fragmented missions\u2014that is, concentrating attention on redundancies or performance differences across agencies, in addition to performance gaps within a single agency\u2014will present unique difficulties for both the executive branch and the Congress."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Building a Sustained Focus on Fragmentation and Overlap", "paragraphs": ["Past efforts to deal with crosscutting federal activities suggest that even within the statutory framework of the Results Act, success will take time and will require sustained attention in both the executive branch and the Congress. At this very early stage of Results Act implementation, it is clear that much work remains to be done. In June 1997 testimony before a joint hearing of the Senate Appropriations and Governmental Affairs Committees, the Director of OMB acknowledged, \u201c(A)gencies understandably have first focused on their own programs, and are only beginning to look at enhancing interagency coordination for programs or activities that are crosscutting in nature.\u201d Our reviews of draft agency strategic plans, requested by House Leadership to assist the congressional consultation process, confirmed that agencies are only beginning to consider the challenges of fragmentation and overlap.", "Nearly all of the draft plans lacked evidence of interagency coordination, and some of the plans\u2014including those from some agencies that operate complex programs where interagency coordination is clearly required\u2014lacked any discussion of the need to coordinate with other agencies on crosscutting issues. For example, the ability of the Department of Health and Human Services to achieve its goal of self-sufficiency and parental responsibility for welfare recipients is likely to depend on employment, training, and education programs administered by the Departments of Labor and Education; yet, the draft plan makes no mention of the roles of these other agencies.", "Even if an agency\u2019s draft plan recognized the need to coordinate with others, there was generally little information about what strategies would be pursued to address mission fragmentation and program overlap. For example, although the draft plans for the Departments of Justice and Veterans Affairs contained a general goal to improve coordination among agencies involved in related functions, no specific strategies to achieve this goal were discussed.", "These developments serve to emphasize a fundamental issue: the need for specific institutions and processes to sustain and nurture a focus on mission fragmentation and program overlap. The very nature of this issue presents special challenges for both the executive branch and the Congress.", "In the executive branch, the sheer number of departments and agencies, many of which are \u201cholding\u201d organizations for widely diverse subordinate bureaus, administrations, and services, will present a significant impediment. The Results Act establishes mechanisms to deal with this environment: strategic plans, emphasizing long-term goals and objectives in consultation with the Congress and external stakeholders, and the governmentwide performance plan, presenting \u201ca single cohesive picture of the federal government\u2019s annual performance goals.\u201d However, notwithstanding consultation requirements and the iterative nature of strategic planning, such plans will likely focus internally, especially if there are no persistent, external, cross-agency integrating efforts. The recent growth of ad hoc interagency coordinating groups is an encouraging development, but sustained impetus from OMB will likely be needed to ensure that agency plans address fragmentation concerns. The governmentwide performance plan, prepared by OMB based on agency performance plans, offers perhaps the best opportunity for continued attention to coordination and integration issues within the executive branch, but it remains an untested approach whose relationship to the Congress, as discussed below, is unclear.", "The departmental staff teams established in the House of Representatives have provided a valuable means to coordinate congressional consultations, but mission fragmentation and program overlap will continue to present challenges to the traditional committee structures and processes. Moreover, the governmentwide performance plan raises a series of questions for the Congress, including the following:", "How can the Congress most appropriately respond to the performance goals specified in the plan?", "How can the Congress express its perspectives and priorities on governmentwide performance goals, especially with respect to areas of fragmentation and overlap?", "How can the Congress best stimulate development of common performance measures within fragmented mission areas and programs, especially for those that cut across jurisdictions of specific committees?", "These questions suggest continuing challenges for the Congress as it seeks to address crosscutting performance issues in the context of its current institutions and processes.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce its contents earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days from the date of this letter.
