Federal law has periodically required the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to report on federal climate change funding.

GAO analyzed OMB funding reports and responses to a Web-based questionnaire sent to federal officials, reviewed available literature, and interviewed stakeholders."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Funding for climate change activities reported by OMB increased from $4.6 billion in 2003 to $8.8 billion in 2010, and is organized in a complex, crosscutting system. OMB reports funding in four categories: technology to reduce emissions, science to better understand climate change, international assistance for developing countries, and wildlife adaptation to respond to actual or expected changes. Over this period, technology funding, the largest category, increased from $2.56 billion to $5.5 billion and increased as a share of total funding. OMB also reported $26.1 billion as funding for climate change programs and activities in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, and tax expenditures to encourage emissions reductions, with $7.2 billion in federal revenue losses in 2010. Many federal entities manage related activities, including interagency programs that coordinate agency actions. Questionnaire responses suggest that methods for defining and reporting climate change funding are not interpreted consistently across the federal government. Respondents identified three methods for defining and reporting climate change funding, foremost of which is guidance contained in OMB Circular A-11. While most said their own organization consistently applied these methods internally, far fewer said that they were applied consistently across the government. Some, for example, noted that other agencies use their own interpretation of definitions, resulting in inconsistent accounting across the government, because of several factors, such as the difficulty in distinguishing between programs related and unrelated to climate change. Respondents, literature, and stakeholders identified two key factors that complicate efforts to align funding with priorities. First, notwithstanding existing coordinating mechanisms, questionnaire results indicated that federal officials do not have a shared understanding of strategic priorities. This is in part due to inconsistent messages articulated in strategic plans and other policy documents. A 2008 Congressional Research Service analysis had similarly found no \"overarching policy goal for climate change that guides the programs funded or the priorities among programs.\" Second, respondents indicated that since mechanisms for aligning funding with priorities are nonbinding, they are limited when in conflict with agencies' own priorities. Questionnaire respondents also identified options to better align funding with strategic priorities. Such options included (1) a governmentwide strategic planning process that promotes a shared understanding among agencies of strategic priorities by articulating what they are expected to do within the overall federal response to climate change and (2) an integrated budget review process that better aligns these priorities with funding decisions through a more consistent method of reporting and reviewing climate change funding. Federal entities are beginning to implement some of these options. However, without further improvement in how federal climate change funding is defined and reported, strategic priorities are set, and funding is aligned with priorities, it will be difficult for the public and Congress to fully understand how climate change funds are accounted for and how they are spent. Among GAO's recommendations are that the appropriate entities within the Executive Office of the President (EOP), in consultation with Congress, clearly establish federal strategic climate change priorities and assess the effectiveness of current practices for defining and reporting related funding. Relevant EOP entities did not provide official written comments, but instead provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Climate change is a complex, crosscutting issue that poses risks to many  existing environmental and economic systems, including agriculture,  infrastructure, ecosystems, and human health. A 2009 assessment by the  United States Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) found that  climate-related changes\u2014such as rising temperature and sea level\u2014will  combine with pollution, population growth, urbanization, and other social,  economic, and environmental stresses to create larger impacts than from  any of these factors alone. Funding for climate change activities is spread  across the federal government. According to the Office of Management  and Budget\u2019s (OMB) June 2010 Federal Climate Change Expenditures  Report to Congress, 9 of the 15 cabinet-level executive departments, along  with 7 other federal agencies, received funding for climate change  activities in fiscal year 2010.

For  example, in 2008 the Congressional Research Service (CRS) reported that  the packaging of mostly existing programs into a federal climate change  strategy has resulted in a lack of a unifying mission across the federal  government. This finding is reinforced by two of our recent reports\u2014a  2010 report on environmental satellites used for measuring variations in  climate over time and a 2009 report on climate change adaptation\u2014which  showed that certain federal climate-related activities were not well  coordinated across the government. We have found in the past that when  agencies do not collaborate well when addressing a complicated,  interdisciplinary issue like climate change, they may carry out programs in  a fragmented, uncoordinated way, resulting in a patchwork of programs  that can limit the overall effectiveness of the federal effort.", "In this context, you asked us to review federal climate change activities.  Our objectives were to examine (1) federal funding for climate change  activities and how these activities are organized; (2) the extent to which  methods for defining and reporting climate change funding are interpreted  consistently across the federal government; (3) federal strategic climate  change priorities, and the extent to which funding is aligned with these  priorities; and (4) what options, if any, are available to better align federal  climate change funding with strategic priorities.", "To address these objectives, we analyzed climate change funding data and  tax expenditures presented in OMB\u2019s reports to Congress on federal  climate change expenditures, reviewed other relevant reports, and  interviewed stakeholders knowledgeable about federal funding for climate  change programs and activities. To identify relevant reports and  stakeholders, we reviewed our prior climate change work and conducted a  literature search and review. Using this information, we developed a Web- based questionnaire to gather information and opinions of key federal  officials involved in defining and reporting climate change funding,  developing strategic priorities, or aligning funding with strategic priorities.", "We worked with federal officials within EOP, interagency coordinating  programs, and individual agencies to pretest the questionnaire; the final  list of questionnaire recipients included 106 federal officials. Of these  officials, 73 responded to the questionnaire, for a response rate of about 69  percent. Not all officials responded to all questions. Given our  methodology, we may not have identified every person who has  knowledge of or experience with the topics we covered. However, we  believe we were able to reach many of the relevant federal officials  because we worked with EOP and interagency coordinating bodies to  identify the federal officials to whom we sent the questionnaire.

We found, among other  things, that it was unclear whether funding changed as much as OMB  reported because modifications in the format and content of OMB reports  limited the comparability of funding data over time. For example, OMB  reported that it expanded the definitions of some accounts to include  more activities, but did not specify how it changed the definitions. We  were also unable to compare climate-related tax expenditures over time  because OMB reported data on proposed, but not on existing tax  expenditures.", "Based on these findings, we recommended that OMB (1) use the same  format for presenting data from year-to-year, to the extent that it could do  so and remain in compliance with reporting requirements; (2) explain  changes in report content or format when they are introduced; (3) include  information on existing climate-related tax expenditures in its reports; and  (4) use the same criteria for determining which tax expenditures to  include as it uses for determining which accounts to include.

According to  OMB staff, each of these methods has different levels of formality and  oversight. First and foremost, agencies rely on guidance provided by OMB  through Circular A-11, which describes how agencies are to report funding  to OMB. The circular directs agencies to report funding that meet certain  criteria in three broad categories\u2014research, technology, and international  assistance. Budget data requested by OMB are reported by agencies through  its Web-based MAX Information System (MAX) using the criteria specified  in Circular A-11. According to OMB staff, Circular A-11 is the primary  methodology for defining and reporting long-standing \u201ccross-cuts\u201d of  funding for climate change activities. Interagency groups, such as USGCRP  have collaborated in the past with OMB to clarify the definitions in Circular  A-11, according to technical comments from CEQ, OMB, and OSTP.", "Second, some respondents identified guidance from interagency programs  as another method for defining climate change funding. For example, in its  2006 strategic plan, CCTP developed a list of classification criteria for how  to report climate change technology funding. According to a high-ranking  CCTP official, this list was negotiated between its constituent agencies,  and contains guidance about how to report funding. Similarly, USGCRP  developed definitions to help agencies report research funding in  categories related to its strategic research objectives. USGCRP has the  sole responsibility for developing the definitions for more detailed science  research categories, although the total spending reported by each agency  should be consistent with the official figures released in the federal  climate change expenditures report, according to technical comments  from CEQ, OMB, and OSTP. These EOP entities also commented that  funding analyses conducted by interagency programs are reviewed prior to  release by OMB. Some agencies have also developed operational  definitions of climate change programs within their purviews, according to  several respondents. In technical comments, CEQ, OMB, and OSTP noted  that such definitions help agencies ensure consistency over time in how  they interpret criteria.", "Third, entities within EOP or interagency programs may informally ask  agencies to provide information on programs as part of periodic \u201cdata  calls,\u201d according to several respondents. In technical comments, CEQ,  OMB, and OSTP stated that data calls are most commonly used to collect  information from agencies for analyses internal to EOP, but also for  unique or new reporting needs. For example, USGCRP recently completed  a data call in support of our September 2010 report on geoengineering.  The data call requested agencies to report federal funding for programs or  activities that research deliberate, large-scale interventions in the earth\u2019s  climate system to diminish climate change or its impacts, and it requested  descriptions of specific geoengineering approaches that fit this definition.  Similarly, OMB sent a recent data call asking agencies to report on  programs or activities related to climate change adaptation.", "Respondents identified two key strengths of current methods for defining  and reporting climate change funding. The first was the use of stable  processes, which enable an agency to compare its own climate change- related funding data over time, according to many respondents.

As noted  by one respondent, instances have arisen where agency program staff are  unaware or have not included funding data for certain programs to OMB,  leading to confusion over how an agency\u2019s budget numbers were  determined. According to OMB staff, some programs may not be reported  as climate-related because agency officials may not have identified them in  their budget reviews. For example, a high-level OMB staff member we  interviewed told us that \u201creports may not be consistent if agencies don\u2019t  report things they should. OMB tries to be consistent over time, but is  dependent upon agency submissions.\u201d", "Related to the current methods for defining and reporting funding is the  practice of aggregating funding for multiple programs or activities without  clear explanation.

Similarly, another federal official stated that the primary  challenge associated with tracking climate change technology funding is  that many programs can be included in a given appropriation line item.  According to a 2008 CRS report, \u201cbecause of the aggregation of funding  information that is publicly available, understanding the specific uses of  climate change funds can be challenging. The levels of funding for specific  activities are often unreported or unclear.\u201d", "Difficulty determining which programs are related to climate change.  Determining \u201cwhere to draw the line\u201d between programs and activities  related and not related to climate change is a limitation of current methods  for defining and reporting funding, according to respondents, available  literature, and stakeholders. Some respondents noted that it is difficult to  make the distinction between what programs should and should not be  counted as funding for climate change. Part of the difficulty lies in where  to draw the line between \u201cdirect\u201d programs and activities\u2014for which  climate change is a primary purpose\u2014and \u201cindirect\u201d funding\u2014which  includes those programs that have a different primary purpose but support  climate change goals. The distinction is difficult to make, in part, because  the primary purpose of direct funding may be to provide coherence to the  disparate aims of the indirect programs, according to one stakeholder. \u201cThe biggest limitation\u2026 is separating what activities are explicitly \u2018climate change\u2019 vs.  broader environmental activities which have impact on our knowledge of climate  change. Our work relating to climate change frequently also relates to other  environmental concerns\u2014such as biodiversity patterns and loss, environmental  dynamics and systems. Teasing out the \u2018climate\u2019 elements\u2026is never easy or simple.\u201d", "Indeed, such challenges of definition render the tallies of certain types of  climate change programs somewhat arbitrary, according to a 2010 report  by the Congressional Budget Office. CRS raised similar concerns in a  2008 report, noting that \u201cinconsistencies are likely across years due to  changes in the scopes of what is considered for \u2018climate change.\u2019\u201d Such  inconsistencies make it harder for Congress and the public to fully  understand how climate change funds are accounted for and how they are  spent.", "According to OSTP, if agencies reported all the investments in global  change research (a much broader scope than climate), then the process  would be more difficult, but possibly more comprehensive than the  current approach. OSTP added that the programs, and even the agencies,  that are involved in climate issues are expanding rapidly as adaptation and  mitigation activities are included, which makes definitional issues and  reporting challenges even more difficult.", "These views echo a long-standing definitional problem, identified as early  as 1993 by the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) in a  report on climate change. At that time, according to the report, climate- related projects were categorized as focused (directly related to global  change) or contributing (justified on a basis other than global change but  having the potential to contribute to the global change knowledge base).  According to OTA, there were no standardized criteria for classifying  contributing research, and each agency used its own system, making it  harder to track overall climate change funding. Further highlighting the  difficulty of defining climate change programs, a DOE official told us that  \u201cit can be difficult to distinguish between programs with direct climate  change benefits and indirect benefits, especially for crosscutting items like  basic research. If CCTP only reported those programs that were  exclusively climate change-oriented, the number of programs and amount  of funding reported would shrink dramatically. Many programs, such as  wind energy and energy efficiency, have easily identified climate change  co-benefits. However, there may be other programs with climate change  co-benefits that are more difficult to identify, such as clean coal  technology.\u201d", "Difficulty reconciling reporting categories with changing priorities.  Some respondents noted that it is difficult to use standardized reporting  categories when priorities change. For example, one respondent said the  current methods are not flexible and do not allow for the inclusion of  climate change activities that are very relevant but are happening outside  of what is traditionally considered part of the climate change budget.  Another respondent reported this was the case with adaptation activities,  but also noted that agencies are in the process of developing definitions  and reporting methods for the crosscutting, nontraditional category. One  federal official we spoke with noted that, because of historical inertia, the  current reporting process may not fit well with changing priorities. This  official stated that \u201cit is hard to change the reporting categories used in  USGCRP\u2019s Our Changing Planet reports even though they no longer make  any sense. It is risky to change such categories because people will ask  questions about why the change was made.\u201d", "According to several respondents, a recent proliferation of unique budget  data inquiries have made it more difficult to consistently track and report  funding data. According to one respondent, \u201ctoo many different entities  are requesting similar, but different information related to climate  change.\u201d Another respondent said, \u201cthe way that we collect data and  maybe even the data that we collect may inhibit our flexibilities in  responding to the varying and increasing calls for information from  outside entities. For example, our process may be designed to respond to  OMB requests for information but may not directly respond to requests  from other entities if the information requested is different.\u201d In technical  comments, CEQ, OMB, and OSTP noted that respondents are likely  referencing the difficulty in responding to unique data calls, not that the  data calls undermine the effectiveness of long-standing crosscuts.", "Agency support for USGCRP. According to OSTP, each agency pays its  share of USGCRP\u2019s budget, which is determined by the amount of climate  change research funding it reports. Hence, the more climate research  funding an agency reports, the higher its assessment for supporting the  USGCRP office and other joint responsibilities. According to technical  comments from CEQ, OMB, and OSTP, this assessment was 0.35 percent  in fiscal year 2010. Several stakeholders who were formerly involved in  federal climate change funding decisions said that distributing the cost of  funding USGCRP in this way provides an incentive for agencies to be  cautious in how they report climate change activities. Some respondents  echoed this concern. In certain situations, agencies may report  conservatively to, for example, pay a lower assessment. In other instances,  agencies may take the opposite approach. For example, according to one  stakeholder, some agencies over-report their climate change activities  because they see an opportunity to take credit for leadership.", "OMB staff acknowledged this may be the perception, but disagreed that  agencies could manipulate official climate spending figures. According to  technical comments from CEQ, OMB, and OSTP, it is questionable  whether official numbers can be manipulated in this way because OMB  reviews annual variations to ensure that criteria are being consistently  applied over time.

While OSTP and OMB most recently directed agencies to focus on  activities in their budgets that support the national assessment and  monitoring of greenhouse gas emissions, the 2003 USGCRP strategic plan  and its 2008 revision generally focus federal research on different  priorities, mostly related to reducing scientific uncertainty about climate  changes. CCTP\u2019s 2006 strategic plan similarly focuses federal resources  on different priorities, including capturing and sequestering carbon  dioxide. While these strategic plans were created for different purposes  and times, and are not mutually exclusive, they\u2014and the programs  charged with implementing the plans\u2014represent the operational link  between EOP and agencies.

In its report, NAPA recognized that the same senior  interagency group needed to coordinate federal climate research and  service delivery ideally could be configured to support the overarching  executive branch climate policy agenda, which, according to the report,  would likely bring beneficial synergy and focus to decision making.", "Another approach for aligning funding with priorities that enjoyed success  in the past, according to the results of a 2008 USGCRP expert roundtable  discussion, was OMB\u2019s past practice of favoring interagency priorities over  individual agency priorities when collectively reviewing climate science  budget decisions. The roundtable discussion emphasized that there needs  to be a \u201ccarrot\u201d (a flexible pool of funding to encourage agency  participation) and \u201cstick\u201d (a penalty for not addressing interagency  priorities) to enhance agency implementation of interagency program  priorities. According to our interviews with stakeholders, past USGCRP  funding decisions vetted by an integrated budget review process, were  enforced by what was known as \u201cfencing.\u201d Once agencies signed off on  their contribution to the USGCRP during budget negotiations with OMB,  funding became \u201cfenced off.\u201d Therefore, once an agency committed funds  it was not allowed to \u201cchange its mind,\u201d as OMB would not allow it to  reprogram the funds for other purposes elsewhere in its budget. In other  words, once the priorities were set through the budget review process,  they were locked in through \u201cfencing.\u201d", "A different idea to improve the coordination of climate change programs  suggested by several reports we reviewed was to provide USGCRP with a  central budget to allocate to its member agencies, or the authority to  redirect agency funding to interagency priorities. A 2009 NRC report stated  that an increased discretionary budget for the USGCRP director, sufficient  to carry out interagency efforts such as workshops would provide  flexibility and seed money for objectives that are of higher priority to the  program than to any participating agency. However, certain respondents  warned that giving budget authority to USGCRP was not practical, noting  that the discretion that agencies have is appropriate because many climate  change activities also serve other functions. Furthermore, according to the  testimony of a former director of OSTP, \u201cit is a reality that central  budgeting for an interagency effort like  or CCTP is  incompatible with the Federal budget structures and processes.\u201d", "EOP offices have begun taking steps to improve coordination. For  example, a July 2010 memorandum from OMB and OSTP to department  and agency heads detailing certain climate-related priorities states that \u201cin  requesting funds for large-scale  projects  involving significant interagency or international collaboration, agencies  should identify: the lead organization for the collaboration; the unique  capabilities brought to the collaboration by each partnering organization;  and the specific roles and responsibilities for each organization. Agencies  should coordinate with partner Federal agencies to formulate budget  requests for interagency collaborations.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Continuing Efforts to Link Related Climate Change Activities", "paragraphs": ["Efforts to link related climate change activities across the federal  government could better align climate change funding with priorities,  according to respondents, available literature, and stakeholders.

Specifically, facilities that  emit 25,000 metric tons or more of carbon dioxide equivalent greenhouse  gas emissions per year and most upstream suppliers and vehicle and  engine manufacturers are required to report their emissions.
