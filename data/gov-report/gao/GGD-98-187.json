This report is one of several that we have issued in response to your request. This report discusses the results of our evaluation of the internal control techniques Customs has in place to safeguard certain law enforcement records in the Treasury Enforcement Communications System (TECS) from being inappropriately deleted.", "As part of our review, we examined records designated by Customs as containing lookout data, which identify persons and vehicles known or suspected of illegal activity. TECS is designed to enable Customs inspectors to compare records containing lookout data with persons and vehicles entering the United States during primary screening inspections at ports of entry. Matches found during this comparison process can lead to a secondary inspection, with an intensive search and the arrest of the person and seizure of the vehicle and other property if drugs or other contraband are discovered during the search. TECS lookout records at ports of entry can be very important to law enforcement efforts to detect smuggled narcotics crossing the border. For example, the value of a lookout record was recently demonstrated when Customs inspectors seized 112 pounds of cocaine from a vehicle arriving from Mexico. A thorough inspection of the vehicle was performed because of the active TECS lookout record on the vehicle, leading to the discovery of 46 packages of cocaine.", "In developing the information in this report, we (1) interviewed key officials and reviewed TECS internal control documents at Customs\u2019 headquarters and at three Customs Management Centers (CMC) located along the Southwest border and (2) visited three ports of entry: Otay Mesa, CA; Nogales, AZ; and Laredo, TX. We selected the Otay Mesa port of entry because it was of specific interest to you. We selected Laredo because it is the busiest cargo port of entry on the Southwest border, and we selected Nogales to provide information on a smaller, yet busy port of entry. At each port, we interviewed key officials to obtain information on chains of authority for the deletion of records from TECS; reviewed TECS internal control documents; and observed Customs inspectors\u2019 use of TECS.", "We requested comments on a draft of this report from the Secretary of the Treasury. These comments are discussed near the end of this letter. We performed our work between February 1998 and July 1998 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["A major goal of Customs is to prevent the smuggling of drugs into the country by attempting to create an effective drug interdiction, intelligence, and investigation capability that disrupts and dismantles smuggling organizations. Although Customs inspectors have the option to conduct examinations of all persons, cargo, and conveyances entering the country, the inspectors may selectively identify for a thorough inspection those that they consider high risk for drug smuggling. This identification is generally done through the use of databases available to Customs, such as TECS.", "TECS is designed to be a comprehensive enforcement and communications system that enables Customs and other agencies to create or access lookout data when (1) processing persons and vehicles entering the United States; (2) communicating with other computer systems, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s National Crime Information Center; and (3) storing case data and other enforcement reports. In addition to Customs, TECS has users from over 20 different federal agencies, including the Immigration and Naturalization Service; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms; the Internal Revenue Service; and the Drug Enforcement Administration.", "The TECS network consists of thousands of computer terminals that are located at land border crossings along the Canadian and Mexican borders; sea and air ports of entry; and the field offices of Customs\u2019 Office of Investigations and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. These terminals provide access to records and reports in the TECS database containing information from Customs and other Department of the Treasury and Department of Justice enforcement and investigative files."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "How TECS Records Are Used at Land Border Ports of Entry", "paragraphs": ["According to the TECS user manual, all TECS users (e.g., Customs inspectors and special agents) can create and query subject records, which consist of data on persons, vehicles, aircraft, vessels, businesses or organizations, firearms, and objects. According to TECS Data Standards, records should be created when the subject is deemed to be of law enforcement interest. This interest may be based on previous violations, such as drug smuggling or suspicion of violations, or subjects that are currently or potentially of investigative interest. One of the reasons for creating a TECS lookout record is to place a person or vehicle in the system for possible matching at Customs\u2019 screening locations, such as land border ports of entry. For example, if a vehicle\u2019s license plate that was placed on lookout for possible drug smuggling were later matched during a primary inspectionat a land border port of entry, that vehicle could be referred for additional scrutiny at a secondary inspection.", "Inappropriate deletions of TECS lookout records could negatively affect Customs\u2019 ability to detect drug smuggling. Although inspectors have the option to conduct a thorough examination of all persons, cargo, and conveyances entering the country, they selectively identify for a thorough inspection only those that they consider high risk for drug smuggling. This identification is generally done through the use of databases available to Customs, such as TECS. Inspectors also rely on their training and experience to detect behavior that alerts them to potential drug violators. If lookout records have been inappropriately deleted, inspectors will have less information or less accurate information on which to make their decisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TECS Administrative Control Structure", "paragraphs": ["The TECS administrative control structure consists of a series of System Control Officers (SCO) at various locations, including Customs headquarters, CMCs, and ports around the country. These SCOs are responsible for authorizing and controlling TECS usage by all of the users within the network. A national SCO has designated other SCOs at Customs headquarters for each major organization (e.g., Office of Investigations, Field Operations, and Internal Affairs) who, in turn, have designated regional SCOs who have named SCOs at each CMC and Office of Investigations field office. In some instances, SCOs have been appointed at the port of entry and Office of Investigations suboffice level. Consequently, the SCO chain is a hierarchical structure with each user assigned to a local SCO who, in turn, is assigned to a regional SCO, and so on up to the national level.", "One of an SCO\u2019s primary duties is to establish User Profile Records on each user. User Profile Records identify the user by name, social security number, position, duty station, and telephone number. They also identify the social security number of the user\u2019s supervisor, the SCO\u2019s social security number, and the TECS applications that the user is authorized to access. SCOs at the various levels have certain system authorities they can pass on to other users. For example, the record update level is a required field in the User Profile Record that indicates the user\u2019s authority to modify or delete records. SCOs can only assign to a user the level that they have, or a lower level. According to the TECS user manual, record update levels include the following: 1. Users can only modify or delete records they own (i.e., the user created the records or received them as a transfer from the previous owner). 2. Users can modify or delete any record within their specific Customs sublocation, such as a port of entry, thereby ignoring the ownership chain;the user does not have to be the owner of the record. 3. Users can modify or delete any record owned by anyone in their ownership chain. 4. Users can modify or delete any record in the Customs Service, thereby ignoring the ownership chain. 5. Users have a combination of levels two and three. 9. Users can modify or delete any user\u2019s record in the database."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Customs Guidance on Creating, Modifying, and Deleting TECS Records", "paragraphs": ["According to Customs TECS officials, when a TECS user creates a record and enters it into the system, the user\u2019s supervisor is automatically notified of the entry. All records must be viewed by the supervisor. The supervisor must approve the record, and the record must be linked to supporting documentation, such as a Memorandum of Information Received.", "According to the TECS user manual, TECS users can modify and delete records that they own, and on the basis of the record update level in their User Profile Record, may modify and delete the records of other users as follows: If the users are supervisors or SCOs with the proper record update level (three or five), they may modify and delete the records owned by users in their supervisory or SCO chain. If the users\u2019 record update level (two, four, or five) allows, they may modify and delete the records created or owned by other users in a specific Customs sublocation, such as a port of entry.", "No other controls or restrictions are written in the TECS user manual or any other document that we reviewed."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Weak Internal Controls Over the Deletion of TECS Records", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Managers\u2019 Financial Integrity Act of 1982 required, among other items, that we establish internal control standards that agencies are required to follow (see 31 U.S.C. 3512). The resulting Comptroller General\u2019s standards for internal controls in the federal government contain the criteria we used to assess Customs\u2019 controls over the deletion of lookout records from TECS. During our review, we identified three areas of control weakness: separation of duties, documentation of transactions, and supervision."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Separation of Duties", "paragraphs": ["The Comptroller General\u2019s internal control standards require that key duties and responsibilities in authorizing, processing, recording, and reviewing transactions should be separated among individuals. To reduce the risk of error, waste, or wrongful acts or to reduce the risk of their going undetected, no one individual should control all key aspects of a transaction or event. Rather, duties and responsibilities should be assigned systematically to a number of different individuals to ensure that effective checks and balances exist. Key duties include authorizing, approving, and recording transactions and reviewing or auditing transactions.", "Customs\u2019 current policy authorizes a wide variety of people within and outside of an individual\u2019s supervisory and SCO chain to individually delete the records that another individual owns without any checks and balances (e.g., concurrence by another person). This situation increases risk because, as one SCO that we interviewed told us, the more individuals\u2014supervisors, SCOs, or others\u2014with the required record update levels there are, the more vulnerable TECS is to having records inappropriately altered or deleted. According to the TECS user manual, supervisors, SCOs, and other users with the proper record update level may delete TECS records that they do not own. Moreover, we noticed a range in the number of individuals who were authorized to individually delete others\u2019 records at the three CMCs and three ports we visited. For example, the Southern California CMC had 1 official\u2014the SCO\u2014with the authority to delete others\u2019 records, while the Arizona CMC had 41 individuals\u2014supervisors, SCOs, and others\u2014with that authority. In addition, 1 of the ports we visited (Nogales) had 22 individuals with the authority to delete any record within their port without the record owner\u2019s or anyone else\u2019s permission. In these instances, many individuals, by virtue of their status as a supervisor or SCO or because they possessed the required record update level, were able to delete records with no checks and balances in evidence."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Documentation of Transactions", "paragraphs": ["The Comptroller General\u2019s standards require that internal control systems and all transactions and other significant events are to be clearly documented, and that the documentation is to be readily available for examination. Documentation of transactions or other significant events should be complete and accurate and should facilitate tracing the transaction or event and related information from before it occurs, while it is in process, to after it is completed.", "Neither Customs policies nor the TECS user manual contained standards or guidance to require that Customs officials document reasons for the deletion of TECS lookout records. Although TECS can produce detailed information on what happened to records in the system and when it happened, there is no requirement that the person deleting the record is to describe the circumstances that called for the deletion. Thus, examiners cannot determine from the documentation whether the deletion was appropriate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Supervision", "paragraphs": ["The Comptroller General\u2019s standards require that qualified and continuous supervision is to be provided to ensure that internal control objectives are achieved.

TECS officials told us that users could delete records that they own without supervisory approval.
