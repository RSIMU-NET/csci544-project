Correspondence exams of individual tax returns, which target fewer and simpler compliance issues, are significantly less costly on average than the broader and more complex field exams. GAO estimated that the average cost (including overhead) of correspondence exams opened in 2007 and 2008 was $274, compared to an average of $2,278 for field exams. IRS spent almost 20 percent of the $1.6 billion per year that it devoted to exams on returns from taxpayers with positive income of at least $200,000, even though such returns accounted for only 3 percent of the 136 million individual returns filed per year. (Positive income, a measure that IRS uses to classify returns for exam planning purposes, disregards losses that may offset this income).", "GAO estimated that, for the 2 years of cases reviewed, correspondence exams were significantly more productive in terms of direct revenue produced per dollar of cost than field exams. Both types of exams of taxpayers with positive incomes of at least $200,000 were significantly more productive than exams of lower-income taxpayers.", "GAO demonstrated how these estimates could be used to inform resource allocation decisions. For example, a hypothetical shift of a small share of resources (about $124 million) from exams of tax returns in less productive groups shown in the figure to exams in the more productive groups could have increased direct revenue by $1 billion over the $5.5 billion per year IRS actually collected (as long as the average ratio of direct revenue to cost for each category of returns did not change). These gains would recur annually, relative to the revenue that IRS would collect if it did not change its resource allocation. This particular resource shift would not reduce exam coverage rates significantly and, therefore, should have little, if any, negative effect on voluntary compliance."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that IRS review disparities in the ratios of direct revenue yield to costs across different enforcement programs and across different groups of cases and consider this evidence as a potential basis for adjusting its allocation of enforcement resources each year.

Of the approximately 141 million individual tax returns filed in 2010,  only 1.1 percent were formally audited. IRS has developed several  compliance enforcement programs with the goal of increasing taxpayer  compliance, using resources more efficiently, and minimizing taxpayer  burden. These programs, which include computer-based matching  systems and streamlined correspondence audits (which do not involve  face-to-face meetings with taxpayers) designed for less complex issues,  fill different roles in the compliance enforcement strategy. Every year IRS  publishes information regarding the coverage rates and additional taxes  assessed through these various programs, but relatively little information  is available on how much revenue is actually collected as a result of these  enforcement activities (called direct revenue). Even less information is  available regarding program performance with respect to identifiable  subpopulations (varying in terms of income levels, and types of income)  covered by the enforcement programs.", "Given the importance of appropriately allocating limited resources, you  asked us to assess the performance of IRS\u2019s enforcement programs.

These programs are described below in the background  section. We also report the cost of cases worked and the percentage of  total returns covered by correspondence and field exam programs. For  the correspondence and field exam programs, we make these  comparisons across the principal groups of individual taxpayers (defined  in terms of positive income size and characteristics of their returns, such  as the presence of the earned income tax credit (EITC)) that IRS uses for  exam planning purposes. We use program cost data obtained from IRS\u2019s  Integrated Financial System (IFS) and data on the number of cases from  IRS\u2019s Enforcement Revenue Information System (ERIS). We also use  data on coverage rates from IRS\u2019s Data Book.

We also obtained cost data from  IFS for these four programs. For the field exam program, available data  allow us to incorporate differences in the length, difficulty, and location of  audits into our cost comparisons. Our return on investment measure is  computed as the ratio of revenues over costs with the value of the  revenues discounted for any delays between the year in which IRS  expended the money on the enforcement cases and the year in which the  revenues were collected.", "To determine the potential for gains from shifting resources from lower- yielding programs and types of taxpayers to higher-yielding ones, we use  our results from the second objective to demonstrate how modest  reallocations of resources would affect total collections, assuming that  additional cases examined in a particular group would be approximately  as productive as the average case in that group.

IRS estimated that it would eventually recover about $65 billion of  this amount through late payments and enforcement actions, leaving a  net tax gap of $385 billion. The tax gap has been a persistent problem in  spite of extensive congressional and IRS efforts to reduce it. In past work  we have said that reducing the tax gap will not likely be achieved through  a single solution. Rather, the tax gap must be attacked on multiple fronts  and with multiple strategies over a sustained period of time. On the  enforcement front, IRS\u2019s efforts to ensure compliance of individual  taxpayers combine several distinct programs that collectively monitor and  correct noncompliance with income tax filing, reporting, and payment  requirements. These programs fill different roles in the enforcement  process and vary in the number of taxpayers covered, the resources  used, and their level of automation.", "IRS\u2019s Math Error program electronically checks all filed tax returns for  obvious math errors as returns are processed. The Math Error program  reviews and adjusts items specifically listed in Internal Revenue Code  section 6213.

The Automated  Underreporter (AUR) program electronically matches the IRP data  against the information that taxpayers report on their forms 1040 as a  means of identifying potentially underreported income or unwarranted  deductions or tax credits. The matching process takes place months after  taxpayers have filed their tax returns. For tax year 2010, AUR identified  approximately 23.8 million potential discrepancies between taxpayer  income, deduction, and other information reported by third parties and the  information supplied by taxpayers on their individual income tax returns.  IRS officials said that resource constraints prevent them from contacting  taxpayers for all of the cases in which discrepancies are identified. If a  mismatch exceeds a certain tax threshold, AUR reviewers decide if it  warrants a notice to the taxpayer asking for an explanation of the  discrepancy or payment of any additional tax assessed. IRS guidance  directs reviewers to consider the reasonableness of the taxpayers\u2019  responses, but reviewers generally do not examine the accuracy of the  information in the responses because they do not have examination  authority. For certain issues, AUR reviewers may refer cases for a  correspondence examination.", "The Automated Substitute for Return (ASFR) program uses data from the  IRP system to identify persons who did not file returns, construct tax  returns for certain nonfilers, and assess tax, interest, and penalties based  on those substitute returns. IRS does not pursue all of the constructed  returns. Potential cases fall into one of ten priority levels and are worked  highest-priority first. ASFR officials said they make budget decisions by  taking into account the resources available to the program and determine  the level of new cases that will be worked over the following year. In fiscal  year 2011, the ASFR program closed nearly 1.4 million cases.", "Correspondence examinations are formal audits of individual taxpayers  but do not involve face-to-face meetings with taxpayers. Instead, these  examinations target specific issues that are limited in scope and  complexity, easily documented, and can be handled quickly and efficiently  through correspondence between the taxpayer and the IRS examiner.  Tax returns are selected as potential cases through automated business  rules that filter or select tax returns according to predetermined criteria.  These business rules can detect multiple potential issues, all of which can  be worked through a single correspondence exam. Examiners have the  authority to review additional issues on a return even if they were not  identified by the automatic filters.", "Field examinations are conducted in face-to-face meetings between the  taxpayer and the IRS examiner. These audits are targeted at individual  returns with broader and more complex issues. Unlike correspondence  examinations, the field examination program has a classification process  where an experienced tax examiner will review a potential case to  determine which, if any, issues should be examined. Individual tax returns  are selected for field examination in a variety of ways. Some returns are  selected in the pursuit of specifically identified compliance issues, such as  abusive transactions or offshore compliance. Others are selected on the  basis of a statistical formula that attempts to predict the potential for  additional tax assessments, and yet others are selected randomly for  research purposes. Regardless of why the return was initially selected for  audit, an examiner will review the return in its entirety to determine if other  issues are present.", "The responsibility for operating these individual taxpayer enforcement  programs largely rests with IRS\u2019s Small Business/Self-Employed (SB/SE)  Division, which handles complex individual returns, and Wage and  Investment (W&I) Division, which handles simpler returns.

We  estimated that the average direct revenue yield per dollar of cost across  all correspondence exams of individual taxpayers was $7. In contrast, the  average direct yield per dollar for field exams of individual taxpayers was  $1.8. We also estimated that the direct revenue per dollar of cost was  about $22 for AUR cases and about $31 for ASFR cases.", "Exams that are more complicated than average are likely to require both  more time to complete and more highly skilled examiners, who cost more  per hour. In estimating the results for field exams in figure 3, we  incorporated differences in the amount of time spent on each field exam,  which is recorded in the ERIS database, but we did not account for  differences in hourly costs relating to varying skill levels of examiners  across cases because the data available for that purpose were limited.Nevertheless, to test the potential sensitivity of our results to this missing  factor, we estimated an alternative set of field exam results, using an  ERIS data element that reflects the expected difficulty of an exam. We  also tested the effect of differences in locality pay for field examiners in  different geographic locations. (See app. I for further details.) We found  that adjusting for skill levels likely reduces some of the differences in  direct revenue per dollar of cost across field exam categories; adjusting  for location has a negligible effect.

This result is based  on shifting the $124 million from exams of lower-income returns with the  earned income tax credit (EITC) and lower-income business returns  without EITC to exams of higher-income returns and lower-income  nonbusiness returns without EITC. The result holds true as long as the  average ratio of direct revenue to cost for each category of returns  remained unchanged. (See fig. 4.) Similar gains would recur annually,  relative to the revenue that IRS otherwise would collect if it did not  change its resource allocation and taxpayer behavior remained  substantially the same.", "We took account of several constraints when designing our hypothetical  resource reallocation example. First, we did not want to suggest a large- scale change because some reallocations cannot be made quickly,  particularly if they require a different distribution of examiner skills than  exists in IRS\u2019s current workforce. The $124 million that we shifted  represents less than 8 percent of the $1.6 billion per year that IRS  devoted to examinations of individual tax returns for the 2 years we  studied and we shifted less than 5 percent of existing field exam  resources ($1.1 billion per year) to correspondence exams. Second, we  did not want to end up with extreme coverage rates (either high or low) in  any return category. Therefore, we did not reduce the combined coverage  rate for any category for which the coverage rate was already close to or  below 1 percent, and we kept the highest coverage rate (for returns with  positive incomes of $1 million or more) under 11 percent.that 11 percent rate is almost twice the current rate for that category.)  Finally, given that certain compliance issues can be reviewed effectively  only through a field exam, we did not decrease field exam resources in  any return category for which we increased correspondence exam  resources.", "Exam resource reallocation can also affect tax collections indirectly by  influencing the voluntary compliance of nonexamined taxpayers. These  indirect effects are difficult to estimate and IRS has no empirical evidence  that would allow it to say whether overall voluntary compliance would  increase or decrease as a result of specific resource reallocations.  Changes in exam coverage rates are generally believed to affect  voluntary compliance by altering taxpayers\u2019 perceived risks of being  audited. The higher the risk of being audited, the less inclined taxpayers  are to evade taxes. As shown in figure 5, our hypothetical reallocation  would have increased combined coverage rates in most of the tax return  categories we examined. For those categories in which coverage rates  declined, the declines were relatively modest. For these reasons we  believe that the direct revenue gains associated with our hypothetical  reallocation would not likely be offset by significant indirect revenue  losses. However, if larger resource allocations were considered, the lack  of empirical evidence on the potential changes in voluntary compliance  could leave IRS uncertain of the extent to which direct revenue gains  might be offset by negative indirect revenue effects. Although research on  this issue is challenging, IRS might be able to leverage its existing efforts  to study voluntary compliance through the National Research Program  (NRP) to get better information on the influence of enforcement activity on  voluntary compliance.", "Our analysis focused upon ratios of average direct revenue to average  cost. We did not incorporate other potentially important considerations  due to data constraints. One such consideration is the extent to which the  ratio of direct revenue per dollar of cost may decline for a particular  category of exams as additional resources are devoted to that category.  The revenue yield of each additional return that IRS exams within a  particular return category may be lower than the average revenue- productivity rates we estimated, particularly if IRS\u2019s return selection  process for examinations results in returns with the greatest revenue  potential being worked first and those with the least potential being  worked last. Little is known about the relationship between marginal and  average revenue and cost within specific return categories because IRS  currently does not identify the marginal cases worked each year.IRS collects some information on marginal cases, such as how the broad  characteristics of those returns that would likely be selected (or not  selected) in a modest program expansion (or contraction) would differ  from the average return actually audited now, planners would have to rely  solely upon ratios of average direct revenue to average cost\u2014a less  accurate basis for estimating the direct revenue consequences of specific  exam resource allocations.", "An analysis of the marginal revenue yields for specific categories of  returns might also enable IRS to reduce the number of audits that result  in no direct change in tax liability (although they may have beneficial  effects on voluntary compliance). These no-change cases impose  burdens on compliant taxpayers. Further, substantial variations across  return categories in the percentage of exams that result in no change  could be viewed as inequitable because compliant taxpayers in some  categories have a greater chance of being burdened than compliant  taxpayers in other categories. No-change rates in some higher-income  return categories are already relatively high, compared to rates for lower- income categories. For example, the no-change rate for correspondence  exams of tax returns with positive income of $1 million or more was about  53 percent for fiscal years 2007 to 2008. (See table 1 in app. II.)  However, the highest no-change rates are associated with  correspondence exams, which should be less burdensome than field  exams. High no-change rates could also be associated with declining  revenue yields in marginal cases; however, without a specific study of  marginal cases, it is not possible to say whether no-change cases are  concentrated among the last cases examined in a particular category or  whether they are spread relatively evenly across exams worked  throughout the course of the year.", "Factors other than revenue yields and IRS budget costs also matter for  purposes of an overall cost-benefit evaluation of IRS exam activities.  These activities impose compliance costs on taxpayers and economic  efficiency costs on society. Return categories with low ratios of direct  revenue to IRS budget costs could have offsetting advantages in terms of  lower efficiency and compliance costs; however, no empirical evidence of  variations in these other effects or costs across the return categories  exists, nor would it be easy to obtain. (See app. III for further discussion  of these tradeoffs.)"], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The results of our analyses suggest that there is potential for IRS to  increase the direct revenue yield of selected enforcement programs by  hundreds of millions of dollars per year without significant (if any) adverse  effect on the indirect effect that examinations have on revenues.  However, our results are preliminary and limited in scope. The collection  and analysis of additional data would help to both confirm our basic  conclusion and assist IRS in more finely adjusting its resource allocation  decisions. One priority would be to study the feasibility of estimating the  marginal revenue and marginal costs within each program within each  taxpayer group. It would be helpful, for example, to estimate at least how  the broad characteristics of those returns that would likely be selected (or  not selected) in a modest program expansion (or contraction) would differ  from the average return actually audited now. Such information would  help IRS assess the extent to which revenue productivity would likely  decline, if at all, if more exam resources are devoted to a particular group  of taxpayers. Another useful project would be to see if some linkage could  be made between the amounts of time that specific examiners spend on  each case and the revenue collection amounts for each case that are  recorded in ERIS. Such a link would enable IRS to estimate ratios of  direct revenue to cost that better incorporate differences in the hourly  costs across examiners with different skill levels. The collection or  estimation of other information that would be useful when allocating  resources, such as the influence of enforcement activity on voluntary  compliance, is challenging, which is why little is known about those topics  to date. Nevertheless, IRS might be able to leverage its existing efforts to  study voluntary compliance through the NRP to get better information on  the influence of enforcement activity on voluntary compliance.", "In the absence of the additional data identified above, IRS planners can  use the results of an analysis such as ours in combination with their  professional judgment to decide whether the potential for direct revenue  gains more than offsets the potential for reductions in indirect revenue or  in equity and any increases in compliance or efficiency costs.

The cost that those amounts represent can be  attributed to the tax law, rather than to IRS enforcement efforts.

IRS\u2019s enforcement activities can alter the tax  avoidance and evasion behavior of individuals, which affects the  efficiency of resource allocation in the economy.
