This report examines: (1) EPA's process for appointing advisory committee members, (2) the extent to which EPA followed its process for selecting members from October 2016 through March 2018, and (3) how, if at all, selected characteristics of EPA advisory committees changed after January 2017.

Each phase involves several steps. For example, a key step for evaluating candidates involves EPA staff's preparing documents that reflect staff recommendations on the best qualified and most appropriate candidates for achieving balanced committee membership, according to EPA guidance.", "EPA generally followed its established process for most of its 22 advisory committees; however, in fiscal year 2018, EPA did not follow a key step for appointing 20 committee members to two committees GAO reviewed: the EPA Science Advisory Board and Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee, which advise the agency on environmental regulatory matters, among other things. The 2018 appointment packets for these two committees did not contain documents reflecting EPA staff rationales for proposed membership, as called for by EPA's established process. EPA developed guidance to implement the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA). By directing officials responsible for appointing committee members to follow a key step in its process to document staff rationales for proposed membership, the agency would have better assurance that it will (1) consistently meet FACA's purpose of encouraging uniform appointment procedures and (2) show how it made appointment decisions to achieve the best qualified and most appropriate candidates for balanced committee membership. EPA also did not consistently ensure that members appointed as special government employees (SGE)\u2014who are expected to provide their best judgment free from conflicts of interest and are required by federal regulations to disclose their financial interests\u2014met federal ethics requirements. For about 23 percent, or 17 of the 74 financial disclosure forms GAO reviewed, an ethics official had not signed and dated that the SGE filing the form was in compliance with federal ethics rules. EPA also did not periodically review its ethics program, as called for by federal regulations, such as through audits or spot-checks, to evaluate the quality of financial disclosure reviews for SGEs. Until EPA's Ethics Office evaluates the quality of financial disclosure reviews of SGEs as part of its periodic review of its ethics program, it will not have reasonable assurance that it will address noncompliance with federal ethics requirements and prevent conflicts of interest on its advisory committees.", "Based on GAO's review of the U.S. General Services Administration's (GSA) FACA database, there were notable changes to selected characteristics of EPA advisory committees (i.e. at least a 20 percentage point difference in the change to a characteristic after January 2017 compared to the period after January 2009). Of the four characteristics GAO reviewed\u2014committee composition, regional affiliation, membership turnover, and number of meetings committees held\u2014one or more of the first three changed notably for four of 18 EPA advisory committees after January 2017."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is recommending that EPA direct (1) officials responsible for appointing committee members to follow a key step in its appointment process to document staff rationales for proposed membership and (2) EPA's Ethics Office to evaluate the quality of financial disclosure reviews of SGEs appointed to advisory committees.

The Federal Advisory Committee Act  (FACA) authorizes federal agencies to establish advisory committees to  provide the agencies with advice and recommendations. As of March 31,  2018, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) managed 22  advisory committees under FACA. These committees play an important  role at EPA by providing advice that helps the agency develop  regulations, accredit laboratories, and manage research programs,  among other activities. The topics addressed by these committees span  EPA\u2019s portfolio and include pesticides, drinking water quality, air quality,  rural community welfare, and children\u2019s health. For example, the  committee at EPA with the largest number of committee members, the  EPA Science Advisory Board (SAB), advises EPA on the adequacy and  scientific basis of standards and regulations under the Clean Water Act,  Safe Drinking Water Act, and other federal environmental laws. Another  committee, the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC), is  responsible for reviewing national ambient air-quality standards, among  other topics.", "Questions have been raised about EPA\u2019s process for appointing  committee members following recent policy changes affecting who serves  on EPA advisory committees. Specifically, EPA issued a policy in October  2017 that restricts recipients of EPA grants from serving on advisory  committees. The policy states that (1) members shall be independent  from EPA, which shall include a requirement that no member of an EPA  federal advisory committee currently receive EPA grants; (2) committee  balance should reflect prominent participation from state, tribal, and local  government, as appropriate for the committee\u2019s purpose and function; (3)  EPA should seek to increase the geographic diversity of members by  ensuring membership is balanced with individuals from different states  and EPA regions; and (4) EPA should promote fresh perspectives by  regularly rotating membership. Three lawsuits were filed challenging the  policy; all were dismissed. Other recent EPA decisions regarding  advisory committees have raised questions. For example, in October  2018, EPA disbanded a CASAC subcommittee charged with helping the  agency review air quality standards for particulate matter and halted plans  to form another subcommittee to help assess limits on ozone pollution.", "You asked us to review issues related to how EPA appoints advisory  committee members. In this report, we (1) describe EPA\u2019s established  process for appointing members to serve on EPA advisory committees;  (2) evaluate the extent to which EPA followed its process from fiscal year  2017 through the first two quarters of fiscal year 2018; and (3) describe  how, if at all, selected characteristics of EPA\u2019s advisory committees  changed after January 2017.", "To describe EPA\u2019s process for appointing members to serve on EPA  advisory committees, we reviewed EPA\u2019s Federal Advisory Committee  Handbook, which documents this process. We also reviewed relevant  federal laws, regulations, and policies and interviewed EPA officials. To  evaluate the extent to which EPA followed its established process from  fiscal year 2017 through the first two quarters of fiscal year 2018, we  requested and reviewed all agency documentation used to support  appointment decisions from the 17 committees that appointed or  reappointed advisory committee members during this time frame. The  remaining committees did not appoint any committee members during the  time frame we reviewed. For the 17 committees, we reviewed all  appointment packets produced during this time. Many of these packets  contained appointment documents for numerous appointees or  reappointees. We also reviewed portions of financial disclosure forms for  74 individuals appointed or reappointed to EPA advisory committees to  determine if their forms were consistent with key federal requirements  and guidance. We reviewed these forms to determine if the individuals  met federal financial-disclosure-reporting requirements. Additionally, we  interviewed EPA officials involved with appointing committee members to  understand the steps the officials took. We then compared the steps they  described taking with selected steps in EPA\u2019s established process. We  focused on steps in the appointment process that were to be documented  in the appointment packets, which EPA used to support appointment  decisions. Specifically, we reviewed those aspects of the process for  which EPA was to have documentary evidence, and we evaluated EPA\u2019s  implementation of ethics oversight requirements relevant to EPA\u2019s  process for appointing committee members.", "To describe how, if at all, selected characteristics of EPA\u2019s advisory  committees changed after January 2017, we analyzed information from  the FACA database, a publicly available database maintained by the U.S.  General Services Administration (GSA) that contains information about  FACA advisory committees that agencies, including EPA, are required to  provide annually. We compared four characteristics of committees before  and after the two most recent changes in presidential administrations. To  identify notable changes to a characteristic, we first identified any  changes after January 2017 that were large relative to other changes to  that characteristic by comparing the characteristics of committees on  January 19, 2017, to those on March 31, 2018. If we identified a  relatively large change, we then assessed whether it was large relative to  changes to the characteristic from January 19, 2009, to March 31, 2010.  If it was, we identified the change as notable. To provide context, we also  reviewed the characteristics of EPA\u2019s advisory committees from January  20, 2013, and April 1, 2014. The characteristics we compared were: (1)  committee composition (e.g., are a committee\u2019s members affiliated with  academia, consulting, industry, government, a non-government  organization, or other); (2) regional affiliation (i.e., with which regions of  the country are committee members affiliated); (3) membership turnover  (i.e., the percentage of committee members who no longer served on a  committee); and (4) the number of meetings committees held. For 4 of the  22 advisory committees EPA was managing on March 31, 2018, we did  not analyze any of the four characteristics because they were established  after the beginning of the time frame we analyzed. To assess the  reliability of information in the FACA database for the 18 EPA advisory  committees within the scope of our review, we analyzed relevant  documentation, tested and spot-checked data, and interviewed GSA and  EPA officials. We reviewed the data for accuracy with EPA officials. We  determined that the data were overall sufficiently reliable for describing  changes in committee characteristics for our selected time periods.  Further information about the scope and methodology of our review is  presented in appendix I.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2017 to July 2019 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

For example, one purpose of FACA is to ensure  that uniform procedures govern the establishment and operation of  advisory committees. Also under FACA, an agency establishing an  advisory committee must, among other things, require the committee\u2019s  membership to be balanced in terms of the points of view represented  and the functions to be performed by the committee. In addition, federal  ethics regulations establish when and how federal officials should review  financial disclosure forms to identify and prevent conflicts of interest  prohibited by federal law for any prospective committee members  required to file these forms in connection with their appointments to  advisory committees. GSA has provided additional guidance regarding  the implementation of ethics requirements under FACA.", "Various EPA offices and officials are responsible for helping the agency  follow these requirements. For example, EPA\u2019s Federal Advisory  Committee Management Division\u2014which has overall responsibility for  committee management and ensuring that EPA\u2019s advisory committees  comply with FACA\u2014developed the Federal Advisory Committee  Handbook to clarify roles and responsibilities for complying with relevant  requirements. The handbook was written primarily for EPA employees  assigned as designated federal officers for committees. These officers  are responsible for the day-to-day management of advisory committees  and play a central role in identifying and recommending candidates who  can help the committees meet their goals. EPA employees assigned as  designated federal officers also are responsible for maintaining committee  records. According to EPA\u2019s Federal Advisory Committee Handbook, one  of the primary reasons that Congress passed FACA was to ensure public  access to the records and documents of advisory committees, and that  this fosters greater transparency and accountability of agencies\u2019 use of  advisory committees.", "EPA\u2019s Ethics Office is responsible for helping the agency follow federal  ethics requirements. Housed within the agency\u2019s Office of General  Counsel in headquarters, the Ethics Office oversees all aspects of the  agency\u2019s ethics program, including financial disclosure reporting. The  Designated Agency Ethics Official coordinates and manages the  program. The Designated Agency Ethics Official delegates authority to  more than 100 deputy ethics officials located throughout the agency\u2014 including in headquarters and regional offices\u2014to carry out most  elements of EPA\u2019s ethics program. For example, deputy ethics officials  are to review financial disclosure reports for prospective committee  members to identify and prevent conflicts of interest.

The agency establishes non- discretionary committees when required to by statute or directed to by the  President. For example, the Clean Air Act requires EPA to establish an  advisory committee to, among other things, help EPA review standards  for national ambient air quality every 5 years. EPA also can establish  discretionary committees at the Administrator\u2019s direction if, for example,  these committees provide an important and unique perspective on EPA  programs or operations. An example of a discretionary committee is the  Pesticide Program Dialogue Committee, which was formed to help EPA  perform its duties under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and  Rodenticide Act and related laws. See appendix II for a list of EPA\u2019s 22  advisory committees as of March 31, 2018. EPA must approve the  establishment of any subcommittees formed to assist committees with  their work.", "EPA also can appoint different types of members to its advisory  committees, depending on the needs of its committees and other  considerations. For instance, EPA may appoint a committee member as a  federal government employee under an appropriate hiring authority. If  EPA expects a federal employee to serve no more than 130 days in any  365-day period, guidance from the U.S. Office of Government Ethics  (OGE), which oversees the executive branch\u2019s ethics program, states that  the employee should be designated as a special government employee  (SGE). If EPA decides not to appoint the committee member as a  federal employee, that committee member would be a non-employee  representative. EPA decides whether to appoint committee members as  federal employees.", "To help federal agencies such as EPA determine whether to designate  committee members as SGEs or representatives, OGE has developed  guidance on factors to consider when agencies make these  determinations. For example, OGE guidance states that SGEs are  expected to provide independent expert advice and provide their best  judgment free from conflicts of interest. They are generally subject to  federal ethics regulations placed on other federal employees\u2014including  the requirement to file financial disclosure forms. In addition, OGE  guidance states that representatives serve as the voice of groups or  entities with a financial or other stake in a particular matter before an  advisory committee.

In one example, the handbook explains that  a committee needs a representative from local government. For the  past several years, the position has been filled by someone from an  affluent suburban county.

For  example, OGE regulations:  state that designated agency ethics officials, acting directly or through  other officials, are responsible for carrying out effective financial  disclosure programs by, among other things, using information in  financial disclosure reports to prevent and resolve potential conflicts of  interest;  specify actions the official must take if the reviewing official concludes  that information disclosed in the report may reveal a violation of  applicable laws and regulations; and  state that designated agency ethics officials are responsible for  periodically evaluating their agencies\u2019 ethics programs.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government also states that  management should design control activities to achieve objectives and  respond to risks, such as by comparing actual performance to planned or  expected results and analyzing significant differences.", "Because EPA had not periodically evaluated through audits or spot- checks the quality of financial disclosure reviews for SGEs appointed to  advisory committees, the agency was not well positioned to compare the  program\u2019s actual performance with planned results or address instances  of noncompliance with federal ethics requirements. Until EPA\u2019s Ethics  Office, as part of its periodic review of its ethics program, evaluates\u2014for  example, through audits or spot-checks\u2014the quality of financial  disclosure reviews conducted for SGEs appointed to EPA advisory  committees, it will not have reasonable assurance that it is addressing  noncompliance with federal ethics requirements and preventing conflicts  of interest among SGEs appointed to EPA advisory committees.

GSA provided us with data  files downloaded to Excel from its FACA database from October 1, 2005,  to March 31, 2018, for our analysis. GSA maintains the FACA database  on a fiscal year basis. During the fiscal year, staff in each agency,  including EPA, are to enter data to reflect any changes about the  agency\u2019s FACA committees. At the end of each fiscal year, GSA is to  perform, in conjunction with each agency, an annual comprehensive  review of the data entered into the database by the agency for that fiscal  year. According to GSA officials, these reviews constitute the agency\u2019s  main process for ensuring the reliability of the database. Once the review  is complete, the data are locked down, meaning they can no longer be  changed. We received data through the 2017 fiscal year after GSA  completed the 2017 review.", "Because this latest GSA review was the end of fiscal year 2017 and we  wanted to include data into 2018, we requested that EPA update the  database to March 31, 2018, for each committee for certain data fields  relevant to our analyses. We asked that for each committee, the EPA  staff member responsible for entering a committee\u2019s data in the FACA  database provide confirmation to us that the data had been updated  through March 31, 2018. After we received confirmation that data for the  22 committees in existence on March 31, 2018, had been updated, GSA  staff provided us the data update for EPA committees from October 1,  2017, through March 31, 2018.", "To further assess the reliability of these data, we reviewed the database\u2019s  technical documentation and interviewed GSA and EPA officials to  identify any potential issues with our planned analysis of the data. We  conducted logic tests and spot-checked the data to identify errors and  inconsistences. For example, we scanned committee member\u2019s names to  identify potential duplicates of the same person in the same committee  and made corrections where appropriate. If a person served on more than  one committee, we included that person separately for each committee  on which he or she served. For each member, we also checked the  appointment start and end dates indicated in each fiscal year for  inconsistencies across fiscal years. In some instances, we identified  missing or inconsistent data in these dates and shared this information  with EPA officials. EPA was able to provide some corrected data for  members with missing or inconsistent appointment-date data from  October 1, 2015, to March 31, 2018. We excluded from our analyses  four committees for which over 30 percent of members had appointment  date issues we were not able to resolve, as well as individual members  with unresolved date issues for the committees we included in the  analysis. We also checked the 2018 data that GSA provided to us  against the data posted to EPA\u2019s website. We determined that overall the  data were sufficiently reliable for conducting analysis to describe changes  in selected member and committee characteristics for our selected time  periods.", "Finally, we took steps to structure the data provided by GSA in the format  needed for our analyses. Specifically, because GSA maintains its data on  a fiscal year basis, the data we received from GSA contained a separate  row in the database for each committee member for each fiscal year that  he or she was a member. To facilitate our analyses, we transposed the  dataset so there was one row for each member (for each committee, if a  member was in more than one committee) that contained the data from  all of the fiscal year records for that member.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2017 to July 2019 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
