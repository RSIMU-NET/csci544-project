However, it is unclear how the United States will achieve its desired end-state in Iraq given the significant changes in the assumptions underlying the U.S. strategy. The original plan assumed a permissive security environment. However, an increasingly lethal insurgency undermined the development of effective Iraqi government institutions and delayed plans for an early transfer of security responsibilities to the Iraqis. The plan also assumed that U.S. reconstruction funds would help restore Iraq's essential services to prewar levels, but Iraq's capacity to maintain, sustain, and manage its rebuilt infrastructure is still being developed. Finally, the plan assumed that the Iraqi government and the international community would help finance Iraq's development needs, but Iraq has limited resources to contribute to its own reconstruction, and Iraq's estimated future needs vastly exceed what has been offered by the international community to date. The NSVI is an improvement over previous planning efforts. However, the NSVI and its supporting documents are incomplete because they do not fully address all the desirable characteristics of an effective national strategy. On one hand, the strategy's purpose and scope is clear because it identifies U.S. involvement in Iraq as a vital national interest and central front in the war on terror. The strategy also generally addresses the threats and risks facing the coalition forces and provides a comprehensive description of the desired U.S. political, security, and economic objectives in Iraq. On the other hand, the strategy falls short in three key areas. First, it only partially identifies the current and future costs of U.S. involvement in Iraq, including the costs of maintaining U.S. military operations, building Iraqi government capacity at the provincial and national level, and rebuilding critical infrastructure. Second, it only partially identifies which U.S. agencies implement key aspects of the strategy or resolve conflicts among the many implementing agencies. Third, it neither fully addresses how U.S. goals and objectives will be integrated with those of the Iraqi government and the international community, nor does it detail the Iraqi government's anticipated contribution to its future security and reconstruction needs.

According to this document, prevailing in Iraq is a vital U.S. national  interest because it will help win the war on terror and make America safer,  stronger, and more certain of its future. To achieve victory, the strategy  requires the United States to maintain troops in Iraq until its objectives are  achieved, adjusting the number up or down as conditions warrant.  Currently, the United States deploys about 130,000 U.S. troops in support of  the Iraqi government. Between fiscal years 2003 and 2006, the U.S.  government has allocated about $311 billion to support U.S. stabilization  and reconstruction efforts in Iraq, including over $34 billion for  reconstruction assistance alone. Moreover, the administration has  requested about an additional $51 billion to support U.S. stabilization and  reconstruction operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in fiscal year 2007.", "We initiated this review under the Comptroller General\u2019s authority because  of broad based congressional interest in Iraq issues.

We also examined the reports of other oversight entities  that performed internal control and management reviews. We assessed the  strategy using the six desirable characteristics of an effective national  strategy developed in previous GAO work. For example, GAO has used this  methodology to assess and report on the administration\u2019s strategies  relating to terrorism and restructuring the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD)  global force posture. National strategies with these characteristics offer  policy makers and implementing agencies a management tool that can help  ensure accountability and more effective results. The six characteristics  are (1) a clear purpose, scope, methodology; (2) a detailed discussion of  the problems, risks, and threats the strategy intends to address; (3) the  desired goals and objectives, and outcome-related performance measures;  (4) a description of the U.S. resources needed to implement the strategy;  (5) a clear delineation of the U.S. government roles, responsibilities, and  mechanisms for coordination; and (6) a description of how the strategy is  integrated internally among U.S. agencies and externally with the Iraqi  government and international organizations.

State  assessments and other U.S. government reports noted that this hindered  the implementation of U.S. stabilization and reconstruction plans. A review  of the U.S. mission completed in October 2005 found, among other things,  that (1) no unified strategic plan existed that effectively integrated U.S.  government political, military, and economic efforts; (2) multiple plans in  Iraq and Washington have resulted in competing priorities and funding  levels not proportional to the needs of overall mission objectives; (3)  focused leadership and clear roles are lacking among State, DOD, and other  agencies in the field and in Washington, D.C.; and (4) a more realistic  assessment of the capacity limitations of Iraqi central and local government  is needed.", "The study made a series of recommendations that led to the creation of the  November 2005 NSVI, including (1) creating a single, joint civil-military  operational plan to clarify organizational leads; (2) providing better  strategic direction and more coordinated engagement with Iraqi  government and international donors; (3) establishing three mission teams  to address political, security, and economic tasks; and (4) establishing  provincial reconstruction teams to engage Iraqi leadership and foster  flexible reconstruction, local governance, and \u201cbottom-up\u201d economic  development. The study also called for a streamlined interagency support  office in Washington, D.C., to assist the mission\u2019s working groups and  provide needed institutional memory and continuity. In response, the  administration created the NSVI in November 2005 to reorganize U.S.  government stabilization and reconstruction efforts around three broad  tracks\u2014political, security, and economic\u2014and eight strategic objectives  (see table 1).", "Overall, officials in DOD and State identified seven documents that  describe the U.S. government strategy for Iraq in addition to the NSVI. The  U.S. government uses these documents to plan, conduct, and track  different levels of the U.S. stabilization and reconstruction strategy as  follows:  National/strategic level: The President and the NSC established the  desired end-state, goals and objectives, and the integrated approach  incorporated in the NSVI. The May 2004 NSPD 36 made State  responsible for all U.S. activities in Iraq through its Chief of Mission in  Baghdad (Ambassador), with the exception of U.S. efforts relating to  security and military operations, which would be the responsibility of  DOD. The directive also continued the U.S. Central Command  (CENTCOM) responsibility for all U.S. government efforts to organize,  equip, and train Iraqi security forces. MNF-I oversees the effort to  rebuild the Iraqi security forces through a subordinate command. The  National Strategy for Supporting Iraq (NSSI) serves as a management  tool to match and coordinate U.S. stabilization and reconstruction needs  and priorities and provides updates on activities associated with each  strategic objective.", "Operational level: The Joint Mission Statement clarified the roles and  responsibilities between the Chief of Mission in Baghdad and the  Commander of MNF-I and established mission milestones and target  dates for their achievement. The August 2004 campaign plan elaborated  and refined the original plan for transferring security responsibilities to  Iraqi forces. In April 2006, Commander of the MNF-I and the Chief of  Mission in Baghdad issued a new classified Joint Campaign Plan  incorporating the changes in organization laid out in the NSVI, although  some of the annexes to this campaign plan are being reworked and were  not available as of May 2006.", "Implementation and reporting level: Operations Order 05-03  incorporates revised missions and objectives for the Multinational  Corps-Iraq (MNC-I), the MNF-I unit responsible for command and  control of operations throughout Iraq.

Since then, however, the  strategy\u2019s underlying security, reconstruction, and economic assumptions  have changed in response to changing circumstances (see fig. 2). First, the  original plan assumed a permissive security environment that never  materialized. Second, the CPA assumed that U.S. funded reconstruction  activities would help restore Iraq\u2019s essential services to prewar levels but  has failed to achieve these goals.

CPA expected that a  relatively small internal security force would replace the disbanded Iraqi  Army and would quickly assume responsibility for providing security from  the coalition forces. However, growing insurgent attacks led to (1) the  collapse of Iraqi forces in April 2004; (2) the delay of coalition plans to turn  responsibility for security over to the new Iraqi security forces beginning in  early 2004; and (3) the postponement of plans to draw down U.S. troop  levels below 138,000 until the end of 2005. In October 2004, State reported  to Congress that the uncertain security situation affected all potential  economic and political developments in Iraq and that enhanced Iraqi  security forces were critically needed to meet the new threat environment.  The coalition\u2019s military commander and the U.S. Chief of Mission  conducted strategic and programmatic reviews in mid-2004 and reached  similar conclusions, noting that the hostile security situation required the  creation of substantially larger Iraqi security forces with coalition  assistance.", "As a result, between 2003 and 2006, the projected Iraq security force  structure doubled in size, while U.S. appropriations for support of the Iraqi  security forces more than quadrupled. CPA projected the need for a  security force of about 162,000 personnel (including about 77,000 armed  forces and National Guard troops and 85,000 police) in 2003. Current plans  call for 325,500 security personnel to be organized under coalition  direction: including completing the initial training and equipping of the  137,500 in the Iraqi Armed Forces and 188,000 police and other interior  ministry forces by the end of December 2006. U.S. assistance appropriated  for Iraqi security forces and law enforcement has grown from $3.24 billion  in January 2004 to approximately $13.7 billion in June 2006.

However, the U.S. efforts have yet to restore Iraq\u2019s essential services to  prewar levels, and efforts to achieve these goals have been hindered by  security, management, and maintenance challenges. As a result, the United  States has yet to prove that it has made a difference in the Iraqi people\u2019s  quality of life.", "According to senior CPA and State officials responsible for the strategy, the  CPA\u2019s 2003 reconstruction plan assumed (1) that creating or restoring basic  essential services for the Iraqi people took priority over jobs creation and  the economy and (2) that the United States should focus its resources on  long-term infrastructure reconstruction projects because of the expertise  the United States could provide. According to the senior CPA official  tasked with developing the reconstruction plan, CPA drew up a prioritized  list of more than 2,300 construction projects in 10 sectors to be completed  in about 3 years, which were to be funded by the $18.4 billion made  available in the fiscal year 2004 supplemental appropriation for the 2004  Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund (IRRF2). The U.S. reconstruction  effort focused primarily on building or restoring essential services to  prewar levels\u2014or to a standard acceptable to and accessible by all Iraqi  citizens\u2013over the long-term with less emphasis on more immediate  development tasks. CPA initially allocated about two-thirds of the IRRF2  funds to restore essential services in the oil, water, and electricity sectors,  while more immediate projects in democracy building, private sector  development, and the employment sector received about 3 percent.", "However, the coalition\u2019s decision in November 2003 to accelerate the  return of power to a sovereign Iraqi interim government and changes in the  security situation altered these assumptions, leading the U.S.  administration to reallocate a total of $3.5 billion between January 2004  and April 2006 from the water resources and sanitation and electric sectors  to security, law enforcement, justice, and democracy building and  employment programs. For example, the mission reallocated over $555  million in IRRF2 funds to democracy programs and reallocated $105  million to improve productivity and employment in the agriculture sector  to support the Iraqi government as it prepared for elections. A World Bank  report stated that the agriculture sector employed 18 percent of Iraq\u2019s labor  force and accounted for about 10 percent of gross domestic product in  2004. Before this time, the United States had devoted no IRRF2 resources  to the agricultural sector.", "U.S. expectations about Iraq\u2019s capacity to manage and sustain its own  reconstruction efforts have not been realized and have resulted in greater  U.S. emphasis on capacity development. As reported in prior GAO reports,  the U.S. reconstruction effort has encountered difficulties in maintaining  new and rehabilitated infrastructure, resulting in some U.S.-funded  projects becoming damaged or inoperable after being turned over to the  Iraqis. For example, as of June 2005, U.S.-funded water and sanitation  projects representing about $52 million of approximately $200 million  spent on completed projects were inoperable or were operating at lower  than normal capacity. Recent U.S. mission assessments have noted the Iraqi  government\u2019s limited capacity to provide services to the Iraqi people due to  weak technical expertise, limitations in managers\u2019 skills and training, and  an inability to identify and articulate strategic priorities, and other factors.  As a result, the administration reallocated $170 million for government  capacity building programs and $133 million for infrastructure operations  and maintenance needs in 2005 and early 2006.", "As GAO has reported previously, these challenges contributed to the  cancellation or delay of projects in the essential services sectors, affecting  U.S. efforts to achieve its targets in the oil, electricity, and water sectors,  and undermining its efforts to improve the quality of life for the Iraqi  people. A March 2006 poll of Iraqi citizens indicated that over half the  respondents thought Iraq was heading in the wrong direction. Moreover,  the poll reports that over the last year, growing numbers believe that the  security situation, the provision of electricity, the prevalence of corruption,  and the state of the economy worsened."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Expected Level of Iraq and International Community Financial Support for Iraq\u2019s Developmental Needs Have Not Yet Been Met", "paragraphs": ["From the outset of the reconstruction and stabilization effort, the U.S.  strategy assumed that the Iraqis and the international community would  help finance Iraq\u2019s developmental needs. However, these expectations have  not yet been met, and Iraq\u2019s estimated future reconstruction needs vastly  exceed what has been offered to date. According to a CPA report and  senior CPA and State officials, the 2003 CPA plan assumed that the Iraqis  and the international community would support development needs that  were not financed by the United States. For example, a CPA report  assumed that Iraqi oil revenues could help pay for reconstruction costs  because it estimated that Iraq\u2019s oil production would increase to about 2.8  to 3.0 million barrels per day (mbpd) by the end of 2004, a one-third  increase over 2002 levels, and generate about $15 billion in oil export  revenue for the year.", "These expectations about Iraq\u2019s ability to contribute to and manage its own  reconstruction have not been realized in practice. U.S. agency documents  estimated Iraq\u2019s 2003 actual prewar crude oil production at 2.6 mbpd. In  March 2006, State reported that oil production was about 2 mbpd. A  combination of insurgent attacks on crude oil and product pipelines,  dilapidated infrastructure, and poor operations and maintenance have  hindered domestic refining and have required Iraq to import significant  portions of liquefied petroleum gas, gasoline, kerosene, and diesel. In  addition, although the capacity for export is theoretically as high as 2.5  mbpd, export levels averaged about 1.4 mbpd in 2005. Shortfalls in  expected oil production levels and increased security spending contributed  to reductions in Iraq\u2019s own projections of how much of the budget would be  available to contribute to its own reconstruction. In 2005, Iraq\u2019s  government budgeted approximately $5 billion for capital expenditures,  but a senior U.S. mission official stated that they managed to spend only a  few hundred million by the end of the year. He attributed this to Iraq  ministries\u2019 lack of expertise to manage projects, write contracts, and  provide effective controls on the contracting process.", "The strategy\u2019s assumptions about the need for extensive international  donor support for rebuilding Iraq\u2019s reconstruction have not significantly  changed since 2003, although the estimated cost of restoring Iraq\u2019s  infrastructure has grown significantly since October 2003. At that time, a  World Bank, United Nations, and CPA assessment initially estimated that it  would cost about $56 billion to meet reconstruction needs across a variety  of sectors in Iraq. The United States committed about $24 billion for relief  and reconstruction in fiscal years 2003 and 2004, with the expectation the  Iraqis and the international community would provide the rest. Other  foreign donors pledged about $13.6 billion to rebuild Iraq. According to  State documents, international donors have provided over $3.5 billion in  the form of multilateral and bilateral grants as of April 2006. About $10  billion, or 70 percent, of the pledged amount is in the form of loans,  primarily from the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF),  and Japan. As GAO has reported previously, however, Iraq currently owes a  combined $84 billion to victims of its invasion of Kuwait and other external  creditors, which may limit its capacity to assume more debt. Moreover,  Iraq's needs are greater than originally anticipated due to severely  degraded infrastructure, postconflict looting and sabotage, and additional  security costs. In the oil sector alone, Iraq will now likely need an estimated  $30 billion over the next several years to reach and sustain an oil  production capacity of 5 million barrels per day, according to industry  experts and U.S. officials. For the electricity sector, Iraq projects that it will  need $20 billion through 2010 to boost electrical capacity, according to the  Department of Energy\u2019s Energy Information Administration.

Specifically, the NSVI identifies U.S.  government efforts to rebuild and stabilize Iraq in terms of three  overarching political, security, and economic objectives and addresses the  assumptions that guided its development. For example, to help Iraq achieve  the strategic goal of forging a national compact for democratic  government, the strategy\u2019s subordinate objectives state that the United  States would help promote transparency in the executive, legislative, and  judicial branches of government, and help build national institutions that  transcend regional and sectarian interests, among other activities. To help  achieve another strategic goal, building government capacity and providing  essential services, the strategy also states that the U.S. government is  helping to achieve this objective by rehabilitating critical infrastructure in  the fuel and electric power sectors. It is also rehabilitating schools,  providing new textbooks, computers, and materials; and training teachers  and school administrative staff.

U.S.  officials estimate that 60 percent of water treatment output is lost due to  leakage, contamination, and illegal connections. The U.S. mission reported  in December 2005 that it had developed a set of metrics to better estimate  the potential impact of U.S. water and sanitation reconstruction efforts on  Iraqi households, but acknowledges it is impossible to measure how much  water Iraqis are actually receiving or whether the water is potable.

Approximately $276 billion has been provided to support U.S. military  operations and forces as of June 2006, which currently number about  130,000 troops, and over $34 billion to develop capable Iraqi security  forces, restore essential services, and rebuild Iraqi institutions. The  administration has also requested about $51 billion more for military and  reconstruction operations for fiscal year 2007: including $50 billion that the  Office of Management and Budget terms \u201cbridge funding\u201d to continue the  global war on terrorism in Iraq and Afghanistan and an additional $771  million for reconstruction operations in Iraq.", "These cost data are not included in the strategy. As a result, neither DOD  nor Congress can reliably determine the cost of the war, nor do they have  details on how the appropriated funds are being spent or historical data  useful in considering future funding needs. Moreover, the strategy states  that the war in Iraq yields benefits in the global war on terrorism but does  not discuss substantial financial and other costs. In addition, GAO has  previously found numerous problems in DOD\u2019s processes for accounting  for and reporting cost data for its operations in Iraq, which constitute about  90 percent of estimated total U.S. government costs. Given the current  fiscal challenges facing the U.S. government, such an assessment would  help clarify the future costs of U.S. involvement in Iraq.", "The strategy also fails to project future costs and contributions from non- U.S. sources. It does not address the extent to which the Iraqi government  will contribute financially to its own rebuilding effort. While supporting  documents provide some information on current spending plans and  allocations, the dispersion of this budget information across numerous  budget documents makes it difficult to analyze how the objectives of the  NSVI will be funded. For example, State\u2019s quarterly 2207 reports to  Congress describe the current status of the Iraq reconstruction funding  allocations and the status of international donations for reconstruction. In  February 2006, State issued two supplemental documents that provide  some additional information on how IRRF2 funds and fiscal year 2006 and  2007 budget appropriations were to be spent across the NSVI\u2019s three tracks  (political, security, and economic). Other supporting documents partially  address these resource issues but do not identify future resource needs.  The unclassified version of the MNF-I/ U.S. Embassy Baghdad Joint  Mission Statement on Iraq indicates that budgetary and human capital  resources will be needed, and funding is expected from Congress and the  Iraqi government. However, it does not identify the specific amounts  needed to meet key U.S. goals. The 2207 reports discuss international  donor contribution levels and reports on the progress of projects funded  with international grants but does not relate these amounts to Iraqi  requirements.", "In addition, none of the strategy documents takes into account the total  cost of Iraq\u2019s reconstruction, which will be more than originally  anticipated, due to severely degraded infrastructure, postconflict looting  and sabotage, and additional security costs. Initial assessments in 2003  identified a total of $56 billion in Iraqi reconstruction needs in various  sectors, but more recent cost estimates suggest that the oil infrastructure  and electric sectors alone will require about $50 billion in the next several  years. These funding concerns have grown as resources have been shifted  from reconstruction projects to security needs. For example, between  January 2004 and April 2006, the administration reallocated $3.5 billion  from the water resources and sanitation and electric sectors to security;  justice, public safety, and civil society; and democracy building activities;  and other programs. This contributed to the cancellation, delay, or scaling  back of water and electricity projects and will complicate efforts to achieve  the objectives for these essential service sectors.", "Although the NSVI acknowledges that rampant corruption is a challenge  threatening the success of U.S. reconstruction and stabilization efforts, the  strategy does not address how reconstruction efforts should take the risk  of corruption into account when assessing the costs of achieving U.S.  objectives in Iraq. For instance, IMF, the World Bank, Japan, and European  Union officials cite corruption in the oil sector as an especially serious  problem. In addition, according to State officials and reporting documents,  about 10 percent of refined fuels are diverted to the black market, and  about 30 percent of imported fuels are smuggled out of Iraq and sold for a  profit. By not addressing this risk, the strategy cannot provide adequate  guidance to implementing parties trying to assess priorities and allocate  resources."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Strategy Partially Addresses U.S. Roles, Responsibilities, and Coordination Mechanisms", "paragraphs": ["This characteristic addresses which U.S. organization will implement the  strategy and their roles, responsibilities, and mechanisms for coordinating  their efforts. Addressing this characteristic fosters coordination and  enhances both implementation and accountability.", "The NSVI and the supporting documents partially address the roles and  responsibilities of specific U.S. government agencies and offices and the  process for coordination. To organize U.S. efforts in Iraq, the NSVI breaks  down the political, security, and economic tracks of the strategy into eight  strategic objectives (pillars) that have lines of action assigned to military  and civilian units in Iraq. Each strategic objective has a corresponding  interagency working group to coordinate policy, review and assess the  progress, develop new proposals for action, and oversee implementation of  existing policies. National Security Presidential Directive 36 made the  Department of State responsible for nonsecurity aspects of reconstruction  and lays out key roles for the U.S. Chief of Mission in Baghdad and  CENTCOM. It directed that the Commander of CENTCOM will, with the  Chief of Mission\u2019s policy guidance, direct all U.S. government efforts in  support of training and equipping Iraq security forces. It also established  the roles for the mission\u2019s two supporting offices: the Iraq Reconstruction  Management Office and the Projects and Contracting Office.", "Although the NSVI organizes the U.S. strategy along three broad tracks and  eight strategic objectives, it does not clearly identify the roles and  responsibilities of specific federal agencies for achieving these specific  objectives, or how disputes among them will be resolved. For example,  GAO found only one reference in the NSVI to the reconstruction  responsibilities of a particular U.S. government agency in Iraq when it  noted that the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other U.S. agencies  would assist an Iraqi antimajor crimes task force in the investigation of  terrorist attacks and assassinations. Thus, it is not clear which agency is  responsible for implementing the overlapping activities listed under the  eight strategic objectives. For instance, one activity is to promote  transparency in the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the Iraqi  government; however, the strategy does not indicate which agency is  responsible for implementing this activity, or who to hold accountable for  results. Moreover, little guidance is provided to assist implementing  agencies in resolving conflicts among themselves, as well as with other  entities. In our prior work, we found that delays in reconstruction efforts  sometimes resulted from lack of agreement among U.S. agencies,  contractors, and Iraqi authorities about the scope and schedule for the  work to be performed. For example, in the water resources and sanitation  sector, Iraqi and U.S. officials\u2019 disagreements over decisions to repair or  replace treatment facilities or to use brick instead of concrete have delayed  project execution."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Strategy Partially Addresses Integration with Iraqi Government and International Donors", "paragraphs": ["This characteristic addresses both how a national strategy relates to the  goals, objectives, and activities of other strategies, to other government  and international entities, and relevant documents from implementing  organizations.

For instance, the NSVI and supporting  documents identify the need to integrate the efforts of the coalition, the  Iraqi government, and other nations but do not discuss how the U.S. goals  and objectives are integrated with the strategies, goals, and objectives of  the international donors and the Iraqi government.

However, the  strategy has only partially addressed how it relates to the objectives and  activities of Iraq and the international community and does not address  what it expects the international community or the Iraqi government to pay  to achieve future objectives. This affects the strategy\u2019s ability to address  the challenge of conducting an integrated operation dependent upon Iraq\u2019s  limited capacity to contribute to its own reconstruction.

Three analysts independently assessed two selected  strategy documents using the checklist to verify its relevance and then  convened as a panel to test their ability to apply the checklist to the  information contained in the document. The team concluded that the  checklist was relevant and appropriate for assessing the NSVI. The three  analysts independently assessed the NSVI and recorded the results on  separate checklists and then met as a panel to reconcile the differences in  their scores. A separate panel of three other analysts also independently  assessed the NSVI using the same methodology, and then the two panels  met as a group to discuss similarities and resolve differences in their  scoring. In addition, the first panel of three analysts evaluated seven  additional documents applying the same criteria in the checklist.

We notified the Department of State (State) of the scope of our review.", "After the National Strategy for Victory in Iraq (NSVI) was released in  November 2005, we focused our review on whether the new strategy  and related planning documents identified by State and the Department  of Defense (DOD) addressed the desirable characteristics of an  effective national strategy. On February 10, 2006, we met with senior  State officials from the Bureau of Near East and Asia and the office of  the Senior Advisor to the Secretary of State and Coordinator for Iraq  Affairs to describe our plans and methodology for assessing the NSVI.  State officials acknowledged our methodology and identified the key  documents (both unclassified and classified) that, when combined with  the NSVI, served as the collective U.S. strategy for Iraq.  2. We modified figure 1 to place the National Strategy for Supporting Iraq  (NSSI) at the strategic level. However, we disagree that the NSSI links  goals to resources. In fact, State\u2019s comments note that the NSSI does  not specify the future military and civilian resources necessary for  achieving U.S. strategic objectives, and it is in the process of  incorporating the fiscal year 2006 supplemental budget into the NSSI.  Until State completes this linkage, it is difficult to assess whether the  NSSI will adequately link goals to resources.  3. We disagree with State\u2019s contention that we did not take into account  the fiscal year 2006 supplemental and the fiscal year 2007 budget  requests in our assessment of the NSVI. We evaluated these as part of  our review. Even though State officials did not include these documents  among those they identified as supporting the strategy. In addition, we  reviewed other U.S. government documents that provided useful  context and information, including two related reports issued by State  in February 2006: (1) Rebuilding Iraq: U.S. Achievements Through the  Iraq Relief  and Reconstruction Fund; and (2) Advancing the  President\u2019s National Strategy for Victory in Iraq : Funding Iraq\u2019s  Transition to Self-Reliance in 2006 and 2007 and Support for the  Counterinsurgency Campaign.  4. We acknowledge that the purpose of the NSVI was to provide the public  with an overview of a multitiered, classified strategy and not to set  forth every detail on information readily available elsewhere. Our  analysis was not limited to the publicly available, unclassified NSVI.

Collectively, these documents still lack all  the key characteristics of an effective national strategy. However, we  refined our recommendation to focus on the need to improve the U.S.  strategy for Iraq. 5. We disagree with State\u2019s comment that helping restore essential  services to prewar levels was not an assumption of the early U.S.  reconstruction strategy. According to the key architects of the original  Coalition Provisional Authority plan, restoring essential services to a  prewar level was a key assumption of the U.S. strategy.  6. Documents we received from State and the Department of Energy  estimated that Iraq\u2019s 2003 actual prewar crude oil production was 2.6  million barrels per day. State did not provide any additional  documentation to support their contention. In addition, the 4,300  megawatts figure cited by State is below the postwar peak of 5,400  megawatts and the planned U.S. goal of 6,000 megawatts. 7. We agree that it is not possible to make definitive statements about the  number of people nationwide with access to clean drinking water  during the prewar period because reliable data did not exist. We have  noted this problem in previous reports and testimonies. This report  describes U.S. mission efforts announced in December 2005 to develop  an improved set of metrics to better estimate the potential impact of  U.S. water and sanitation reconstruction efforts on Iraqi households.  We reviewed excerpts from this reporting and included it in our report.  However, State has not complied with our request to provide us with a  complete copy of its metrics plan to better allow us to judge the results  of its efforts.  8. As we have previously reported, subsidies for food, fuel, and electricity,  rising costs for security forces, and high costs to sustain Iraq\u2019s  bureaucracy limit Iraq\u2019s ability to contribute to its own reconstruction  efforts. While Iraq budgeted about $5 billion for capital expenditures in  2005, it only provided a few hundred million dollars by the end of the  year. Accordingly, it is too early to determine if the Iraqi government  will spend the $6.2 billion it has budgeted for capital expenditures in  2006.  9. We clarified the report to characterize the 2003 World Bank study as an  initial estimate and not a comprehensive survey. While acknowledging  that more than $56 billon will be needed to bring Iraq to a status  equivalent to other oil-producing developing nations, State does not  think that \u201ccosts\u201d have gone up. However, recent State and Department  of Energy cost estimates show that the oil infrastructure and electric  sectors alone will require about $50 billion in the next several years. In  addition, June 2006 reporting from the Department of Energy states  that Iraq could need $100 billion or more for long-term reconstruction  efforts.  10. We agree that the Iraq and U.S. governments have succeeded in  achieving debt relief for Iraq from the Paris Club and commercial  creditors. However, there is a significant amount of debt remaining,  amounting to $84 billion. This debt includes war reparations that Iraq  owes from its invasion of Kuwait. This remaining debt imposes a  continuing financial burden on the country.  11. We revised our report to include updated April 2006 figures. 12. We included the $30 billion estimate for the oil sector to illustrate the  significant future costs to restore a critical sector\u2014a sector from which  Iraq derives 90 percent of its budgetary revenues. State\u2019s Iraq  Reconstruction Management Office developed these estimates. In  addition, as noted in comment 9 above, Iraq could need $100 billion or  more for long-term reconstruction, according to a June 2006 report by  the Department of Energy.  13. We agree that it is very difficult to accurately account for corruption as  a cost in achieving the overall goals for Iraq. We recognize that State  launched an anticorruption strategy in December 2005, but this strategy  was not reflected in the documents we reviewed. We included State  estimates that help describe the magnitude of the corruption problem.", "For example, State reports that 10 percent of refined fuels are diverted  to the black market, and about 30 percent of imported fuels are  smuggled out of Iraq and sold for a profit.  14. The recently announced International Compact could be a useful  vehicle for better international coordination, but the details of the  compact\u2019s scope and function and linkage to the new donor  coordination process have not been specified. The International  Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iraq provides a coordination  mechanism among United Nations agencies, but its linkage to U.S.- funded projects is also unclear. More importantly, no single document  describes how the goals and projects of the United States, Iraq, and the  international community are or will be linked to achieve maximum  effectiveness and avoid duplication of effort."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["Stephen M.
