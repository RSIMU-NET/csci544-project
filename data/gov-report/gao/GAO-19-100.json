For example, Treasury periodically collects performance data from housing finance agencies (HFA) and analyzes and validates these data. However, while Treasury requires HFAs to regularly assess the risks of their programs, it does not systematically collect or analyze these assessments. As a result, Treasury is missing an opportunity to ensure that HFAs are appropriately assessing their risk. Also, Treasury does not require HFAs to consistently document which of their staff are responsible for internal control execution. This documentation could help HFAs wind down their programs, particularly as staff turn over.", "Most HFAs met Treasury's goals for drawing down HHF funds, with $9.1 billion disbursed to HFAs as of September 2018. HHF programs have assisted hundreds of thousands of distressed homeowners since 2010. However, the data Treasury has collected are of limited use for determining how well HFAs met their goals for assisting households and demolishing blighted properties, or for evaluating the HHF program overall. For example, Treasury did not develop a consistent methodology for HFAs to use when setting performance targets, which limits Treasury's ability to compare across programs or assess the HHF program as a whole. Further, GAO's guide to designing evaluations states that where federal programs operate through multiple local public or private agencies, it is important that the data these agencies collect are sufficiently consistent to permit aggregation nationwide. Although HFAs have until the end of 2021 to disburse their HHF funds, many programs are beginning to close, making it too late for meaningful changes to Treasury's approach to performance measurement. However, should Congress authorize Treasury to extend the program beyond December 2021 or establish a similar program in the future, it would be useful at that time for Treasury to develop a program evaluation design that would allow the agency to assess overall program performance, as well as performance across HFAs and program types."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that Treasury collect and evaluate HFAs' risk assessments and routinely update staffing documentation.

Through TARP, Treasury funded housing programs intended to help  prevent avoidable foreclosures and preserve homeownership, including  the TARP Housing Finance Agency Innovation Fund for Hardest Hit  Markets, also known as the Hardest Hit Fund (HHF). HHF, established in  2010, provides funding to selected states to develop innovative solutions  to housing market difficulties in their states.

We identified 14 monitoring and oversight practices based  on a review of federal internal control standards, Office of Management  and Budget (OMB) guidance, and GAO reports on leading monitoring  activities. Although Treasury is not required to follow all of the guidance  that we identified, we determined that the guidance describes practices  that are helpful for creating an effective monitoring framework. We  selected practices that focused on the structure of Treasury\u2019s oversight  framework, the performance measures Treasury requires HFAs to track,  goal setting, and communication with external parties. We assessed the  extent to which Treasury\u2019s current monitoring policies and procedures  addressed the leading practices. More specifically, we determined  whether Treasury\u2019s monitoring policies and procedures addressed,  partially addressed, or did not address leading practices.

For each of these programs,  we reviewed the HFA\u2019s contract with Treasury to identify the most current  targets for either assisting homeowners or demolishing blighted  properties. We also analyzed quarterly performance reports on program  outputs (defined as the products or services delivered) and outcomes  (defined as the consequences of carrying out an activity). Through a  review of program documentation and information from knowledgeable  officials, we found that Treasury\u2019s output data on homeowners assisted  and blighted properties demolished were sufficiently reliable for the  purpose of describing program outputs. However, as we discuss later in  this report, we found that outcomes data, such as the number of  homeowners who are no longer participating in HHF programs, were not  sufficiently reliable for our purposes due to differences in HFAs\u2019  interpretations of outcomes data definitions, among other things.", "To identify the factors that HFAs and other stakeholders viewed as  challenges for the HHF program, we reviewed related audit reports and  interviewed officials from four HFAs, selected based on their mix of HHF  programs, proportion of HHF funds disbursed, and geographic diversity.  For two of these HFAs, which had blight-elimination programs, we  conducted site visits to observe activities related to blight elimination  efforts. For this and the other objectives, we also interviewed mortgage  servicers and organizations that work with HFAs and housing counseling  agencies.

All four HFAs and various  stakeholders with whom we spoke told us that staff turnover at HFAs  presents challenges. In some cases, turnover has been related to the way  the HHF program has been funded. For example, staff from two HFAs  mentioned that either they let staff go or their temporary staff found more  permanent positions as the agencies spent down their initial HHF funds.  When Congress authorized Treasury to make additional TARP funds  available to HHF beginning in 2016, these HFAs had to hire and train new  staff. Treasury officials told us that many HFAs encountered staffing  challenges as a result of the program\u2019s fifth funding round.

Staff from most of the HFAs and servicers  with whom we spoke, as well as Treasury staff and other stakeholders,  told us that implementation of the HHF program was challenging. Specific  implementation challenges mentioned by HFAs included creating an in- house information system to manage HHF data; managing refinancing  requests from homeowners who have been awarded HHF funds (to help  ensure the HFA\u2019s place as a lien-holder); and sharing information with  servicers. While Treasury helped to develop a system to facilitate the  sharing of loan-level information for the HHF program, one HFA and  some servicers noted that the system has not always worked smoothly.  Additionally, Treasury staff told us that a challenge HFAs are currently  facing is the wind-down of the HHF program. They stated that HFAs must  determine how they should advertise to the public, internal staff, and  external partners that programs are closing; when they should stop  accepting applications; and what resources are available for activities  related to program closeout.", "Outreach to homeowners. All four HFAs and an advocacy organization  told us that it can be challenging to effectively reach eligible homeowners.  As an example, staff from one HFA told us that housing counseling  agencies have been an effective tool for making homeowners aware of  HHF programs but that there are fewer foreclosure counselors available  to homeowners now compared to when the HHF program started in 2010.  Staff from an HFA that closed its HHF programs to new applicants after  the initial funding rounds told us that it was challenging to communicate to  the public, and therefore to potential clients, that its HHF programs were  reopening after they received additional funding. Additionally, a  representative of a nonprofit organization that works to address  challenges in the mortgage market told us that many people did not know  about the HHF program and that program information was hard for  consumers to find on many states\u2019 websites.", "Program accessibility. According to academic research and two  stakeholders (an advocacy group and a housing counseling agency), the  accessibility of an HFA\u2019s program can affect program participation. A  2014 study of Ohio\u2019s HHF program found that the design of the program  hampered accessibility and therefore program participation. The  program was designed to require registrants (those who started the application process) to continue the application process by working with a  housing counseling agency. The study found that registrants who lived  within 5 miles of their assigned housing counseling agency submitted a  complete application almost 32 percent of the time, while those who lived  over 50 miles away submitted a complete application about 18 percent of  the time. Similarly, a representative for an organization that advocates on  behalf of low-income homeowners noted that the design of one state HHF  program requires applicants to meet with specific housing counseling  agencies to complete the application process. However, the housing  counseling agencies to which applicants are assigned may not be nearby.  The representative stated that in some cases, homeowners are assigned  to a housing counseling agency that is located 3 or 4 hours away from  where the homeowners live. According to the advocacy group  representative, this design is particularly challenging for elderly  homeowners who may have trouble applying online and need personal  help.", "Additionally, representatives for a housing counseling agency told us that  their state HFA stopped involving community organizations to guide  applicants throughout the application process once the HFA received  additional HHF funding in 2016 and instead chose to work with applicants  directly. They said this design may hurt homeowners who do not live near  the HFA and would benefit from in-person assistance that could be  provided close to their homes. A representative from the state\u2019s HFA  confirmed that the HFA decided to work directly with applicants once it  received additional HHF funds in 2016. The representative stated that  while homeowners could also apply for HHF assistance online (after the  HFA changed the program design in 2016), the HFA\u2019s system did not  accept electronic signatures. Thus, homeowners without the ability to  print and scan documents would need to come to the HFA\u2019s office to  complete the application process.", "Variety of programs and their status. Treasury officials noted that the  wide variety of programs that HFAs are implementing can create  operational challenges for HFAs. As an example, the officials explained  that HFAs may encounter challenges when their programs require  coordination with local partners. For example, land banks can encounter  delays in acquiring properties for demolition, and contractors may not do  demolition work properly or may attempt to increase the amounts that  they charge for their work after winning a contract.", "Five mortgage servicers with whom we spoke described similar  challenges. For example, representatives from one servicer told us that it  was challenging to work with the 19 different HFAs because they all  implemented different HHF programs. The representative added that it  was particularly challenging if an HFA had a change in either leadership  or points of contact for the HHF program. Another servicer explained that  servicers have to review each HFA\u2019s participation agreement and  subsequent updates. This servicer noted that updates to agreements can  create challenges, as the servicer needs to determine whether it can  provide what the HFA is requesting. Representatives from this and a third  servicer told us that it would have been helpful for servicers to have an  up-to-date list of active HHF programs. Further, one servicer told us that it  is challenging to help homeowners understand that each HFA and  program has different requirements and guidelines. As previously  discussed, Treasury communicates information to stakeholders, such as  servicers, through regular conference calls. However, Treasury expects  HFAs to keep their servicers abreast of the status of HHF programs  because HFAs contract directly with servicers.", "Representatives from one HFA noted that it was challenging to keep  servicers updated on changes to their HHF programs. For example, they  reported that when the HFA made changes to its unemployment program,  servicers confused the program with another of the agency\u2019s HHF  programs. The representatives also stated that they have had to make  many phone calls to try to keep servicers up to date.", "External factors. Treasury officials and other stakeholders noted that  external factors such as changing market needs and natural disasters  have created challenges for some HFAs. Treasury officials noted that  some HFAs have had to change their HHF programs over time to  respond to changes in local housing conditions. An organization that  advocates for HFAs as well as an HFA similarly noted that changing  housing markets present challenges for HFAs, which have to adjust their  program offerings in an effort to continue to serve homeowners. As  previously discussed, HFAs must obtain Treasury approval to add or  revise their HHF programs, and they must document the changes by  amending participation agreements. Treasury officials also noted that  natural disasters can affect HHF programs because HFAs have to turn  their attention to post-disaster housing needs.

The  report maintained that some HFAs were using their administrative funds  for expenses that were unnecessary. In a May 2018 hearing, SIGTARP  testified that some HFAs were not following federal cost principles related  to administrative expenses. Additionally, SIGTARP has issued reports  describing mismanagement of the HHF program by specific HFAs, as well  as challenges related to blight removal.

Further, by not evaluating these risk assessments, Treasury is  missing an opportunity to help ensure that risk levels are appropriate.", "As HFAs wind down their HHF programs and HFA staff are relieved of  their HHF-related positions, maintaining updated and accurate staffing  information can help ensure that HFA staff are informed of who in  their own offices is responsible for internal control execution.", "Because Treasury did not implement the HHF program in a manner that  is consistent with standards for program evaluation design we previously  identified, the performance data that Treasury collects do not provide  significant insights into the program\u2019s effectiveness. More specifically,  Treasury did not clearly state some of its performance measures; lacks documentation of the relationship between program outputs and  overall goals; did not design consistent methodologies for HFAs to use in setting did not require participating HFAs to use consistent methodologies to  calculate outcomes.", "As a result, Treasury cannot aggregate key performance data or compare  performance data across HFAs or HHF program types to demonstrate the  results of the HHF program. As we have previously reported, OMB has  set the expectation that agencies should conduct evaluations of federal  programs. Moreover, our guide to designing evaluations states that where  federal programs operate through multiple local public or private  agencies, it important to ensure the data these agencies collect are  sufficiently consistent to permit aggregation nationwide in order to  evaluate progress toward national goals. Although HHF programs must  stop disbursing funds by December 31, 2021, many of the programs have  already ended or are in the process of winding down, making it too late  for changes to Treasury\u2019s approach to performance measurement to have  a meaningful impact. However, we note that if Treasury were to extend  the current program, as it did after Congress provided additional funding  in 2015, or if Congress were to establish a similar program due to a future  housing crisis, it would be useful at that time for Treasury to develop a  program evaluation design that would allow the agency to assess overall  program performance, as well as assess performance across HFAs and  program types."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following two recommendations to Treasury:  The Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions should annually collect  and evaluate HFAs\u2019 risk assessments, which include HFAs\u2019 risk levels.

To create the framework, we reviewed key reports  and guidance related to monitoring, oversight, and performance  management. In particular we reviewed relevant leading practices from  internal control standards; previous GAO work on results-oriented  performance goals and measures,  key attributes for successful  performance measures, characteristics for successful hierarches of  performance measures, and managing fraud risk; and Office of  Management and Budget guidance on oversight. Although Treasury is  not required to follow all of the guidance that we identified, we determined  that the guidance describes practices that are helpful for creating an  effective monitoring framework.", "To select the practices for the scorecard, we focused on practices  relevant to the structure of an oversight framework (including fraud risk);  performance measures; goal setting; and communication with external  parties. We reviewed key reports and guidance and then vetted our  selected practices with stakeholders knowledgeable about performance  measurement, design methodology, fraud risk, and the law. Based on this  review and input, we consolidated identified practices into 14 leading  practices to apply to Treasury\u2019s monitoring framework.", "We then assessed Treasury\u2019s policies and procedures against the  framework. Specifically, we reviewed the agencies\u2019 documented policies  and procedures, reviewed documentation of how Treasury followed its  policies and procedures, conducted interviews with Treasury staff  responsible for overseeing HHF, and interviewed stakeholders, such as  mortgage servicers, about Treasury\u2019s monitoring of HHF. We also  interviewed staff from four HFAs about Treasury\u2019s monitoring of their  programs; we selected the HFAs based on their mix of HHF programs,  proportion of HHF funds disbursed, and geographic diversity. We also  took into account whether stakeholders indicated that an HFA\u2019s  implementation of the program was particularly successful or challenging.  With regard to the documentation Treasury collects as part of its  monitoring, we limited our review to its 2016 and 2017 monitoring  activities, and we limited our review of Treasury\u2019s written policies and  procedures to those implemented from January 2016 to September 2018.  Two analysts independently reviewed agency policies and procedures to  determine whether the policies were consistent with the 14 identified  leading practices. Any disagreements in the determinations were resolved  through discussion or with a third party, including the General Counsel\u2019s  office. We categorized each practice as follows:", "Addressed: Treasury\u2019s policies and procedures reflect each  component of the leading practice.", "Partially addressed: Treasury\u2019s policies and procedures reflect some  but not all components of the leading practice.", "Not addressed: Treasury\u2019s policies and procedures do not reflect any  of the components of the leading practice  To describe active HHF programs and the status of HFAs\u2019 progress  toward program goals, we reviewed program documents, administered a  data collection instrument, and spoke with officials at four HFAs (selected  as previously described) and Treasury. We defined active programs as  those that had a total allocation approved by Treasury and were  accepting applications and still disbursing funds to households or blight  elimination projects as of December 2017. In order to identify which  programs were active, we developed, collected, and reviewed a  questionnaire in which HFAs provided information on when each of their  HHF programs started and stopped disbursing funds. For each of the 71  active programs we identified, we reviewed quarterly performance reports  as of December 2017 to compile descriptive information such as program  outputs and outcomes.", "Through the review of program documentation and interviews with  knowledgeable officials, we found that Treasury\u2019s output data were  sufficiently reliable for our description of homeowners assisted and  properties demolished. We also found that the data Treasury collected  from HFAs on program outcomes were not reliable for the purpose of  summarizing alternative outcomes by HFA or by program type. Treasury  officials noted that the conclusions that can be drawn from alternative  outcome data are inherently limited, particularly for the purpose of making  comparisons between HFAs or program types, due to HFAs interpreting  certain outcome measures differently, among other factors. Additionally,  by comparing Treasury\u2019s outcome measures to leading practices, we  found that their definitions were not clearly stated.", "We also identified four studies on the impact of HHF blight elimination  programs and reviewed them for reliable methodology. We determined  that one of the four studies was not reliable for the purpose of assessing  the impact of blight programs on targeted areas. Two of the three studies  that we determined to be reliable had important limitations. One study  examined 1 of the 18 counties that were served by that HFA\u2019s blight  elimination program. The other study did not isolate the independent  effect of the HFA\u2019s blight elimination program because other factors, such as local economic conditions, could also affect the performance of key  economic indicators. We reviewed each HFA\u2019s contract with Treasury  as of December 2017 to identify each program\u2019s target for assisting  homeowners or demolishing blighted properties. Through comparison  with internal control standards, we found that these targets were not  reliable for the purpose of describing HFAs\u2019 progress toward program  goals because they were not stated in a form that permitted reasonably  consistent measurement.", "To describe the factors Treasury identified as challenges for the HHF  program, we analyzed Treasury\u2019s on-site compliance monitoring reports  for 2016 and 2017. As a part of our analysis, we identified the HFAs that  Treasury visited in 2016 and 2017 and the extent to which Treasury had  observations related to five Treasury-identified areas: monitoring  processes and internal controls, eligibility, program expenses and  income, administrative expenses, and reporting.", "We also interviewed key stakeholders regarding their views of challenges  related to implementation of the HHF program, particularly since 2012.  We discussed challenges with Treasury staff with responsibilities for  monitoring HFAs\u2019 implementation of the program; staff from four HFAs  that are implementing HHF programs; six mortgage servicers that are  involved with the HHF program; and two housing counseling agencies  that are involved with the HHF program. For two of the HFAs with blight  elimination programs, we conducted site visits to observe activities  related to blight elimination. Additionally, we discussed challenges with  other interested organizations, including an association for HFAs and an  organization that brings together housing counselors, mortgage  companies, investors, and other mortgage market participants to help  address challenges in the mortgage market.
