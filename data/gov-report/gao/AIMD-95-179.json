However, within federal budgeting and financial management, operational definitions for the term \u201caccount\u201d vary depending on the user and the purpose to be served. For example, congressional appropriators establish budget accounts to facilitate congressional allocation and oversight responsibilities. The President\u2019s budget presentation generally reflects this structure but may consolidate separate items into a single account.Agency officials use these budget account structures to report to the Congress and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), but they often rely on more detailed account structures\u2014such as standard general ledger accounts which integrate proprietary and budgetary accounting, internal budgetary allotment schedules, or project and activity plans maintained by program managers\u2014to monitor expenditures and performance and for other management needs.", "Once defined, accounts may be quantified in various ways depending on the user and the purpose to be served. A wide variety of budgetary information and subsidiary classifications are available to meet the many needs of different users. For example, users interested in relative priorities within the annual budget process might concentrate on budget authority; those interested in the approaches used by government to address its needs might look to obligations; and those interested in deficits and how much the government ultimately spends might emphasize outlays. Each perspective would produce a different, but equally valid, universe of budget accounts.", "For this report, we have used budgetary resources as reported in the President\u2019s budget presentation to define and measure the universe of accounts. Budgetary resources are equivalent to all available budget authority\u2014appropriations, borrowing and contract authority, reappropriations, and offsetting collections from the public and other federal organizations, net of transferred authority and statutory limitations. This approach captures a very large universe by including all accounts with budgetary resources available for obligation, but it can be confusing when compared to the outlays occurring in a given fiscal year. Because budgetary resources include current and permanent authority as well as resources available from offsetting collections and from prior years, they may vary significantly from outlays. This was the case for the fiscal year 1995 estimate, as reported in the President\u2019s fiscal year 1996 budget, which projected budgetary resources of $2.5 trillion and net outlays of $1.5 trillion.", "Lastly, it might be inferred that discussing budget accounts as a structure, rather than as separate and independent decisions as indicated by the 1985 act quoted above, suggests that there is or should be a set of coherent rules and criteria. This is not our intention. In this report, we examine budget accounts collectively for two reasons. First, the concept of a budget account structure is accepted among budget practitioners and academics and allows for succinct references to an ever-changing and complex environment. Second, analyses which describe the budget account structure in terms of the characteristics and patterns of its constituent parts\u2014the separate accounts\u2014can provide rich insights into the federal budget process and are necessary to the consideration of cross-cutting proposals.", "For example, the following recent congressional actions and administration initiatives call for or suggest certain cross-cutting changes to budget accounts.", "The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993 was enacted to enhance program management, public accountability, and congressional decision-making by establishing a process to set strategic and annual program goals and to measure accomplishments.

We reviewed the fiscal year 1995 accounts of three judgmentally selected organizations\u2014the Departments of Energy (DOE), HHS, and Treasury\u2014and found that these accounts appear to emphasize program and process orientations to a greater extent than objects and organizations. Within these three organizations, program and process accounts represented 60 percent of accounts and 55 percent of total budgetary resources.", "Each of the four orientations used in this report\u2014object, organization, process, and program\u2014reflects a specific focus or interest of the Congress. An object orientation emphasizes the items of expense, while an organization orientation focuses on the responsible governmental unit. In effect, the former stresses control of spending on an item-by-item basis; the latter accentuates accountability. Accounts with a process orientation concentrate on the specific operations or approaches underlying federal activities, while those with a program orientation focus on the missions and objectives of governmental units.", "Object, organization, process, and program orientations are found throughout the federal budget account structure.

For example, the costs of providing Medicare are spread among at least three accounts with different orientations: Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund (program orientation), Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund (program orientation), and Program Management (object orientation). Other programs separate accounts for salaries and expenses from other program expenditure accounts. Conversely, some accounts include the costs of a number of programs and activities within a single account.

Over one-third of fiscal year 1995 budget accounts have access to offsetting collections.

As part of its annual process to develop the President\u2019s budget, OMB uses its MAX budget system to collect a wide variety of information from all branches of government, from executive departments and organizations, and from independent agencies. We obtained MAX data for the fiscal year 1996 budget, which included the current year 1995 estimates used in this report. Although we did not independently verify the extracted data for each budget account, we reconciled total budget authority and certain data from a judgmentally selected subset of accounts to the published Budget of the U.S. Government, Fiscal Year 1996\u2014Appendix.", "To define a universe of budget accounts, we extracted current year 1995 estimates of gross budgetary resources from the 1996 budget data. Gross budgetary resources are equivalent to gross budget authority given in the current year and available for obligation from prior years, net of transfers out, enacted rescissions, and statutory limitations on the use of authority.Any regular account reporting such resources was extracted and compiled into a separate database we used for this project. We verified our approach with OMB to ensure that we were accurately identifying and collecting budgetary data consistent with the concept of gross budgetary resources.", "We chose gross budgetary resources as the operational definition of a budget account for two reasons. First, it is a concept that fulfills a wide variety of federal budget needs, from congressional oversight and appropriations to program management. Second, this definition ensured the largest possible universe of accounts with available budget authority for our study. In effect, this approach caused a selection of all budget accounts which had available and enacted spending authority and thus could be the source of federal commitments (or obligations) during fiscal year 1995.", "Budget authority is heterogeneous in nature. It is provided in many different forms, covers many different time periods, and reflects congressional expectations ranging from indefinite authority that may never be used (such as borrowing authority) to definite authority which generally is expected to be outlayed in the current year (such as current appropriations). As a result, it is not additive, either across programs or organizations for a specific year or across a series of years for one program or organization. However, even with this qualification, we have aggregated budgetary resources in this report, as OMB does in its annual Historical Tables. Just as OMB recognizes the need for historical data on this subject, we recognize a comparable need for current data to express the totality of current obligational authority.", "For each account reporting gross budgetary resources, we extracted a variety of information from the OMB MAX system.", "To determine the federal organization, we extracted the agency code for each account. In the analyses contained in this report, we identify the major branches and organizations that are separately presented in the President\u2019s budget. Other entities listed as \u201cother independent agencies\u201d in the budget are separately identified in specific analyses in this report when the entity represents a significant number of accounts and/or budgetary resources. Thus, the actual federal organizations listed in analyses based on appropriations subcommittees will differ slightly from those used in other analyses.", "To determine the congressional decision-making structure, we extracted the appropriations bill originating subcommittee code for each account. The MAX system indicates both the spending jurisdiction (appropriations or authorizing committee) and the specific appropriations subcommittee associated with each authority action for each account. For analyses in which appropriations subcommittee was a variable, only accounts (and resources within those accounts) for which a specific appropriations subcommittee took action are included. In addition, because the MAX system does not indicate the appropriations subcommittee associated with budgetary resources available from prior years, analyses involving appropriations subcommittees and resource types exclude any budgetary resources available from prior years. Therefore, the universe of accounts and budgetary resources for analyses involving appropriations subcommittees is smaller than the universe used in the remainder of this report.", "To comment on the mission(s) addressed by the budgetary resources of an account, we extracted budget function information. The budget function classification system describes 18 broad areas of national need and was developed to provide a coherent and comprehensive basis for analyzing and understanding the budget. In some cases, the budgetary resources of a single account may be coded to multiple functions. In these cases, we assigned the account to the budget function which received the majority of the account\u2019s budget authority in fiscal year 1995. However, budgetary resources in multi-function accounts were allocated to each of the functions according to the distribution of budget authority in the account.", "To determine the type of budgetary resources available to an account, we aggregated data from the OMB MAX system into four components: prior year authority, current year authority, permanent authority, and offsetting collections. Prior year authority reflects the balances of budget authority from previous years that remain available for obligation. Current authority is budget authority provided in fiscal year 1995 appropriations acts, while permanent authority is provided in standing authorizing legislation. Offsetting collections represent authority that results from the receipt of collections from other government accounts or collections from the public that are of a business-type or market-oriented nature. Offsetting collections are usually a form of permanent authority. However, in this report, we segregated offsetting collections because the cyclical or business-type nature of such authority differs from other permanent authority.", "To determine the extent of restrictions associated with the resources within an account, we extracted fund type information from the OMB MAX system. All governmental activities are financed through federal funds or trust funds. Federal funds are further separated into (1) general funds or special funds, to distinguish unrestricted receipts from those that are earmarked for a specific purpose, and (2) public enterprise funds or intragovernmental revolving funds, to distinguish between receipts arising from a cycle of business-type operations from the public or governmental organizations. Although trust funds are segregated into revolving and nonrevolving funds, for this report, we have aggregated both into a single trust fund category.", "We computed median accounts, in terms of budgetary resources, to determine representative account sizes for federal mission, federal organization, appropriations subcommittee, and fund type. Statistical medians are particularly useful when wide variations exist across multiple dimensions. Unlike other statistical measures of central tendency (for example, averages), medians are not influenced by a few extremely large or small values and thus yield a more representative account size. We displayed ranges of account size with the median to illustrate variability.", "To describe the predominant interests of the Congress in enacting an account, we defined four orientations\u2014object, organization, process, and program. These orientations were derived from a literature search which focused on the key events or developments associated with federal budgeting practices and are not directly associated with a particular data element in the OMB MAX system. Using the definitions we developed for each of these orientations, we reviewed each of the accounts in three judgmentally selected organizations and all accounts with more than $1 billion and less than $1 million in resources. To aid in assigning the accounts to an orientation, we reviewed the account\u2019s title, statutory language, narrative statement, and budget presentations. Many accounts possess aspects which made assignment to a single orientation very difficult and somewhat arbitrary. Thus, the assignments presented in this report should be seen as suggestive or indicative, rather than definitive.", "Lastly, to develop historical and anecdotal data on the federal budget account structure, we performed literature searches and conducted interviews with budget specialists in academia, OMB, the Congressional Research Service, and the Congressional Budget Office. We also reviewed written documents produced by OMB, the National Performance Review, and the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board.", "Our work was performed in Washington, D.C., from April 1995 through May 1995."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Major Contributors to This Report", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Accounting and Information Management Division, Washington, D.C.", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Selected Bibliography", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["Managing for Results: Strengthening Financial and Budgetary Reporting (GAO/T-AIMD-95-181, July 11, 1995).", "Government Restructuring: Identifying Potential Duplication in Federal Missions and Approaches (GAO/T-AIMD-95-161, June 7, 1995).", "Budget Function Classification: Agency Spending by Subfunction and Object Category, Fiscal Year 1994 (GAO/AIMD-95-116FS, May 10, 1995).", "Budget Function Classification: Agency Spending and Personnel Levels for Fiscal Years 1994 and 1995 (GAO/AIMD-95-115FS, April 11, 1995).", "Budget Function Classification: Relating Agency Spending and Personnel Levels to Budget Functions (GAO/AIMD/GGD-95-69FS, Jan. 30, 1995).", "Management Reform: Implementation of the National Performance Review\u2019s Recommendations (GAO/OCG-95-1, Dec. 5, 1994).", "Budget Object Classification: Origins and Recent Trends (GAO/AIMD-94-147, Sept. 13, 1994).", "Management Reform: GAO\u2019s Comments on the National Performance Review\u2019s Recommendations (GAO/OCG-94-1, Dec. 3, 1993).", "Budget Issues: Assessing Executive Order 12837 on Reducing Administrative Expenses (GAO/AIMD-94-15, Nov. 17, 1993).", "Budget Issues: Financial Reporting to Better Support Decision-making (GAO/AFMD-93-22, June 1993).", "A Glossary of Terms Used in the Federal Budget Process (GAO/AFMD-2.1.1, Jan. 1993).", "Budget Issues: The Use of Spending Authority and Permanent Appropriations is Widespread (GAO/AFMD-87-44, July 17, 1987)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Publications", "paragraphs": ["Caiden, Naomi. \u201cGuidelines to Federal Budget Reform.\u201d Public Budgeting and Finance, Vol. 3, Winter 1983, pp. 4-22.", "Caldwell, Kenneth S. \u201cThe Accounting Aspects of Budgetary Reform: Can We Have Meaningful Reform Without Significant Changes in Traditional Accounting Practices?\u201d Governmental Finance, Vol. 7, Aug. 1978, pp. 10-17.", "The Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government (\u201cThe Hoover Commission\u201d).
