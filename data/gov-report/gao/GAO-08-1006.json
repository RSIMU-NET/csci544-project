In addition to its increase in NIV workload, Mission Mexico will be facing increases in its passport workload due to the implementation of WHTI. The magnitude of the increase in passport workload is more difficult to forecast than for NIVs because there is a great deal of uncertainty as to how many U.S. citizens live in Mexico and the number of these citizens likely to apply for a passport. Mission Mexico has already seen a significant increase in its passport workload as U.S. citizens living in Mexico have begun to apply for passports in response to the new documentary requirements. State forecasts that passport workload will peak in fiscal year 2009 with WHTI's anticipated implementation at land ports of entry. State is taking steps to help ensure U.S. consulates in Mexico keep pace with anticipated demand for NIVs and U.S. passports, including adding interviewing windows to several high-demand posts and planning to hire about 100 temporary adjudicating officers. Consular officials at several posts generally agreed these efforts to expand resources should be adequate for Mission Mexico to keep pace with expected workload increases, and GAO's analysis indicates the mission will generally have enough interviewing windows during the surge. Several posts will rely on additional temporary adjudicators to keep pace with increased demand. State is confident it has an adequate pool of potential applicants. Mission Mexico may also gain additional capacity from a pilot program, under way at two posts, outsourcing a portion of the NIV application process to off-site facilities.

In addition to the surge in demand caused by the  expiring Border Crossing Cards, State officials anticipate that Mission  Mexico will also continue to experience steady growth in demand from  first-time visa applicants. To assist in preparing for these increases, State  has developed forecasts of the expected future NIV workload in Mexico.  In doing so, State first developed a forecast of the underlying demand from  new applicants. To determine the forecast of underlying demand, State  calculated the average NIV demand for Mission Mexico for fiscal years  2005 to 2007. This serves as the starting point for the underlying demand  line shown in figure 2. Then, State calculated an annual increase in  underlying demand to account for estimated growth over time. Using  underlying demand as a baseline, State then developed a range of  forecasts that reflect differing assumptions about the percentage of Border  Crossing Card holders who will renew their cards when they expire. As  figure 2 shows, these different assumptions about the number of Border  Crossing Cards that will be renewed can significantly impact the  anticipated levels of NIV demand. For example, at the surge peak in fiscal  year 2011, forecasted demand ranges from around 2.5 million applications  if 50 percent of Border Crossing Card holders renew, to 3.4 million  applications if 100 percent renew. According to State officials, the 75  percent renewal rate is the most likely scenario. Assuming a 75 percent  renewal rate among card holders, the forecasts show missionwide NIV  demand peaking at slightly less than 3 million applications in fiscal year  2011, which represents a 94 percent increase in demand from fiscal year  2007. State intends to monitor renewal rates as the surge progresses to  help refine its assumptions about likely demand.", "In addition to the missionwide forecast, State has developed demand  forecasts for individual consulates. As shown in figure 3, which assumes a  75 percent renewal rate for Border Crossing Cards, State\u2019s forecasts  anticipate NIV demand peaking in fiscal year 2011 for the majority of  posts, although demand is expected to peak in fiscal year 2012 for  Monterrey and Hermosillo. State forecasts that Mexico City will have the  highest overall demand, with applications growing to over 600,000 in fiscal  year 2011, but anticipates that the steepest increases in demand will occur  at border posts, as shown in figure 4.", "This pattern is similar to the previous Border Crossing Card surge, where  the border consulates assumed a greater share of the total mission  workload during the surge, with this share then diminishing again at the  surge\u2019s end. As shown in figure 4, Tijuana is forecasted to experience the  most significant increases of any post\u2014between fiscal years 2007 and 2011  the post\u2019s demand is anticipated to increase 226 percent. Ciudad Juarez  and Nuevo Laredo have the second-and third-highest increases at 212  percent and 207 percent, respectively."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Despite Uncertainties, State\u2019s Forecasts Provide a Reasonable Basis for Planning for the Expected Surge in Workload", "paragraphs": ["Estimating future NIV demand is inherently uncertain, and State  acknowledges that various factors may reduce the accuracy of its  forecasts. For one, State is unsure as to the percentage of Border Crossing  Card holders who will renew their cards when they expire. Some card  holders have had their cards lost or stolen and have already had them  replaced at a consulate. Other card holders have either legally or illegally  immigrated to the United States and will not be returning to renew their  cards. Finally, some applicants may decide to defer renewals for various  reasons, including the recent rise in NIV fees, or because they have no  immediate travel plans. Given these uncertainties, State followed  commonly accepted best practices by performing sensitivity analysis to  see what Mission Mexico\u2019s likely workload would be under different  scenarios, which are reflected in figure 2. By developing these different  workload scenarios, State has been able to better identify the potential  range of Mission Mexico\u2019s staffing and facility needs.", "In addition to the uncertainties regarding the number of Border Crossing  Card holders who will renew their cards, there are also uncertainties  regarding underlying demand from nonrenewal applicants. State\u2019s  methodology assumes constant annual increase in underlying demand  over the life of the forecasts and does not consider how various economic  and demographic factors may affect NIV demand. As State officials  acknowledge, such factors, including changes in the value of the Mexican  peso or the strength of the U.S. economy, can affect NIV demand.  However, any inaccuracies in the estimates of underlying nonrenewal  demand are unlikely to significantly affect the overall accuracy of State\u2019s  projections because the surge is due primarily to Border Crossing Card  renewals. For example, even if underlying demand increased by twice as  much as State expected between fiscal years 2010 and 2011, this would  result in total NIV demand being only 2 percent more than State forecasted  for fiscal year 2011, under the 75 percent renewal scenario.", "Although, as discussed above, there are uncertainties with the forecasts,  State\u2019s approach to forecasting NIV workload, based on historical  precedent and underlying growth in demand provide State with a  reasonable basis for planning for the anticipated surge in NIV demand.  State has detailed data on the number of Border Crossing Cards issued  during the previous surge, when they expire, and where they were issued,  which gives it a strong foundation for developing its assumptions about  future demand. As figure 5 shows, State\u2019s forecasts anticipate that the  upcoming surge will be predominantly cyclical, following a pattern similar  to the previous Border Crossing Card surge in fiscal years 1998 to 2002.  Furthermore, in recognition of the uncertainties that do exist, State used  sensitivity analysis to estimate different potential levels of NIV demand to  inform its plans for the upcoming surge. State officials believe their plans  include sufficient flexibility to meet NIV demand increases under the  various scenarios they have developed. Additionally, State plans to  continually track demand at the consulates as the NIV surge unfolds and  will revise its forecasts periodically."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Mission Mexico Will Experience an Increase in Passport Workload Due to WHTI Implementation, Although the Magnitude Is Difficult to Predict", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the surge in NIV workload, Mission Mexico has begun to  experience a surge in its passport workload as a result of the  implementation of WHTI at air ports of entry in January 2007 and its  subsequent, planned implementation at land and sea ports in June 2009.  According to State officials, the mission has already seen a significant  increase in its passport workload as U.S. citizens living in Mexico have  begun to apply for passports in response to the new documentary  requirements. Mission Mexico\u2019s passport and CRBA workload, which State  tracks together because both types of applications are handled by  consular officers in posts\u2019 American Citizen Services units, grew to 34,496  applications in fiscal year 2007, a 77 percent increase from fiscal year 2006.  Passport and CRBA workload continues to increase in fiscal year 2008,  with the mission already having processed about 70 percent of the fiscal  year 2007 total in the first 6 months of fiscal year 2008. Despite the  expected increases, passport and CRBA workload will continue to be only  a fraction of Mission Mexico\u2019s workload, relative to NIV applications.", "While State expects passport workload in Mexico to continue to increase  significantly in the coming years, it is difficult to predict precisely what the  magnitude of this increase will be. Unlike with the NIV surge, there is not a  clear historical precedent to the WHTI surge. Additionally, there is a great  deal of uncertainty regarding the number of U.S. citizens living in Mexico  and the number of these citizens who are potential passport applicants.  According to State headquarters and Mission Mexico officials, many of the  U.S. citizens living in Mexico are dual nationals who have spent the vast  majority of their lives outside the United States and have few ties with the  country. Consequently, the consulates tend to have much less contact with  and knowledge of these citizens than they do of typical expatriates.  Therefore, efforts to forecast increases in passport workload due to WHTI  are extremely challenging.", "Nonetheless, State has developed rough estimates of the likely increase in  workload caused by the implementation of WHTI. These WHTI workload  numbers include estimates of both passport and CRBA applications. State  did not use any type of formal statistical analysis in developing these  estimates because the lack of data on U.S. citizens living in Mexico made  any such analysis problematic. Thus, these estimates have the potential for  significant errors. According to State\u2019s estimates, Mission Mexico\u2019s WHTI  workload is projected to peak in fiscal year 2009 with the intended  implementation of WHTI at land ports of entry. This means that the peak  in WHTI workload is expected to occur 2 years before the NIV peak in  fiscal year 2011. At the WHTI workload peak in fiscal year 2009, State  estimates that the mission will likely have over 66,000 passport and CRBA  applications. Even with workload expected to begin declining in fiscal  year 2010, State anticipates that it will continue to be significantly higher  through at least fiscal year 2012 than it has been over the last several  years.", "At the post level, State estimates that the majority of WHTI workload will  be handled at four posts: Mexico City, Guadalajara, Tijuana, and Ciudad  Juarez. This is consistent with recent experience in Mexico. As shown in  figure 6, these four posts handled 77 percent of the mission\u2019s total  passport and CRBA workload in fiscal year 2007. They also handled 73  percent of the mission\u2019s total workload in the first 6 months of fiscal year  2008.", "The WHTI workload estimates discussed in this report, which were  provided to us on July 2, are revisions to earlier projections discussed in  our June 25, 2008, testimony. State\u2019s earlier projections had  underestimated passport and CRBA workload by 31 percent for the  mission in fiscal year 2007. Although its earlier estimates were too low for  fiscal year 2007, State\u2019s revised WHTI forecasts are actually lower than its  previous estimates of passport and CRBA workload for fiscal years 2008  through 2012. While it has revised its WHTI forecasts, State is not making  the development of precise workload estimates the focus of its efforts to  prepare for the surge. State has instead chosen to pursue strategies  designed to provide it with the flexibility to respond to increases in  workload as they occur\u2014particularly as a more limited number of  resources will be needed to cover increases in passport and CRBA  applications than NIV applications, given their small share of Mission  Mexico\u2019s overall consular workload."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "State Is Adding Interviewing Windows and Temporary Adjudicators to Posts in Mexico to Keep Pace with Projected Workload Increases", "paragraphs": ["In anticipation of the surge in demand for NIVs and U.S. passports in  Mexico, State is adding hardened interview windows to several high- demand posts.

The new  facility in Ciudad Juarez is set to open in September 2008, and State  expects to open the new Tijuana facility in September 2010 (construction  on this facility began in April 2008). Once completed, these projects will  provide Mission Mexico with the window capacity to interview about 1  million additional NIV applicants per year.

Consequently, NIV  applicants may face longer wait times for an interview appointment at  these posts. State officials noted that individuals who would typically  apply at one of these two posts will have the option to schedule  appointments at the relatively nearby consulate in Monterrey, which is  expected to have excess window capacity during the surge in demand.  Consular officials at the Guadalajara post believe they should be able to  absorb the increased workload with the number of windows available as  long as they have enough staff to work the windows in shifts to keep them  open all day, if necessary.

Consequently, these posts would be at greatest risk of increased NIV  backlogs if temporary adjudicator slots cannot be filled as needed or if  their productivity is not as high as anticipated. However, State officials  believe they have an adequate pool of potential candidates from among  returning Peace Corps volunteers, graduates of the National Security  Education Program, eligible family members, and retired Foreign  Service officers.

They also noted that a U.S. citizen  with a security clearance is on site to manage the facility and the  contractor is responsible for conducting local police background checks  of its employees. Nevertheless, consular officials in Monterrey stressed the  importance of monitoring contractor employees to help ensure they do not  coach applicants. Additionally, the off-site facility will have no exterior  markings indicating its association with the U.S. consulate. State officials  believe this will reduce the security risk to the facility and contractor  employees.", "State envisions expanding this model throughout Mexico and other high- demand posts worldwide to help expand the capacity of consular  operations without incurring the costs of building additional facilities. No  timetable for this expansion has been set, according to State officials. In  Monterrey, the use of the pilot program made available extra space in the  consulate facility to add much-needed NIV interview windows. Post  officials in Guadalajara also noted that the off-site data collection model  would make it possible to add interviewing windows to their consulate  facility, if necessary, by freeing up space currently needed to enroll  applicants. State also envisions the possibility of providing off-site data  collection facilities serving NIV applicants in cities that do not have  consulates.", "State officials stated that the department intends to assess the pilot to  ensure that the technological challenges of remote biometric data  collection and data transfer have been overcome. They will also assess  whether the new software involved presents the data to consular officers  in a user-friendly format to facilitate the adjudication. In addition, State  will monitor adjudication rates at the participating posts to see how the  new model affects productivity. However, State has neither developed a  written assessment plan nor indicated whether its evaluation plans include  an assessment of potential risks related to fraud or the security of the  operation.

State recently provided guidance to posts worldwide on waiving  interviews for certain applicants, following the transition to the collection  of 10 fingerprints and technology allowing reuse of fingerprints. The policy  only applies to applicants seeking to renew their biometric NIVs within 12  months of expiration. Consular officers retain the discretion to require any  applicant to appear for an interview, and applicants may not have an  interview waived unless they clear all computer-based security screening.  According to State guidance, consular officers will also have the discretion  to waive interviews of renewal applicants as part of the off-site data  collection model being piloted in Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo, when  prints collected off-site match with the applicant\u2019s fingerprints already  stored in expiring Border Crossing Cards.", "The Monterrey and Ciudad Juarez posts have already begun to waive  interviews of applicants renewing NIVs and found significant productivity  gains. As a result, officers there were able to adjudicate cases more  rapidly and better utilize window capacity, according to consular officials.  These posts also found no significant difference in denial rates for NIV  renewal applicants who were interviewed compared to those whose  interviews were waived, although State officials noted it was necessary to  continue monitoring the effect of waiving interviews.

In  addition, consular officials stated they will have the option of using NIV  interview windows to adjudicate passport applications\u2014possibly during  off hours, if necessary.", "In addition, posts are seeking ways to become more efficient in how they  process the increasing volume of passports. For example, many posts have  recently implemented an appointment system to better manage the flow of  passport applicants and have also improved their Web sites to help  provide better assistance to applicants, many of whom do not speak  English and are applying for passports for the first time. State is also  upgrading its software used for passport processing in overseas posts to  enable posts to scan passport applications, which they expect will reduce  staff resources needed for data entry. Some posts are also considering  increased use of consular agents in other locations, such as Puerto Vallarta  or Cabo San Lucas, to accept passport applications to help relieve some of  the workload for consular staff.

State\u2019s  efforts to increase the number of hardened interview windows at several  of its consulates and hire additional temporary consular officers represent  a substantial increase in resources needed to keep pace with the projected  surge in NIV and passport workload. As State continues to revise its  workload projections, it may need to adjust its plans for increasing these  resources. The success of the efforts to prepare for the surges in passport  and NIV workload is likely to depend on State\u2019s ability to fill the  approximately 100 slots it has planned for temporary adjudicators in time  to meet the surge in workload. Several posts in Mexico will rely heavily on  these additional staff to keep pace with expected demand for NIVs and  avoid excessive wait times for interviews of applicants. However, State  officials have expressed confidence that they will be able to fill these  positions with qualified candidates.", "In addition, Mission Mexico may reap productivity gains from a pilot  program to outsource part of the NIV application process, including  biometric data collection, at off-site facilities; however, this effort is in its  early stages, and State has not yet undertaken a comprehensive evaluation  of the pilot program. While State officials have expressed their intention to  evaluate the pilot program, the department has not yet indicated whether  its evaluation plans include an assessment of risks related to fraud and the  security of the operation, consistent with internal control standards.

To accomplish our  objectives, we analyzed State data on current and forecasted passport and  nonimmigrant visa (NIV) workload for all 10 consulates in Mexico and  assessed the magnitude of expected future workload increases. Along with  this, we analyzed the reliability of State passport and NIV workload data  and found them sufficiently reliable for our purposes. As part of our  review, we also assessed State\u2019s forecasting methodologies based on  available information. In our review, we determined that State had  employed a reasonable methodological approach in developing its NIV  forecasts for the mission and among the individual consulates. However,  certain factors may still impact the accuracy of the forecasts, including the  extent to which Border Crossing Card holders renew their cards when  they expire. Additionally, changes in various economic and demographic  variables, such as the strength of the U.S. economy, also have the potential  to affect NIV demand.", "We also examined State\u2019s current staff and facilities devoted to NIV and  passport processing and its estimates of resource needs when workload  peaks in 2011.

We chose these  consulates because they were among the posts with the highest current  and forecasted passport and visa workloads in Mexico and also because  they provided a mix of border posts and posts within the interior of the  country. At each post, we observed visa and passport processing, and met  with consulate management and representatives from the Non-Immigrant  Visa and American Citizenship Services units.
