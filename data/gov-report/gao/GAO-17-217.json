For example, the Guard allots two full-time staff to each state and territory, which provides Rhode Island\u2014a state with about 2,000 soldiers\u2014the same number of staff as Texas, which has about 18,600 soldiers. Similar imbalances exist in the Reserve, with one full-time staff at one command responsible for about 9,000 soldiers located in 16 different states, while the one full-time staff member at another command is responsible for 300 soldiers in 4 states. Officials said that collateral-duty personnel are used to mitigate workload disparities, but these positions are not always filled in the Guard, and the Reserve does not know the number filled. Without evaluating their staffing structures, the Army does not know the extent of such issues and their effect.", "Budget Management: The Guard has developed budget guidance on the use of funds but has not effectively communicated it to program staff, and the Reserve has not developed or distributed this guidance to its staff. Thus, Guard and Reserve program staff do not have information needed to develop their budget allocations and help ensure the efficient use of program funds.", "Investigation Timeliness: Data on Guard cases investigated by its Office of Complex Administrative Investigations (OCI) in fiscal year 2015 show that 57 percent, or 45 of 79 cases, took 6 to 9 months to complete; 39 percent, or 31 of 79 cases, took 3 to 6 months; and the remaining 4 percent (3 of 79 cases) took longer than 9 months. According to OCI officials, investigations take longer to complete because OCI does not have enough personnel to handle its growing caseload, which more than doubled from 2014 to 2015. The Army and the Guard have not reassessed OCI's resources since the increase in investigation requests to help ensure it has the staff needed to complete investigations within 3 weeks, as required by OCI guidance.", "Eligibility for follow-up or long-term health-care services paid for or provided by the Department of Defense (DOD) varies based on a Guard or Reserve victim's duty status at the time of an assault. Victims in the Guard and Reserve must go through a process, known as a line of duty determination, to determine their eligibility for care. The Guard has established an expedited process for making a determination within 72 hours of the process being initiated. However, the Reserve's process is lengthy, and in prior work GAO found that 80 percent of these determinations were overdue. Reserve officials said they plan to include an expedited process in the new Army regulation that is being drafted; however, Reserve officials did not provide details about the planned process or documentation about how it would be implemented. Without an expedited process to provide more timely decisions, sexual assault victims in the Reserve may continue to pay for their care up front, or else face delayed access to care."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making six recommendations, including that DOD evaluate program staffing structure, communicate and develop budget guidance, assess the Guard's investigation timeliness and resources, and develop an expedited process for determining Reserve eligibility for healthcare services.

The Army\u2019s reserve  components, which include the Army National Guard and the Army  Reserve, collectively comprise over 550,000 members compared to the  nearly 490,000 soldiers serving in the active-duty Army. In fiscal year  2015, 604 sexual assault incidents involving  Army reserve-component  victims were reported to Army and National Guard personnel; however,  sexual assault is generally an underreported crime. Based on a survey of  reserve-component members conducted by the Defense Manpower Data  Center in 2015, the Department of Defense (DOD) estimated that 8,386  reserve component members were sexually assaulted during the same  period. Further, DOD determined that, in fiscal year 2015, of those  reserve-component members who indicated in the survey that they had  experienced a sexual assault, only about 22 percent of women serving in  the reserve component and 16 percent of men reported the incident to  DOD.", "For more than a decade, Congress and DOD have taken a variety of  steps to prevent and respond to sexual assault in the military. In 2004,  following a series of high-profile sexual assault cases involving  servicemembers, Congress required the Secretary of Defense to develop,  among other things, a comprehensive policy for DOD on the prevention of  and response to sexual assaults involving servicemembers. In response  to statutory requirements, DOD established its sexual assault prevention  and response program in 2005 to promote prevention, encourage  increased reporting of sexual assault crimes, and improve victim  response capabilities. Starting with its fiscal year 2007 report on sexual  assault in the military, DOD began to distinguish between reports of  sexual assault involving members serving on active duty and those  involving activated members of the National Guard and the Reserve.", "Since 2008 we have issued multiple products and made numerous  recommendations related to DOD\u2019s efforts to prevent and respond to  incidents of sexual assault involving  servicemembers on active duty. Most  recently, in November 2015, we reported on the extent to which DOD had  developed and implemented a strategy to prevent sexual assault. In  general, we found that DOD had developed a sexual assault prevention  strategy but that it did not link specified activities to desired outcomes.  Furthermore, we reported that DOD had not taken steps to help ensure  that the prevention-focused activities being implemented at installations  were consistent with the overarching objectives of its prevention strategy.  We recommended that DOD, among other things, link the activities  specified in its prevention strategy with desired outcomes and that it  communicate and disseminate its prevention strategy to all program  personnel.

We also interviewed headquarter-level officials with the  Department of the Army, the Army National Guard, and the U.S. Army  Reserve, as well as officials from DOD\u2019s Sexual Assault Prevention and  Response Office (SAPRO) on efforts to implement this guidance in the  Army National Guard and the Army Reserve, and asked about any  challenges that they had identified or experienced during implementation.  In reviewing this guidance and in our discussions with officials, we  identified challenges related to department and service-level program  responsibilities for the assignment of program staff, budget development  and execution, and investigations. We obtained May 2016 data from the  Army National Guard and April 2016 data from the Army Reserve\u2014the  most recent available at the time of our review\u2014on the number,  geographical dispersion, and types of personnel used to staff full-time and  collateral-duty program positions. We also obtained data from the  Department of the Army and the Army National Guard on the amount of  time it took to conduct sexual assault investigations in fiscal years 2012  through 2015, which is the period available in the system used to  maintain these data at the time of our review. We assessed the reliability  of the data sources by reviewing information on data quality and the systems that produced them, and by discussing the data with  knowledgeable agency officials. We determined these data sources were  sufficiently reliable for describing the Army National Guard and the Army  Reserve staffing of program positions and the length of investigations.  Further, we compared Army National Guard and Army Reserve efforts to  staff and develop budgets for their respective programs with Standards  for Internal Control in the Federal Government that emphasize the  importance of (1) establishing an organizational structure and assigning  responsibilities that enable an agency or department to operate in an  efficient and effective manner and to achieve its objectives, (2)  communicating quality information to make informed decisions, especially  as it relates to the prioritization of and accountability for funds, and (3)  providing accountability for resources and ensuring that only valid  transactions to use or commit resources are initiated or entered into.", "Additionally,  we conducted site visits to four installations\u2014two for the  Army National Guard and two for the Army Reserve\u2014that were selected  based on a variety of factors, including installations that had a higher  number of reported sexual assault incidents, as well as the size and  geographic dispersion of different installations. Although the information  obtained during our site visits is not generalizable to other installations, it  enabled us to obtain the perspectives of a variety of personnel  responsible for implementation of the Army National Guard\u2019s and the  Army Reserve\u2019s sexual assault prevention and response programs. We  also administered and analyzed the results of two web-based surveys,  one for each component, that solicited perspectives from all full-time  sexual assault response coordinators (SARC) and victim advocates (VA)  serving in the Army National Guard and the Army Reserve. Of the full-time SARCs and VAs who were available during the period of survey  administration, we received completed survey responses from 68 out of  92 potential respondents, or 74 percent, for the Army National Guard, and  from 27 out of 46 potential respondents, or 59 percent, for the Army  Reserve.", "For our second objective, we reviewed provisions in DOD, Department of  the Army, and Veterans Health Administration guidance pertaining to  medical and mental health-care services available to members of the  Army National Guard and Army Reserve following a sexual assault. In  our web-based survey of full-time SARCs and VAs serving in the Army  National Guard and the Army Reserve, we asked about the availability  of  medical and mental health-care services for sexual assault victims, and  analyzed the results to determine how services are identified and the  extent to which they vary by location. We also interviewed officials from  DOD and the Department of the Army, and met with officials during our  site visits, to discuss the medical and mental health services available to  sexual assault victims serving in the Army National Guard and the Army  Reserve, including any care that can be obtained through the local  community, and the extent to which the availability of such care may be  affected by a member\u2019s duty status.

However, aspects of the military technician occupation limit the ability  of those serving in these positions from effectively executing the role  and responsibilities of a SARC or VA.

However, due to the way some program personnel have interpreted  the 24/7 response capability requirement, this policy may conflict with  another DOD policy that designates SARCs and VAs as the single  point of contact for ensuring that a 24-hours-a-day, 7-days-a-week  victim response capability exists. Although Army Headquarters and  Army National Guard officials told us that the DOD Safe Helpline was  designed to provide this 24/7 response capability, some of the Army  National Guard and the Army Reserve SARCs and VAs that we  interviewed interpret DOD\u2019s requirement for a 24/7 victim response  capability to mean that they are on call at all times regardless of their  civilian or military duty status\u2014especially since they are the only  individuals in their respective units who have been assigned these  responsibilities.

During a site visit, one Guard  SARC told us that the SARC could easily claim comp time each week,  but did not feel right claiming the hours. Another Army Reserve SARC  we interviewed told us that the command had denied the SARC\u2019s  request for compensatory time despite having spent hours beyond the  normal workday on the phone assisting victims.

For example, some officials with the  Department of the Army, the Army National Guard, and the Army Reserve  supported the idea of sharing the Army\u2019s active and reserve-component  resources to establish a regional support structure for the program. In  addition, a SHARP official from Army Forces Command stated that  staffing program personnel on a regional basis would align well with the  regional staffing approach that the Department of the Army has  successfully used to provide other victim services, such as its special  victims counsel and criminal investigators. However, we also met with  Army National Guard and Army Reserve officials who were opposed to  the concept of a regional approach. For example, some commanders in  the Army National Guard and Army Reserve expressed concerns about  who would be responsible for supervising SHARP personnel and  ensuring accountability for performance and response times, while the  chief of staff of a Reserve command commented that the idea needed  further analysis.", "Officials with the Department of the Army said that active-component  SHARP personnel may provide support to Army National Guard and  Army Reserve personnel and that sexual assault victims may seek  assistance from any SARCs or VAs, regardless of their duty status or  service affiliation.

Neither Army officials nor the draft  Campaign Plan provided details about what the assessment would  evaluate, such as the allocations of full-time and collateral-duty personnel  and the use of military technicians versus civilians for the positions, or  when the assessment would be conducted or completed.

However, this guidance was not  communicated or disseminated in its entirety to National Guard SHARP  personnel by the National Guard SHARP program office. Instead, in  2015, the Army National Guard\u2019s SHARP office distributed a summary of  the guidance to its SARCs in the form of a two-page e-mail that consisted  of a general solicitation of funding requests; a paragraph that described  marketing, outreach, and administrative resources that could be  purchased with program funds; and another paragraph that addressed  personnel training expenditures. As a result, Army National Guard SARCs  and VAs expressed uncertainty in response to our survey about what  would qualify as an authorized use of program funds. Specifically, 19 out  of 30 Army National Guard respondents (63 percent) who provided  supplemental written responses to our survey question about whether any  additional funding guidance would be useful indicated a desire for  additional guidance about how to spend their funds, such as whether  spending on things such as conferences, training, and promotional items  were permissible.

For example, SARCs and other officials at the Army Reserve installations  that we visited told us that they did not receive budget guidance in 2015  from the Army Reserve Command\u2019s SHARP office. Specifically, Army G-1 officials we spoke with during a site visit to an Army Reserve major  subordinate command stated they receive no funding guidance for the  SHARP program from Army Reserve Command, and from their  perspective there is no formal budget process. Similarly, during our visit  to another Army Reserve major command, the full-time SARC told us that  the SARC called the Army Reserve Command\u2019s SHARP office three  times to ask for budget guidance, and that the guidance the individual  finally received was unclear and consisted of a spreadsheet and a due  date. Another full-time SARC at a different Army Reserve major  command told us that the SARC\u2019s command would not allow program  funds to be spent without a specific authorization, and that the absence of  funding guidance from Army Reserve Command meant that the SARC  does not have the information needed to fill out these authorizations and  was thus limited in his or her ability to purchase promotional items and  plan activities. The concerns expressed during our site visits were further  corroborated by responses to our survey, with 15 out of 27 Army Reserve  respondents (56 percent) indicating that they had never received any  guidance from Army Reserve Command about how to spend SHARP  program funds.", "Officials from the Army Reserve Command\u2019s SHARP office said they  have provided budget guidance many times and that they were unaware  of a unit that asked for, but did not receive, requested guidance.

However, while the March 2015 training provided an overview of the  funding process and preparing a budget, the materials from that training  that we reviewed did not provide any information or other guidance about  what specific items should be included in their annual budget requests or  what would qualify as an authorized use of program funds. Without the  Army Reserve Command SHARP office developing and communicating  guidance that provides clear information about what to include in budget  requests, SHARP personnel in the Army Reserve will not have the  necessary information to develop their budgets and to help ensure the  efficient and effective use of program funds.", "In addition to issues with budget guidance, we found that the Department  of the Army\u2019s SHARP office has limited visibility over the use of SHARP  program funds by the states and territories in the National Guard and by  the Army Reserve commands. According to Army Regulation 600-20, the  Director of the Army\u2019s Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Program  is responsible for the program\u2019s management functions. Moreover,  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state that  management should design control activities to provide, among other  things, accountability for resources, which can be done by periodically  comparing resources with the recorded accountability to help reduce the  risk of errors, fraud, misuse, or unauthorized alteration; and should  ensure that only valid transactions to use or commit resources are  initiated or entered into. Officials from the Department of the Army\u2019s  SHARP office stated that they oversee the general execution of the Army  National Guard\u2019s and the Army Reserve\u2019s SHARP program budgets.  These officials also stated that in fiscal year 2016, they began conducting  midyear reviews to provide additional oversight of SHARP funding  execution in the Army National Guard and the Army Reserve by  comparing their spending plans to the Army\u2019s long-term budget plan, also  known as the Program Objective Memorandum.

To  help address this concern, Army National Guard SHARP officials said that  in fiscal year 2016, they started requesting monthly execution reports  from the states to provide additional visibility over how SHARP funds are  being used. Similarly, officials from the Army Reserve SHARP program  office said that every month they review the difference in the command\u2019s  funding allocations and execution, and will contact commands to discuss  any deviations as needed. While these are positive steps that may  facilitate increased oversight, this level of information had not yet been  included in the scope of the midyear reviews conducted by the  Department of the Army. Until the scope of the midyear reviews is  expanded to facilitate increased oversight of specific SHARP program  expenditures in the Army National Guard and the Army Reserve at the  state and command level, the Department of the Army will be limited in its ability to make informed budget decisions and to help ensure the  appropriate use of program funds."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Sexual Assaults Involving Reserve Component Members Can Be Investigated by Different Organizations, and Investigation Timeliness Can Pose a Challenge for Some Cases Involving Army National Guard Members", "paragraphs": ["The organization responsible for investigating a sexual assault incident  involving a member of the Army reserve components varies depending on  the circumstances of the situation, and the timeliness of some  investigations involving Army National Guard members can pose a  challenge. Investigative  authority of sexual assaults involving a member  of the reserve component is determined by the victim\u2019s or accused\u2019s duty  status and location at the time of the incident and may be assigned to a  military criminal investigative organization, civilian law enforcement  organization, or, in certain incidents involving an Army National Guard  member, the National Guard\u2019s Office of Complex Administrative  Investigations (OCI). Table 1 summarizes some factors that generally  determine which organization has the authority to investigate sexual  assault incidents that involve a member of the Army National Guard or  the Army Reserve.", "While there are general guidelines for determining investigative authority,  there are various circumstances that may affect the extent to which such  incidents are investigated. For example, Army National Guard and Army  Reserve officials explained that the specific crimes enumerated under the  category of \u201csexual assault\u201d in the Uniform Code of Military  Justice in  some cases differ from what is classified as a sexual assault under state  and local laws. Further, the National Guard Bureau has reported that  the military\u2019s definition for sexual assaults may be more stringent than  state statutes, resulting in reports that may not be fully investigated by  civilian law-enforcement organizations or in situations where civilian  authorities have declined to prosecute. The National Guard Bureau has  also reported that the lack of a unifying code of military justice applicable  to all states is a particular challenge, because there can be considerable  variance among the different state codes of military justice as well as  state criminal statutes that may be applicable for members of the Army  National Guard. While these variations are consistent with existing law,  Army National Guard and Army Reserve officials stated that this can send  a mixed message to soldiers, because reserve component members  involved in a sexual assault incident may not receive the criminal  investigation that their active-duty counterparts routinely receive for the  same or similar offense.", "To help address the instances when Guard members are not subject to  Uniform Code of Military Justice jurisdiction, in 2012, the National Guard  Bureau established its Office of Complex Administrative Investigations  (OCI) to conduct administrative investigations of sexual assault incidents  involving Guard members that were declined a criminal investigation by  civilian law-enforcement organizations. In 2014, OCI\u2019s mission was  refined to include the investigation of sexual assault cases that occur  within the states but were not investigated by a military criminal  investigative organization due to the lack of jurisdiction or when it is  determined that the civilian law enforcement agency with jurisdiction did  not process a case sufficiently. OCI officials stated that they use DOD\u2019s  definition of sexual assault to conduct their investigations and  substantiate or unsubstantiate an allegation of sexual assault based on  the evidence collected, and they then refer the case to the subject\u2019s  commander for appropriate action.", "While OCI helps to fill a gap in investigating sexual assault cases  involving National Guard members, timely investigations are a challenge  that may affect the extent to which OCI is used to conduct investigations.  According to National Guard guidance, OCI investigations should typically  be completed in 3 weeks. However, OCI investigation data show that of  the 79 investigations it conducted in fiscal year 2015, 57 percent or 45  cases took 6 to 9 months from the time a case was referred until when  the investigation was completed, and 39 percent or 31 cases took 3 to 6  months to complete. In contrast, we analyzed timeliness data on  investigations conducted by CID\u2014the Army\u2019s military criminal  investigative organization\u2014that were recorded in DOD\u2019s sexual assault  incident database and found that, for sexual assault cases investigated in  fiscal year 2015, 81 percent of the cases with Army National Guard  victims (68 out of 84) and 48 percent of the cases with Army Reserve victims (45 out of 93) were completed within 3 months of receiving the  request for an investigation.", "According to OCI and CID officials, a timely investigation is important  because it becomes increasingly more difficult to gather useful evidence  the farther out an investigation is conducted from when the incident  occurred. During one of our site visits, we met with the state\u2019s Adjutant  General who called OCI\u2019s investigation delays \u201cunconscionable\u201d, and as a  result, said that they prefer to work with civilian law-enforcement  organizations instead. However, the Adjutant General acknowledged that  civilian law-enforcement organizations may decline to investigate, in  which case an OCI investigation is the only option. Figure 3 shows more  detailed information about OCI investigation time frames compared to  CID investigation time frames for fiscal years 2013 through 2015.", "While OCI officials did not comment on the reasonableness of the typical  length of an investigation, they did express concern with the timeliness of  OCI\u2019s investigations, and explained that the lengthy investigations are the  result of OCI not having enough full-time personnel to meet the current  demand for investigations. To assist in alleviating the issue, OCI officials  told us that OCI received additional funding from the National Guard  Bureau to increase the number of full-time trained investigators from 12 in  fiscal year 2015 to 18 in fiscal year 2016. While the number of  investigators has increased, OCI officials stated that they are only  authorized to place investigators on short-term active-duty orders for 1  year, which has resulted in constant turnover and has further exacerbated  delays because new personnel have to be trained each year. Army  National Guard and OCI officials also stated that a 2014 manpower study  conducted by the Army Manpower Analysis Agency validated OCI\u2019s need  for five Army civilian investigator positions, which would provide greater  continuity in the office since those positions could be filled with personnel  that could serve longer than the 1-year limit that the military personnel  have been subject to. However, the officials added that funding was not  approved to fill the civilian positions. Since the 2014 study, OCI\u2019s  caseload has increased. Specifically, referrals of cases to OCI for  investigation have consistently increased since the office was  established\u2014starting with 3 referrals in fiscal year 2012, 20 referrals in  2013, 35 referrals in 2014, and more than doubling to 80 referrals in  2015. Based on the caseload increase since 2014, one senior OCI official  estimated that 22 investigators are needed to help with the current  backlog of cases. However, the official added that future funding for OCI  staffing is in question largely because the Department of the Army did not  validate OCI\u2019s requirement for any personnel in its most recent long-term  budget plan, the Program Objective Memorandum for 2017\u20132021.", "To help agencies run efficient and effective operations, Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government states that management  should establish an organizational structure, assign responsibility, and  delegate authority to achieve the entity\u2019s objectives.

However, the Army and National Guard Bureau have not  reassessed OCI\u2019s resources and timeliness since 2014 to take into  account OCI\u2019s growing caseload and to determine how to improve the  timeliness of sexual assault investigations in light of the increased  number of requests for investigations conducted by OCI. Until the Army  and the National Guard Bureau reassess OCI\u2019s resources and timeliness  to determine how to conduct sexual assault investigations more quickly  and to identify the resources needed to improve the timeliness of  investigations, Army National Guard victims may continue to experience  lengthy investigations and the ability to gather usable evidence will be  increasingly more difficult."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Medical and Mental Health Services Available to Army National Guard and Army Reserve Victims of Sexual Assault Vary Availability of Medical and Mental Health Services Varies for Army Reserve and Army National Guard Victims of Sexual Assault", "paragraphs": ["The availability  of medical and mental health services paid for or provided  by DOD varies based on a National Guard or Reserve victim\u2019s duty status  at the time of an assault.

Rather, officials with the Army National Guard and the Army Reserve told  us that under these circumstances, a sexual assault victim would be  referred to state and local community resources to receive care.", "In addition to duty status, there are other factors that may affect a  reserve-component member\u2019s ability to obtain medical or mental health- care services following a sexual assault, such as the availability  of care in  rural areas, quality of care, and affordability of care.", "Availability  of care in rural areas: As noted above, state and local  community medical and mental health resources are the primary  treatment options for reserve-component members who are sexually  assaulted while serving in an ineligible duty status, and are also  options for care paid for by DOD if a reserve component member was  assaulted in an eligible duty status. However, the availability  of such  resources for sexual assault victims can vary depending on the  geographic location of where the victim lives. Officials from the Army  National Guard, the Army Reserve, and SAPRO told us that some  reserve-component members who live in rural or remote areas may  have difficulty finding available resources.

Specifically, 11 out of 66 Army National  Guard respondents (17 percent) and 2 out of 27 Army Reserve  respondents (7 percent) reported that they were aware of victim  complaints about the quality of medical care; and 12 out of 66 Army  National Guard respondents (18 percent) and 3 out of 26 Army  Reserve respondents (11 percent) were aware of victim complaints  about the quality of mental health care. SAPRO officials told us that  they have explored trying to address the availability  and quality of  care by using telemedicine, where a care provider communicates  electronically with the victim through a computer or tablet, which  would expand the choice of potential providers. However, they said  that state licensure laws prohibit DOD from delivering telemedicine to  a servicemember when he or she is in a civilian status, or is not  eligible for care in a federal facility.", "Affordability of care: As previously noted, DOD does not pay for or  provide medical or mental health care to reserve-component soldiers  who are sexually assaulted while serving in an ineligible duty status,  which Army National Guard and Army Reserve officials stated raises  concerns about the affordability of care for these soldiers, particularly  for those who do not have health insurance. To help address  concerns about the affordability of care, Army National Guard and  Army Reserve officials developed a proposal for a pilot program  through the Army Family Action Plan process that would provide its  members with vouchers for treatment for duty-limiting mental health  conditions regardless of duty status. According to Army National  Guard officials, these vouchers could potentially be used for  counseling related to a sexual assault, as well as other issues such as  suicide prevention or substance abuse. The officials said that in April  2016, the Army Family Action Plan tabled this proposal until fall 2016,  due in part to concerns that it could conflict with insurance  requirements under the Affordable Care Act. However, Army National  Guard and Army Reserve officials explained that even if a reserve  member has health insurance, the out-of-pocket or copayment  expenses can still be significant enough to inhibit a sexual assault  victim from getting care. Army National Guard officials and members  of the Joint Psychological Staff met in July 2016 with leaders of the  Psychological Health Multi-Disciplinary Working Group to discuss  issues such as funding for the pilot program and voucher eligibility.  The group decided to present the pilot proposal at the October 2016  Reserve Psychological Health Council Meeting to further develop  support from other military services.

The Army National Guard has  established an expedited process to determine whether sexual assault  victims are eligible for medical and mental health care that is provided by  or paid for by DOD, but the Army Reserve has not, potentially resulting in  a delay to a soldier\u2019s access to services. Specifically, DOD\u2019s instruction  specifies that National Guard and Army Reserve personnel who are  assaulted while serving in an eligible duty status, such as during inactive  duty training, are eligible for medical and mental health services that are  either provided or funded by DOD. However, before DOD will pay for or  provide any follow-up or long-term medical and mental health care for  sexual assault victims serving in the Army National Guard or the Army  Reserve, DOD requires that a line-of-duty determination be made to  establish whether the incident was service-connected (i.e., occurred in  the line of duty).

The instruction also  provides that line-of-duty determination requests for sexual assault cases  that meet certain criteria must be decided within 30 days from the date of  the request. To meet this requirement, given the lengthy nature of the  determination process, the National Guard established an expedited line- of-duty investigation process for sexual assault victims, which Army  National Guard officials said generally enables them to make a  determination within 72 hours of when a request is made. Army National  Guard officials explained that for this process, the Army National Guard  developed an automated, secure web-based system that is accessible to  the Joint Force Headquarters SARC. The SARC inputs all line-of-duty  determination data into this system, and the determination is then  reviewed and approved as appropriate by the Army National Guard  SHARP Office.", "However, the Army Reserve does not have an expedited version of the  line-of-duty determination process. Army Reserve officials told us that  they have no documented average or baseline timeframe for getting a  line-of-duty determination approved, and that the timeframe varies based  on the commander, the local facilities, and the needs of victim, among  other things. They explained that the determinations depend heavily on  the commander\u2019s knowledge of the process, but acknowledged that the  Army Reserve SHARP program office should do a better job in assuring  that these requests are expedited. In July 2015, we reported on the time it  can take to complete the determination process\u2014noting that more than  three-fourths of all Army Reserve line-of-duty investigations, including  those not related to sexual assault incidents, were overdue. We found  that for the Army Reserve, 82 percent of formal investigations took longer  than the required 75 days, and 80 percent of informal investigations took  longer than the required 40 days. In our survey, 15 out of 27 Army  Reserve respondents (56 percent) indicated that completing the line-of- duty process was \u201cextremely or moderately challenging\u201d, and 11 out of 27  Army Reserve respondents (41 percent) identified that ensuring victims  get care while waiting for a duty determination to be \u201cextremely or  moderately challenging.\u201d Figure 4 further details survey responses from  Army Reserve SARCs and VAs on challenges associated with the line-of- duty determination process.", "During a site visit to an Army Reserve command, we met with Army  medical personnel who told us that because of the lengthy line-of-duty  process, it was possible that a victim in the Army Reserve who received  care at a DOD facility may be billed for his or her care before a  determination of duty status is made. Reserve officials also stated that the  primary issue associated with the line-of-duty process is that medical  costs for victims are not paid up front by DOD. As a result, victims will  either have to pay out of pocket, use their civilian health insurance if they  have any, or let the bills go into collection while they are waiting for the  line-of-duty determination to be approved.", "As of September 2016, Army Reserve officials said that they plan to  include an expedited process for line-of-duty determinations for Army  Reserve sexual assault victims in the Army Reserve chapter of the new  Army SHARP regulation that is currently being drafted. However, Army  Reserve officials did not elaborate on the details about the planned  process or provide any documentation about how this process would be  implemented for the Army Reserve. In addition, they told us that they  continue to coordinate with Human Resources Command, the  Department of the Army SHARP office, and the Department of the Army  G1 medical policy office to consider methods to process line-of-duty  requests for Army Reserve victims that would allow the same access to  care and benefits as an active component victim. Without an expedited  line-of-duty determination process in the Army Reserve that provides for  more timely decisions, along with a method for tracking the length of time  to make the determinations so that officials have visibility over the extent  that they are meeting the required time frames, sexual assault victims in  the Army Reserve may continue to have to pay for their care up front,  even if an assault occurred during an eligible duty status, or else face  delayed access to care provided or paid for by DOD.", "In addition to challenges posed by the length of the determination  process, Army Reserve victims who choose to keep the incident  confidential by making a restricted report have not been able to receive  medical or mental health care provided or paid for by DOD. The National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 provides that for restricted  reports, a member of the armed forces who is a victim of sexual assault  may elect to confidentially disclose the details of the assault and to  receive medical treatment, among other services specified in the law. In  addition, DOD guidance states that line-of-duty determinations may be  made without identifying  the victim to the command or DOD law- enforcement organizations to enable the victim to access medical care  and psychological counseling. However, Army Reserve officials  explained that if an Army Reserve victim wants to file a restricted report  but also wants to receive medical care covered by DOD, his or her  command would need some knowledge of the case to approve the line- of-duty determination. This is because the Army\u2019s regulation on line-of- duty determinations requires that a formal investigation be conducted by  a commissioned or warrant officer who is senior in grade to the soldier  being investigated, and that an informal investigation be conducted by the  unit commander. Further, the Army regulation provides that a general or  special court-martial convening authority for the soldier is still the final  approving authority for either a formal or informal line-of-duty  determination.", "In April 2016, DOD issued an updated version of its line-of-duty  instruction, which states that line-of-duty determinations for restricted  reporting of sexual assault cases require modified procedures in  accordance with DOD Instruction 6495.02. The Department of the  Army\u2019s regulation has not been updated to align with DOD\u2019s revised  instruction; however, Army Reserve officials said that they were provided  with new guidance in September 2016 that allowed limited health-care  benefits to be provided to reserve component victims with a restricted  line-of-duty determination. However, Army Reserve officials could not  provide a copy of this guidance, and did not elaborate on the details  about how these benefits would be provided to Reserve members, or  what the restricted benefits would include. Without a modified line-of-duty  determination process that enables soldiers to both file a confidential or  restricted report and receive medical or mental health care paid for or provided by DOD if an assault occurred while they were in an eligible duty  status, sexual assault victims in the Army Reserve may continue to have  to pay for their care if they choose to file a confidential or restricted report,  contrary to the provisions in the 2012 Act."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The Army National Guard and the Army Reserve have implemented  sexual assault prevention and response programs, but challenges with  staffing, budget management, investigation timeliness, and eligibility  determinations for care provided or paid for by DOD may hinder program  implementation over the long term if they are not addressed.

Further, Army  National Guard and Army Reserve staff will not be able to plan for and  use program funds without the necessary budget guidance, and Army  leadership will not be able to effectively oversee and account for program  funds without greater visibility of program expenditures at the state and  command level.

In addition, DOD responded to our three budget- related recommendations as a group, concurring with two and partially  concurring with one. Specifically, DOD stated that it agreed with our  recommendation for the Army National Guard SHARP Program Office to  communicate and disseminate its guidance on budget development and  execution for the SHARP program to all full-time SHARP program  personnel. DOD also agreed with our recommendation that the Army  Reserve SHARP Program Office develop clear guidance on budget  development and execution for the SHARP program and to disseminate  this guidance to its full-time SHARP program personnel.", "However, DOD partially concurred with our recommendation for the Army  SHARP Program Office to expand the scope of its midyear review to  include monitoring and providing oversight of SHARP program  expenditures at the Army National Guard state and Army Reserve  command level. Specifically, DOD agreed that the Army SHARP Program  Office can provide additional oversight of expenditures through the  addition of compliance inspections in the SHARP Organization Inspection  Plan, but disagreed that it be done by expanding its midyear review\u2014 stating that such a change seemed excessive and would indicate a lack  of trust in the ability of its organizations to manage and properly execute  their resources. Instead, DOD stated that the Army Headquarters SHARP  Program Office recommends that program managers in the Army  National Guard and the Army Reserve continue to monitor individual  transactions at the command level. We disagree that further monitoring  would be excessive or that it would indicate a lack of trust in the  components\u2019 ability to manage and execute their resources; instead, we  see this as a step that will enable the Army SHARP program office to fully  execute the program management functions that it has been assigned.  For example, our report credits the Army SHARP program office with  overseeing the general execution of program funds by the Army National  Guard and the Army Reserve. However, our report also notes that this  level of monitoring does not constitute the type of control activity that is  necessary to help reduce the risk of errors, fraud, and misuse.", "Additionally,  this level of monitoring does not help to ensure that financial  resources are committed to valid and appropriate efforts in support of the  SHARP program. As such, we continue to believe that our  recommendation for the Army SHARP program office to expand the  scope of its midyear review is valid.", "Furthermore, DOD did not concur with our recommendation for the  Secretary of the Army, in collaboration with the Chief of the National  Guard Bureau, to reassess the Office of Complex Administrative  Investigation\u2019s (OCI) timeliness and resources to determine how to  improve the timeliness of processing sexual assault investigations  involving members of the Army National Guard, and identify the  resources needed to improve the timeliness of these investigations. In its  written comments, DOD stated that OCI is a National Guard Bureau  organization and the administrative investigations that it conducts are  outside the limited scope of authority the Secretary of the Army may  exercise over the Army National Guard. As such, DOD suggested that the  recommendation be redirected to have the Secretary of Defense direct  the Chief, National Guard Bureau to perform this task in collaboration, as  necessary, with the Secretary of the Army and Secretary of the Air Force.  Further, DOD stated that the Chief of the National Guard Bureau is  prepared to direct the National Guard Bureau Joint Staff, Army National  Guard, and Air National Guard to analyze current OCI case load and  requirements, coordinate with the Department of the Army to formally  document OCI civilian and military staffing requirements necessary to  timely conduct investigations, and recommend procedures to make OCI a  program of record with appropriate funding and personnel levels. We  agree with DOD\u2019s suggestion to redirect the recommendation to the Chief  of the National Guard Bureau and we have incorporated this change in  our report, as appropriate. Furthermore, we are encouraged by the  actions that DOD stated the Chief of the National Guard Bureau is  prepared to take, and believe that if implemented, they would meet the  intent of our recommendation.", "Finally, DOD partially concurred with our recommendation to develop and  implement an expedited line-of-duty determination process for Army  Reserve sexual assault victims, along with a method for tracking the  length of time to make the determinations. DOD stated that it agrees the  Army Reserve should develop and implement an expedited line of duty  process, but added that doing so would not correct or mitigate the  challenges of funding behavioral health care for Army Reserve soldiers,  particularly those who require coverage for trauma experienced in a non- duty/non-paid status. DOD further stated that in response to this issue, a  recommendation has been forwarded to the Secretary of Defense to  consider directing a study into the feasibility of funding behavioral health  care services for servicemembers who experience sexual assault while in  a non-duty status. We recognize that an expedited line of duty process  will not address challenges that reserve soldiers may encounter if an  assault occurred in a non-duty status. We are encouraged by this  additional action, and believe that, along with implementing an expedited  line-of-duty determination process, additional efforts to try and overcome  the impediments to health care for reserve members who are sexually  assaulted while not in an eligible duty status could have a positive effect  on readiness of the force.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Army, the  Chief of the National Guard Bureau, and the Chief of the Army Reserve.

We also interviewed headquarters-level officials with  the Department of the Army, the Army National Guard, and the U.S. Army  Reserve, as well as officials from DOD\u2019s Sexual Assault Prevention and  Response Office (SAPRO), and asked about areas where they had  identified or experienced implementation challenges. In reviewing the  guidance and in our discussions with officials, we identified challenges  related to department and service-level program responsibilities  pertaining to the assignment of program staff, budget development and  execution, and investigations. We analyzed the guidance to assess the  extent to which responsibilities for program development and  implementation in the Army\u2019s reserve components have been carried out  in these areas. In our interviews with officials, we also discussed the  applicability of and efforts to implement this guidance in the Army\u2019s  reserve components and about whether the unique nature of reserve- component service poses any challenges to efforts to prevent and  respond to sexual assault. We compared the testimonial evidence  obtained during these interviews with relevant provisions in the guidance  and documents obtained to assess whether any of these provisions, or  the lack thereof, were contributing factors in the challenges identified.", "In addition, we interviewed officials during site visits to four selected  installations\u2014two for the U.S. Army Reserve and two for the Army  National Guard\u2014on the implementation of sexual assault prevention and  response programs in their respective components. We selected the  locations for our site visits based on a variety of factors, such as  installations having a higher number of reported sexual assaults per total  number of soldiers, as well as to select installations of varying size and  geographic region. In addition, for the Army National Guard, we  considered the number of reported sexual assault incidents that were  referred to the Office of Complex Administrative Investigations. During  these visits, we met with sexual assault response coordinators (SARC),  victim advocates (VA), staff judge advocates, chaplains, medical and  mental health personnel, commanders, and non-commissioned officers.  At two of the site visit locations, we also met with special victims\u2019 counsel  and investigators located at these sites. While we did not employ  methodology that would allow us to generalize to the four installations as  a whole or furthermore to all Army reserve component installations, the  information we gathered at these four installations enabled us to obtain  perspectives of a sample of commanders, servicemembers, and other  officials who implement and provide services or support to sexual assault  victims. In our discussions with noncommissioned officers at the site  visits, we used a standard set of questions and asked to meet with a  group of 3\u201310 full-time personnel, rather than putting part-time reservists  on orders to come in and meet with us. We asked to meet with soldiers  who worked in a mix of combat-arms and combat-support occupations,  and in ranks that would be closest to or would have the most interaction  with enlisted soldiers. By interviewing a small group of noncommissioned  officers at each installation we visited, we were able to obtain a non- generalizable sample of servicemember perspectives on the Army\u2019s  sexual assault prevention and response, or SHARP, program and its  response to sexual assaults. In addition to our site visits, we also  interviewed officials in SAPRO and the Army Medical Command to obtain  a more comprehensive understanding of the Army\u2019s efforts to implement  its sexual assault and prevention program in its reserve components.", "To assess the assignment of SHARP program staff, we requested and  obtained data from the Army\u2019s reserve components on the number,  geographical dispersion, and types of personnel used to staff key  program positions; the authorized end strength, or total number of  soldiers, for each state in the Army National Guard and for each Army  Reserve major command; and the locations of all subordinate units for  each Army Reserve major command. For the Army Reserve, we received  a data file with data as of April 2016 that we tabulated using SAS in  order to compile the summary level information for the categories of  interest, whereas for the Army National Guard we received the  information as of May 2016 already tabulated for our tables. For both  sources of data, we assessed the reliability of the information for our  reporting objectives by (1) reviewing the data for accuracy and  completeness, (2) reviewing available documentation about the data  collection and management, and (3) collecting information from  knowledgeable agency officials during interviews and by having them  complete a questionnaire about the data. We also compared the  collection and use of data with relevant DOD guidance and with the  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government, specifically the  importance of using appropriate, accurate, complete, and accessible  information to help management make informed decisions. We  determined that the data provided by the Army Reserve Command and  the Army National Guard were sufficiently reliable for reporting on the  number and types of SHARP program staff, and the number and  geographical dispersion of soldiers served by assigned SHARP program  staff. We also compared these results with relevant DOD and Army  guidance to assess the extent to which responsibilities for establishing  staff positions needed to adequately implement program requirements  have been met. In addition, we compared these efforts with the standards  for internal control about the importance of establishing an organizational  structure and assigning responsibilities that enable an agency or  department to operate in an efficient and effective manner and to achieve  its objectives.", "In addition, we reviewed relevant documents related to budget  development and oversight, and identified any corresponding actions  taken and compared them with standards for internal control about the  importance of communicating quality information to make informed  decisions, especially as it relates to the prioritization of and accountability  for funds, and providing accountability for resources and ensuring that  only valid transactions to use or commit resources are initiated or entered  into.", "Regarding the length of investigations, we obtained data from the  Defense Sexual Assault Incident Database (DSAID) from the Army and  from the National Guard Office of Complex Administrative Investigations  on the length of time it took to investigate sexual assault incidents  involving Army reserve-component victims from fiscal years 2012 through  2015, which is the period available in the DSAID database at the time of  our review. For cases reported to Department of the Army personnel, we  received a data file that included incident report date and date of  conclusion of the investigation for sexual assault incidents between 2012  and 2015, which enabled us to calculate the length of time it took to  investigate sexual assault incidents and tabulate this information for our  tables. For the National Guard, we received the information already  tabulated for our tables. For both sources of data, we assessed the  reliability of the information for our reporting objectives by reviewing the  data for accuracy and completeness, (2) reviewing available  documentation about the data collection and management, and (3)  collecting information from knowledgeable agency officials during  interviews and by having them complete a questionnaire about the data.  We also compared the collection and use of data with relevant DOD  guidance and with standards for internal control in the federal government  about the importance of using appropriate, accurate, complete, and  accessible information to help management make informed decisions. We  determined that the data provided by the Army and the Army National  Guard were sufficiently reliable for describing the length of time it takes to  investigate sexual assault incidents involving Army reserve component  victims. However, a limitation of these data is that they only include cases  with an Army Reserve or Army National Guard victim that were reported  to an Army or National Guard SARC; cases that were reported to or  handled by a SARC from another military service are not included in  these data.", "To better understand and more comprehensively represent the  experiences and perspectives of key program personnel across the  Army\u2019s reserve components, we administered and analyzed the results of  two web-based surveys, one for each component, that solicited the  perspectives on program guidance and implementation, among other  things, from all full-time SARCs and VAs identified within the Army\u2019s  reserve components. We requested and were provided contact  information for all full-time SARCs and VAs/VACs in the Army Reserve  and Army National Guard from the components\u2019 respective SHARP  program offices. These lists included 52 Army Reserve full-time SARCs  and VAs and 98 Army National Guard full-time SARCs and VACs.", "To develop our survey questions, we sought input from knowledgeable  officials and reviewed relevant reports to identify themes and issues  affecting sexual assault prevention and response efforts in the Army  reserve components. Specifically, we interviewed officials from the  SHARP program offices of the Army Headquarters, Army Reserve, and  Army National Guard, and from the Army Medical Command for input on  our survey development. We also reviewed DOD and Army reports and  other research related to sexual assault and we reviewed our prior work  related to DOD\u2019s sexual assault prevention and response program. We  also worked with GAO social-science survey specialists to develop our  survey questionnaires, applying generally accepted survey design  standards. Based on our review of information and consultation with  knowledgeable officials during the development of the survey, we  determined that slightly different variations of the survey were needed for  the Army Reserve and National Guard in order to tailor to questions or  response options to the specific components.", "We took steps in the development of the questionnaires, the data  collection, and the data analysis to minimize any errors associated with  conducting surveys, such as differences in how questions are interpreted,  variations in respondents\u2019 ability and knowledge or awareness for  answering a specific question, or how responses are entered in the  survey form. In addition to seeking input from officials in the Army  Reserve and Army National Guard SHARP program offices on our survey  questions, we also pretested the content and format of the questionnaire.  This pretesting helped us to determine whether (1) the survey questions  and response options were clear and unbiased, (2) the terms used were  accurate and precise, (3) respondents were able to provide the  information we were seeking, and (4) the questions and response options  were comprehensive. We chose the pretest subjects to include three  SARCs from the Army Reserve, and two Army National Guard SARCs.  We conducted two pretests in person and three over the telephone. We  made changes to the content and format of our final questionnaire after  our discussion with the program office personnel, as well as after each of  the first four pretests, based on the feedback we received. See appendix I  for the Army Reserve survey questions and response tabulations for each  closed question, and appendix II  for the Army National Guard survey  questions and response tabulations.", "We administered the questionnaire through a Web-based application on a  secure GAO server. First we sent an e-mail announcement of the survey  to 52 Army Reserve full-time SARCs and VAs and 98 Army National  Guard full-time SARCs and VAs. Each SARC and VA was given a unique  password and username for completing the survey online. We sent up to  three follow-up e-mail messages to those who had not yet responded,  followed by an additional telephone outreach attempt for the remaining  nonrespondents. The questionnaire was available online for  approximately 6 weeks. Although our original survey was distributed to  the 52 Army Reserve individuals and 98 Army National Guard individuals,  we subsequently excluded from our recipient list 6 individuals from the  Army Reserve and 6 individuals from the Army National Guard, because  those individuals were unavailable  during the period of survey  administration for reasons such as deployment, maternity leave, extended  sick leave, or no longer serving in the SARC or VA position. Of the  remaining 46 Army Reserve full-time SARCs and VAs and 92 Army  National Guard full-time SARCs and VAs, 27 Army Reserve SARCs and  VAs, and 68 Army National Guard SARCs and VAs completed the  survey, for response rates of 59 percent for the Army Reserve and 74  percent for the Army National Guard.", "We analyzed the electronic survey-response data set using SAS. We  first reviewed the data for electronic processing errors or other  inconsistencies in the data, and assessed the frequencies of item  nonresponse. After minor data cleaning and additional formatting, the  analysis included frequency distribution of responses to each question,  cross-tabulations of specific questions, and reviewing the open-ended responses to identify themes and areas of concern raised by the  respondents.", "To identify medical and mental health-care services available to members  of the Army National Guard and the Army Reserve following a sexual  assault (objective 2), we reviewed relevant provisions in DOD,  Department of the Army, and Veterans Health Administration guidance  pertaining to medical and mental health-care services available to those  serving in the Army\u2019s reserve components following a sexual assault. We  interviewed officials from SAPRO; Army Medical Command; and the  SHARP Program Offices for Army Headquarters, Army Reserve  Command, and the Army National Guard about the medical and mental  health services that are available to sexual assault victims serving in the  Army\u2019s reserve components and the extent to which the availability  of  such care may be affected by a member\u2019s duty status. Similarly, during  our visits to four selected locations, we met with behavioral health or  medical officials to discuss the medical and mental health-care services  that are available to reserve-component members who are sexually  assaulted, including any care that can be obtained through the local  community. We also discussed any potential barriers that may affect the  availability  of and access to such care by reserve-component members,  such as the line-of-duty determination process. In addition, we discussed  efforts to identify local medical and mental health providers. We also  interviewed a military sexual trauma coordinator at a Veterans Affairs  Medical Center to better understand the services and care that are  available to reserve-component members through the Department of  Veterans Affairs.", "To identify the number of Army Reserve major commands with units  located in each state and territory, we requested and obtained data from  the Army Reserve Command on the number and size of each Army  Reserve major command\u2019s subordinate units, and the locations of these  subordinate units.

We analyzed the results of the  surveys to determine how the medical and mental health services  available at different installations were identified, and the availability  and  use of community medical and mental health-care services and  resources, and to gain a fuller understanding of the extent to which these  services may vary by location.", "Regarding sexual assault incident data, we obtained data from the  Defense Sexual Assault Incident Database (DSAID) from the Army and  the Army National Guard on the number and type of reported sexual  assault incidents involving Army reserve-component victims from fiscal  years 2012 through 2015, which is the period available in the DSAID  database.

As we have  previously reported, the precise number of sexual assaults involving  servicemembers is not possible to determine, and studies suggest that  sexual assaults are generally underreported in the United States. Both  active and reserve component servicemembers may report an alleged  sexual assault using either the unrestricted or restricted reporting options.  An unrestricted report of an alleged sexual assault incident is provided to  the chain of command or a law enforcement organization for  investigation. A restricted report is a confidential report of an alleged  sexual assault that can be made without initiating an investigation or  notifying the chain of command.", "In both the Army National Guard and Army Reserve, the majority of  reported incidents were made as unrestricted reports, as shown in figure  5. Data for Army National Guard victims are listed in two separate groups,  depending on whether an incident was reported to an Army sexual  assault response coordinator (SARC) or a National Guard SARC. For the  purposes of documenting sexual assault incidents in DSAID, officials from  the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) Sexual Assault Prevention and  Response Office (SAPRO) said that DOD considers the National Guard  to be a separate military service. As a result, they told us that only  National Guard officials have visibility over cases entered into DSAID by a  National Guard SARC\u2014even if the victim is a member of the Army  Reserve\u2014and Army Headquarters Sexual Harassment/Assault Response  and Prevention (SHARP) program officials told us that they do not have  visibility over any cases involving Army National Guard soldiers that were  reported to a National Guard SARC. Similarly, Army National Guard  officials told us that the Army National Guard\u2019s program office does not  have visibility over cases involving Army National Guard soldiers that  were reported to an Army SARC (active duty or Army Reserve).", "These data could differ from the data that DOD reports to Congress,  because the data included in those reports do not necessarily represent  the service affiliation of the victim.
