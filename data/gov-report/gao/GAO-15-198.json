Because of difficulties in locating supporting documents for prior fiscal years, in June 2012, DOD leadership decided that the Marine Corps would prepare and subject to audit a Schedule of Budgetary Activity that would include only current year activity on fiscal year 2012 appropriations. In December 2013, the DOD OIG issued an unqualified opinion on the Schedule.", "GAO was asked to assess the 2012 audit results. GAO (1) determined the extent to which the OIG's audit met professional standards, (2) analyzed the status of Marine Corps actions on recommendations, and (3) identified any DOD-wide implications from the audit. GAO reviewed auditor documentation, re-performed certain tests, evaluated Marine Corps corrective action plans and statuses, and determined whether other military services and DOD would likely encounter similar issues. GAO met with DOD OIG auditors and Marine Corps and DOD Comptroller officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO found that in certain key audit areas, the Department of Defense (DOD) Office of Inspector General (OIG) did not perform sufficient procedures, under professional standards, and consequently did not obtain sufficient, appropriate audit evidence to support the audit opinion on the Marine Corps' Fiscal Year 2012 Schedule of Budgetary Activity (Schedule). GAO found that the OIG did not perform sufficient procedures to determine (1) the completeness of transactions reported on the Schedule, (2) the reliability of certain evidence used to support transactions included on the Schedule, (3) whether budgetary activity was recorded in the proper period and shipment obligations were properly recorded. In addition, the OIG did not properly consider and evaluate the audit evidence in concluding and reporting on the results of the audit.", "For example, about half of the Marine Corps' reported fiscal year 2012 budgetary activity originated in non-payroll feeder systems. However, the OIG did not perform sufficient procedures to determine the completeness of the data transferred to the general ledger from the non-payroll feeder systems, although the OIG had reported control weaknesses over feeder system transfers in the 2 prior year audits that the Marine Corps had not yet fully addressed. Also, the OIG did not perform sufficient procedures to determine the reliability of data in certain feeder systems that were used as support when the Marine Corps could not locate or provide original support for some of the OIG's sampled transactions. The OIG stated that certain audit testing in subsequent audits was expanded to address GAO's concerns.", "On March 23, 2015, the OIG withdrew its fiscal year 2012 audit report, stating that facts identified in the audit of the Marine Corps' fiscal year 2014 Schedule raised questions about the completeness of information on which the 2012 opinion was based. The OIG has indicated that once additional information has been gathered and analyzed, it will revisit its fiscal year 2012 audit opinion in light of its analysis and determine whether the report should be reissued.", "GAO also found that the Marine Corps had made limited progress in addressing auditor recommendations since the audit of its fiscal year 2010 Statement of Budgetary Resources (SBR). For example, as of December 2013, the Marine Corps had not completed action on 130 of the 177 OIG recommendations. In commenting on GAO's report, the Marine Corps noted that it has subsequently remediated numerous recommendations. GAO has not assessed these subsequent corrective actions.", "GAO identified DOD-wide implications from the Marine Corps audit related to challenges in assuring the (1) completeness of budgetary transactions, (2) reliability of data generated by DOD agencies' business processes and systems, and (3) proper fiscal year recording of obligations and outlays. Actions to address these challenges will help ensure the reliability of DOD component agencies' financial information; however, until such actions are complete, DOD and its component agencies likely will continue to face significant challenges in having reliable budgetary information for decision making on DOD missions and operations and achieving auditability of their budgetary information."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO makes three recommendations related to the quality of DOD OIG audits. The OIG agreed with GAO's recommendations, but disagreed with many of its findings; the Marine Corps disagreed with certain findings; and the Office of the DOD Comptroller generally agreed with GAO's findings on the DOD-wide audit readiness implications from GAO's work.

The Marine Corps was selected because  it is the smallest military service, has a single standard general ledger  system, and has an integrated military personnel and payroll system. The  SBR is a required financial statement for federal government entities, and  is the only financial statement predominately derived from an entity\u2019s  budgetary accounts in accordance with budgetary accounting rules, which  are incorporated into generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for  federal government entities. The SBR and related disclosures are  designed to provide information on authorized budgeted spending  authority reported in the Budget of the United States Government  (hereafter referred to as the President\u2019s Budget), including budgetary  resources, availability of budgetary resources, and how obligated  resources have been used. In concert with the analysis of other  budgetary data, the SBR\u2019s linkage to the President\u2019s Budget helps assess  the reliability of budgetary data reported in the President\u2019s Budget. The  proper preparation and audit of the SBR is key to this assessment.", "After assessing its ability to locate documentation supporting its  budgetary transactions, the Marine Corps asserted that it was audit ready  (i.e., prepared to undergo an audit of its fiscal year 2010 SBR). The DOD  Office of Inspector General (OIG) contracted with a public accounting firm  (audit firm) for assistance in conducting the audits of the Marine Corps\u2019  SBRs for fiscal years 2010, 2011, and 2012. The DOD OIG issued  disclaimers of opinion on the Marine Corps\u2019 fiscal year 2010 and fiscal  year 2011 SBRs. The disclaimers were the result of a scope limitation  caused by the Marine Corps\u2019 inability to provide timely, sufficient audit  documentation for recorded transactions, particularly with regard to prior  year transactions that supported beginning balances of obligations. As a  result of the difficulty in locating supporting documentation for an SBR  audit, in June 2012, with the approval of the DOD Comptroller, the Marine  Corps reduced the scope of its fiscal year 2012 audit to include only  current year transaction activity on fiscal year 2012 appropriations  presented in a General Fund Schedule of Budgetary Activity (General  Fund Schedule). The Marine Corps intended this effort to be a building  block toward a complete SBR audit covering all open appropriation years,  as subsequent fiscal year budgetary activity was audited. For fiscal year  2012, the Marine Corps reported $28.7 billion in General Fund  appropriations and $21.1 billion in net outlays (spending, net of offsetting  collections and receipts). On December 20, 2013, the DOD OIG issued  an unqualified (\u201cclean\u201d) opinion on the Marine Corps\u2019 Fiscal Year 2012  General Fund Schedule.", "You asked us to assess the results of the Marine Corps\u2019 fiscal year 2012  audit. Our objectives were to (1) determine the extent to which the audit  was performed in accordance with professional auditing standards;   (2) analyze the status of the Marine Corps\u2019 actions to address identified  accounting, financial reporting, and information technology system control  weaknesses; and (3) identify any DOD-wide implications from the Marine  Corps\u2019 fiscal year 2012 audit results.", "To address our first objective, we analyzed the auditor\u2019s documentation  on all aspects of the audit to determine the extent to which (1) the audit  was performed in accordance with professional auditing standards and  (2) the auditor\u2019s reported conclusions were supported by the documented  audit evidence. To address our second objective, we analyzed pertinent  documentation on the status of the Marine Corps\u2019 corrective actions on  auditor recommendations from its fiscal years 2010 through 2012 audits.  We identified closed recommendations and determined whether   (1) corrective actions had been appropriately designed to address  reported weaknesses and (2) documentation on closed recommendations  confirmed that actions to address them had been completed. For our third  objective, we analyzed issues identified in our work and considered  whether DOD and the other military services relied on many of the same  systems, processes, and controls as the Marine Corps and would be  likely to experience similar issues in their audits. During our work, we met  with DOD OIG auditors and the audit firm to discuss the performance of  the audit. We met with Marine Corps officials to discuss the status of  corrective actions on recommendations from its fiscal year 2010 through  2012 audits and the status of actions on our previous recommendations.  We also had periodic discussions with DOD Comptroller and Financial  Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) Directorate officials to discuss  DOD FIAR Plan Status Reports and FIAR Guidance related to military  service and service-provider audit readiness.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2012 through July 2015 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards  (GAGAS).

DOD has undertaken several financial management  improvement initiatives over the years to address weaknesses in  business systems, processes, and controls through its FIAR strategy,  semiannual FIAR Plan Status Reports, and financial management reform  methodology contained in the FIAR Guidance. DOD also spends billions  of dollars annually to maintain key business processes and operations  and acquire modern systems that are fundamental to achieving its  business transformation goals, including systems that support key  functions, such as personnel, financial management, health care, contract  management, acquisition, supply chain, and logistics.

In August 2013, we reported that  DOD risk management policies associated with preparing auditable  financial statements through the FIAR Plan are not in accordance with  widely recognized guiding principles for effective risk management. For  example, DOD has not addressed key risks associated with its  component agencies\u2019 reliance on service providers for significant aspects  of their financial operations and their inability to maintain documentation  to support transactions. In addition, DOD has continued to identify a  department-wide need for qualified and experienced personnel\u2014not only  at working levels, but also in senior leadership positions\u2014as a risk to  achieving its financial management improvement and audit readiness  goals.

However, after reviewing the status of the Marine Corps audit readiness  efforts, on April 10, 2009, the DOD OIG reported that the Marine Corps\u2019  assertion of audit readiness was not accurate and that the documentation  supporting its assertion was not complete. Although the Marine Corps  made progress toward audit readiness during fiscal year 2009, the DOD  OIG reported that a number of issues led auditors to conclude that an  audit of the Marine Corps\u2019 fiscal year 2009 SBR would not have positive  results. For example, the OIG stated that after 3 months of extensive  effort by the Marine Corps, adequate supporting documentation was  received for only 74 percent of the sampled budgetary transactions. The  DOD OIG reported that unless the issues were resolved, the risk of a  disclaimer of opinion would be high. The DOD OIG also reported that the  Marine Corps had identified remediation activities that needed to be  accomplished before an audit of its SBR was undertaken. The DOD OIG  suggested that the Marine Corps consider requesting an audit of its fiscal  year 2010 SBR. The OIG subsequently contracted for assistance from an  audit firm in performing an audit of the Marine Corps\u2019 fiscal year 2010  SBR. Because the Marine Corps asserted SBR audit readiness at the  beginning of fiscal year 2010, it was not subject to DOD\u2019s May 2010 FIAR  Guidance, which required each DOD component to review its processes  and controls to identify needed corrective actions and develop a financial  improvement plan with roles, responsibilities, and milestone dates for  completing actions on assessable units as part of a component-level,  overall financial improvement and audit readiness plan.", "In September 2011, we reported that the DOD OIG issued a disclaimer of  opinion on the Marine Corps\u2019 fiscal year 2010 SBR because the Marine  Corps could not provide documentary support for transactions in a timely  manner, and support for transactions was missing or incomplete. We  also reported that the Marine Corps experienced difficulty identifying and  providing complete populations of transactions that the auditors could  confirm and use as a basis for substantive testing. In addition, the DOD  OIG reported that the Marine Corps did not have adequate processes,  systems, and controls over accounting for and reporting on the use of  budgetary resources. Further, the Marine Corps could not provide  evidence that reconciliations for key accounts and processes, such as the  reconciliation (or matching) of payments (outlays) to bulk (estimated)  obligations for shipments of household goods recorded in its Military  Personnel appropriation account, were being performed. The OIG  reported that Marine Corps management had not asserted that all  corrective actions from eight previously identified material weaknesses  had been completed. These weaknesses included, among others,  deficiencies in financial management systems and deficiencies in controls  over Fund Balance with Treasury and unobligated balances.", "During its fiscal year 2011 SBR audit effort, the Marine Corps again  experienced difficulty in identifying complete populations and providing  supporting documentation for samples of transactions selected by the  auditors for testing. In November 2011, the DOD OIG issued a disclaimer  of opinion on the Marine Corps\u2019 fiscal year 2011 SBR, basically for the  same reasons as the fiscal year 2010 disclaimer. However, based on  discussions with DOD Comptroller, Navy, and Marine Corps officials after  the audit report was issued, the OIG decided to give the Marine Corps  additional time to provide audit documentation that had not been obtained  during the original time frame of the audit. Consequently, on   December 29, 2011, the OIG extended the audit of the Marine Corps\u2019  fiscal year 2011 SBR to March 31, 2012. Despite the extended testing  period, the Marine Corps was still unable to provide timely and relevant  supporting documentation necessary for completing audit procedures to  determine whether the Marine Corps\u2019 fiscal year 2011 SBR was  presented fairly.

Reasonable assurance is a high, but not absolute, level of  assurance that is reached when the auditor has obtained sufficient,  appropriate audit evidence to reduce audit risk (that is, the risk that the  auditor expresses an inappropriate opinion when the financial statements  are materially misstated) to an acceptably low level. In general,  misstatements, including omissions, are considered to be material if,  individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to  influence the economic decisions that users make based on the financial  statements. Judgments about materiality are made in light of surrounding  circumstances and involve both qualitative and quantitative  considerations. These judgments are affected by the auditor\u2019s  perception of the financial information needs of users of the financial  statements, by the size or nature of a misstatement, or both.

One such  recommendation relates to the lack of a formal policy and control  procedure for correcting errors that occur during data interface  processing, in which transactions flow from feeder systems through  DCAS and ultimately into SABRS. Such a policy would help assure that  identified errors and rejected transactions are reviewed by management,  resolved, and resubmitted for processing.

As a result,  instead of properly recording transactions, such as budget authority,  obligations, collections, and disbursements (outlays) at the time of the  related events, DEAMS managers relied on DFAS to record journal  vouchers (adjusting entries) in DDRS and used other offline electronic  processes, such as spreadsheets, to record accounting entries.  According to the DOD OIG, because funds control accounting was not  being managed in DEAMS, budget execution reports and SBRs were  developed using budgetary status data that could not be traced to  actual transaction data within the official accounting system.

Typical  cutoff tests for completeness include testing transactions recorded before  the beginning of the reporting period and after the end of the reporting  period to determine whether there are material amounts of transactions  that should have been recorded in the current reporting period. Obtaining  sufficient evidence of proper cutoff may also necessitate that the auditor  perform other procedures. For example, if there is a risk that transactions  may be recorded after the cutoff testing period or the audit completion  date, such procedures may include examining open purchase orders,  unpaid invoices, and contracts as of a date near the audit completion  date, or estimating amounts that should be recorded in the current year  based on appropriate evidence.", "To assess the risk of material misstatement related to cutoff and  determine the scope of cutoff testing with respect to budgetary activity,  auditors would generally determine the length of transaction cycles from  when a transaction occurs to when the transaction is properly recorded  for significant business processes.

However, the OIG was not required to meet  this reporting time frame for its audit of the Marine Corps\u2019 Fiscal Year  2012 General Fund Schedule and had already significantly exceeded it.  Given that this was a first-year audit of a 1-year schedule of budgetary  activity, additional testing could either have confirmed that a 30-day  window was appropriate and thus set a baseline, or would have shown  that further efforts were needed by the Marine Corps to address  processing delays so that the future 45-day reporting cycle could be met  without increasing audit risk.", "The audit documentation shows that the OIG tested only the transactions  recorded in October 2013 that the Marine Corps applied against fiscal  year 2012 appropriations to determine whether they should have been  recorded to fiscal year 2012.

Support for some sampled shipment outlay  transactions initially recorded to fiscal year 2012 appropriations included  receiving reports that were dated in August 2011 and September 2011,  indicating that they pertained to fiscal year 2011 or earlier appropriations.  Further, the documentation on testing results did not include auditor  comments that refer to additional procedures performed to ensure that  necessary adjustments had been identified by the Marine Corps and that  these adjustments were recorded by the close of the fiscal year 2012  accounting period.", "The audit documentation also shows that the auditors did not perform any  substantive cutoff testing for two general ledger accounts: the obligation  account for delivered orders and the outlay account. The OIG told us that  it did not test for proper cutoff of the obligation account for delivered  orders because any errors identified would result in an adjustment to the  obligation account for undelivered orders and would have no net effect on  the Marine Corps\u2019 Fiscal Year 2012 General Fund Schedule because the  two obligation accounts are both reported on the \u201cObligations Incurred\u201d  line item of the Schedule. However, the OIG\u2019s testing of the obligation  account for delivered orders during fiscal year 2012 substantive testing  identified 11 errors for which the corresponding adjustments were  recorded to other general ledger accounts and were reported on different  line items of the Marine Corps\u2019 Fiscal Year 2012 Schedule. Thus, without  testing obligations related to delivered orders for proper cutoff, there may  be misstatements related to delivered orders that would not be detected  by the audit.", "With regard to cutoff testing of outlay transactions, the audit  documentation showed that after the OIG\u2019s tests of internal controls over  proper cutoff for outlay transactions resulted in an unacceptably high error  rate, the OIG requested that the Marine Corps provide documentation for  a sample of 334 outlay transactions for substantive testing of end-of- period cutoff. According to OIG auditors, the Marine Corps responded  that it was not able to provide support for this large substantive sample  because it was responding to requests for support on sampled  transactions that related to the audit of its Fiscal Year 2013 General Fund  Schedule at that time. As a result, the OIG attempted to rely on its initial  tests of the Marine Corps\u2019 internal controls over proper cutoff and  extended the time frame for completing its control tests to attempt to  resolve the initial exceptions. The audit documentation included  statements that the Marine Corps provided additional documentation and  that the OIG determined that the documentation was sufficient to resolve  all 21 transactions that were initially tested with exception (errors). Our  review of Marine Corps documentation identified available support for 18  of the 21 transactions, and we determined that the support was sufficient  to resolve only 6 of them.

Obligations for  shipments of household goods for military members and civilians who are  deployed or relocated include amounts for storage costs and reshipment  of the items when the personnel return. These obligations, which are  funded by Military Personnel appropriations, typically liquidate over a  period of 2 or more years. Obligations for shipments of military supplies  and equipment, funded by Operation and Maintenance appropriations,  and obligations for shipments funded by Procurement appropriations  generally are liquidated within several days or a few weeks.", "The audit documentation showed that the OIG had identified several audit  risks associated with shipment transactions. For example, the OIG had  determined that the Marine Corps (1) did not have sufficient  documentation available to support its multiple obligation processes for  shipment transactions and (2) was unable to match the liquidations  (outlays) with corresponding obligations. The audit documentation also  showed that the OIG had attempted to perform substantive testing of the  Marine Corps\u2019 shipment obligations; however, the Marine Corps was  unable to provide support for $231.5 million of its reported $529.5 million  in fiscal year 2012 shipment obligations. The audit documentation noted  that the lack of supporting documentation related to the Marine Corps\u2019  practice of recording (1) bulk estimated obligations for U.S.  Transportation Command shipments and (2) obligations for commercial  shipments either at the same time or after the associated payments were  made. Further, because the Marine Corps was unable to match outlays  for specific shipments to its bulk estimated obligations, the auditors could  not determine the reliability of obligated balances through detail testing of  transactions.", "Given the identified issues related to the reliability of recorded  transportation obligations, the Marine Corps developed a model to  estimate the unliquidated obligations as of the end of the fiscal year. The  model was based on historical outlay patterns, using outlay data for fiscal  years 2008 through 2012. To illustrate, if historically 75 percent of the  outlays relating to an appropriation were expended at the end of the first  year, the model would estimate that the remaining 25 percent would be  unliquidated obligations for the appropriation. The reliability of the model  depends on several factors, including the reliability of the outlay data  used in the model; the appropriateness of assumptions used in the  model; and the consideration of factors that may affect historical patterns,  such as the different outlay patterns for the different types of shipments.", "The audit documentation stated that the OIG relied on the auditing  standards in testing the Marine Corps\u2019 estimated liquidations of shipment  obligations.

In assessing the reasonableness of the estimate,  auditing standards state that the auditor normally concentrates on key  factors and assumptions that include sensitivity to variations, deviations  from historical patterns, susceptibility to misstatements and bias, and the  entity\u2019s historical experience related to the reliability of prior year  estimates. The auditing standards also identify procedures that the  auditor may consider when reviewing and testing the process used to  develop management\u2019s estimates, including controls over the process,  and the relevance, reliability, and sufficiency of historical data used in the  estimate.", "The audit documentation showed that the OIG performed some review  and analysis of the Marine Corps\u2019 model for estimating obligated  balances related to shipments and made minor adjustments to the model.

However, the reliability of the estimated fiscal year- end obligated balance reported in the Marine Corps\u2019 Fiscal Year 2012  General Fund Schedule is uncertain because of (1) the lack of assurance  over the completeness and reliability of the shipment obligation and  outlay data used to estimate the ending balance of obligations and (2) the  application of a generalized liquidation rate for shipments that had  significant differences in liquidation periods.

At the conclusion of the audit, the auditor  accumulates identified misstatements and considers whether such  misstatements are material to the entity\u2019s financial statements. In addition  to quantitative measures, the auditor is also required to consider  qualitative factors when assessing the materiality of misstatements.  Auditing standards further state that as the aggregate misstatement  identified in testing approaches materiality, the risk that the financial  statements could be materially misstated also increases; consequently,  the auditor should consider the effect of undetected misstatements in  concluding on whether the financial statements are fairly stated.", "As previously discussed, in concluding on the audit, the auditor makes  judgments about materiality in light of surrounding circumstances and  qualitative and quantitative considerations. These judgments are affected  by the auditor\u2019s perception of the financial information needs of users of  the financial statements by the size or nature of a misstatement, or both.  As a basis for quantitative considerations on the results of testing, the  auditor establishes a materiality level, or the maximum level of  misstatement the auditor is willing to accept in concluding on the audit  without the amount of misstatement being misleading to the users of the  financial information. Federal government auditors generally set  materiality for reporting on audit results at 3 percent of the materiality  base. The materiality base is the element of the financial statement(s)  that the auditor judges as most significant to the primary users of the  statements. For the audit of the Marine Corps\u2019 Fiscal Year 2012 General  Fund Schedule, the OIG used the reported Obligations Incurred line item  amount of $27.5 billion as the materiality base.

The audit documentation showed that the audit team had  initially determined that it could not conclude on the accuracy of sampled  contract outlay transactions for which there was no support that the goods  and services paid for were received. Accordingly, the OIG audit team  counted the related transaction amounts as untested and planned to  include them in the calculation of identified misstatements. The audit  documentation showed that OIG management made an assumption that  the unsupported outlay transactions could be adjusted and reported as  advance payments to avoid counting the amounts as untested. The audit  documentation stated that because outlays and advances are reported on  the same line item of the General Fund Schedule, the adjustment would  have no net effect on the Schedule. However, advances typically require  authorization in law or in contract and without documentation of such  authorization the advance should be considered untested. Had the  auditors included the contract progress payment errors as untested  amounts, the identified misstatement would have totaled over   $808 million.

In  concluding on the testing for this category of transactions, the audit  team stated that this issue posed a scope limitation.

We found no  documentation of the basis for the OIG management decision that the  limited procedures performed were reliable for use in estimating year- end obligated balances. This is a significant issue because shipment  obligations reported by the Marine Corps as totaling over $529 million  represent two-thirds of the materiality threshold used by the OIG to  conclude on the audit.

To the extent that these challenges are not resolved,  they will pose serious obstacles to the military services, which are  currently undergoing first-time audits of their fiscal year 2015 General  Fund schedules of budgetary activity, and could also pose obstacles to  DOD\u2019s efforts to achieve audit readiness on a full set of financial  statements for fiscal year 2018."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Completeness of Populations and Proper Cutoff Are Critical to DOD- Wide Audit Readiness", "paragraphs": ["In May 2014, we reported that DOD had an inventory of 2,329 business  systems, including 286 financial management systems; 702 logistics  systems; 730 human resources management systems (including payroll  systems); and numerous acquisition, logistics, and other business  systems. The vast majority of the department\u2019s financial transactions  originate in these business systems that then feed financial transaction  data\u2014including data for military and civilian payroll, supplies and  procurements, travel, work orders, and shipments\u2014to DOD general  ledger systems. As identified in our review of the Marine Corps\u2019 fiscal  year 2012 audit, performing tests to assure the completeness and  reliability of DOD business systems data and performing periodic  reconciliations of business system data to general ledger systems are  necessary to provide reasonable assurance that military service and  defense agency financial statements include all transactions and  balances that should have been recorded for the period. This will be a  challenge across DOD given the large number of feeder systems and the  fact that the controls over most systems have not yet been tested.  Without assurance of completeness of populations used for audit testing,  auditor sampling and testing results will not provide the reasonable  assurance necessary for concluding on an audit and forming an opinion.  DOD\u2019s FIAR Guidance continues to identify the inability to provide  assurance of complete populations (i.e., reconcile the general ledger to  transaction detail, including feeder system detail) as an audit readiness  dealbreaker.", "As a subset of completeness, proper fiscal year-end cutoff of transaction  activity and assurance that appropriation data are recorded to the proper  fiscal year are essential to ensuring that the financial statements and the  schedules of budgetary activity include all data for the accounting period  audited. As previously discussed, the population of transactions for  shipments of household goods and military items used in the Marine  Corps\u2019 fiscal year 2012 audit contained liquidations (outlays) related to  one or more previous fiscal year appropriations. Because the Marine  Corps was unable to reconcile its fiscal year 2012 bulk estimated  obligations to the related outlays, and outlays recorded to fiscal year 2012  included outlays that were properly chargeable to prior fiscal year  appropriations, the populations of obligations and outlays provided to the  auditors for sampling and testing were not consistent with the reported  scope of its Fiscal Year 2012 General Fund Schedule. Since the other  military services also use bulk estimated obligations to fund their business  processes whose transaction cycles cover multiple fiscal years, the  inability to segregate outlays by appropriation fiscal year poses a  significant risk to the integrity of their schedules of budgetary activity,  particularly with regard to first-year schedules. For example, when bulk  estimated obligations liquidate over several fiscal years, identifying a  population of transactions that relates to a first- or even a second-year  schedule of budgetary activity is problematic.

This is directly contrary  to the DOD FIAR Guidance on audit dealbreakers related to DOD feeder  systems, which states that substantive testing of transactions to  supporting documentation cannot overcome ineffective or missing  information technology system controls when transaction evidence is  electronic and only maintained within a system or the key supporting  evidence is system-generated reports.", "The other military services and some DOD agencies use these same  mission support agencies\u2019 business processes and systems to issue and  ship military supplies and equipment and ship household goods, and they  make payments (outlays) based on billings generated by these agencies\u2019  business feeder systems. To the extent that the other military services are  unable to locate original support for tested transactions, there is a  potential risk that if DOD mission support agencies\u2019 systems and  processes are not tested to reasonably assure the reliability of transaction  data, the other military services\u2019 and DOD will experience the same  problem as the Marine Corps. Accordingly, DOD\u2019s FIAR Guidance  recognizes that for large volumes of transactions, it is more effective and  efficient to rely on internal controls, including information system controls,  rather than planning to fully rely on substantive testing of larger numbers  of sampled transactions for which documentary support must be located  and provided to the auditors. Since December 2011, DOD\u2019s FIAR  Guidance has stated that DOD mission support agencies are responsible  for resolving dealbreakers related to their information systems,  processes, and controls and obtaining SSAE No. 16 examinations.

The OIG stated that even if it  included the $35.8 million that we reported related to unsupported  contract payment transactions, the revised misstatements would total  approximately $808.8 million, which is still below the overall materiality  threshold of $826 million that the OIG had established for the audit.", "As discussed in our report, auditing standards state that in evaluating  whether the financial statements are presented fairly, in all material  respects, in conformity with GAAP, the auditor must consider the effects,  both individually and in the aggregate, of misstatements (both known and  likely) that are not corrected by the entity. At the conclusion of the  audit, the auditor accumulates identified misstatements and considers  whether such misstatements are material to the entity\u2019s financial  statements. Auditing standards further state that as the aggregate  misstatement approaches materiality, the risk that the financial  statements could be materially misstated also increases; consequently,  the auditor should consider the effect of undetected misstatements, in  concluding on whether the financial statements are fairly stated.  Because the OIG\u2019s previously noted calculation of misstatements totaling  $773 million represents nearly 94 percent of its $826 million materiality  threshold for the audit, in accordance with auditing standards, the OIG  should have determined an amount for undetected misstatements and  included this amount in its materiality calculation for concluding on the  results of the audit of the Marine Corps\u2019 Fiscal Year 2012 General Fund  Schedule. However, the OIG did not do so.", "Further, had sufficient audit procedures been performed in the key areas  of concern that we identified, additional misstatements  may have been  identified that, when aggregated with already identified misstatements,  could be material to the Marine Corps\u2019 Fiscal Year 2012 General Fund  Schedule.

For the audit of the Marine Corps\u2019 Fiscal Year 2012 General  Fund Schedule, we provided comments to the OIG as we identified  issues and concerns about its audit. For example, on May 1, 2013, when  the OIG was in the process of concluding on the fiscal year 2012 audit  results, we informed the OIG that audit procedures were not performed to  test cutoff, and that cutoff is a key assertion that must be tested to provide  audit evidence related to the completeness of transactions included in  financial statements for the period audited. On May 30, 2013, the OIG  made a decision to include cutoff as one of the additional areas it planned  to test in its audit of the Marine Corps\u2019 Fiscal Year 2012 General Fund  Schedule.

Our review of the OIG\u2019s audit documentation found that on  September 6, 2013, the OIG e-mailed two, separate statistical samples  for cutoff testing of obligations and outlays to the Marine Corps and  requested that the Marine Corps provide the requested supporting  documentation by close of business on September 13, 2013.

As our criteria, we used  professional audit standards issued by the American Institute of Certified  Public Accountants, which are consistent with generally accepted  government auditing standards, and considered additional guidance in  the GAO/President\u2019s Council on Integrity and Efficiency Financial Audit  Manual. We followed the guidance in Section 650 of the Financial Audit  Manual for relying on the work of others. We reviewed the Marine Corps\u2019  Office of Inspector General (OIG) audit contracts and statements of work  and the Marine Corps\u2019 management representation letters, which contain  assertions about the reliability of its financial reporting in accordance with  generally accepted accounting principles, related to the audits of the  Marine Corps\u2019 Fiscal Year 2012 General Fund Schedule and its Fiscal  Years 2011 and 2010 General Fund Statements of Budgetary Resources.

We retested selected auditor  sample items for significant classes of transactions, such as civilian and  military payroll, unpaid obligations related to undelivered orders and  delivered orders, and outlays (payments or liquidations of the orders  received) to determine if we agreed with the auditors\u2019 conclusions on  tests of those sample items. Throughout our audit, we discussed the  concerns we identified regarding the conduct of the audit with OIG and  independent public accounting firm auditors, including concerns about   (1) completeness of reported budgetary transactions, (2) the reliability of  data generated by DOD feeder systems, (3) proper fiscal year cutoff and  the reliability of reported shipment obligations, and (4) the auditors\u2019  conclusions on the audit as well as the basis for auditor judgments made  during the audit.", "To analyze the status of the Marine Corps\u2019 actions to address audit  recommendations on identified accounting, financial reporting, and  information technology system control weaknesses, we used federal  internal control standards as our criteria. We assessed the status of the  Marine Corps\u2019 corrective actions on recommendations from the Marine  Corps\u2019 fiscal years 2010 through 2012 audits. We met with Marine Corps  officials to discuss corrective action plans and actions completed and  under way as well as their process for monitoring corrective actions. We  reviewed auditor support for closed recommendations to determine  whether the (1) corrective actions had been appropriately designed to  address reported weaknesses and (2) documentation on closed  recommendations confirmed that actions to address them had been  completed.", "To identify any DOD-wide implications of the Marine Corps\u2019 Fiscal Year  2012 General Fund Schedule audit results, we considered our findings  with regard to the conduct of the Marine Corps audit and the status of  Marine Corps actions to address auditor recommendations as well as  November 2014 Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) Plan  Status Report information on the status of DOD military service and DOD  mission support agency audit readiness efforts.

We considered whether DOD agencies and the other military  services relied on many of the same systems, processes, and controls as  the Marine Corps and would be likely to experience similar issues in their  audits.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2012 through July 2015 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1.  Material misstatements. The OIG stated that we did not identify any  material misstatements that were excluded from its conclusions on the  audit. It was not our objective to audit the Marine Corps\u2019 Fiscal Year  2012 General Fund Schedule of Budgetary Activity (General Fund  Schedule). Consequently, we did not perform audit tests to determine  whether material misstatements occurred. As stated in our report, the  OIG did not perform sufficient audit procedures, under professional  standards, and consequently did not obtain sufficient, appropriate  evidence to support its opinion on the Marine Corps\u2019 Fiscal Year 2012  General Fund Schedule of Budgetary Activity (General Fund  Schedule). Had sufficient audit procedures been performed in key  areas of concern that we identified, additional misstatements may  have been identified that when aggregated with the already identified  misstatements, could be material to the Marine Corps\u2019 Fiscal year  2012 General Fund Schedule.  2.  Rejected transactions. The OIG stated that figure 3 in our draft  report indicated that rejected transactions were removed from the  Standard Accounting, Budgeting and Reporting System (SABRS) with  no process to eventually include corrected transactions in SABRS.  Because figure 3 depicts feeder system data flow, we revised the  arrow related to the flow of rejected transactions to show that, if  handled correctly, the rejected transactions would be corrected and,  entered into SABRS. However, as discussed in our report, the OIG  did not perform sufficient procedures to reasonably assure that  rejected transactions were properly resolved and entered into SABRS  before closing a related audit recommendation.   3.  Reconciliation of SABRS to Fund Balance with Treasury. The OIG  stated that we expressed concern that it did not complete a full  comparison of fiscal year SABRS transaction activity to the Marine  Corps\u2019 fiscal year 2012 Fund Balance with Treasury reconciliation.  The OIG stated that such a comparison is an acceptable procedure  for gaining assurance of completeness, but it is not a required audit  procedure. We referred to such testing as an example of one of the  types of audit procedures that may be performed to determine  whether recorded transactions are complete.", "The OIG also stated that it had traced selected transactions to the  reconciliation. However, as stated in our report, these procedures  would not be effective for testing completeness of transactions  recorded in SABRS because they begin with items that are already  recorded in SABRS.  4.  Fiscal year 2012 activity recorded to fiscal year 2011  appropriations. The OIG stated that our example of $3.8 billion in  Marine Corps fiscal year 2012 outlays that was recorded to fiscal year  2011 appropriations as reported by the Department of the Treasury,  overstated the risk to the Marine Corps\u2019 Fiscal Year 2012 General  Fund Schedule. The OIG stated that the Marine Corps fiscal year  2012 outlay activity would include charges to 1-year appropriations as  well as multiyear appropriations. We specifically excluded multiyear  appropriations in calculating the $3.8 billion amount in our example.  We included this example in our report because it illustrates that the  amount of such transactions charged to prior year appropriations was  material. As stated in our report, we believe the risk of material  misstatement to the Marine Corps\u2019 Fiscal Year 2012 General Fund  Schedule related to transactions recorded in fiscal year 2012 to prior  year appropriations that should have been charged to fiscal year 2012  appropriations is high based on numerous reported Marine Corps\u2019  weaknesses in controls over accounting and financial reporting and  the magnitude of fiscal year 2012 Marine Corps\u2019 outlays that were  recorded to prior fiscal year appropriations. Accordingly, testing of  such transactions was necessary to determine whether there were  any material misstatements.", "In addition, the OIG stated that the audit of the Marine Corps\u2019 Fiscal  Year 2012 Schedule appropriately excluded fiscal year 2012  transactions recorded to fiscal year 2011 because the Schedule only  included current year appropriations. However, the scope of a first- year audit of a schedule of budgetary activity would appropriately  include a determination of whether transactions related to current  fiscal year appropriations were improperly charged to prior year  appropriations, and, therefore, improperly excluded from the  schedule.   5.  Consideration of DOD agencies as third parties. The OIG stated  that the auditing standards permit the use of both internal and external  evidence and state that evidence from a knowledgeable source that is  independent is generally more reliable than evidence obtained only  from internal sources. Further, the OIG stated that based on its audit  approach, it does not consider information obtained from the Defense  Logistics Agency (DLA) and U.S. Transportation Command to be  internal evidence. Instead, the OIG considered these DOD agencies  to be third parties with respect to the Marine Corps. As stated in our  report, in examining evidence supporting a transaction, the auditor  should consider the reliability of the information used as audit  evidence, such as electronic documents, including consideration of  controls over its preparation and maintenance where relevant. Such  consideration would normally include any information that raises  doubts about the reliability of the evidence. If the auditor has doubts  about the reliability of information to be used as audit evidence or is  aware of issues with the reliability of the data, the auditor should  determine what modifications or additions to the audit procedures are  necessary to resolve the issues. Also, as discussed in our report,  there were well-known, documented issues that should have raised  significant doubts about the reliability of the data from DLA and U.S.  Transportation Command systems and processes that the OIG relied  on in its transaction testing for the audit of the Marine Corps\u2019 Fiscal  Year 2012 General Fund Schedule.  6.  Military Standard Requisitioning and Issue Procedures  (MILSTRIP) material weakness. The OIG stated that although it  agrees that there are weaknesses surrounding MILSTRIP processes,  DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2012 Agency Financial Report does not conclude  that the data within the system is unreliable and that the reported  weaknesses would not prevent the auditors from using the MILSTRIP  information to complete the audit tests. We disagree. As discussed in  our report, DOD reported DLA\u2019s MILSTRIP process as a department- wide material weakness, stating that the department could not  effectively account for transactions and balances in the MILSTRIP  orders process. Because this and other factors should have raised  doubts about the reliability of MILSTRIP process data, auditors should  determine what modifications or additions to the audit procedures are  necessary to resolve the issues.   7.  Relevance of OIG report on Defense Enterprise Accounting and  Management System (DEAMS). The OIG stated that auditing  standards do not require a Statement on Standards for Attestation  Engagements (SSAE) No. 16 examination of system information in  order for the results to be used to corroborate data from another entity  and that the Marine Corps did not rely solely on DEAMS for its  financial statement reporting. However, the concern raised in our  report was that the OIG used information from DEAMS as audit  evidence and DEAMS had known data reliability issues. As discussed  above, if there are doubts about the reliability of information to be  used in audit testing, auditors should determine what modifications or  additions are needed to the audit procedures to resolve the issues.  8.  Relevance of disclaimer on DOD financial statements. The OIG  stated that although it issued a disclaimer on DOD\u2019s department-wide  financial statements for fiscal year 2012, its audit effort on the  department-wide statements did not include any tests of DEAMS or  MILSTRIP data that were used to corroborate the Marine Corps  transactions. The OIG stated that as a result, there was no direct  connection between the results of the DOD department-wide financial  statement audit report and the audit of the Marine Corps\u2019 Fiscal Year   2012 General Fund Schedule. As discussed in our report, in  disclaiming an opinion on DOD\u2019s department-wide financial  statements for fiscal year 2012, the OIG reported that DOD financial  management and business feeder systems were unable to adequately  support material amounts on the financial statements as of September  30, 2012. The well-known, documented issues related to these  systems should have raised significant doubts about the reliability of  the data used in testing and the OIG should have determined what  modifications or additions were needed to the audit procedures to  resolve the issues.  9.  Reallocation of shipment outlays. The OIG stated that it agrees  with us that some transactions may be recorded in the wrong period,  although the Marine Corps did not report and the OIG did not identify  any material instances where the Marine Corps recorded transactions  in an improper period. As discussed in our report, the OIG\u2019s audit  documentation did not include evidence that the OIG performed any  procedures to (1) test the accuracy of the Marine Corps\u2019 allocation of  fiscal year 2012 shipment billings to previous fiscal year  appropriations or (2) confirm that the related adjustments were  recorded to ensure that the portion of the outlays that pertained to  previous fiscal year appropriations, and in some cases, other military  services, were excluded from the outlays reported on the Marine  Corps\u2019 Fiscal Year 2012 General Fund Schedule.", "The OIG also stated that our draft report was misleading regarding the  discussion of $21 million of fiscal year 2012 shipment billings the  Marine Corps was analyzing in January 2013 to determine the extent  of adjustments needed to the Marine Corps reported fiscal year 2012  outlays. The OIG stated that our auditors were present during a series  of meetings to assess this situation. The meetings the OIG referred to  were held in November and December 2014, which was after the OIG  had issued its opinion on the Marine Corps\u2019 Fiscal Year 2012 General  Fund Schedule.  10. Cutoff control testing on outlays. The OIG stated that it was able to  resolve 7 transactions that its initial testing had determined were  exceptions (errors) and that the other 14 transactions were supported  by evidence obtained from DLA, an agency external to the Marine  Corps. We revisited Marine Corps documentation that was available  for 18 of the 21 transactions and determined that the additional  support was sufficient for 6 of the 18 transactions. We revised the  discussion in our report accordingly. However, because support for  the other 12 transactions was not sufficient, we continue to believe  that controls over cutoff for outlays were not effective and the OIG  should have performed substantive detail tests of cutoff for outlays.  11. Adjustments to progress payment transactions. The OIG stated  that while the Marine Corps may not always properly record certain  progress payment transactions the OIG obtained evidence that an  outlay occurred related to a valid obligation. The OIG stated its  position that for purposes of the Marine Corps\u2019 Fiscal year 2012  General Fund Schedule, if support for progress payment outlays could  not be obtained, adjusting the outlay transaction to an advance  payment would have no net effect on the Marine Corps\u2019 schedule. The  OIG stated that it considered such occurrences as a compliance  issue. However, as stated in our report, the audit documentation  showed that the audit team had initially determined that it could not  conclude on the accuracy of sampled contract outlay transactions for  which there was no support that the goods and services paid for were  received. More specifically, the audit documentation showed that the  audit team could not determine the validity of certain progress  payment obligations because the contract information provided to  them by the Marine Corps did not contain sufficient detail to make  such a determination. Further, the audit documentation showed that  the tested contractor invoices were related to progress payments and  the audit team had determined that progress payments should not be  recorded as advances. The audit team planned to include the  unsupported contract obligations and outlays in its overall calculation  of misstatements. The audit documentation also showed that OIG  management subsequently made an assumption that the unsupported  outlay transactions could be adjusted and reported as advance  payments to avoid counting the amounts as untested. As stated in our  report, the audit documentation did not include a reconciliation or  explanation for such conflicting statements between OIG  management and the audit team.  12. Quantitative Methods Division (QMD) certification. The OIG  commented that it disagreed with the discussion in our report  regarding QMD\u2019s certification of statistical sampling and stated that  although QMD expressed some concern with the statistical methods  used by the audit firm, QMD confirmed that the statistical projections  were calculated accurately and signed the certification. As stated in  our report, we reviewed the documentation on QMD\u2019s certification and  held discussions with QMD statisticians regarding reasons why they  added a note that qualified their certification. Specifically, the note  stated that QMD expresses no opinion as to the application of results  with respect to the evaluation of the sample results against materiality.  QMD officials told us that they qualified their certification because the  auditors mixed two methods for making statistical estimates, QMD  was not included in the materiality assessment process, and as a  result, they did not know the basis for the auditor judgments that were  made. QMD officials also told us that this was unusual and that they  are generally included in auditor assessments of materiality to help  the auditors interpret sampling results."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the United States Marine Corps", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)/Chief Financial Officer", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Robert F.
