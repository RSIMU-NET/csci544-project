Some former employers had stopped mining coal or gone out  of business, so they were no longer contributing to the United Mine  Workers of America (UMWA) retiree benefit funds. To ensure that these  individuals would continue to receive the health benefits specified in  previous collective bargaining agreements reached with coal companies,  often gained in exchange for lower pensions, the Congress enacted the  Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992 (Coal Act). The Coal Act  replaced the existing UMWA retiree health benefit funds with the  Combined Benefit Fund (CBF) and the 1992 Benefit Plan\u2014collectively  referred to in this report as the Funds. The act specified how each fund  would be financed by the coal miners\u2019 former employers and other sources  to cover the health care costs not paid for by Medicare. In 2001, there were  about 55,000 beneficiaries in the CBF and about 6,000 in the 1992 Benefit  Plan. The health plans are administered by the United Mine Workers of  America Health and Retirement Funds (UMWAF).", "Since 1997, the CBF has incurred annual operating deficits. Although the  Congress has made special appropriations to keep the CBF solvent, these  actions have not addressed the CBF\u2019s long-term financial challenges.  Health care spending has risen faster than contributions to the CBF, and  financial difficulties have been compounded by court decisions that have  reduced the per beneficiary premium paid by the coal miners\u2019 former  employers and relieved some companies of the responsibility for paying  premiums for certain beneficiaries. Consequently, actuarial projections  indicate that annual revenue shortfalls are expected to continue.", "In contrast to the CBF, the 1992 Benefit Plan has not incurred ongoing  deficits. The 1992 Benefit Plan has a different financing structure and  premiums paid by coal companies are adjusted each year to meet the  expected health care costs of covered beneficiaries. From 1997 through  2002, these premiums rose by 47 percent to keep pace with increases in  per capita health care spending.", "To help the Congress consider long-term solutions to the Funds\u2019 financial  challenges, you asked us to examine (1) how the Funds\u2019 health benefits  compare to benefits offered by other retiree plans, (2) how the health care  costs of the Funds\u2019 beneficiaries compare to the costs of other retiree  groups, and (3) the efforts of the Funds\u2019 officials to control costs. To  conduct our study, we compared the benefit packages the Funds offered  in 1999 to the benefit packages certain major manufacturing companies  offered and those offered to a sample of unionized hourly workers.  Because 89 percent of the Funds\u2019 beneficiaries are eligible for Medicare,  we compared the health care costs for these individuals to the health care  costs of other, demographically similar Medicare beneficiaries covered by  employer-sponsored insurance. We also interviewed the Funds\u2019 managers  and their contractors, officials from the Health Care Financing  Administration (HCFA), and coal company representatives about the  financing and operations of the Funds.

Since the  Funds were established in 1993, coal companies have challenged several  provisions of the law. Court decisions in favor of former employers have  reduced the premium contributions paid by the companies to the CBF.  Although the CBF\u2019s financing was originally expected to be adequate, the  CBF has incurred an annual operating deficit in each year since 1997,  prompting Congress to make special appropriations in 1999 and 2000 to  maintain its solvency.

For the 1992 Benefit Plan, the  Coal Act allows the premiums to be adjusted annually to cover changes in  the cost of providing benefits. The trustees have historically set the  premiums so that revenues will meet projected annual expenditures.

The same formula  specifies how the cost of any spending in excess of the targeted amount is  to be shared. The Funds assume full financial risk for the cost of Medicare- covered part B benefit that cover physician, hospital outpatient, and  certain other services.

As a result of the court decision in that case, premiums  charged to companies were reduced by approximately 10 percent. In  other lawsuits, companies have challenged some of SSA\u2019s beneficiary  assignment decisions. The effect of one Supreme Court decision was to  reduce companies\u2019 financial responsibilities thereby increasing the  number of unassigned beneficiaries. Another case changed the status of  several thousand beneficiaries from assigned to unassigned. The CBF will  receive no further premiums from coal companies for all living  beneficiaries who are now unassigned as a result of these cases, and  transfers from the AML will have to increase to cover the health care costs  of these additional unassigned beneficiaries.

Part of the rise in cost was due to higher medical prices.", "However, overall increases in the use of medical services and increases in  the use of outpatient prescription drugs and other expensive services also  pushed up per beneficiary costs. Although Medicare per capita costs rose  by 26 percent during this period, in part due to rising utilization, the trend  may have been magnified in the CBF because it serves a closed, and  therefore aging, population. Per capita costs would be expected to grow  faster among CBF beneficiaries relative to Medicare beneficiaries because  older individuals tend to use more medical services than younger  individuals and because the cost of outpatient prescription drugs, which  are not covered by Medicare, have risen faster than other components of  health care spending during this period.", "Unlike premiums in the 1992 Benefit Plan, CBF premiums have not kept  pace with increases in the cost of services not covered by Medicare. The  CBF premium update adjustment specified in the Coal Act only reflects  changes in medical prices, which rose at an average annual rate of 3.6  percent from 1994 to 2000 while per capita spending increased at twice  that rate. To date, Medicare payments have been sufficient to cover the  cost of providing Medicare-covered services in both the CBF and the 1992  Benefit Plan because annual updates to Medicare\u2019s payments reflect  underlying changes in both prices and use of services.

In addition, most aspects of the  Funds\u2019 outpatient prescription drug coverage are more generous than the  coverage provided by other benefit plans. However, many features of the  Funds\u2019 health plans are similar to those offered in the comparison plans. In  particular, the Funds\u2019 coverage for hospital and physician services, which  account for the majority of health care spending, is comparable to the  coverage provided by the other plans.

Eligibility  requirements for retiree health plan coverage by the Funds are similar to  those of other manufacturing employers.

The Funds\u2019 beneficiaries  are responsible for copayments on each service used, up to an annual  amount of $100 per family, excluding prescription drugs. Additional out-of- pocket expenses for covered prescription drugs are capped at $50 per  family per year. The total cap of $150 is substantially less than the median  cap of over $1,750 in plans offered to other unionized hourly workers.", "SNF coverage. The Funds\u2019 beneficiaries are eligible for SNF care with no  cost-sharing requirement and no limit on the number of covered days.

The Funds\u2019 beneficiaries pay a  $5 copayment per prescription and their annual out-of-pocket costs for  covered prescription drugs are capped at $50. In contrast, many plans  offered by manufacturing companies do not have deductibles but require  beneficiaries to pay higher cost sharing requirements with no cap on out- of-pocket costs. (See table 2.) Some plans require beneficiaries to pay 20  percent of the cost of each prescription while others use multitiered  copayment schedules that may, for example, require $5 for generic drugs,  $10 to $15 for brand name drugs included in the health plan\u2019s formulary,  and $20 or more for nonformulary brand name drugs.

The Funds pay the entire cost of a drug, with the exception  of the copayment, if a beneficiary uses a generic version of a prescription  drug when one is available, unless his or her physician submits a written  justification specifying that a particular brand is necessary. If the request  is approved, the beneficiary is not charged an additional amount for the  brand name product. Typically, about 40 such requests are received each  month and about 30 percent of them are approved. Without approval, the  Funds\u2019 beneficiaries who use brand name drugs instead of generic  equivalents, or who use off-formulary brand names instead of ones  included on the formulary, must pay the full difference in price between  the preferred and nonpreferred drug.

In 1999, the  average beneficiary in the Funds reported his or her health status as fair or  good. That same year, the average Medicare beneficiary with similar  demographic characteristics reported his or her health status as good or  very good. Several studies have found that individuals who report poorer  health tend to use substantially more services than individuals who report  better health. Thus, it is likely that some of the higher costs and  utilization associated with the Funds\u2019 beneficiaries is a result of their  relatively poorer health. The Funds\u2019 low cost-sharing requirements provide  few financial barriers to care, which may also contribute to the cost  differential.
