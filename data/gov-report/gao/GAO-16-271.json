EDA officials said the most significant of the remaining key tasks are finalizing the ITM program regulations, manuals, and forms. Other key tasks remaining include hiring additional staff, finalizing the requirements for the program's information technology systems, developing marketing materials, and conducting outreach. As of November 2015, EDA officials expected they could begin issuing ITM program loan guarantees as early as July 2016.", "EDA has coordinated with other federal agencies to learn from their experiences with loan guarantee programs, but EDA has not clearly differentiated ITM from other programs, which may result in duplication.", "Coordination. EDA officials said they reached out to officials from the Departments of Energy and Agriculture, and the Small Business Administration (SBA)\u2014agencies that have loan guarantee programs comparable to the ITM program\u2014to learn from their experiences. EDA officials decided to largely model the ITM program after an SBA program that provides loan guarantees to small businesses, and they adapted or plan to adapt the SBA program's application forms, and regulations, among other things. EDA's coordination has helped avoid duplication of the effort those agencies have already expended in designing loan guarantee programs.", "Potential duplication. As currently designed, the ITM program is not clearly differentiated from SBA's program or from other programs that already provide loan guarantees to a similar pool of borrowers. EDA officials acknowledged that the ITM program is potentially duplicative with other programs in a number of respects.

GAO's fragmentation, overlap, and duplication analysis guide states that one way to help minimize duplication among government programs is to identify and target service gaps that the programs could fill. In 2011, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) identified several gaps in capital access for small and medium-sized manufacturers, including gaps companies face in early stages of growth. However, in coordinating with SBA and NIST, EDA did not seek information on how the ITM program could target these capital access gaps to minimize duplication with other programs.

According to data  from the Bureau of Economic Analysis and the Bureau of Labor Statistics,  in 2014, the manufacturing sector accounted for about $2 trillion\u2014or 12  percent of the U.S. economy\u2014and employed approximately 12 million  workers\u2014or about 9 percent of the U.S. workforce. U.S. manufacturers  continue to be the most productive in an increasingly global marketplace,  according to the President\u2019s Council of Advisors on Science and  Technology, and the development of innovative products and processes  serves as an important driver of U.S. competitiveness. Small and  medium-sized manufacturers are particularly important to U.S.  competitiveness because they represent a majority of manufacturers in  the country.", "However, small and medium-sized manufacturers often lag behind large  firms in innovation and adopting new technologies. In comparison to  other sectors, manufacturing has a greater need for capital because of  the heavier use of machinery and equipment. The sector also requires  more working capital because of the longer periods of time needed to  convert materials into finished commercial products and sell them. Many  small and medium- sized manufacturers have reported difficulty gaining  access to the capital they need. If capital access is limited, small and  medium-sized manufacturers may face greater difficulty developing and  commercializing innovative technologies in order to remain competitive.", "To invest in innovation, improve U.S. competitiveness, and help address  the capital needs of small and medium-sized manufacturers, the America  COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (COMPETES 2010), among  other things, directed the Secretary of Commerce to establish the Federal  Loan Guarantees for Innovative Technologies in Manufacturing (ITM)  program. The ITM program is intended to support loan guarantees for  small and medium-sized manufacturers for the use or production of  innovative technologies. A key issue debated during consideration of  COMPETES 2010 was whether the ITM program would duplicate existing  loan guarantee programs at other federal agencies, including programs at  the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Small Business  Administration (SBA). COMPETES 2010 directs the Secretary of  Commerce to ensure, to the maximum extent practicable, that the  activities carried out under the ITM program are coordinated with, and do  not duplicate, the efforts of other federal loan guarantee programs.  Ultimately, the Economic Development Administration (EDA) within the  Department of Commerce (Commerce) was assigned the task of  implementing the ITM program.", "COMPETES 2010 also included a provision that GAO conduct biennial  reviews of the Secretary of Commerce\u2019s execution of the program. In our  first report on the program, published in July 2013, we found that EDA  had taken preliminary steps to execute the program, but it had not yet  issued any loan guarantees. We found that EDA officials had (1)  established a staffing budget and initiated a search for key staff members  including an attorney and a program director, (2) obtained technical  assistance from SBA on how to develop a loan guarantee program, (3)  created a timeline for executing the program, and (4) published a request  in the Federal Register for comments from manufacturers and potential  lenders to help determine the level of demand and ideal structure for the  program. According to EDA officials, at that time, they expected to issue  the first loan guarantees in December 2015. This second report assesses  (1) the status of EDA\u2019s implementation of the ITM program and (2) the  extent to which EDA has coordinated with other agencies to ensure that  ITM program activities do not duplicate the efforts of other federal loan  guarantee programs.", "To assess the status of EDA\u2019s implementation of the ITM program, we  analyzed applicable laws and reviewed program documents, as well as  documents published in the Federal Register related to the program. We  also reviewed the contract and statement of work for a contractor EDA  hired to assist in developing the program. To identify completed and  pending key tasks, we reviewed EDA\u2019s project plan, which included  information on tasks required to implement the ITM program from  program development to issuance of the first loan guarantee, and each  task\u2019s level of completion. We also interviewed EDA officials and  contractor staff about the program\u2019s development, among other topics.", "To assess the extent to which Commerce has coordinated with other  agencies to ensure that ITM program activities do not duplicate the efforts  of other federal loan guarantee programs, we reviewed the 2014 Catalog  of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) to identify examples of  comparable loan guarantee programs at other federal agencies. We  verified program information and parameters listed in the CFDA against  the Electronic Code of Federal Regulations and agency websites, and  then asked agency officials to confirm this information during interviews.  To mitigate the possibility that the CFDA information excluded relevant  programs, we asked officials from agencies with comparable programs  whether there were any other potentially comparable programs at their  agencies. Using this methodology, we identified four examples of  programs that are comparable to the ITM program because they provide  loan guarantees for domestic manufacturers and allow or specifically  target businesses producing, using, or commercializing innovative  technologies, among other criteria. These four programs are as follows:", "SBA\u2019s 7(a) Loan Guarantee program, which provides loan guarantees  to small businesses for a variety of purposes;", "USDA\u2019s Business and Industry Loans program, which provides loan  guarantees to rural businesses and cooperatives for a variety of  purposes;", "USDA\u2019s Biorefinery, Renewable Chemical, and Biobased Product  Manufacturing Assistance program, which provides loan guarantees  for the development, construction, and retrofitting of commercial-scale  biorefineries; and", "Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) Federal Loan Guarantees for  Innovative Energy Technologies program, which provides loan  guarantees for the use of new or significantly improved technologies  in energy projects that avoid, reduce, or sequester air pollutants or  greenhouse gases. See appendix I for additional information on these  four programs.", "We interviewed EDA officials and officials associated with the comparable  programs at SBA, USDA, and DOE to assess the extent to which EDA  has coordinated with those agencies to minimize duplication with their  federal loan guarantee programs. Specifically, we asked SBA, USDA, and  DOE officials about the interactions and discussions they had with EDA  regarding the development of the ITM program and their experiences with  implementing loan guarantee programs at their own agencies. We also  interviewed EDA officials to identify how they coordinated with other  agencies and incorporated information gathered from those agencies as  they developed the ITM program. For each of the programs, we reviewed  regulations and budgetary information. Using information from these  documents we compared programs based on program features such as  program purpose, allowable loan amounts, and recipient population.  Furthermore, we interviewed a National Institute of Standards and  Technology (NIST) Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP)  program official with experience related to the financial resources and  strategies MEP centers can use to help manufacturers develop innovative  products or expand markets and sales. We discussed NIST\u2019s interactions  with EDA officials about the ITM program, the needs of small and  medium-sized manufacturers, and marketing and outreach. We obtained  a NIST MEP report on the capital needs of small and medium-sized  manufacturers, which we reviewed and determined to be sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of this report.

If a borrower defaults on a guaranteed loan, the lender is to be  reimbursed by the agency for the balance of the guaranteed portion of the  loan. The guaranteed portion of a loan may vary across federal loan  guarantee programs. A loan guarantee gives lenders an incentive to  make loans that, due to the perceived risk of default, they otherwise might  not make without requiring, for example, higher interest rates or additional  collateral. For each of their loan guarantee portfolios, agencies are  required to estimate the long-term cost to the government, which is  referred to as the credit subsidy cost. The credit subsidy cost for each  loan guarantee is equal to the amount of the estimated losses or gains to  the federal government over the life of the loan. As part of the  agreement, lenders may be required to pay fees to the agency to offset  administrative expenses and credit subsidy costs.", "Part of EDA\u2019s mission is to support economic development by promoting  innovation, global competitiveness, and regional collaboration. In addition  to developing the ITM program, EDA\u2019s activities include providing funding  through a number of investment programs, as well as offering a variety of  services that include technical assistance, postdisaster recovery  assistance, trade adjustment support, strategic planning, and research  and evaluation. EDA does not currently administer any loan guarantee  programs besides the pending ITM program.", "In directing the establishment of the ITM program, COMPETES 2010  provided for three types of eligible projects\u2014ones that reequip, expand,  or establish a manufacturing facility in the United States to use an innovative technology or an innovative process in manufacture an innovative technology product or an integral  component of such a product; or commercialize an innovative product, process, or idea that was  developed by research funded in whole or in part by a grant from the  federal government.", "As it has designed the ITM program, EDA has drafted the following  definitions to help determine project eligibility:  innovative\u2014defined as representing a significant improvement in  function, performance, reliability, or quality of a product or service in  comparison to commercial technologies currently in use, and technological\u2014defined as relying on the principles of one of the  following sciences: engineering, physical sciences, computer  sciences, or biological sciences.", "The ITM program will provide a guarantee for up to 80 percent of a loan,  with a maximum loan size of $10 million, or up to $15 million in certain  circumstances, according to EDA officials. Through fiscal year 2015,  Congress has appropriated $19 million for the ITM program. Credit  subsidy costs are based on the assumption that the government will only  need to reimburse lenders for a percentage of the loan guarantees made.  In this case, according to EDA estimates, the agency will need to reserve  about 7 percent of the value of loans guaranteed to cover the cost of  future defaults. The program may support a total of up to $70 million in  guaranteed loans for each $5 million in appropriations. This $5 million can  be used to support $70 million in guaranteed loans because costs to the  government are only incurred when a borrower defaults on a loan.", "Although Commerce\u2019s EDA was given the task of implementing the ITM  program, COMPETES 2010 stated that Commerce may use its NIST  MEP centers to provide information about the ITM program and conduct  outreach to potential borrowers.
