Moreover, IRS oversight of charities suffers from a lack of results-oriented goals and strategies. Concerns have also been raised that IRS's resources have not kept pace with the growth in the charitable sector, and some measures suggest that available resources may not be used as effectively as in the past. State officials consider inadequate the charity data IRS shares with them. IRS does not proactively share some data that states are permitted to receive, such as denials and revocations of charities' tax-exempt status. Federal law prohibits sharing some data that state officials believe would be valuable, such as the status and results of examinations of charities' returns."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Millions of donors annually give hundreds of billions of dollars to charities.

Oversight relies on the public (including donors, organizations that oversee charities\u2014referred to as \u201cwatchdogs\u201d\u2014and the media), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and states. This combined oversight not only checks compliance with relevant laws, but also guides the public\u2019s decisions about donations and stems abuses by charities. Although the common belief is that the vast majority of charities strive to meet their charitable purpose, if a few charities abuse the public trust, the support given to the charitable community can be undercut.", "This report focuses on the adequacy of (1) publicly reported Form 990 (see app. I) data on charity spending in facilitating public oversight of charities, (2) IRS\u2019s oversight of charities, and (3) IRS\u2019s data sharing with state agencies that oversee charities. In researching these issues, we met with IRS and Department of the Treasury officials and reviewed IRS documents. We did the same at state and watchdog groups that oversee charities. We reviewed studies on charities and analyzed IRS\u2019s data on its oversight of charities and its Forms 990 on charity operations from filing years 1994 through 1999. Data for more recent years were not available when we did our work."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 501(c) establishes 27 categories of tax-exempt organizations. The largest number of such organizations falls under Section 501(c)(3), which recognizes charitable organizations. Generally, charities pay no income taxes on contributions received, but they can be taxed on income generated from unrelated business activities. These charities and related parties may be subject to several additional IRS excise taxes and penalties for certain actions, such as not filing a required tax return. Generally, taxpayers may deduct the amount of any contributions to charities from their taxable income.", "By 2000, IRS had recognized 1.35 million tax-exempt organizations under Section 501(c), of which 820,000 (60 percent) were charities. Social welfare, labor, and business leagues accounted for 280,000 (21 percent) of the tax-exempt organizations. The remaining organizations (about 19 percent) were exempt under other Section 501(c) categories. At the end of 1999, the assets of Section 501(c)(3) organizations approached $1.2 trillion and their annual revenues approached $720 billion.", "The term charitable, as defined in the regulations that underlie IRC Section 501(c)(3), includes assisting the poor, the distressed, or the underprivileged; advancing religion; advancing education or science; erecting or maintaining public buildings, monuments, or works; lessening neighborhood tensions; eliminating prejudice and discrimination; defending human and civil rights; and combating community deterioration and juvenile delinquency. An organization must apply for IRS recognition as a tax-exempt charity that strives to meet one or more of these purposes. In general, a charity is to serve broad public interests, rather than specific private interests.", "Generally, public charities are required to file annual information returns with IRS that are also available to the public. The larger charities file Form 990, Return of Organization Exempt from Income Tax. Smaller charities\u2014with gross receipts of less than $100,000 and total assets of less than $250,000\u2014are allowed to file an abbreviated Form 990-EZ. The smallest charities, with less than $25,000 in gross receipts, and certain other types of organizations, such as churches and certain other religious organizations, are not required to file. The Form 990 is to be filed within about 5 months of the end of the charity\u2019s accounting year, with extensions available.", "Form 990 has 105 line items on 6 pages, as well as 45 pages of instructions. The data on various finances and activities provide a basis for reviewing whether the organization continues to meet the requirements for tax exemption. The form also has two schedules: Schedule A and Schedule B. Schedule A covers several areas, including compensation of employees and independent contractors earning over $50,000 annually; lobbying activities; sources of revenue; and relationships with noncharitable exempt organizations, such as social welfare organizations. Schedule B is to be filed by certain charities that receive contributions of $5,000 or more from one or more donors. Charities may be required to file other forms in specific situations. Appendix I describes the Form 990.", "IRS and various stakeholders\u2014such as the states and \u201ccharity watchdogs\u201d\u2014oversee charitable operations to protect the public interest in part by reviewing the Forms 990. Certain charities, including those receiving federal and private grants, obtain independent financial audits. To the extent that such audit information is available in conjunction with Forms 990, those doing the oversight have more information on the financial status of the charities, and individuals can make more informed choices about donations to specific charities. Recognizing the importance of public oversight and a \u201cfree market\u201d, where charities compete for donations, Congress expanded public disclosure of and access to the Form 990. Such oversight is important to help support charities, inform donors about how their money is spent on a charitable purpose, and stem potential abuses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["Our objectives in this review were to analyze the adequacy of (1) publicly reported Form 990 data on charity spending in facilitating public oversight of charities, (2) IRS\u2019s oversight activities for charities, and (3) IRS\u2019s data sharing with state agencies that oversee charities.", "For the spending data reported by charities, we interviewed IRS officials and experts (e.g., AICPA, the Urban Institute) to learn about charities\u2019 reporting of expense data on the Form 990 and about independent financial audits. We reviewed studies such as those done by the Urban Institute, academicians, and the Chronicle on Philanthropy to better understand the expense data. We analyzed expense data reported by charities on the Form 990. IRS\u2019s Statistics of Income (SOI) Division had available data on charity expenses, but those data only covered up to 1998 and did not include data on \u201cjoint-cost allocations\u201d (e.g., allocating selected expenses between education and fundraising). To obtain at least 2 years of joint-cost data, we purchased filing years 1998 and 1999 data from the Urban Institute which contracts with IRS to digitize Form 990 data for the full population of charities that filed Form 990. For some large charities, primarily hospitals, expense data such as by line items of the Form 990 were not available to the Urban Institute. Thus, only joint-cost data and aggregate data for expenses, assets, and revenues for 1999 are presented throughout our report. Because several sources of data were used, data are presented by filing, tax, and fiscal years in this report.", "For IRS oversight of charities, we talked with responsible IRS officials to identify oversight processes when charities apply for recognition of their tax-exempt status and when IRS examines Forms 990 filed by charities. For these types of oversight, we reviewed documentation on IRS\u2019s processes and criteria used to review applications and examined Forms 990. We also analyzed related data for fiscal years 1996 through 2001. For applications, such IRS data included the number and types of applications received and their dispositions. For examinations, such data focused on the number and types of examinations and their results. In addition, we contacted other federal agencies, such as the Federal Trade Commission, to understand the types of oversight of charities that they conducted and the extent to which they coordinated that oversight with IRS. Appendix V discusses our selection of the agencies and our work.", "For IRS data sharing with states, we interviewed IRS officials and reviewed IRS documents. We did the same at the National Association of State Charity Officials (NASCO), which represents 38 states that oversee charities to protect public interests. We participated in an October 9, 2001, annual NASCO conference. At the conference, we asked state officials about their oversight and coordination with IRS or others. We talked with Treasury, IRS, and state officials about the tradeoffs of changing the law to allow IRS to share oversight data (e.g., examination results) with state charity officials. We also reviewed related studies and articles.", "For all three objectives, we collected documents from and talked with officials at various organizations. We talked with officials at the Joint Committee on Taxation about its reports in 2000 on disclosure of tax data on charities and on public, IRS, and state oversight. On the basis of referrals from IRS and NASCO, we talked with and collected documents from officials at the Council on Foundations, the Independent Sector, the GuideStar project at Philanthropic Research Inc., the Direct Marketing Association, and others that were knowledgeable about charity data, oversight, or fundraising. We reviewed documents from and talked with officials at three watchdog groups\u2014Better Business Bureau Wise-Giving Alliance, Charity Navigator, and American Institute of Philanthropy\u2014that oversee charities.", "We also asked for comments on short sections or summaries of the draft report from the organizations that provided data or perspectives on those sections. We made technical changes to the report where appropriate after receiving their comments. For example, we did not use the 1999 detailed expense data from the Urban Institute after receiving its comments. The Urban Institute did not have the necessary data to resolve certain discrepancies with the detailed data (e.g., reported line item amounts not equaling reported aggregate amount for expenses) before we issued the report. As a result, we deleted analyses of the detailed expense data for 1999 that had been in the draft report.", "We conducted our work in Washington, D.C., from June 2001 through March 2002, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

No measures are available on the accuracy of the expense data and substantial discretion in allocating the expenses makes use of the data problematic in comparing charities. Given such data limitations, public oversight of charities cannot rely solely on the expense data reported on the Form 990.", "A key potential use of data on charities\u2019 spending is to show what portion is spent on charitable purposes through program services (i.e., efficiency). In aggregate, the data show that from 1994 through 1998, charities allocated, on average, 87 percent of their spending to charitable program services and the remainder to fundraising and general management,suggesting a high-level of spending efficiency, as shown in figure 1.

At the same time, however, IRS officials and watchdog groups have expressed concerns about potential or actual inaccuracy in Form 990 expense data.", "Because efficiency is a criterion that donors may use in selecting among charities, charities have an incentive to report their expenses in a manner that makes them appear to be efficient. IRS has discovered instances in which charity fundraising expenses have been underreported because charities have \u201cnetted\u201d such expenses against the funds raised. According to IRS, fundraising expenses include fees paid to professional fundraisers as well as in-house expenses (e.g., salaries) for fundraising.", "For example, a charity might contract with a professional fundraiser to raise donations. The fundraiser might raise $250,000, charge the charity a fee of $150,000, and give the charity the remaining $100,000. When reporting to IRS, the charity \u201cnets fundraising expenses\u201d by reporting the $100,000 as a direct public contribution and does not report the $150,000 retained by the professional fundraiser as a fee. Such reporting does not comply with IRS instructions, under which the charity should report the full amount raised ($250,000) as the direct public contribution and the fee retained by the fundraiser ($150,000) on line item 30 of the Form 990.", "As with netting of fundraising expenses, IRS has found that some charities have misreported professional fundraising fees as \u201cother\u201d expenses, but has not measured the extent to which charities do this. In these cases, a charity would report professional fundraising fees on line item 43 of the Form 990, along with other expenses, rather than on line item 30 for such fees. IRS requires charities to itemize expenses on 22 different line items on Form 990 and expressly prohibits reporting professional fundraising or other fees on line item 43 with \u201cother\u201d expenses that are not appropriate for the accompanying 21 line items. Available data do not show the extent to which charities may fail to properly itemize their expenses such as for professional fundraising, but \u201cother\u201d expenses represent a significant portion of all reported expenses. Our analysis showed that for 1994 through 1998, on average, 26 percent of all expenses were reported as \u201cother\u201d expenses, as shown in figure 2.", "Despite not knowing the extent of misreporting, IRS has been sufficiently concerned that it has taken steps to better ensure charities properly report their expenses, especially for fundraising. Regarding netting of fundraising fees, IRS clarified its reporting instructions in 2001 and publicized the changes. Regarding reporting fundraising (and \u201cother\u201d fees) on the designated Form 990 line item rather than on the \u201cother\u201d expense line item, IRS believed its instructions were clear, but has reiterated them in its Continuing Professional Educational text for fiscal year 2002 and in training for its examiners. IRS makes this text available to tax practitioners and the public to inform them about the proper application of tax laws and regulations. IRS is instructing its examiners during fiscal year 2002 to check whether fundraising is being properly reported and to impose penalties where appropriate. IRS plans to convene a taskforce to consider what projects should be undertaken involving fundraising and Form 990 reporting, but the details have not yet been determined.", "Within the charitable community, various organizations have been concerned about the accuracy of charitable expense reporting, with concerns often focusing on fundraising expenses. A 1999 Urban Institute study of Form 990 expense data found that 59 percent of 58,127 charities that received public donations either reported zero fundraising expenses or left this line item blank on the Form 990. Using the same criteria as the Urban Institute, our analysis of the Form 990 data from 1994 through 1998 found the number, on average, to be 64 percent, as shown in figure 3.", "We did similar analyses for all charities, regardless of whether they received public donations. From 1994 to 1998, 69 percent of all charities reported either no fundraising expenses or left this line item blank (line item 15) on the Form 990. We further analyzed how many charities reported no fees paid to professional fundraisers on the Form 990 from 1994 through 1998. On average, over 93 percent of all charities reported either no fees paid to professional fundraisers or left this line item blank (line item 30) on the Form 990. that so many charities would report no fundraising expenses, but acknowledged that several factors could account for low fundraising expenses. For instance, it noted that the smaller the amount of funds raised, the less likely charities may be to incur fundraising expenses. However, the Urban Institute did not indicate the amount that could be raised without incurring fundraising expenses. Thus, it would not be surprising for some charities, such as small ones or newer ones, to have little or no fundraising expenses.", "The Urban Institute also notes that charities that raise revenues through \u201cspecial events and activities\u201d (Form 990, line item 9c) may legitimately report little or no fundraising expenses. When we accounted for those reporting special event expenses among those represented in figure 3, we found that, on average for 1994-1998, 34.8 percent of all remaining charities that received contributions did not report fundraising expenses.", "In addition, various articles have discussed problems in charities\u2019 reporting of fundraising expenses. For example, a May 2000 article in the Chronicle of Philanthropy discussed how some charities leave the \u201cpublic in the dark\u201d by not reporting fundraising expenses.

Figure 4 shows the three functional expense categories and the related lines for specific expenses.", "Although the three expense categories differ, their boundaries overlap. Fundraising activities may be mixed with program services, especially when a charity provides education related to its charitable purpose in a fundraising solicitation. Similarly, general management expenses may be mixed with the delivery of program services and fundraising. Charity employees may, for instance, spend time managing the daily support of the charity, spend time participating in raising funds, and spend time providing program services.", "We analyzed the portions of total program service expenses (line item 13 of Form 990) during 1994 through 1998 that came from (1) grants and specific assistance (line items 22 and 23) that can only be charged to program service expenses to meet the charitable purpose or (2) expenses such as salaries, travel, etc. (line items 24 through 43) that can be charged to the program service, fundraising, and general management categories. It is important to recognize that expenses such as salaries and travel can be charged to program services when they are incurred in connection with meeting the charitable purpose. Table 1 shows the analysis of the types of expenses comprising program service expenses.", "Charities can use different methods (which are not reported on the Form 990) for charging and allocating expenses. Such differences can affect comparisons across charities. Thus, charity watchdog groups, organizational donors, or others may draw inappropriate conclusions when comparing the expenses charged to program services or allocated across the three functional categories. Neither IRS nor the professional accounting accrediting bodies require or prohibit particular allocation methods. In general, any method for charging or allocating expenses should be reasonable, logical, and consistently applied given the circumstances and facts. Organizations that provide funds or grants to charities are likely to provide guidance or requirements for charging and allocating expenses and to require independent financial audits.", "Among the methods for allocating joint fundraising costs, the three methods mentioned routinely by accounting professionals and in accounting texts are the: (1) physical units method, (2) relative direct cost method, and (3) stand-alone joint-cost allocation method. Each method can produce a different financial \u201cportrait,\u201d and no one method is appropriate for all circumstances.", "The method used determines the allocation of expenses among fundraising, program services and general management. For example, suppose a charity contracts with an external fundraiser to conduct a mail solicitation in which the letter combines program service (education) and fundraising text over 100 lines. The fundraiser\u2019s $1 million fee covers expenses for identifying potential donors and creating and mailing the letter. The charity must devise a way to equitably allocate the fundraiser\u2019s expenses. One way is to use the physical units method of allocation. The physical units method uses identifiable, measurable, and calculable physical aspects of fundraising instruments to allocate expenses. In this example, the physical aspects are the number of text lines in the solicitation letter. If 10 lines of text covered fundraising and 90 lines covered program services, an allocation based on counting lines would allow the charity to allocate $100,000 to fundraising and $900,000 to program services.", "However, this method of allocation may be inappropriate if most of the expenses incurred actually related to the use of the donor mailing list\u2014the value of which relates more to fundraising than to program services. The stand-alone joint-cost-allocation method might provide a more reasonable allocation in this circumstance. If this method were used, and if $750,000 of the fundraiser\u2019s fee covered the value of its mailing list, at least $750,000 of the $1 million in total costs would be for fundraising and no more than $250,000 would count for program services. Thus, the method used can materially influence the allocation of a charity\u2019s expenses.", "In March 1998, the AICPA published Statement of Position 98-2 (SOP 98-2) \u201cAccounting for Costs of Activities of Not\u2013for\u2013Profit Organizations and State and Local Governmental Entities That Include Fundraising\u201d to provide guidance on the allocation of joint activities, such as those when program services and fundraising are involved. SOP 98-2 was intended to provide consistent, clear, and detailed guidance for reporting joint activities. SOP 98-2 sets three criteria (purpose, audience, and content) that must be met to allocate such joint-cost expenses to the Form 990 program services or management and general categories, rather than to fundraising. The three SOP 98-2 criteria are:   Purpose: should show that fundraising activities will help meet a program service or general management purpose.", "Audience: should show that donors are selected to meet a program service or a general management purpose rather than to contribute only funds.", "Content: should show that the content of the joint activity supports the charity\u2019s program service or general management purpose.", "According to AICPA, if any of these criteria are not met, then all expenses should be allocated to fundraising. All three criteria require a call for action in order to allocate expenses to program services. A call for action makes general requests for involvement with an activity or cause, regardless of whether the individual contributes funding to those requesting the involvement. Absent a call to action, SOP 98-2 recognizes the activity as fundraising, and no expenses should be allocated to program services.", "IRS added a checkbox to the 2001 Form 990 to indicate whether SOP 98-2 had been used to account for joint costs. IRS noted that the purpose was to facilitate the understanding of those reading the Form 990. IRS also is asking for comments on whether the use of SOP 98-2 should be required for certain filers (such as those above a specified amount of assets) to ensure greater uniformity in expense allocations and better comparison of fundraising expenses across charities.

Charity watchdog groups, GuideStar, the Urban Institute, and others have spoken against reliance on spending efficiency ratios as the sole measure of a charity\u2019s worthiness. The expense data and related efficiency ratios (such as program service expenses compared with all expenses) do not provide much perspective on other attributes of charities, such as how well they accomplish their charitable purpose, regardless of the amounts spent.", "Charity watchdogs have evolved to help monitor charities and enhance public oversight. In general, within the resources they have, these watchdog groups use the Form 990 data and other available data to analyze aspects of selected charities. These watchdog groups analyze spending efficiency ratios, but note limitations that could mislead the public on which charities are and are not doing well. Spending efficiency fluctuates with factors such as the popularity of the cause, age of the charity, and type of charitable activities. For example, an established, well- known charity may spend more money on fundraising than a newer charity. A charity also may have wide swings in its spending for charitable purposes if, for instance, those purposes are affected by sudden changes from events such as natural disasters. Also, a charity saving funds to build a facility to serve its charitable purpose may have no program service expenses until adequate funds are raised to begin the project.", "When evaluating a charity, the public also considers how well a charity accomplishes its charitable purposes, which is not measured by spending data. However, measuring accomplishments and comparing charities on that basis is difficult to do according to the Independent Sector, the Urban Institute, and others (such as academicians). Given the wide diversity in the charity community, no standard rules have been devised to guide charities in reporting accomplishments. The Form 990 has a section that asks charities to report what was accomplished with the program service expenses; IRS\u2019s instructions allow discretion on reporting those accomplishments.", "Other standards that the charity watchdog groups have suggested for evaluating charities include the manner in which the charity governs itself, raises funds, informs the public, accounts for its finances, prepares budgets and financial documents, and has independent audits or reviews.

IRS staffing for overseeing tax-exempt organizations fell between 1996 and 2001 while at the same time the number of new applications for tax exemption and the number of Forms 990 filed increased.

Rather, IRS focuses on other issues related to the tax exemption for charities. For instance, in reviewing applications for recognition as tax-exempt charities, IRS focuses on whether applicants plan to undertake activities that meet the criteria for tax-exempt status and that adhere to standards such as restrictions on private benefits accruing to charity officials. Similarly, when examining charities\u2019 Forms 990, IRS checks for compliance with specific requirements applicable to charities, such as meeting a recognized charitable purpose. On the basis of discussions with IRS and state officials, oversight of charities\u2019 efficiency and effectiveness is more likely to be accomplished through the public\u2019s decisions about which charities to support and through states\u2019 efforts to ensure that charities do not abuse their charitable status.", "As for oversight of applications, IRS revenue agents review the applications of organizations seeking tax-exempt status as charities.

According to IRS, the results of the market segment studies are intended to help refine the selection criteria for identifying noncompliant returns for examination as well as help identify other strategies to improve compliance such as additional guidance, clearer instructions, or correspondence on apparent noncompliance. Understanding compliance problems and measuring compliance among the various types of charities also is intended to help determine where to focus resources.", "As of February 2002, about half of the selected segments dealt with a wide variety of tax-exempt organizations that were not charities and about half dealt with various types of charities such as those for hospitals, colleges, and churches.

The planning principles in the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) and incorporated into IRS\u2019s Strategic Planning, Budgeting, and Performance Management process call for agencies to define the measurable results they are attempting to achieve, generally over several years. This approach is intended to ensure that agencies have thought through how the activities and initiatives they are undertaking are likely to add up to a meaningful result that their programs are intended to accomplish.

Key to the proper functioning of this marketplace is the availability of reliable data, such as Form 990 data, that donors can use to make informed choices about which charities merit their contributions.", "However, due to suspected but unmeasured inaccuracy in some charities\u2019 reporting of their expenses and to the range of discretion that charities have in charging and allocating expenses, Form 990 expense data alone are not adequate for public oversight of charities and should be used with caution.
