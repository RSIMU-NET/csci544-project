GAO used a statistical random sample of 2008 CMS contract actions (including contract awards and modifications) to assess CMS internal control procedures. The results were projected to the population of 2008 CMS contract actions.

Specifically, based on our statistical random sample of 2008 CMS contract actions, GAO estimates that at least 84.3 percent of fiscal year 2008 contract actions contained at least one instance where a key control was not adequately implemented. GAO also estimates that at least 37.2 percent of fiscal year 2008 contract actions had three or more instances in which a key control was not adequately implemented. The contract actions GAO evaluated were generally subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation. For example, CMS used cost reimbursement contracts without first ensuring that the contractor had an adequate accounting system. Also, project officers did not always certify invoices for payment. These deficiencies were due in part to a lack of agency-specific policies and procedures to help ensure proper contracting expenditures. These control deficiencies also stem from a weak overall control environment as characterized primarily by inadequate strategic planning for staffing and funding resources. CMS also did not accurately capture data on the nature and extent of its contracting, which hinders CMS's ability to manage its acquisition function by identifying areas of risk, due to a lack of quality assurance procedures over data entry. CMS also has not substantially addressed seven of the nine recommendations made by GAO in 2007 to improve internal control over contracting and payments to contractors. For example, CMS has not made progress in clarifying the roles and responsibilities for implementing certain contractor oversight responsibilities and, as of July 2009, CMS still had a backlog of contacts that were overdue for closeout, putting CMS at increased risk of not identifying or recovering improper payments or waste. The continuing weaknesses in contracting activities and limited progress in addressing known deficiencies will continue to put billions of taxpayer dollars at risk of improper payments or waste."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), a component of  the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), administers the  high-risk programs of Medicare and Medicaid, and other programs such as  the State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program. CMS relies extensively on  contractors to assist in carrying out its basic mission, including program  administration, management, and oversight of its health programs. In fiscal  year 2008, CMS reported that it obligated $3.6 billion under contracts for a  variety of goods and services. CMS\u2019s acquisitions include contracts to  administer, oversee, and audit claims made under the Medicare program;  provide information technology systems; provide program management  and consulting services; and operate the 1-800 Medicare help line.", "In November 2007, we reported significant deficiencies in internal control  over certain contracts used by CMS for start-up administrative services to  implement programs enacted under the Medicare Prescription Drug,  Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA).

This report addresses the extent to which (1) CMS implemented effective  internal control procedures over contract actions to help ensure proper  contracting expenditures and (2) CMS established a strong control  environment for contract management.", "To address the extent to which CMS implemented control procedures over  contract actions, we focused on contracts that were generally subject to  the FAR (i.e., FAR-based), which represented about $2.5 billion, or about  70 percent, of total obligations awarded in fiscal year 2008. The FAR is the  governmentwide regulation containing the rules, standards, and  requirements for the award, administration, and termination of  government contracts. Based on the standards for internal control, FAR  requirements, and agency policies, we identified and evaluated 11 key  internal control procedures over contract actions, ranging from ensuring  contractors had adequate accounting systems prior to the use of a cost  reimbursement contract to certifying invoices for payment. Contract  actions include new contract awards and modifications to existing  contracts. We conducted our tests on a statistically random sample of 102  FAR-based contract actions CMS made in fiscal year 2008 and projected  the results of our statistical sample conservatively by reporting the lower  bound of our two-sided, 95 percent confidence interval. We tested a  variety of contract actions including a range of dollars obligated, different  contract types (fixed price, cost reimbursement, etc.), and the types of  goods and services procured. The actions in the sample ranged from a  $1,000 firm-fixed price contract for newspapers to a $17.5 million  modification of an information technology contract valued at over $500  million. For each contract action in the sample, we determined if the 11  key internal control procedures were implemented by reviewing the  contract file supporting the action and, where applicable, by obtaining  additional information from the contracting officer or specialist or senior  acquisition management. We also tested the reliability of the data  contained in CMS\u2019s two acquisition databases. Basic attributes of its  contract actions, such as contractor name and obligation amount, which  we found to be reliable for purposes of this report, were used to produce  the historical obligation information presented in the background section.", "To address the extent to which CMS established a strong control  environment for contract management, we obtained and reviewed  documentation regarding contract closeout, acquisition planning, and  other management information and interviewed officials in the Office of  Acquisition and Grants Management (OAGM) about its contract  management processes.

Obligations for other- than-claims processing activities, such as the 1-800 help line, information  technology and financial management initiatives, and program  management and consulting services, have increased 466 percent, as  shown in figure 1. These trends may be explained in part by recent  changes to the Medicare program, including the movement of functions,  such as the help line, data centers, and certain financial management  activities, from the fiscal intermediaries and carriers to specialized  contractors. These specialized contractors, such as beneficiary contact  center contractors and enterprise data center contractors, are categorized  below as other-than-claims processing contractors.", "MMA required CMS to transition its Medicare claims processing contracts,  which generally did not follow the FAR, to the FAR environment through  the award of contracts to Medicare Administrative Contractors. CMS  projected that the transition, referred to as Medicare contracting reform,  would produce administrative cost savings due to the effects of  competition and contract consolidation as well as produce Medicare trust  fund savings due to a reduction in the amount of improper benefit  payments. Additionally, the transition would subject millions of dollars of  CMS acquisitions to the rules, standards, and requirements for the award,  administration, and termination of government contracts in the FAR.  Obligations to the new Medicare Administrative Contractors were first  made in fiscal year 2007. CMS is required to complete Medicare  contracting reform by 2011.

The  Enhanced Departmental Contracts Information System (DCIS) is an HHS  database that is used for department-level acquisition management and to  satisfy external reporting requirements. DCIS collects and forwards  information to the Federal Procurement Data System Next Generation  (FPDS-NG), which is a publicly available database of governmentwide  acquisition information. Likewise, FPDS-NG feeds into  www.usaspending.gov, a Web site created in response to the Federal  Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006, which required a  single searchable Web site, accessible by the public for free, that reports  key information for each federal award."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Acquisition, Contract Types, and Cognizant Federal Agency Responsibilities", "paragraphs": ["The contract life cycle includes many acquisition and administrative  activities. Prior to award, an agency identifies a need; develops a  requirements package; determines the method of contracting; solicits and  evaluates bids or proposals; and ultimately awards a contract. After  contract award, the agency performs contract administration and contract  closeout. Contract administration involves monitoring the contractor\u2019s  performance as well as reviewing and approving (or disapproving) the  contractor\u2019s request for payment. Other tasks may include audits or  reviews of the contractor\u2019s costs and compliance with CAS. The contract  closeout process involves verifying that the goods or services were  provided and that administrative matters are completed, including a  contract audit of costs billed to the government and adjusting for any over-  or underpayments based on the final invoice.", "Agencies may choose among different contract types to acquire goods and  services. This choice is the principal means that agencies have for  allocating risk between the government and the contractor. Contract types  can be grouped into three broad categories: fixed price contracts, cost  reimbursement contracts, and time and materials (T&M) contracts.  Although the FAR places limitations on the use of cost reimbursement and  T&M contract types, these contract types may be used to provide the  flexibility needed by the government to acquire the large variety and  volume of supplies and services it needs. As discussed below, these three  types of contracts place different levels of risk on the government and the  contractor. Generally, the government manages its risk, in part, through  oversight activities.", "For fixed price contracts, the government agrees to pay a set price for  goods or services regardless of the actual cost to the contractor. A  fixed price contract is ordinarily in the government\u2019s interest when  the risk involved is minimal or can be predicted with an acceptable  degree of certainty and a sound basis for pricing exists, as the  contractor assumes the risk for cost overruns.", "Under cost reimbursement contracts, the government agrees to pay  those costs of the contractor that are allowable, reasonable, and  allocable to the extent prescribed by the contract. The government  assumes most of the cost risk because the contractor is only required  to provide its best effort to meet contract objectives within the  estimated cost. If this cannot be done, the government can provide  additional funds to complete the effort, decide not to provide  additional funds, or terminate the contract. Cost reimbursement  contracts may be used only when the contractor\u2019s accounting system  is adequate for determining costs applicable to the contract and  appropriate government surveillance during performance will provide  reasonable assurance that efficient methods and effective cost  controls are used. In order to determine if the contractor has  efficient methods and effective cost controls, contracting officers and  other contracting oversight personnel may perform a comprehensive  review of contractor invoices to determine if the contractor is billing  costs in accordance with the contract terms and applicable  government regulations. In addition, the establishment of provisional  and final indirect cost rates helps to ensure that the government  makes payments for costs that are allowable, reasonable, and  allocable to the extent prescribed by the contract.", "For T&M contracts, the government agrees to pay fixed per-hour labor  rates and to reimburse other costs directly related to the contract,  such as materials, equipment, or travel, based on cost. Like cost  reimbursement contracts, the government assumes the cost risk  because the contractor is only required to make a good faith effort to  meet the government\u2019s needs within a ceiling price. A T&M contract  may be used only if the contracting officer prepares a determination  and findings that no other contract type is suitable and if the contract  includes a ceiling price that the contractor exceeds at its own risk. In  addition, since these contracts provide no positive profit incentive for  the contractor to control costs or use labor efficiently, the  government must conduct appropriate surveillance of contractor  performance to ensure efficient methods and effective cost controls  are being used.", "The FAR defines cognizant federal agency (CFA) as the agency  responsible for establishing forward pricing rates, final indirect cost rates  (when not accomplished by a designated contract auditor), and  administering cost accounting standards for all contracts in a business  unit. Generally, the CFA is the agency with the largest dollar amount of  negotiated contracts, including options, with the contractor. In addition,  the CFA may be responsible for establishing provisional indirect cost rates  (also known as \u201cbilling rates\u201d) based on recent reviews, previous rate  audits, experience, or similar reliable data to ensure that estimates are as  close as possible to final indirect cost rates anticipated."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Internal Control", "paragraphs": ["The Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government provide  the overall framework for establishing and maintaining internal control  and for identifying and addressing areas at greatest risk of fraud, waste,  abuse, and mismanagement.

As such, an entity\u2019s management should  establish and maintain an environment that sets a positive and supportive  attitude towards control and conscientious management. A positive  control environment provides discipline and structure as well as a climate  supportive of quality internal control, and includes an assessment of the  risks the agency faces from both external and internal sources. Control  activities are the policies, procedures, techniques, and mechanisms that  enforce management\u2019s directives and help ensure that actions are taken to  address risks. The standards further provide that information should be  recorded and communicated to management and oversight officials in a  form and within a time frame that enables them to carry out their  responsibilities. Finally, an entity should have internal control monitoring  activities in place to assess the quality of performance over time and  ensure that the findings of audits and other reviews are promptly resolved.", "Control activities include both preventive and detective controls.  Preventive controls\u2014such as invoice review prior to payment\u2014are  controls designed to prevent errors, improper payments, or waste, while  detective controls\u2014such as incurred cost audits\u2014are designed to identify  errors or improper payments after the payment is made. A sound system  of internal control contains a balance of both preventive and detective  controls that is appropriate for the agency\u2019s operations. While detective  controls are beneficial in that they identify funds that may have been  inappropriately paid and should be returned to the government, preventive  controls such as accounting system reviews and invoice reviews help to  reduce the risk of improper payments or waste before they occur. A key  concept introduced in our standards is that control activities selected for  implementation be cost beneficial. Generally it is more effective and  efficient to prevent improper payments. A control activity can be  preventive, detective, or both based on when the control occurs in the  contract life cycle."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Pervasive Deficiencies in Control Procedures at the Contract Level Increase the Risk of Improper Payments or Waste", "paragraphs": ["We found pervasive deficiencies in internal control over contracting and  payments to contractors.

CMS also  did not take appropriate steps to ensure that existing policies were  properly implemented nor maintain adequate documentation in its  contract files. Further, the Contract Review Board was not effective in  ensuring proper contract award actions. These internal control  deficiencies are a manifestation of CMS\u2019s weak overall control  environment, which is discussed later.", "As a result of our work, we estimate that at least 84.3 percent of FAR- based contract actions made by CMS in fiscal year 2008 contained at least  one instance in which a key control was not adequately implemented. (See  table 3 in app. I for a list of the 11 controls we tested, which ranged from  ensuring contractors had adequate accounting systems prior to the use of  a cost reimbursement contract to certifying invoices for payment.) Not  only was the number of internal control deficiencies widespread, but also  many contract actions had more than one deficiency. We also estimate  that at least 37.2 percent of FAR-based contract actions made in fiscal  year 2008 had three or more instances in which a key control was not  adequately implemented. The high percentage of deficiencies indicates a  serious failure of control procedures over FAR-based acquisitions, thereby  creating a heightened risk of making improper payments or waste.

CMS did not always meet FAR requirements for  specific contract types that were awarded, nor maintain adequate support  for approved provisional indirect cost rates, which are necessary to  determine the reasonableness of indirect costs billed on invoices.  Additionally, CMS did not timely perform or request audits of incurred  direct and indirect costs, which provide assurance that costs billed by the  contractor are allowable and reasonable under the terms of the contract  and applicable government regulations. These control deficiencies are  discussed in detail below and the results of the other control procedures  we tested can be found in appendix I.", "We estimate that at least 46.0 percent of fiscal year 2008 CMS  contract actions did not meet the FAR requirements applicable  to the specific contract type awarded. Sixteen contract actions  we tested had deficiencies\u2014of which 1 related to a letter contract, 9  related to cost reimbursement contracts, and 6 related to T&M  contracts. In the case of the letter contract, the contract file did not  contain the authorization for use of the letter contract, which is  required by HHSAR. In the case of cost reimbursement contracts, the  FAR states that a cost reimbursement contract may be used only  when the contractor\u2019s accounting system is adequate for determining  costs applicable to the contract. Of the contract awards in our  sample, we found 9 cases in which cost reimbursement contracts  were used without first ensuring that the contractor had an adequate  accounting system. An adequate contractor accounting system is key  to the government\u2019s ability to perform the various contract oversight  activities required by the FAR for cost reimbursement contracts. In  particular, contracting officers and other members of the federal  agency acquisition workforce rely on the contractors\u2019 contract  proposals, interim billings, provisional indirect cost rates, and reports  of actual costs incurred (which are used to finalize the direct and  indirect costs billed) all of which are generated from data maintained  in the contractor\u2019s accounting system. In addition to the 9 cases  above, during our review of modifications we observed another 6  cases in which cost reimbursement contracts were used even though  CMS was aware that the contractor\u2019s accounting system was  inadequate at the time of award. In one instance, the contracting  officer was aware that a contractor had an inadequate accounting  system resulting from numerous instances of noncompliance with  CAS. Using a cost reimbursement contract when a contractor does  not have an adequate accounting system hinders the government\u2019s  ability to fulfill its oversight duties throughout the contract life cycle.  Additionally, it increases risk of improper payments and the risk that  costs billed can not be substantiated during an audit.", "When choosing to use T&M contracts, the FAR requires contracting  officers to prepare and sign a determination and finding that no other  contract type is suitable for the acquisition. The justification is  required to set forth enough facts and circumstances to clearly and  convincingly justify the specific determination made. We found that  the determination and finding was either not documented or  insufficient in six T&M contract awards we reviewed. In cases when  the justification memorandum was prepared, contracting officers  merely quoted language from the FAR but did not set forth clear and  convincing findings\u2014that is, the particular circumstances, facts, or  reasoning essential to support the determination\u2014for why other  contract types could not be used. When the contracting officer does  not clearly and convincingly document the findings that support using  a T&M contract type, OAGM does not have assurance that the  appropriate contract type was used. In addition, for three of the  contract actions, the contract specialist told us that the actions the  document listed to mitigate the risk of awarding a T&M contract were  not performed. Because CMS did not carry out the stated mitigation  strategies used to justify the selection of the T&M contract type, it  increased its exposure to the risk of improper payments or waste.", "We estimate that for at least 40.4 percent of fiscal year 2008  contract actions, CMS did not have sufficient support for  provisional indirect cost rates nor did it identify instances  when a contractor billed rates higher than the rates that were  approved for use. Specifically, for 17 contract actions that utilized  indirect cost rates, CMS did not have documentation supporting what  would be the appropriate provisional indirect cost rates for the  contractor. For an additional 19 contract actions, the provisional rates  either did not match the indirect rates billed on the invoices or could  not be matched because the invoice did not provide sufficient detail.  The FAR states that provisional indirect cost rates shall be used in  reimbursing indirect costs such as fringe benefits or overhead costs  under cost reimbursement contracts and are used to prevent  substantial overpayment or underpayment of indirect costs. These  rates are generally established by the CFA, contracting officer, or  auditor on the basis of reliable data or previous rate audits and should  be set as close as possible to the anticipated final indirect cost rates.  Provisional indirect cost rates provide agencies with a mechanism by  which to determine if the indirect costs billed on invoices are  reasonable for the services provided until such time that final indirect  cost rates can be established, generally at the end of the contractor\u2019s  fiscal year. Approval of provisional indirect cost rates is important  given the fact that indirect costs can be more than 50 percent of the  total invoice amount. When the agency does not maintain adequate  support for provisional indirect rates, it increases its risk of making  improper payments.", "We estimate that for at least 52.6 percent of fiscal year 2008  contract actions, CMS did not have support for final indirect  cost rates. Specifically, 23 contract actions we tested did not have  documentation of final indirect cost rates or support for the prompt  request of an audit of indirect costs. The FAR states that final  indirect cost rates, which are based on the actual indirect costs  incurred during a given fiscal year, shall be used in reimbursing  indirect costs under cost reimbursement contracts. The amounts a  contractor billed using provisional indirect cost rates are adjusted  annually for final indirect cost rates providing a mechanism for the  government to timely ensure that indirect costs are allowable and  allocable to the contract. Final indirect cost rates are generally  negotiated by the government\u2019s negotiating team that includes the  CFA following an audit of a statement of incurred costs submitted by  the contractor. CMS officials told us that they generally adjust for  final indirect cost rates during contract closeout at the end of the  contract performance rather than annually mainly due to the cost and  effort the adjustment takes. Moreover, since final indirect cost rates  are established by the CFA, when CMS is not the CFA, CMS must wait  on the CFA to perform the necessary audit work required to establish  the final indirect cost rates. Not annually adjusting for final indirect  cost rates increases the risk that CMS is paying for costs that are not  allowable or allocable to the contract. Furthermore, putting off the  control activity until the end of contract performance increases the  risk of overpaying for indirect costs during contract performance and  may make identification or recovery of any unallowable costs during  contract closeout more difficult due to the passage of time.", "We estimate that for at least 54.9 percent of fiscal year 2008  contract actions, CMS did not promptly perform or request an  audit of direct costs. We found that 25 contract actions for which  this control applied did not have an audit of direct costs promptly  performed or requested. Similar to the audit of indirect costs, audits  of direct costs allow the government to verify that the costs billed by  the contractor were allowable, reasonable, and allocable to the  contract. The audit of direct costs is the responsibility of the  contracting officer; however, the contracting officer may request, for  a fee, that the CFA for the contractor perform the audit work. The  FAR does not provide time frames or other requirements for when the  audit of direct costs should be performed except that such an audit  may be necessary for closing out the contract at the end of contract  performance. Not annually auditing direct costs increases the risk  that CMS is paying for costs that are not allowable or allocable to the  contract."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CMS Did Not Follow Existing Policies on Invoice Certification and Purchase Card Oversight", "paragraphs": ["CMS had policies for invoice certification and purchase card oversight;  however, these policies were not consistently followed.

CMS\u2019s Acquisition Policy Notice 16-01 requires the project  officer to review each contractor invoice and recommend payment  approval or disapproval to the contracting officer. This review is to  determine, among other things, if the expenditure rate is  commensurate with technical progress and whether all direct cost  elements are appropriate, including subcontracts, travel, and  equipment. Based on his or her review, the project officer is then to  approve the invoice for payment by signing a Payments and Progress  Certification Form or disapprove by issuing a suspension notice. In  one case, although a contractor submitted over 100 invoices for fiscal  year 2008, only 8 were certified by the project officer. The total value  of the contract through January 2009 was about $64 million.", "After the project officer\u2019s review, the contracting officer or specialist  is also required to review invoices for critical elements such as  compliance with the terms of the contract\u2014including indirect cost  rates\u2014and mathematical accuracy. Based on a cursory review of the  fiscal year 2008 invoices submitted for payment, we found instances  in which the contracting officer or specialist did not identify items  that were inconsistent with the terms of the contract. For example,  facilities capital cost of money is generally disallowed by HHSAR.  However, we found two instances where the contractor billed, and  CMS paid, this cost. Another contractor submitted invoices under its  fixed price contract that were contrary to the payment schedule  stipulated in the contract terms. The contract required the contractor  to submit four invoices of equal amount every 3 months during the 1- year performance period. However, the contractor submitted one  invoice for the entire amount of the contract. Moreover, the invoice  was dated prior to the start date of the contract period of  performance. CMS increases its risk of making improper payments  when it does not properly review and approve invoices prior to  payment.", "OAGM also did not perform required audits and reviews of  CMS purchase cards to identify fraud or waste. These audits  and reviews are particularly important because of the authorized  spending limits. As of July 15, 2009, OAGM\u2019s purchase card program  had issued 123 cards with 20 percent having monthly spending limits  of at least $50,000. Eight card holders had monthly spending limits of  $100,000, the highest spending limit authorized by CMS. Without  sufficient oversight of the purchase card program, CMS does not have  assurance that only allowable transactions are procured through  purchase cards and that the purchase cards are not being used to  circumvent FAR competition requirements.", "The HHS purchase card policy guidance provides that the purchase  card coordinator, which at CMS is within OAGM, is required to  conduct surveillance of the purchase card program by annually  auditing cardholder transactions using such methods as statistical and  nonstatistical sampling, data mining, and spot checks; monitoring  purchase card usage; and deactivitating purchase cards when  appropriate, among other things. The OAGM purchase card  coordinator\u2019s supervisor told us that OAGM did not perform the  oversight activities because the supervisor viewed those activities as  the responsibility of the Office of Financial Management (OFM).

For example, the documentation did not  contain an analysis of the workload anticipated for the year, such as the  total number of new awards, the number of active contracts by contract  type, the number of CMS contracts under HHS\u2019s cognizance, or the  number and type of audits needed. The documents did not contain  information on CMS\u2019s current FTE level, skill mix, or analysis of any skill  gaps. Without this information, OAGM has limited insight into appropriate  solutions, such as the use of contractor support staff.

While officials told us they could use more audit funding, we found  that OAGM management had yet to determine what an appropriate funding  level should be. Without knowing for which contractors additional CFA  oversight is needed, CMS does not know with certainty the number of  audits and reviews that must be performed annually or the depth and  complexity of those audits.

For example, one contract specialist told us she prepared the  Independent Government Cost Estimate based on the winning contractor\u2019s  proposed costs instead of conducting her own independent research to  determine the government\u2019s benchmark for the reasonableness of the  costs of the scope of work. Additionally, as previously discussed, CMS  officials told us that incurred cost audits are not performed annually  primarily due to insufficient resources.

Standards for internal control provide that for an agency to manage  its operations, it must have relevant, reliable, and timely information  relating to the extent and nature of its operations, including both  operational and financial data, that should be recorded and communicated  to management and others within the agency who need it and in a form  and within a time frame that enables them to carry out their internal  control and operational responsibilities. The acquisition data errors are  due in part to a lack of sufficient quality assurance activities over the data  entered into the acquisition databases. Without accurate data, CMS  program managers do not have adequate information to identify and  monitor areas that pose a high risk of improper payments or waste.  Moreover, inaccurate or incomplete data hinder CMS\u2019s ability to mitigate  through additional policies or enhanced oversight any high-risk areas,  such as the frequent use of cost reimbursement contracts, that would be  identified based on reports or analysis of the databases. The errors in  DCIS, including the unrecorded actions, also impact governmentwide  reporting. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) requires agencies  to submit their acquisition data to the Federal Procurement Database  System-Next Generation (FDPS-NG).

In particular, we found that  PRISM contained 16 errors in a field we reviewed that designated the  extent to which the contract was competed, for example, full and  open competition or not competed as a result of being a logical  follow-on to a previous contract. Additionally, we determined that the  award type field in PRISM did not capture consistent information. For  example, the field had prepopulated options associated with both  award type (basic ordering agreement, delivery order, letter contract,  etc.) and contract type (cost reimbursement, fixed price, and T&M).  Combining these options into one data field prevents CMS from  determining the total number of each award type and each contract  type, making it difficult to accurately determine CMS\u2019s contracting  trends.

Further, 11 sample items, or approximately 10 percent of the sample,  were not in DCIS. Our high-level data analysis on the population of  fiscal year 2008 contract actions identified that certain required fields,  such as contract type and competition, contained blank responses and  \u201cnulls\u201d.

The seven substantially unresolved  recommendations represent a lack of action on the part of CMS  management to resolve key control deficiencies.", "Policies and criteria for pre-award contract activities have not  been developed. In our 2007 report, we recommended that CMS  develop policies for certain pre-award contract activities, such as  analysis to justify the contract type selected and verification of the  adequacy of the contractor\u2019s accounting system prior to the award of  a cost reimbursement contract. However, no new policies or guidance  were developed, because in CMS\u2019s view, policies and criteria are  already established in the FAR and HHSAR. While the FAR provides  requirements for federal acquisitions, it is up to the agencies to  develop and provide their contracting workforce with specific policies  and day-to-day procedures that guide them in implementing those  requirements and to tailor the policies to address the specific  operational environment. Agency-specific policy may include  guidance on applicable approval levels, time frames, agency forms,  and routing processes. Also, while the HHSAR provides additional  guidance and policies specific to HHS, the HHSAR does not  specifically address all of the pre-award contract activities that we  identified as needing improvement, nor does it delineate the roles and  responsibilities of the different staff involved in the contracting  process or establish time frames for when certain pre-award contract  activities should be performed. The deficiencies identified in this  report, especially those associated with FAR requirements unique to  specific contract types, further highlight the need for additional  guidance for contracting officers.", "Roles and responsibilities for implementation of CFA  responsibilities not clearly defined. The FAR requires that CFAs  perform certain oversight and monitoring activities. The CFA concept  provides an efficient way for contractors to receive a streamlined set  of audits and reviews, thereby enabling them to receive and perform  government contracts. In our 2007 report, we found that CFA  responsibilities were inadequately fulfilled and recommended that  CMS develop policies and procedures to ensure that CFA  responsibilities were performed. In a recommendation resolution  report, HHS stated that policies and procedures were needed at both  the department level and at CMS. As of July 2009, neither HHS nor  CMS had developed such policies and procedures or a mechanism to  track the CMS contractors for which additional oversight is needed.  Moreover, roles and responsibilities for the performance of CFA  duties were not clear among HHS and its components, including CMS.", "During an interview with CMS, HHS, NIH, and HHS Office of  Inspector General (OIG) officials, HHS officials stated that CFA  responsibilities lie at the HHS department level. However, HHS  officials also said that certain CFA responsibilities are delegated to  HHS components and to contracting officers. Specifically, NIH was  assigned responsibility to establish indirect rates for the contractors  under HHS\u2019s cognizance, but contracting officers within HHS  components are responsible for other CFA duties. However, during  the meeting, the officials could not clearly explain how the  performance of these duties was monitored to ensure that CFA  oversight takes place. HHS officials said that they did not have a  process to identify the contractors, including CMS contractors, for  which HHS would be the CFA. Without a list that is periodically  updated for the contractors\u2019 portfolio of federal government  contracting activity, HHS and its components do not know the  contractors for which CFA oversight is needed.", "NIH officials acknowledged their centralized role in determining  indirect rates, but noted that NIH did not have the resources  necessary to determine the indirect rates for the contractors under  HHS\u2019s cognizance. CMS officials told us that when NIH can not  perform the reviews within the needed time frames to make timely  contract awards, CMS\u2019s cost/price team establishes the rates. The  confusion over roles and responsibilities increases the risk that CFA  responsibilities are not being timely performed, if at all. Without  effective coordination, contractors may not receive the necessary  oversight and the government may not be positioned to protect itself  from the risk of improper payments or waste. The risks of not  performing CFA duties are exacerbated by the fact that other federal  agencies that use the same contractors rely on the oversight and  monitoring work of the CFA.", "CMS policies did not provide guidance on what constitutes  sufficient detail to support amounts billed on contractor  invoices to facilitate the review process. Despite our prior  recommendation, CMS had not prepared guidelines or revised its  invoice review policy to specify or provide examples of sufficient  detail that would be needed to support contractor invoices to  facilitate an adequate review. In fact, most of the invoices we  reviewed were not sufficiently supported. We identified invoices  missing payroll detail, travel receipts, and subcontractor invoices, all  of which are necessary to provide the reviewers adequate information  to confirm if the amounts billed were compliant with the terms of the  contract or otherwise allowable and allocable to that contract. In one  instance, invoices reported labor costs based on labor categories, but  did not show hours worked by employees or their respective labor  rates. In another example, a contractor submitted an invoice in 2008  for services that were provided in 2003. The contractor did not  provide supporting documentation for the $36,944 billed. Neither the  invoice paid in 2008, nor the related file included evidence that the  charge was investigated or further evaluated by either the project  officer or contracting specialist. While different levels of review may  be required based on the complexity of individual invoices and  associated contract type, inadequately reviewing invoices increases  the risk of improper payments.", "CMS has not set criteria for the use of negative certification.", "We recommended in our 2007 report that CMS establish criteria for  the use of negative certification in the payment of contractor invoices  which would consider potential risk factors. CMS uses negative  certification\u2014a process whereby it pays contractor invoices without  knowing whether they were reviewed and approved\u2014in order to  ensure invoices are paid in a timely fashion. This approach, however,  significantly reduces the incentive for contracting officers, specialists,  and project officers to review the invoice prior to payment. Reviewing  invoices prior to payment is a preventive control which may result in  the identification of unallowable billings, especially on cost  reimbursement and T&M invoices, before the invoices are paid. In  light of the importance of this preventive control, we recommended  that CMS establish criteria for when to use negative certification; such  criteria may be based on considerations of potential risk factors such  as contract type, the adequacy of the contractor\u2019s accounting system,  and prior history with the contractor. We found, however, that  OAGM\u2019s invoice review policy was not revised to address this  recommendation and OAGM officials confirmed that negative  certification is still the primary method for paying invoices regardless  of risks.", "Training on invoice review procedures still needed. As discussed  earlier, project officers did not always certify invoices for approval  and contracting officers or specialists did not always identify  instances where invoices did not comply with contract terms and  conditions. We also found that invoices were not always maintained in  the file, as required by CMS\u2019s invoice review policy. In light of these  continuing deficiencies, and the need for further revisions to its  invoice review policy described above, further training on invoice  review procedures will be necessary.", "Continuing backlog of contracts overdue for closeout. In 2007,  we reported that CMS did not timely perform contract closeout  procedures resulting in a backlog of 1,300 contracts, of which 407  were overdue for closeout as of September 30, 2007. We  recommended that CMS develop a plan to reduce the number of  contracts in the backlog. CMS did not provide us a closeout plan for  fiscal year 2008 and the fiscal year 2009 plan was insufficient.  Specifically, the plan did not include a comprehensive strategy to  reduce the backlog of contracts that are eligible and overdue for  closeout nor did it contain a workload analysis, such as a list of  contracts eligible for closeout by contracting officer or specialist or  an estimate of the number of hours or audit funds it would need to  close the contracts.", "The FAR establishes time standards for closing out a contract after  the work is physically completed (i.e., goods or services are  provided).

The  complexity and length of the closeout process can vary with the  extent of oversight performed by the agency during the period of  performance and the contract type.", "CMS officials told us that during fiscal year 2008, OAGM closed 581  contracts and reduced the overdue backlog to 400 contracts (from the  407 reported at the end of fiscal year 2007). Yet OAGM officials could  not provide support for these closures or a list of the contracts  overdue for closeout. Additionally, CMS officials stated that as of July  29, 2009, the total backlog of contracts eligible for closeout was 1,611,  with 594 overdue based on FAR timing standards. This is a substantial  increase over the balances at the end of fiscal year 2007. Moreover,  the total contract value of contracts eligible for closeout has  increased from $3 billion to at least $3.8 billion.", "Insufficient progress has been made to reduce the backlog of  contracts eligible for closeout. The closeout process is particularly  important for cost reimbursement contracts because a contractor is  allowed to bill costs it incurred to provide the good or service. During  the closeout process, the government audits these billed costs to  determine if they were allowable and allocable to the contract, and  processes the final invoice with an adjustment for any over- or  underpayments. The failure to perform contract closeouts in a timely  manner puts CMS at increased risk of improper payments or waste,  and may make identification and recovery of any such improper  payments more difficult due to the passage of time.", "CMS has not taken sufficient actions to investigate and  recover questionable payments. CMS described several actions it  has taken to investigate payments made to 3 of the 12 contractors for  which we identified questionable payments. The actions CMS has  taken to date are insufficient to fully resolve the issues identified and  more remains to be done to recover funds that may have been  inappropriately paid to contractors.", "For example, CMS highlighted $67 million in questionable payments  that were related to one specific contractor and stated that these  questionable payments are being investigated via a fiscal year 2008  incurred cost audit. However, the $67 million related to costs incurred  in fiscal years 2004, 2005, and 2006 and therefore would not be  covered or investigated in an audit of fiscal year 2008 incurred costs.  Additionally, CMS said it had resolved the questionable payments  made to another contractor; however, CMS\u2019s actions did not relate to  the $1.4 million in payments CMS made in fiscal year 2006 that we  questioned. Regarding a third contractor, CMS issued a demand letter  in April 2007 to recover funds the contractor billed and CMS paid in  excess of contract ceiling limits; however, no resolution has yet been  reached. CMS could not tell us whether it had recovered any of the  questioned amounts.", "CMS\u2019s resolution of questionable payments of the magnitude we  identified ($88.8 million) in the prior report should be performed  expeditiously. As a steward of taxpayer dollars, CMS is accountable  for how it spends and safeguards funds as well as having mechanisms  in place to recoup those funds when improper payments are  identified. CMS relies on incurred cost audits that are conducted at  the end of contract performance when the contract is closed to  validate the overall propriety of payments.

In its comments, CMS  also expressed concerns about the scope and timing of our work with  respect to our November 2007 recommendations and disagreed with our  assessment of the status of 5 of the 7 recommendations we made in that  report. We address the concerns CMS raised in its comment letter below  and include additional information at the end of appendix III.", "In its comments, CMS stated its belief that the 11 internal controls we  reviewed did not provide a complete picture of its internal controls over  contract management activities. We acknowledge that there are many  internal controls that are and can be instituted by agencies to help  safeguard assets, prevent and detect fraud and errors, and help  government program managers achieve desired results through effective  stewardship of public resources. As described in appendix I, we selected  11 controls that we determined to be \u201ckey\u201d based on GAO\u2019s standards for  internal control, the FAR and HHSAR, CMS\u2019s policies and procedures, and  other factors including our prior audit findings regarding CMS\u2019s  acquisition controls and the nature of CMS\u2019s acquisition function.", "CMS stated its belief that \u201cvirtually all\u201d of the errors we identified related  to \u201cperceived documentation deficiencies.\u201d CMS stated it was encouraged  that the errors we found did not involve more substantive departures from  the FAR or HHSAR. We disagree with CMS\u2019s overall assessment of our  findings and message of the report. The internal controls we tested are key  to ensuring that contracting activities, both pre-award and post-award,  mitigate risks to the federal government. A number of the findings we  identified during the testing of a statistically valid sample of contract files  involved the lack of documentation that the controls were performed.  Lack of documentation reduces management\u2019s ability to ascertain whether  these important controls were appropriately implemented and therefore is  a serious internal control deficiency. OAGM management\u2019s downplaying of  the overall message of the report\u2014that control deficiencies are  pervasive\u2014further illustrates the weak internal control environment.  Setting an appropriate control environment, especially \u201ctone at the top,\u201d is  key to ensuring that staff take all appropriate steps to mitigate risk and  protect tax dollars from fraud, waste, and abuse.", "CMS also stated that a reasonable amount of time had not yet elapsed  since the issuance of our November 2007 report to allow for corrective  actions to have taken place. A significant number of our current report  findings, including weaknesses in the control environment, were based on  observations and interviews with OAGM officials and reviews of related  documentation such as policies and strategic plans. Our current review  was completed in September 2009, nearly 2 years after the issuance of our  November 2007 report. While CMS also stated that the contract actions we  reviewed took place in fiscal year 2008, it is important to note that we  considered the timing of CMS\u2019s corrective actions when evaluating the  controls we tested. For example, CMS\u2019s Acquisition Policy 02-03, which  identifies level of approvals required by agency officials based on the  estimated dollar value for acquisitions awarded through other than full  and open competition, was implemented in April 2008. We applied these  approval levels only to the awards and modifications in our sample that  were made after the policy was implemented. Furthermore, our  observations and recommendations related to CMS\u2019s control environment  are based on conditions that continued to exist in September 2009.", "CMS disagreed with our determination that their actions to address five of  the seven prior recommendations were not sufficient. These prior  recommendations were aimed at improving preventive controls.  Preventive controls, such as policies and criteria for pre-award activities  and a sound invoice review process prior to payment, are the first line of  defense in reducing the risk of improper payments or waste. We continue  to believe that the limited actions OAGM management has taken, and in  some cases, management\u2019s inaction, fall short of expectations and miss the  intent of improving CMS\u2019s overall system of control over its acquisition  activities.", "For example, CMS asserted that its Acquisition Policy 16-01 entitled  \u201cInvoicing Payment Procedures\u201d satisfies two of the prior  recommendations. The intent of these two recommendations was to  ensure that contractors provided adequate support to facilitate an  appropriate detailed review of the invoiced costs prior to payment and  that CMS develop clear risk-based criteria for the use of negative  certification. CMS uses negative certification\u2014a process whereby it pays  contractor invoices without knowing whether they were reviewed and  approved\u2014in order to ensure invoices are paid in a timely fashion. We  examined this policy during our review and found it to be unresponsive to  the recommendations because it did not provide the recommended  additional guidelines on what the contractor should provide that would  constitute sufficient detail to support amounts billed on contractor  invoices. It also did not describe under what circumstances or in what  situations it was acceptable for CMS to use negative certification.", "With regard to a third prior recommendation that CMS review the  questionable payments we identified, CMS described in its comment letter  specific actions taken to investigate some of the questionable payments  and subsequently provided documentation of actions it had taken to  investigate the questionable payments we identified for three contractors.  After reviewing this information, we revised our assessment of the status  of efforts taken by CMS from \u201cNo Actions Taken\u201d to \u201cActions Insufficient.\u201d  While CMS had taken some action, the steps have not resolved the  questionable payments we identified. For example, CMS highlighted $67  million that we previously questioned that was related to one specific  contractor and stated that these questionable payments are being  investigated via a fiscal year 2008 incurred cost audit. The $67 million we  questioned related to costs incurred in fiscal years 2004, 2005, and 2006  and therefore would not be covered or investigated in an audit of fiscal  year 2008 incurred costs. Moreover, as of the date of the report, CMS could  not tell us whether it had recovered any of the questioned amounts. We  continue to believe that CMS\u2019s actions to date are insufficient and more  actions are needed to investigate and recover the questionable payments  we identified.", "No other changes were made to the report as a result of agency comments.  See appendix III for a discussion of the remaining two prior  recommendations (points 2, 3, and 4) for which CMS disagreed with our  assessment of its progress and our analysis of comments CMS made on  our new recommendations.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce its contents  earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days from its  date. At that time, we will send copies to the Secretary of Health and  Human Services, Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid  Services, and interested congressional committees.

We  selected 11 internal controls over contracting and payments to contractors  to test for this report, ranging from ensuring contractors had adequate  accounting systems prior to the use of a cost reimbursement contract to  certifying invoices for payment. We selected controls to test based on our  review of GAO\u2019s standards for internal control, the Federal Acquisition  Regulation requirements, and agency policies and procedures, taking into  consideration prior audit findings and the contract types most frequently  awarded. The controls we tested are key to effective administration of the  contract in that the lack of implementation would significantly increase  the risk of improper payments or waste.", "To test internal control procedures over contract actions, we selected a  stratified random sample of 102 contract actions totaling $140.7 million in  fiscal year 2008 obligations from a population of 2,441 contract actions  totaling $2.5 billion in fiscal year 2008 obligations. We stratified the  contract actions by type of action, namely contract awards and contract  modifications, recorded in CMS\u2019s PRISM database from October 1, 2007,  through September 30, 2008. Each contract action was either a new  contract award or modification to an existing contract. With this  probability sample, each contract action in the sample frame had a non- zero probability of being included and that probability could be computed  from any contract action. Each stratum was subsequently weighted in the  analysis to account statistically for all the contract actions in the sample  frame, including those that were not selected. Results from this statistical  sample were projected to the population of contract actions made from  October 1, 2007, through September 30, 2008.

In addition, we used a statistically random  sample selected to test the application of controls to also test the accuracy  of the data in the systems.

See \u201cAgency Comments and Our Evaluation\u201d section.  2. As we stated in our November 2007 report, we acknowledge that the  time frames for implementing the Medicare Prescription Drug,  Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 added schedule pressures for  the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). At the same time,  the compressed time frames and resulting contracting practices added risk  to the contracting process. Many of the findings in the November 2007  report were a result of the increased risk together with inadequate  compensating controls to mitigate risk.  3. While the Virtual Acquisition Office, which is an off-the-shelf acquisition  software that provides Web links to acquisition regulation and templates to  aid in completion of common acquisition activities, can be a useful tool for  contracting officers, specialists, and the Office of Acquisition and Grants  Management (OAGM) management, it does not represent the agency- specific policies and criteria we recommended that CMS implement for  pre-award activities. As such, CMS\u2019s actions are unresponsive to the  recommendation. Agency-specific policies provide guidance on how CMS  staff are expected to perform their day-to-day duties.  4. As discussed in the report, we continue to believe the contract closeout  plan does not sufficiently address our recommendation because it did not  include a comprehensive strategy to reduce the backlog of contracts that  are eligible and overdue for closeout, nor did it contain a workload  analysis. The plan was for fiscal year 2009; no other plans were developed.  Additionally, CMS stated that it achieved a 30 percent reduction in the  number of contracts eligible for closeout since 2007. However, CMS could  not fully support the analysis it provided and it related only to the time  period between April 2007 and September 30, 2007. According to data  provided to us by CMS during this current review, since September 30,  2007, the number of contracts eligible for closeout has increased by 24  percent, from 1,300 in 2007 to 1,611 in 2009. Additionally, the number of  contracts overdue for closeout has increased from 407 in 2007 to 594 in  2009, a 46 percent increase.  5. The contract file document checklist employed by CMS at the time of  our review identified key documents that may be included in a contract  file. This checklist is usually completed by either the contract specialist or  contracting officer. While such a checklist is useful for ensuring that  certain documents are contained in a contract file, it did not reflect certain  requirements in which we found CMS to be deficient, such as ensuring  contractors had adequate accounting systems prior to the use of a cost  reimbursement contract. We are encouraged that CMS is taking additional  actions to implement the checklists developed by the Department of  Health and Human Services to be used in fiscal year 2010.  6. During our review and as a result of multiple conversations with OAGM  staff including the team of contract auditors, we revised our testing  procedures to consider and accept provisional indirect cost rates that were  not maintained in the individual contract file but were maintained by the  cost/price team in its central files. Therefore, all provisional indirect cost  rate determinations that were maintained by OAGM, regardless of location,  were considered during our review. The steps CMS described that it plans  to take will be important for ensuring that contract office staff have the  information needed readily available to manage contracts throughout the  contract life cycle.  7. As stated in the report, CMS\u2019s current procedures regarding the  accuracy of data entered into the Departmental Contracts Information  System (DCIS) do not include procedures that would ensure that the  resolution of potential errors are properly documented and errors are  corrected in a timely manner. We further found that OAGM was not fully  implementing its policy because it reviewed every 88th action, rather than  every 50th as provided for in the plan. However, we are encouraged by the  recent initiatives described in CMS\u2019s comments, such as the scorecard, and  OAGM\u2019s commitment to review current policies and procedures and to  make improvements where necessary."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["Staff members who made key contributions to this report include Marcia  Carlsen and Phil McIntyre (Assistant Directors), Sharon Byrd, Richard  Cambosos, Abe Dymond, Patrick Frey, Jason Kelly, John Lopez, Ron  Schwenn, Omar Torres, Ruth Walk, and Danietta Williams."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
