One method used to collect child support, intercepting federal tax refunds, involves all state agencies, OCSE, and two Department of the Treasury agencies--the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Financial Management Service (FMS). GAO was asked to address (1) how the total amount of undistributed collections changed over the years, (2) the causes of undistributed collections, (3) states' efforts to reduce these funds, and (4) OCSE's efforts to assist states.

State agencies had different interpretations of what comprised undistributed collections and data reported by several state agencies were found to be unreliable throughout this time period. OCSE revised the reporting form, but data accuracy concerns remain, in part, because OCSE does not have a process to ensure the accuracy of undistributed collections data. Federal law, some state policies, and inaccurate or missing information were the underlying causes of nearly all types of undistributed collections. State agencies determined how long they held collections from joint tax refunds and if they held collections received before they were due. Federal law allows collections intercepted from joint tax refunds to be held for up to 180 days and in response to GAO's survey, 34 state agencies reported holding them for 180 days. Missing or inaccurate information, such as invalid addresses, also leads to undistributed collections. Based on state agencies' survey responses, GAO determined the median value of the undistributed collections from joint tax refunds was about $1.8 million and the median value of four other types of undistributed collections exceeded $350,000. State agencies GAO visited took steps to better understand and reduce undistributed collections. Of the 6 state agencies visited, 5 had analyzed their undistributed collections cases, 4 adopted performance goals, and officials from all 6 state agencies stressed the importance of researching collections that were missing information. In addition, officials stated that using automated processes to receive and distribute collections helped reduce the number of collections with missing or inaccurate information. OCSE has provided some assistance to help state agencies reduce their undistributed collections. However, the Department of the Treasury has not provided OCSE information that would allow state agencies to distribute collections from joint tax refunds to families sooner. Further, OCSE's efforts to obtain this information have been minimal."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 2002, the Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE), in the  Department of Health and Human Services, reported that billions of  dollars in child support were collected but that payments totaling   $657 million were delayed or never reached the families for whom they  were intended. These undistributed child support payments are a concern  because child support is an important source of income for many families.  According to a 2003 report, for 36 percent of poor children living in  families headed by single mothers, child support payments comprised  almost one-third of the family\u2019s income in 2001. The 1996 Personal  Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA)  generally requires state child support enforcement agencies to disburse  child support collections within 2 business days, if sufficient information  identifying the recipient is provided. In addition, portions of child support  collections must be distributed to state government programs, such as  Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF), to reimburse them for  cash assistance provided to families.", "Although state child support enforcement agencies administer the child  support program, the federal government plays a major role. OCSE funds  two-thirds of the program\u2019s administrative costs; establishes policies and  guidance; provides technical assistance, such as designing curricula and  providing support for staff training; and oversees and monitors state  agencies. Additionally, OCSE is responsible for taking the necessary steps  to help resolve issues at the federal level that affect the child support  program such as processes that prevent child support payments from  reaching families in a timely manner. OCSE and state agencies collect  child support through various methods, such as intercepting the federal  tax refunds of noncustodial parents\u2014parents who do not have primary  care, custody, or control of their children\u2014who are delinquent in paying  their child support. If the noncustodial parent has a new spouse and files  a joint tax return, generally, only the portion of the refund due to the  noncustodial parent should be intercepted. Federal law allows state  agencies to hold collections from certain intercepted federal joint tax  refunds for up to 6 months to provide time for the new spouse to ask for  his or her share of the refund by filing an \u201cinjured spouse\u201d claim with the  Department of the Treasury.", "In an effort to understand the issues associated with undistributed child  support collections, you requested that we address the following  questions: (1) How has the total amount of undistributed collections  changed in the last few years? (2) What are the causes of undistributed  collections? (3) What are state agencies doing to reduce undistributed  collections? (4) How has OCSE assisted state agencies\u2019 efforts to reduce  the amount of undistributed collections?", "We obtained information from several sources that provided some data for  all of the objectives. We conducted a mail survey of all 54 IV-D child  support enforcement agencies. Forty-eight state agencies responded to the  survey. We did not assess the reliability of the data the state agencies  reported in response to our survey. However, we reviewed the data for  completeness and reasonableness. We conducted site visits to 6 state  agencies. We selected California, Florida, Iowa, New York, Texas, and  Virginia because they represented diversity in amounts of undistributed  collections, and geographical location, and they provided examples of  statewide and county administered programs. We interviewed federal and  state officials, reviewed related reports and analyzed applicable laws and  regulations. In addition, we took specific steps to address each of the  objectives. To address how undistributed collections have changed, we  analyzed OCSE data for fiscal years 1999 to 2002 reported by state  agencies. The fiscal year 1999 data was the earliest year with data  comparable to fiscal year 2002; the most current data available at the time  of our review. We assessed the reliability of undistributed collections data  reported to OCSE and found that the data were inconsistent and  unreliable. We also reviewed state and federal reports that discussed  issues associated with calculating and reporting undistributed collections.  To identify the causes of undistributed collections, steps state agencies  have taken to reduce undistributed collections, and assistance OCSE has  provided to state agencies, we reviewed relevant research and audit  reports; examined OCSE guidance and documents related to funded  projects; and interviewed child support advocates and experts.", "We conducted our work between May 2003 and March 2004 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards.

The Child Support  Enforcement (CSE) program, established in 1975 under Title IV-D of the  Social Security Act, established federal standards for state CSE programs  to ensure that parents provide support to their children. Services provided  through the CSE program include locating absent noncustodial parents,  establishing paternity and support orders, and collecting and distributing  child support payments. All 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam,  Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands operate CSE programs. However, many  aspects of implementing the child support program are generally under the  purview of the state rather than the federal government.", "For fiscal year 2002, OCSE reported over 16 million child support cases  and collections of more than $20 billion. One method for collecting child  support is intercepting federal tax refunds. Congress enacted the Federal  Tax Refund Offset program in 1981. Initially the Internal Revenue Service  (IRS), an agency within the Department of the Treasury, OCSE, and the  state agencies operated the program. In 1998 the Financial Management  Service (FMS), another agency within the Department of the Treasury,  assumed primary responsibility for the program. Now, all state agencies,  OCSE, IRS, and FMS play a role in the program. Table 1 shows the amount  of collections offset from tax refunds from 1999 to 2002.", "To start the offset process, state agencies identify those noncustodial  parents that meet the program criteria. For example, for non-TANF cases,  the amount of past due support the noncustodial parent owes must be at  least $500. The state agencies, or OCSE on behalf of the state agencies,  must send a written notice to the noncustodial parent at least 30 days in  advance of sending his or her name to OCSE for the offset program. This  notice includes, among other things, information about filing \u201cinjured  spouse claims.\u201d State agencies send OCSE the names of the eligible  noncustodial parents and the amount owed and OCSE transmits this  information to FMS. FMS adds this information to its debtor file that  includes information on those who owe child support as well as those who  owe other federal debts. IRS processes the tax returns, and then forwards  information to FMS on those individuals who are due refunds. FMS  compares this information to its debtor file and, if there is a match, offsets  the refund by the amount of child support owed. After the refunds have  been offset, FMS notifies the individual, and transfers the offset funds and  information to OCSE. OCSE then distributes the funds and information to  the appropriate state agency.", "When a noncustodial spouse has filed a joint tax return, FMS may offset  the refund if either person owes child support. FMS, acting on behalf of  the Secretary of the Treasury, must notify OCSE, which notifies the state  agencies when the withholding is being made from a refund based on a  joint return, and provides the names and addresses of each taxpayer.  Under these circumstances, the state agency is permitted to delay  distribution of the amount withheld until the Secretary of the Treasury  notifies the state agency that the spouse has received his or her proper  share of the refund. This delay may not exceed 6 months. However, the  law allows a spouse 6 years to file an \u201cinjured spouse\u201d claim. If the spouse  files a timely \u201cinjured spouse\u201d claim and is found to be entitled to a portion  of the withheld amount, IRS will process the claim and allocate the  appropriate amount to each person. If the spouse\u2019s claim is filed after the  funds have been forwarded to the state agency, and the spouse is found to  be entitled to a portion of the withheld amount, FMS sends the spouse his  or her portion and the state agencies must reimburse the Treasury. OCSE  data shows that from March to August 2003, almost $200 million dollars  were collected from offsets of non-TANF joint tax refunds.", "PRWORA amended portions of the Social Security Act, including some  provisions that pertained to child support enforcement. One provision  required state agencies to establish a state disbursement unit to centralize  collection and disbursement of child support payments in order to receive  federal funds. In addition to distributing collections from noncustodial  parents to custodial parents, state agencies also distribute collections to   other government programs such as TANF and Foster Care programs as  reimbursement for benefits provided to families. For example, as a  condition of receiving temporary cash assistance, parents must apply for  child support enforcement services and agree to give all or a portion of  their child support to the state. In fiscal year 2002, OCSE reported that  custodial parents who were receiving public assistance comprised about  three million cases, and those who formerly received public assistance  comprised about seven million cases.", "State agencies are required to report collection and distribution  information quarterly to OCSE through the Quarterly Report of  Collections, Form OCSE-34A.

In its  preliminary annual report for fiscal year 2002, OCSE acknowledged that  interpretation of the data on undistributed collections was limited due to  the variation in the types of collections included. This report indicated  that some state agencies included collections to be distributed within   2 business days; collections received before they were due; and collections  to be distributed to other government programs, while other state agencies  did not. In our survey, we asked state agencies if they included these types  of collections as well as collections to be distributed pending legal  resolution and collections received from intercepting joint tax refunds. Of  the 48 state agencies that responded, nearly all indicated that they  included collections received before they were due to the custodial parent,  collections pending legal resolution, and collections received from joint  tax refunds. Thirty of the state agencies responded that they included  collections to be distributed in 2 business days and 28 state agencies  included collections to be distributed to other government programs.  Figure 1 illustrates the state responses.", "OCSE has taken steps to improve data consistency. OCSE revised its   34A form and related instructions in fiscal year 2003 to improve the  consistency of undistributed collections data. According to OCSE officials,  this change was also made to provide more information about the  composition of undistributed collections. Prior to the changes, all  collections were reported under one category, and it was not possible to  distinguish between collections pending distribution and collections  requiring further research in order to distribute them.", "As of fiscal year 2004, state agencies are required to report total  collections under two categories. The first category, \u201cundistributed  collections pending distribution,\u201d includes collections that state agencies  reasonably expect to distribute through typical business processing in the  future. For example, collections held because of a legal dispute over the  amount of support owed will be distributed as soon as the matter is  resolved. The second category, \u201cundistributed collections unresolved,\u201d  includes collections that require the child support staff to obtain more  information before they can be distributed. These include but are not  limited to collections (1) lacking information to match them to a case,   (2) missing current addresses for a parent, and (3) from checks that were  issued but the time frame for which to cash them had expired. According  to OCSE officials, another new reporting form has been developed for use  beginning in fiscal year 2005 that will require state agencies to report  amounts for 10 types of undistributed collections included under the two  categories.

The cumulative  amounts of these undistributed collections ranged from about $5 million  to $168 million and, according to state officials, the actual amounts of  undistributed collections were lower than reported. The state agencies  and the amounts of the overestimates are summarized in table 3.", "Most of the errors were accounting mistakes discovered by the state  agencies. Officials from the California Department of Child Support  Services reviewed the state\u2019s accounting of undistributed collections and  found that some local officials had included collections in their totals  multiple times because they had misinterpreted a policy. They thought that  disbursements could only be reported if collections were also reported in  the same period and, as a result, when they disbursed funds they again  added these collections into their totals. This resulted in overstating  amounts for total collections and for undistributed collections. Nebraska\u2019s  overestimate occurred partly because collections received before they  were due for non-TANF cases were immediately distributed, but the  officials did not show them as being distributed until the official due date.  In Missouri, nearly all of the overestimate was spousal support collected  by the state disbursement unit that was erroneously reported as child  support collections. For the remainder, in Missouri, when a collection  from a joint tax refund had been distributed to a custodial parent and the  amount was later adjusted in the same reporting quarter because of an  \u201cinjured spouse\u201d claim, the adjusted amount was added as a new  collection. An audit of Michigan\u2019s child support program revealed that it  failed to account for the distribution of payments that noncustodial  parents paid directly to custodial parents.", "The reports related to these overestimates also indicated that having  multiple jurisdictions involved with recording collections contributed to  the errors. Local agencies in California used forms that did not always  include the federal data elements used by the state agency to report  undistributed collections.

According to state officials, noncustodial  parents did not always include identifying information on their payments.  For example, state officials said they sometimes received money orders  from noncustodial parents that were illegible or lacked information, such  as the case number or full name, needed to match them to the right case.", "Missing or inaccurate information on TANF or former TANF cases  contributed to undistributed collections. Officials from 2 state agencies we  visited explained that some collections could not be distributed to the  custodial parent until they determined the correct amount owed to the  government. According to Florida officials, this contributed to nearly   50 percent of its approximate $28 million in undistributed collections. The  state cited two major reasons for this problem: (1) data inaccuracies due  to the conversion of cases from the former statewide system to the state  agency\u2019s new automated system and (2) difficulties exchanging  information between the automated systems of the child support agency  processing the payments and the TANF agency. A 2001 report issued by  the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Office of Inspector General  found that 11 state agencies experienced difficulties in distributing child  support to families leaving TANF. Among the reasons state agencies cited  were problems exchanging information with TANF agencies and  inaccurate addresses for custodial parents receiving TANF benefits. The  report also noted that 28 of 51 state agencies surveyed reported problems  with the automated exchanges of information between the child support  enforcement and the TANF agencies. These problems included  incompatible design of state TANF and child support enforcement  agencies\u2019 automated systems and timing of information exchanges, which,  according to the report, could have caused child support payment delays  and underpayments after clients left the TANF program.", "State officials also said that missing information from employers as well as  inaccurate payments contributed to the amount of undistributed  collections. For example, according to state officials, employers, including  some federal agencies, did not always identify the cases for which the  withheld wages were designated or mailed one check for multiple cases  with the sum of the withheld wages not matching the total amount of the  check. Additionally, some employers sent payments for more than was  due. In its examination of undistributed collections, a report from a private  firm indicated that in New York City, 40 percent of undistributed  collections were from payments that were not due. In some instances  employers sent inaccurate payments because the state agencies had not  notified them that the amount to be withheld had changed. Such changes  would be needed in cases such as those in which previously owed child  support had been paid and only current support was to be withheld, or if  the child had reached the age at which child support payments terminated.  Officials from 1 state agency we visited, told us that they waited to notify  employers about changes in the amount to be withheld until over- payments had been collected. In other cases, officials told us that  employers sent inaccurate payments because they did not always correctly  calculate the amount to be withheld. For example, if a child support order  stipulated that $100 was to be paid each month and $50 were deducted in  each of  26 biweekly pay periods, at the end of the year, the noncustodial  parent would have paid $1,300 instead of the $1,200 that was owed.

Other state disbursement units we visited also had  specific staff dedicated to researching payments with missing information  in order to distribute them as soon as possible.", "State agencies also focused resources on resolving cases with invalid  addresses for custodial parents. State officials cited the importance of  allowing staff to access federal, state, and private databases to locate  custodial parents. Officials in 1 state said they had a contract with a  private vendor because they found this information to be most useful.  Virginia\u2019s system automatically searched databases to match cases that  needed information. Such databases included FPLS, state licensing  agencies, and credit bureaus. In Texas, an indicator was added to case  records to allow field workers to automatically refer cases with invalid  addresses to special enforcement investigators. In addition, a new report  was created to show all cases with collections held due to missing  addresses so that field staff could focus their efforts on these cases. This  change resulted in the distribution of almost $1 million in the first   4 months of implementation. Also, state officials from the 4 state  disbursement units we visited told us that customer service  representatives routinely verified addresses when contacted by custodial  or noncustodial parents."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Using Automated Processes", "paragraphs": ["Officials from 4 of the 6 state agencies we visited encouraged employers to  use Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) when transmitting collections to the  state disbursement unit as a way to improve efficiency and reduce  undistributed collections. According to OCSE officials and a  representative from the American Payroll Association, converting to  electronic payments for child support means having to purchase software  or make programming changes to payroll systems, which can initially be  costly. As an alternative to EFT, 5 state agencies, including 1 we visited,  Florida, developed a process to allow employers to send payments to the  state disbursement unit over the Internet. A state agency\u2019s Web based  payment service operates much like other online banking services in that  an employer registers for the service, receives a user identification and  password and can then access the Web site each pay period to make the  payments for each of its employees. State agencies generally offered these  services free of charge to employers.", "State agencies also provided alternative ways for noncustodial parents to  transmit their payments. Florida offered noncustodial parents the option  of paying their support over the Internet. Texas had a pilot project with a  grocery chain to allow noncustodial parents to pay their child support at  their stores, and then the stores would transmit the payment to the state  disbursement unit electronically. In another pilot project, New York  partnered with a private vendor that sells money orders. Noncustodial  parents could provide the payment to the vendor who would then transmit  the payment electronically to the state disbursement unit.", "In addition to receiving collections electronically, many state agencies  distributed collections to parents electronically. Thirty-seven state  agencies that responded to our survey indicated they offered direct  deposit\u2014a process whereby money is directly transferred to a checking or  savings account\u2014and 9 reported that they issued a state debit card.  Officials from all the state agencies we visited explained that direct  deposit is not an option for many of their customers because they do not  have bank accounts. For anyone without a bank account, a state debit  card is an alternative. The card may be used to purchase goods or services  as well as to obtain cash. Safeguards have been included that prevent  custodial parents from withdrawing cash or making purchases that would  cause an overdraft of the available child support funds. In response to our  survey, most state agencies indicated that they send 40 percent or fewer of  their collections to parents electronically. Figure 6 shows the portion of  collections that state agencies reported distributing to parents  electronically.", "While most state agencies offered at least one form of electronic  distribution to parents, in 2003, Iowa began requiring all parents to receive  collections electronically. Exceptions to this requirement were based on  individual circumstances. Officials told us that as of January 2004, about  95 percent of custodial parents in Iowa were receiving collections  electronically.", "Automated processes to receive and distributed collections can help  reduce undistributed collections. According to state agency officials,  methods that allow state agencies to receive collections electronically can  help reduce undistributed collections due to fewer incorrect or  unidentified collections. Electronic methods for distributing collections to  families can also reduce the number of undistributed collections.  With  direct deposit and state debit cards, funds are transferred from the state  directly to a financial institution and even if the custodial parent changes  addresses, the collections can continue to be deposited. As such, by using  direct deposit and state debit cards, undistributed collections due to  invalid addresses of the custodial parents and those due to paper checks  that can no longer be cashed are reduced.", "In addition to reducing undistributed collections, officials from 2 state  agencies told us that electronic distribution to parents reduces many  processing costs and requires limited manual intervention. Iowa officials  predicted a combined savings to the state and federal government of about  $35,000 a month by sending collections to parents electronically. Officials  in Texas reported a cost savings of $1.34 per transaction by using direct  deposit versus mailing a check, a savings of over $300,000 in a typical  month.", "Additionally, Texas automated two of its child support processes that will  help prevent undistributed collections. In 2000, Texas established an  automated mechanism to issue refunds to noncustodial parents for  collections that exceeded the amount owed. Previously, manual  intervention was required to release these collections. According to  officials, this program saved hundreds of hours of staff time and enabled  them to quickly process refunds. Also in 2000, Texas developed an  automated process to issue new wage withholding orders to employers  when circumstances of cases changed, such as a reduction in the amount  owed. In the first 60 days after implementation, Texas issued over 15,000  new orders to employers."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "State Agencies Reported Earning Interest and Income", "paragraphs": ["Many state agencies reported earning interest and program income.

One state agency did not answer the question. State agencies are  required to deduct interest earned and income from program costs and  can charge fees to help recover some of their administrative costs. For  example, state agencies are required to charge non-TANF families an  application fee, and can charge fees for tax refund offsets and various  services and expenses such as case maintenance fees, or a fee to establish  a support order.

Additionally, OCSE emphasized that improved customer  service by state agencies helps reduce undistributed collections.  According to state officials, customer service representatives are  encouraged to ask for updated information from parents, thereby reducing  the number of cases with incorrect addresses. In fiscal year 2003, OCSE  partnered with the National Council of Child Support Directors to refine  the categories of undistributed collections and obtain state data and best  practices. Also, OCSE issued guidance in March 2003 to reduce the  number of cases with invalid addresses. This guidance informed state  agencies that they could access FPLS to locate custodial parents as well as  to locate noncustodial parents.", "OCSE funded research and provided technical assistance to state agencies  to help them reduce undistributed collections. Between fiscal years 2000  and 2002, OCSE awarded three contracts. The first contract awarded in  fiscal year 2000, for about $135,000, funded research to identify  approaches for reducing undistributed collections in 11 state agencies  with large caseloads or amounts of collections. In addition, this contractor  reviewed undistributed collections in two New York counties and  identified factors in their business processes and automated systems that  prevented them from further reducing these collections. According to  OCSE, a second contract was also awarded in fiscal year 2000 for about  $112,000 that funded research focused on understanding the extent and  causes of undistributed collections across state agencies and highlighting  best practices for distributing such collections. Additionally, OCSE  officials said that a third contract was awarded in fiscal year 2002 for  about $300,000 that funded research to review undistributed collections in  5 state agencies.", "Beginning in fiscal year 2000, OCSE made projects designed to reduce  undistributed collections a priority for demonstration grants, and awarded  five grants. In fiscal year 2000, OCSE awarded one grant for about  $188,000, and in fiscal year 2002, OCSE awarded four grants\u2014one each to  Texas, and the District of Columbia and two to Indiana\u2014for a total  amount of about $500,000. The goals for each of the fiscal year 2002  projects were different. For example, the goal for one project was to  evaluate the use of state debit cards as a way to reduce undistributed  collections.", "Further, OCSE actively encouraged more use of EFT, which as previously  stated can help reduce undistributed collections. In July 2003, the OCSE  Commissioner sent a letter to 80 private sector employers that employ a  large number of noncustodial parents encouraging them to use EFT to pay  the child support they withheld from their employees\u2019 wages. During  several conferences sponsored by employer organizations, OCSE  promoted electronic payment by distributing literature and making  presentations. Additionally, in 2002 OCSE staff assisted the NACHA\u2014 Electronic Payments Association\u2019s Child Support Task Force by helping to  identify issues associated with promoting the electronic collection and  distribution of child support payments. OCSE also worked with several  federal agencies on issues related to electronic payment.

OCSE officials also reported that regional meetings have  included sessions focused on reducing undistributed collections. For  example, officials from Region VII organized a workshop where  perspectives on reporting and best practices were addressed. In July  2003, OCSE initiated monthly audio conference calls to foster discussions  on implementing best practices such as electronic funds distribution.

The officials also explained that they include data on the payment file they  send to FMS that could enable FMS to determine whether the \u201cinjured  spouse\u201d claim has been processed. Furthermore, the IRS officials said that  it would be very costly to reprogram the IRS data systems to enable them  to provide OCSE information on \u201cinjured spouse\u201d claims.", "FMS officials we spoke with stated that until recently, they were not aware  that OCSE needed notification on the payment of injured spouse claims  and they expressed concern about the cost associated with changing their  system in order to provide the information to OCSE. The FMS officials  added that neither IRS nor OCSE emphasized the need for information on  injured spouse claims when FMS became responsible for and set up their  systems to support the tax-offset program. Furthermore, in order for FMS  to send OCSE more information about injured spouse claims, they would  have to reprogram their data files and change at least two data systems.  They also stated that it would take at least 3 years to modify the systems  and would be very costly. FMS officials suggested that the more cost-  effective solution would be for IRS to send OCSE the requested  information Although the offset program has been operating for almost 20 years,  OCSE\u2019s efforts to obtain the information on \u201cinjured spouse\u201d claims from  the Department of the Treasury began in late 2001.

As the federal partner and overseer of this program, it is  OCSE\u2019s role to work with other federal agencies, such as the Department  of the Treasury, to remove barriers that hinder fulfilling its mission.  Furthermore, since collections held from joint tax refunds represent a  large amount of state agencies\u2019 total undistributed collections, it is in the  best interest of the child support program for OCSE to focus more  attention on getting this information.
