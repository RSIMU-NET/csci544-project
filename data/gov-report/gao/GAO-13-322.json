These practices can provide lower prices or reduced risk for the government. The military departments use a number of contract arrangements, including contracts awarded to multiple health care staffing companies, for health care professionals. Military department analyses indicate that multiple-award contracts result in lower prices compared to other contract arrangements.", "The Department of Defense (DOD) does not have a consolidated agency-wide acquisition strategy for medical services. In the absence of such a strategy, contracting for health care professionals is largely fragmented. For example, the military departments had not consolidated their staffing requirements by developing joint contracts beyond a limited number of instances amounting to about 8 percent of the fiscal year 2011 spending on health care professionals. The departments have made efforts to use multiple-award contracts to consolidate intraservice staffing requirements, but GAO identified several instances where multiple task orders were placed for the same type of provider in the same area or facility. A more consolidated strategic sourcing strategy could allow DOD to acquire medical services in a more cost-effective way.", "Nearly all of the military departments' 11,253 contract health care professionals--96 percent--worked in 114 on-base military treatment facilities in fiscal year 2011, while the remaining 4 percent worked in 8 off-base clinics. The costs associated with the contracted health care services provided at on-base facilities are not comparable to such costs at off-base facilities for a variety of reasons. For example, some Military Health System cost accounting data have been characterized as unreliable. In addition, according to DOD officials, labor categories, labor costs, and full time equivalent calculations all vary by military department and in some cases by facility, contract, or geographic location, making a cost comparison problematic.", "DOD medical services contracting personnel are subject to DOD-wide training requirements. Consistent with DOD-wide training for all its contracting officers, DOD does not require health care contracting officers to have specialized training or experience. The required training provides a foundation for career field knowledge and is not targeted to specific types of acquisitions, including contracts for health care professionals. Health care experience among contracting personnel varied by location. Air Force contracting officers are not typically dedicated to medical services contracting, unlike their counterparts in the Army and Navy. The military departments provide contracting officers' representatives, who provide contract oversight, with specialized training in contracting for health care.", "GAO found that each of the departments has policies or procedures in place that generally address most of the legislated quality standards enacted in 2007 for contract health care professionals and the staffing companies that provide them. However, DOD did not require the military departments to use consistent quality standards in response to this legislation because DOD officials believed that the departments were already applying these standards as part of their contracting processes."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Secretary of Defense develop a DOD-wide strategic approach to contracting for health care professionals.

Under TRICARE, beneficiaries may obtain care either through DOD\u2019s  direct care system of MTFs, or through DOD\u2019s purchased care system of  civilian providers. The total DOD health care budget for fiscal year 2011  was $52.45 billion, of which $17.76 billion was to provide health care  through the direct care system of MTFs.

The Departments of the Army  and the Navy each has a medical command, headed by a surgeon  general, who manages each department\u2019s MTFs and other activities  through a regional command structure. Within these medical commands,  the Army and Navy have separate but similarly centralized approaches to  contracting for medical services, including health care professionals. The  Army acquires medical services through the Health Care Acquisition  Activity, which has a main contracting center and five regional contracting  offices. The Naval Medical Logistics Command is in charge of providing  contracting support for medical services for both the Navy and the Marine  Corps. Though similar in his role as medical advisor to the Air Force Chief  of Staff, the Air Force Surgeon General exercises no command authority  over Air Force MTFs. The Air Force does not have a medical contracting  command like the other two services.

Competition is the cornerstone of a sound acquisition  process and a critical tool for achieving the best return on investment for  taxpayers. Officials from the military departments told us that they use  multiple-award contracts for many reasons. In addition to perceived cost  effectiveness, officials stated that multiple-award contracts result in  shorter acquisition lead times and reduce the risk of bid protests.  Officials also stated they use multiple-award contracts because these  contracts are awarded to small businesses, which helps the military  departments meet their small business contracting goals. In fact, 100  percent of the current Army, Navy, and Air Force multiple-award contracts  are awarded to small businesses. DOD officials also stated that multiple- award contracts have facilitated the streamlining of acquisitions and the  standardization of contract requirements, which saves time and contract  administration costs.", "During our review, Navy and Air Force officials completed analyses of  their contracting arrangements which indicated that multiple-award  contracts may result in lower costs when contracting for health care  professionals compared to CSAs. Specifically, Navy officials conducted  an analysis comparing the hourly costs associated with the same type of  health care professional for each of three different contract  arrangements\u2014multiple-award contracts, individual set-aside (ISA)  contracts, and CSAs. Based on this analysis, the Navy determined that  the hourly rate of providers contracted via CSAs was higher than under  multiple-award contracts for the same types of services. Similarly, Air  Force officials told us and provided analysis indicating that CSAs cost  more than multiple-award contracts. In addition, the Air Force conducted  a separate analysis to determine cost savings on their multiple-award  contracts.

For example, Navy officials stated they sometimes contract directly with  an individual health care professional using an ISA when an individual\u2019s  qualifications will be used as the primary selection criterion and cost of  the contract is not as important as the provider\u2019s qualifications. Navy  officials stated they also use ISAs because they are more likely to be able  to pay a health care specialist a competitive market-based salary if they  contract with the provider directly instead of contracting with a staffing  company that typically adds 15-20 percent in overhead costs. A DOD  Inspector General report stated that ISAs may be appropriate in certain  circumstances, such as acquiring a scarce specialty. One drawback of  using an ISA is the amount of time it takes to award a contract. According  to Navy officials, it can take 9-12 months for a contract to be awarded. If  the health care professional on the contract decides to leave, the military  departments are left with an unfulfilled requirement while a new contract  is developed, solicited, and awarded.", "A CSA is another contracting arrangement that can be used to acquire  health care professionals. Similar to ISAs, CSAs are often used to  contract for hard-to-fill positions for health care specialists, especially in  remote locations. Although the Navy used CSAs in the past to fill  requirements for health care professionals, Navy officials stated that they  currently do not use CSAs because this contract arrangement is less cost  effective and provides for less competition. Although CSAs were reported  by the military departments to be more expensive than multiple-award  contracts, TMA officials stated that they have been used to fill positions  when other contracting arrangements have been unsuccessful.", "Regardless of the contract arrangement, some DOD officials told us that it  is challenging to fill the requirements for many of the highly skilled health  care professionals they need to work at MTFs. For instance, in 2012,  multiple-award contracts were competitively awarded to staffing  companies specifically for the National Capital Region. Some of the task  orders on these multiple-award contracts had to be terminated when the  staffing companies could not recruit incumbent health care professionals  whose previous salaries had been well above prevailing market rates.  This resulted in insufficient time for them to recruit new employees and  complete the hiring process without causing gaps in service.

This council also recommended that DOD  establish strategic sourcing councils to develop strategies for sourcing  key labor categories, including nurses and radiologists, and collect  standardized aggregate procurement data across military departments.  Strategic sourcing involves a shift away from numerous individual  procurements to a broader aggregate approach, and often results in cost  savings. Our prior work found that success in this regard requires the  commitment of senior management, as well as reliable and detailed  agency-wide spending data to identify opportunities to leverage buying  power, reduce costs, and better manage suppliers.", "In 2007, DOD drafted a charter for a Defense Medical Strategic Sourcing  Council. The council\u2019s charter stated that its goals were to allow DOD to  standardize the professional services acquisition process, further  decrease variation in unit cost for services, and reduce acquisition  workload. However, according to a TMA official, the military departments  never signed the charter, and the council was never convened.", "GAO reported in July 2010 that DOD would benefit from enhanced  collaboration among the military departments in their processes for  determining professional medical services requirements and  recommended that DOD identify, develop, and implement joint medical  personnel standards for shared services. While DOD concurred with our  recommendation, as of March 2013, no action has been taken to address  it. In our March 2011 report on opportunities to reduce duplication,  overlap, and fragmentation in government programs, we noted that  consolidating common administrative, management and clinical functions  within the Military Health System could increase efficiencies and  significantly reduce costs, but that DOD had taken only limited actions in  this area.", "In June 2011, the Deputy Secretary of Defense established a Task Force  to review various options for changes to the overall governance structure  of the Military Health System and of its multi-service medical markets.  The Task Force identified 13 potential governance options for the Military  Health System. DOD selected an option for Military Health System  governance that would create a defense health agency in part to assume  the responsibility for creating and managing shared services, and leave  the military chain of command intact with the military departments in  control of their military treatment facilities. This option would include a  shared services concept to consolidate common services, including  acquisition, under the control of a single entity. The Deputy Secretary of  Defense stated in a March 2012 memo that DOD recognizes that there  are opportunities to achieve savings in the Military Health System through  the consolidation and standardization of many shared services, including  but not limited to pharmacy programs, medical education and training,  health information technology, budget and resource management, and  acquisitions.", "While DOD is moving forward incrementally with its plans to transform the  Military Health System structure and set up the defense health agency,  decisions about the consolidation of health care staffing requirements  remain outstanding.

Currently, multiple-award contracts in the Army and Navy are generally  set up by U.S. geographical region and by provider type to meet the  requirements of more than one facility. For example, in each geographical  region, the Army and the Navy each have multiple-award contracts for  nurses, and one in each region for doctors. In 2012, the Navy had 6  multiple-award contracts on the west coast and 5 on the east coast,  including many types of health care professionals. The Navy routinely  receives 25 to 40 proposals, and usually makes 3 to 6 awards to health  care staffing companies. Navy officials told us that before multiple-award  contract use was prevalent, buying activity was more fragmented. More  individual contracts\u2014for specific labor categories and locations\u2014made  the burden much greater in terms of administration and oversight.  Officials explained that, at one point, the organization responsible for  medical services acquisitions was funded on the basis of how many  contracts were awarded, which incentivized inefficiency.", "In contrast, the Air Force uses multiple-award contracts that are set up  nationally to be used by all of its MTFs, and these contracts also include  many types of health care professionals. The Army awarded national  contracts for health care professionals in fiscal year 2003, but officials  said this approach was unsuccessful because not enough companies  were able to compete for those contracts and provide health care staffing  services on a national scale. Market research and feedback from  contractors indicated that regional multiple-award contracts would allow  greater opportunities for more small businesses to compete. The Army  subsequently put in place multiple-award contracts with regional  requirements for particular categories of health care professionals, such  as nurses. The Army found that this approach led to more successful  outcomes.", "Despite the use of multiple-award contracts, the potential for more  consolidation among task orders remains.

First, DOD does not collect  and maintain standardized data on health care professionals that would  allow for comparisons of the cost of facilities across the military  departments, or even within a military department from one facility to  another. For example, labor categories are not standardized across DOD.  Labor costs, including salary, benefits, overtime, and other costs vary by  military department and by contract, and the definition of an FTE  employee varies by military department. Second, DOD\u2019s Task Force  report on the Future of Military Health Care concluded that there were  significant issues with the Military Health System cost accounting that  affect the correct calculation of unit costs. For example, reported  workload data have been characterized as unreliable. DOD and military  department officials we spoke with confirmed this assessment during our  review. Third, the financial and data systems used by MTFs are not set  up to differentiate between the cost of care provided by contract health  care professionals versus the cost of care provided by civilian and active  duty health care professionals. Finally, market-based salaries for health  care professionals vary by geographic location and by specialty. For  example, the salary for a chiropractor in Washington, D.C. is significantly  higher than the salary for a chiropractor in the Portsmouth, Virginia area.  Therefore, comparing the costs associated with contract health care  professionals at off-base facilities to any contract health care  professionals at on-base facilities that were not working in the same  geographic area would not result in an appropriate comparison."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Agency- wide Training Requirements for Contracting Personnel, and Health Care Experience Varies", "paragraphs": ["DOD medical services contracting personnel are subject to DOD-wide  training requirements, and health care experience varies for these  personnel.

As a  result, according to Air Force officials we spoke with, Air Force acquisition  professionals involved in medical services require additional training in  the use of an approach often used in this area, personal services  contracting, which is characterized by the employer-employee  relationship it creates between the government and the contractor\u2019s  personnel.

Importantly, CORs may not direct the work of the contractor  by making commitments or changes that affect price, quantity, quality,  delivery, or other terms and conditions of the contract. Within DOD\u2019s  Military Health System, CORs oversee the performance of contract health  care professionals, including the review of contractor invoices and  documenting and reporting on the performance of health care  professionals to the contracting officer. The contract oversight model for  DOD\u2019s Military Health System is different than typical DOD acquisitions,  because the military departments reported regularly using personal  services contracts when contracting for health care professionals who, as  described above, are subject to the direction and supervision by the  government. In contrast to typical DOD contracting oversight  arrangements, supervision of contract health care professionals is  typically accomplished by a government employee at the MTF.
