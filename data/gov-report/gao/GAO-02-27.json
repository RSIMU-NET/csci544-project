All members, including borrowing members, contribute to the capital of the MDBs and participate in oversight and in the setting of operating policies through their participation on the boards of governors and executive boards. The MDBs provide development assistance in the form of loans, equity investments, loan and equity guarantees, and technical assistance. The primary vehicle of development assistance is direct lending. In 2000, the regional MDBs included in this report approved about $16.3 billion of development assistance consisting of loans, loan guarantees, and equity investments for economic and social development.", "The regional MDBs\u2019 lending activities can be grouped primarily into the following two types: market-based lending and concessional lending. Operations of regional MDBs that provide loans with market-based rates are financed primarily through borrowings from world capital markets, members\u2019 paid-in capital, and retained earnings. Members also provide support through subscriptions of callable capital. Because of the significant proportion of callable capital that is subscribed by members with strong credit ratings, including the United States, MDBs are able to use callable capital as backing to obtain more favorable financing terms when borrowing from world capital markets than would otherwise be available without the callable capital. To date there has never been a call on this capital for any of the MDBs included in this report.", "The lending arms of the regional MDBs that provide concessional loans to the poorest of the developing countries\u2014those meeting certain eligibility requirements\u2014are financed through contributions from member countries and borrower repayments of outstanding loans. These loans are called \u201cconcessional\u201d because they are provided with below-market interest rates and extended repayment terms. Due to the nature of concessional lending and the credit risks of borrower countries, the concessional lending arms do not have callable capital subscriptions and do not borrow from world capital markets to finance their operations. Unlike the market-based lending arms of the MDBs, which borrow from world capital markets to fund lending, concessional lending arms rely on capital replenishments or periodic contributions by members in addition to repayments from loans in order to continue lending operations.", "An MDB\u2019s activities are overseen through a board of governors, with a governor from each member country. In general, a board of governors is responsible for admitting new members, authorizing agreements for cooperation with other international organizations, making decisions about the board of executive directors, approving the MDB\u2019s financial statements, determining the reserves and the distribution of profits, and making decisions about the scope of MDB operations. Each MDB also has a board of executive directors, which is responsible for, among other things, overseeing the bank\u2019s daily operations, ensuring the implementation of the decisions of the board of governors, and approving the budget of the bank. The MDB\u2019s own management and staff of international civil servants carry out the MDB\u2019s daily operations.", "The four regional MDB groups included in this report are referred to as regional MDBs because they focus their activities on a particular region.

These standards require independent auditors to obtain a sufficient understanding of internal control to plan the audit and determine the nature, timing, and extent of tests to be performed. As part of an audit, the auditors are to communicate to the audit committee any internal control material weaknesses and reportable conditions that come to their attention during the course of their work. A frequent practice is for the auditors to issue a written document known as a management letter to communicate these weaknesses. The management letter, however, only addresses issues detected as part of the financial statement audit work, and it is not meant to be a comprehensive attestation on the sufficiency of an entity\u2019s internal control.

However, the charters do not contain requirements for an external auditor\u2019s report on the regional MDBs\u2019 internal control over these key objectives and requirements. In addition, the supporting documents provided to us by the regional MDB U.S. Executive Directors regarding the scope of audit services did not contain any requirements for the external auditor to provide a comprehensive report on internal control or compliance matters.

In the audit of financial statements, the auditor is concerned with those policies and procedures within the accounting and internal control systems that are relevant to the financial statements. As such, a financial statement audit is not intended to provide explicit assurance that the entity\u2019s funds were used for their intended purposes, or that management controls are in place to ensure the effective and efficient use of the funds.

Attestation standards apply whenever an independent auditor has been engaged to provide assurance or report on a subject matter that is the responsibility of another party. For example, the regional MDB management would evaluate the effectiveness of its internal control and make an assertion about its effectiveness. In turn, the external auditor attests, or provides assurance on, the MDBs\u2019 internal control or MDB management\u2019s assertion about internal control. Attestation services can cover internal control over financial reporting, operations, and compliance with laws, regulations, or key policies.

In fact, concerns about corruption have intensified in recent years as international financial donors have become increasingly aware that corruption may undermine development by deterring investment and growth and exacerbating poverty. Levels of perceived corruption vary from country to country, as shown in appendix I. Within this challenging environment, the regional MDBs must satisfy their dual mandate of providing development assistance and exercising their fiduciary responsibility. At the same time, MDBs must ensure that corruption is minimized in the projects they finance.", "As shown in figure 2, the MDBs\u2019 operations are funded through member countries\u2019 paid-in capital and borrowing from capital markets, backed by members\u2019 pledges of callable capital. Regional MDBs provide loans with market-based interest rates and loans on concessional terms. For example, the Asian Development Bank group uses its Ordinary Capital Resources for market-based lending and its Asian Development Fund for concessional lending. Figure 2 shows graphically how each arm serves as a financial intermediary, obtaining funds from world capital markets and member governments and providing loans to borrowers.", "Operations of MDBs that provide loans with market-based rates are financed primarily through borrowings from world capital markets, members\u2019 paid-in capital, and retained earnings. Their borrowings from world capital markets are at favorable terms because they have high credit ratings, based on their record of obtaining repayment on the loans they make to borrowers and on the backing provided by member countries\u2019 subscriptions to callable capital. To date, there has never been a need for the MDBs that are the subject of this report to make a call on their callable capital.", "The concessional lending arms, which do not borrow from world capital markets, rely on capital replenishments by members in order to continue lending operations. Unlike the market-based lending arms of the MDBs, the concessional lending arms need such replenishments because they have very long repayment terms and are lending to the less developed countries with high credit risk.", "As of December 31, 2000, regional MDBs had outstanding loans of $116 billion. Concessional loans comprised 26 percent, $30 billion dollars, of that total. The total of concessional loans for the MDBs we reviewed is considerable. At the same time, concessional loans are exposed to the following three types of risk:   First, due to conditions in concessional lending countries, which are among the poorest countries in the world, MDBs are exposed to considerable country and credit risks.", "Second, concessional loans are designed to aid the needs of developing countries, some of which are perceived to have the worst corruption problems in the world. See appendix I.", "Third, because concessional lenders rely on contributions from members, they are not subject to the same market discipline and monitoring that come into play when borrowing from world capital markets to fund lending activities.", "Moreover, even for the market-based lending MDBs, the discipline and monitoring that derive from their borrowing in the capital markets is not sufficient assurance to member countries that the MDBs have adequate controls over their lending operations or that controls are adequate to ensure that funds are used for the purpose for which the loan was granted. Capital-market investors are primarily interested in the financial soundness of the debt issuer. The assurance they receive from high credit ratings and the MDBs\u2019 satisfactory record of obtaining loan repayments satisfies their needs.", "Given this control environment, MDBs and member countries could benefit from the assurance and transparency provided by additional reporting on the part of external auditors on the MDBs\u2019 assertions on internal control, especially in the area of internal control over lending operations and internal control over compliance with key provisions of bank charters and policies. A structured, disciplined process for establishing, monitoring, and reporting on internal control is critical to providing reasonable assurance over the reliability of an entity\u2019s financial reporting, the effectiveness and efficiency of its operations, and its compliance with laws, regulations, charters, or policies.", "Increased assurance through external auditor attestation and reporting to member countries on internal control would provide additional assurance and transparency to member country governments regarding the internal control over MDBs\u2019 financial reporting, lending operations, and the use of their funds. The external auditor\u2019s assessment could also consider the role and activities of the internal audit function in the MDBs\u2019 internal control. Such reporting could be based on a structured and widely accepted framework and include the auditor\u2019s examination and conclusions regarding management\u2019s evaluation and assertion over the effectiveness of control in the following areas: 1.  Reliability of financial reporting: financial reporting controls are the policies and procedures that pertain to an entity\u2019s ability to record, process, summarize, and report financial data consistent with the assertions in the financial statements. 2.  Effectiveness and efficiency of operations: Operations controls relate to managing the entity\u2019s business and include policies and procedures to carry out organizational objectives, such as economy, efficiency, and effectiveness of operations. 3.  Compliance with applicable provisions of the MDBs\u2019 charters and policies: Compliance controls are the policies and procedures management uses to comply with specified provisions of the MDBs\u2019 charters and policies.", "In order for the MDBs\u2019 external auditors to report on controls over financial reporting, lending operations, and compliance, it will be necessary to adopt a phased-in approach. According to our work, reporting on internal control over financial reporting should be a relatively straightforward step for the MDBs to take because their external auditors are already performing financial statement audits; thus, the inclusion of internal control over financial reporting would be a natural addition. For example, the Federal Reserve Board in the United States has recently undergone this process and was able to report externally on internal control over financial operations by its third year.", "While reporting externally on internal control over lending operations and use of funds is vital to MDB accountability, it is a more complex process that could take longer to implement. Before the external auditor can conduct its review, we believe that significant issues need to be addressed to lay the foundation for the internal control review. For example, while internal control frameworks, such as those recognized by the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI), are available, internal control criteria for the MDBs will need to be specified and adopted by the MDBs. The MDBs could work together in developing specified criteria that can be used as a benchmark for implementing internal control and subsequently defining, measuring, and assessing the reasonableness of internal control over lending operations and compliance. The MDBs\u2019 management and audit committees, along with their external auditors, would play an important role in defining the specific criteria in terms of applicability, significance, and materiality.", "Another important issue we believe needs to be addressed by the key players would be to identify the key charter provisions to be included in a review of compliance controls and to define what would constitute \u201csubstantial\u201d compliance with those key provisions of bank charters. After these significant issues are addressed, MDB management would be able to comprehensively document and assess the specific controls identified as material and applicable and subsequently provide its assertions on the effectiveness of those controls. Finally, the external auditor would then report on the reasonableness of management\u2019s assertions related to the relevant lending operations and compliance controls.", "We recognize that resolving these significant issues and developing this additional audit function could take several more years, which is why it is imperative that the MDBs begin phasing in a strategy as soon as possible.

In 1997, bank regulators from 19 industrial and developing countries, with input from an additional 9 countries, developed Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision. These principles, published by the Basel Committee, identified 25 basic principles that need to be put in place for a supervisory system to be effective. A number of the principles address the importance of internal control and the audit function. For example, the principles call for   policies and procedures not only for the granting of loans but also for the ongoing management of loans; internal controls, including independent internal audit activities; and   external audit and compliance functions, to test adherence to these controls as well as applicable laws and regulations.", "INTOSAI also recognizes the importance of effective internal control. In June 1992, INTOSAI issued its Guidelines for Internal Control Standards and defined an internal control structure as the plans of an organization, including management\u2019s attitude, methods, procedures, and other measures that provide reasonable assurance that an organization is achieving the following general objectives:   promoting orderly, economical, efficient, and effective operations and quality products and services consistent with the organization\u2019s mission;   safeguarding resources against loss due to waste, abuse, mismanagement, errors, fraud, and other irregularities;   adhering to laws, regulations, and management directives; and   developing and maintaining reliable financial and management data and fairly disclosing the data in timely reports.", "In this guidance, INTOSAI prescribes the internal control standards that form a framework for an internal control structure that meets the above objectives. Upon issuance of its guidance, INTOSAI\u2019s Internal Control Standards Committee called for supreme audit institutions to encourage and support the establishment of internal controls. This would encompass (a) management understanding its responsibilities for implementing and monitoring the control structures and (b) auditing those structures to assure that controls are adequate to achieve the desired result. INTOSAI member countries have reported to the INTOSAI Internal Control Standards Committee that they have achieved a wide range of positive results.", "In 1992, the United Kingdom Committee on Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance published its study on corporate governance. A principal underlying motivation for the study was the perceived low level of confidence in financial reporting and the inability of external auditors to provide safeguards needed by the private and public sector financial statement users. Under the United Kingdom\u2019s Principles of Good Governance and Code of Best Practices (the Combined Code), a narrative statement from management on how it applied the principles of good governance and whether it has complied throughout the accounting period with the Combined Code\u2019s provisions is required. The external auditor then is required to report on whether the entity complied with the specified provisions of the Combined Code. In the United States, the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) was formed to support the implementation of the recommendations by the National Commission on Fraudulent Financial Reporting, commonly referred to as the Treadway Commission. The Treadway Commission issued its report in 1987 recommending that the sponsoring organizations cooperate in developing additional, integrated guidance on internal control to provide a common reference point that entities can use to assess the quality of their internal control systems. In 1992, COSO issued its report on internal control, Internal Control\u2014Integrated Framework. This framework is designed to assist management in assessing its internal control system against an established standard to help identify basic weaknesses in operation, financial reporting, and legal/regulatory compliance controls and take action to strengthen them. In 1994, COSO also issued an addendum, Reporting to External Parties, that addresses reporting guidelines where reports of internal control are issued in annual reports to shareholders. In a previous report, we reported that the World Bank had adopted a COSO framework. An excerpt of this report is provided in appendix II.", "The U.S. Congress recognized the link between weak internal control and past failures of financial institutions when it enacted the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA). FDICIA requires the management of an insured depository institution to state its responsibility for establishing and maintaining an adequate internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting. FDICIA also requires management to report on the effectiveness of this internal control system and an independent external auditor to attest to management\u2019s assertions on internal control in a separate report. As implemented, management\u2019s report on internal control and the auditor\u2019s related attestation includes control over safeguarding of assets.

However, the major focus of our report was to emphasize that given the control environment in borrowing countries, MDBs and member countries would benefit from the assurance and transparency provided by independent examination and reporting by external auditors in the area of internal control over lending operations and internal control over compliance with key provisions of bank charters and policies. Our report provides information about the results of the external financial statement audits at the MDBs and makes clear that by design the objective of a financial statement audit is not to provide assurance to member countries that project funds are used as intended. Our report notes that, although the regional MDBs have received clean opinions on their financial statements, the current financial statement audits cover only the MDBs\u2019 financial position at a point in time and the financial results of operations and cash flows for a given fiscal year. The financial statement audits are not intended to and do not provide specific assurance about the effectiveness of the MDBs\u2019 internal control over lending operations and compliance with bank charters and key policies. MDB project and program funds are used in countries where the level of perceived corruption is often high.", "Treasury also described, for illustrative purposes, the processes used by IDB for lending oversight and the role of the IDB\u2019s Auditor General and the board of directors in providing oversight. Treasury also stated its belief that the internal entities within the MDBs\u2019 own internal governance structure are better placed than the external auditors to assess internal control of the institutions and to ensure that programs of the banks are effective and efficient as called for in their charters. We acknowledge the importance of the MDB\u2019s own internal processes as a critical aspect of internal control, and MDB management\u2019s responsibility for establishing and implementing an effective system of internal control. However, until the effectiveness of the regional MDBs\u2019 internal control is subject to review by an independent third party, member countries will not have a comprehensive independent assessment of the effectiveness of the controls. The MDBs\u2019 accountability, transparency, and assurance over internal control could be enhanced through expanded external audit processes whereby (1) management provides assertions to the external auditors that the controls are operating effectively, and (2) the external auditor provides an attestation to the effectiveness of the controls through its independent testing procedures.", "Treasury questioned the cost-effectiveness of expanding the external auditors\u2019 engagements to include reporting on internal control over lending operations. We recognize that expanding the scope of the auditors\u2019 work will involve time and effort and, therefore, we recommended a phased approach. However, the amount of MDB funds at risk is considerable. The enhanced reporting is designed to provide additional accountability and transparency over the regional MDB groups\u2019 lending operations and provide reasonable assurance that project funds are spent as intended. External auditor attestation and reporting to member countries on internal control would provide additional assurance and transparency to member country governments regarding the control over MDBs\u2019 financial reporting, lending operations, and the use of their funds.
