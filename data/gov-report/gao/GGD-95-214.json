In addition, OCC\u2019s 1993 course catalog also lists various examiner training opportunities related to bank securities activities. An OCC Capital Markets Expert Seminar covered a range of capital markets topics, including bank dealer, trading, and retail brokerage activities.

Otherwise, securities investors can be exposed to inconsistent sales practices by sales representatives having different levels of training and experience. Although bank and securities regulators have cooperated well on some activities, other opportunities for cooperation exist that could provide more consistent regulation of bank securities activities.", "On occasion bank and securities regulators have worked together. For example, during 1994 bank regulators sought the assistance of SEC and NASD officials and examiners in developing new guidance and in developing and pilot-testing examination procedures. Also during 1994, the Federal Reserve and NASD agreed to coordinate examinations of bank brokerage affiliates. In January 1995, all three banking regulators and NASD reached a formal agreement to coordinate examination schedules of bank-affiliated broker-dealers and share examination findings and workpapers. Further, securities regulators and bank regulators told us that they are discussing various proposals to extend securities industry qualifications testing and registration to bank employees who are engaged in bank-direct securities activities. The testing and registration process is to be backed by examination, enforcement, and disciplinary functions designed to be identical to those in place for the securities industry. Bank and securities regulators expect to resolve this issue within the next several months. SEC has also contacted the bank regulators to propose development of a common approach to eliminating the payment of referral fees to nonregistered employees of financial institutions.", "Despite such cooperative efforts, differences in approaches to and procedures for regulating bank brokerage operations persist. For example, the interagency guidance sets forth standards for registered broker-dealers that differ, in some respects, from federal securities laws and regulations. These differences were highlighted when, in December 1994, NASD released for comment proposed rules governing securities broker-dealers operating on bank premises. The proposed NASD rules prohibit the payment of referral fees by the broker-dealer to nonregistered bank employees. Referral fees are permitted by the interagency guidance, provided that they are one-time nominal fees of a fixed-dollar amount and not contingent on the referral resulting in a transaction. The proposed rules also place stricter controls than the interagency guidance on the broker\u2019s use of confidential bank customer financial information, such as certificate of deposit maturity dates and balances, for soliciting sales of securities. Also, the proposed NASD rules place stricter limits on the use of bank logos in advertising materials for securities than the interagency guidance.", "NASD\u2019s proposed rules have generated controversy in the banking industry. According to the financial press, some bankers have complained that the rules hold bank brokerages to standards that are higher than for nonbank brokerages. For example, they note that, unlike bank brokerages, nonbank brokerages are not required to disclose that mutual funds are not federally insured. An NASD official responded that when a customer deals with a brokerage in a bank, that brokerage has a higher responsibility to ensure that the customer understands the risk involved in investing in securities as compared to savings accounts or certificates of deposit. According to NASD, its proposed rules seek consistent treatment of affiliated and networking (third-party) broker-dealers. Further, NASD said the banking guidelines established by the Interagency Statement do not have the force and effect of law and cannot support disciplinary actions against broker-dealers. Both the Interagency Statement and the proposed NASD rules, however, require written acknowledgement of the disclosure of risks associated with investment products sold in banks. The Interagency Statement is more comprehensive in that it also requires oral disclosure at any sales presentation or offering of investment advice.", "Additional cooperative efforts among bank and securities regulators could help make regulation more uniform and consistent by making information and regulatory procedures used by securities regulators available to bank regulators. For example, NASD and state securities regulators maintain the Central Registration Depository (CRD), a database containing background and disciplinary information on broker-dealers and individual sales representatives. In our September 1994 report and testimony before the congressional oversight committee we recognized that the CRD information, after system design limitations are corrected, could be a useful regulatory tool for controlling the migration of unscrupulous persons among sectors of the financial services industry. We recommended that SEC, the Treasury Department, and other regulators work together to increase disclosure of the CRD information among the various regulators of financial services. Those regulators have begun actions to increase disclosure.

In particular, the securities regulators have questioned the continued exemption of banks from SEC registration and regulation. They argue that the exemptions subject banks to weaker regulatory standards than broker-dealers. For example, in congressional hearings SEC officials stated that banking regulation has traditionally focused on the safety and soundness of the banking system and the protection of depositors as opposed to protection of securities investors. The securities regulators and securities industry representatives have stated that Congress should reassess the current regulatory structure in light of banks\u2019 expansion into securities activities and develop a system of functional regulation in which the securities regulators would be responsible for regulating all securities activities, including those of banks.", "In contrast, bank regulators and banking industry representatives have stated that measures that they have taken to strengthen oversight of securities activities provide adequate protection to customers who choose to invest through their banks.

The regulatory system, which was also designed in the 1930s, has not been adjusted to reflect the changed activities. Because banks are exempt from SEC registration and regulation, banking organizations can chose how to organize their securities brokerage activities, and depending on that organization, how they are regulated. For example, banks can choose to sell securities directly and be subject to oversight by banking regulators but not by securities regulators. If these activities are to be regulated, then bank regulators must include them in their regulatory scheme and examinations. Under the current regulatory structure the same type of securities activities can be overseen by different regulators depending on how banks organize their securities activities.", "The potential for inconsistent oversight has not been much of a problem so far because most banks provide securities services in subsidiaries that are regulated primarily by securities regulators. Further, for the 3 percent of banks nationwide that offer brokerage services that are exempt from regulation by securities regulators, bank regulators have provided new guidance and examination procedures and are working to improve their oversight. Nevertheless, providing consistent securities oversight, no matter where in an organization these activities are done, would be enhanced by increased cooperation, coordination, and sharing of regulatory expertise among bank and securities regulators.

In a 1993 report on the Federal Reserve\u2019s bank holding company inspections, we noted that the quality of Federal Reserve workpapers was inconsistent, and the Federal Reserve Manual did not provide guidance on workpaper preparation. We also recommended that the Federal Reserve improve workpaper documentation of its bank holding company inspections. In response to those recommendations, the Federal Reserve said that those workpapers would be subject to standards similar to the agency\u2019s new standards for workpapers in commercial bank examinations, which the Federal Reserve was testing as of September 1994. The Federal Reserve\u2019s standardized commercial bank work documentation program is intended to provide a consistent format for documenting the tasks performed on each examination. The Federal Reserve\u2019s commercial bank examination standards also provide a format for examiners to follow in reviewing the work of internal auditors, including determining the adequacy of internal auditors\u2019 testing methods.", "In our review of the Federal Reserve\u2019s inspections of the Section 20 subsidiaries, we found two instances in which neither Federal Reserve examiners nor the internal auditors reviewed for compliance with certain firewalls. More specifically, we found the following: In the 1993 inspection of one of the larger Section 20 subsidiaries, neither the Federal Reserve examiner nor the internal auditors reviewed firewalls that restricted credit extensions to the underwriting subsidiary and its clients and customers, prohibited interlocking directorates, required disclosure of the subsidiary\u2019s relationship to the parent organization, and prohibited intercompany transactions and transfers of assets between the Section 20 subsidiary and affiliated insured banks. In this case, the examiner said that he relied on an internal audit that was the same one he relied on in the prior year\u2019s inspection. The Federal Reserve examiners said that they used spot-checks and walk-throughs to review these items, and those reviews may not have been documented in workpapers. In another inspection, neither the Federal Reserve examiner nor the internal auditor reviewed firewalls that restrict the sale of securities underwritten by the Section 20 subsidiary to other subsidiaries of the same bank holding company and restrict any asset sales to affiliated banks.", "It is important that these firewalls be checked to ensure that they are in place and functioning properly to restrict conflicts of interest, risky credit relationships, and illegal intercompany transactions and reciprocal arrangements. In these instances, inspection supervisors\u2019 reviews would have been needed to ensure that all firewalls were examined and work was properly documented in workpapers.", "Federal Reserve officials said that it allowed the districts to use their own discretion in deciding how much to rely on the work of internal auditors. Such discretion is allowed because it is a practical approach to covering all Section 20 subsidiaries. Otherwise, the districts would not be able to cover all of the bank holding companies and their subsidiaries if Federal Reserve examiners themselves did extensive testing of every regulatory requirement. This would be especially true for the New York district, which has the highest number of Section 20 subsidiaries (13)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Reserve Inspections Seek to Correct Deficiencies and Avert Problems", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Reserve, as well as the other federal bank regulators, can impose any of several informal and formal enforcement actions on banks that operate in an unsafe or unsound manner or fail to comply with laws and regulations.

Since the 1987 order that first approved Section 20 subsidiaries, two enforcement actions have been taken, one formal and one informal, both during 1994. On December 5, 1994, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York executed a Written Agreement with a bank holding company, its affiliated bank, and its Section 20 subsidiary not to engage in any violation of Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act or any of the Federal Reserve\u2019s firewalls. As a result of a 1994 inspection, at the Federal Reserve\u2019s request a Section 20 subsidiary adopted a board of directors resolution that restricted the subsidiary\u2019s underwriting and dealing in ineligible securities and required various corrective measures.", "According to Federal Reserve officials, the Federal Reserve has taken few enforcement actions because the Federal Reserve emphasizes corrective measures, rather than enforcement actions, to ensure that Section 20 firms have appropriately functioning internal control and internal audit procedures in place. Under this approach, Federal Reserve officials said, potential problems are discovered and corrected as part of the inspection process before they become serious enough to warrant an enforcement action. However, Federal Reserve officials said they will take enforcement actions if their examiners discover (1) an incidence of serious noncompliance with laws, regulations, or supervisory guidance relative to a Section 20 subsidiary; (2) repeat offenses; or (3) an unwillingness to correct voluntarily noted deficiencies or violations.", "Even though the Federal Reserve\u2019s inspections have not resulted in many enforcement actions, our review of Federal Reserve inspection reports showed that the Federal Reserve\u2019s annual firewall inspection efforts have identified deficiencies and potential problems. In 15 out of 31 of the most recent inspections completed during 1992 or 1993, Federal Reserve examiners noted deficiencies. These deficiencies included, among others, a lack of internal audits for a newly established Section 20 subsidiary and failure to account for and adhere to technical rules related to calculation of the amounts of ineligible versus eligible revenues. According to Federal Reserve officials, such deficiencies are discussed with bank officials in inspection close-out meetings. Following these meetings, Federal Reserve officials said they require the subsidiaries\u2019 management to respond in writing within 60 days about the actions that the subsidiary will take to correct such deficiencies.

In that case Federal Reserve staff found that the examiners verified compliance with this firewall. However, we did not see this work and the results documented in the inspection workpaper files that we reviewed. The Federal Reserve staff also noted that the Section 20 company in question, at the time of the inspection, was operating under the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s 1987 Order and was not subject to the firewall governing asset sales. According to our reading of the Federal Reserve\u2019s Bank Holding Company Supervision Manual, Section 2185.0, page 28, the 1987 Order did contain a firewall governing asset sales. In the third instance, Federal Reserve staff found that a firewall prohibiting reciprocal arrangements was not tested because the Section 20 company in question did about 98 percent of its business in government securities, which are not subject to firewalls.
