In 2004, amended compacts with the FSM and RMI went into effect and will provide $3.5 billion in assistance over 20 years, consisting of grants and contributions to trust funds that are to replace the grants after 2023. The amended compacts include funding and accountability requirements that were not present in the original compact. To better understand the status of the compacts' implementation, GAO evaluated actions taken by the U.S., FSM, and RMI governments since fiscal year 2004 to (1) meet funding requirements and plan for the use of this funding, (2) meet accountability requirements, and (3) establish operations to implement the new agreements."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal years 2004 and 2005, the U.S. government signed grant agreements with the FSM and the RMI focused on six sectors, such as health and education, as provided for in the amended compacts. Authorized grant amounts for each year were about $76 million for the FSM and about $35 million for the RMI. Required trust funds were also established. Strategic planning issues impacting the long-term, effective use of funds have not been addressed. The allocations of the grants to the sectors have not been linked to the countries' development goals; the FSM and RMI have not planned for annual required decreases in grant funding; and trust funds have not been invested to maximize interest earnings (though efforts are currently under way to resolve this final issue). The U.S., FSM, and RMI governments have taken actions to meet compact accountability requirements. For example, the FSM and the RMI have provided financial and performance reports, and the U.S. government has withheld funding to ensure compliance with grant requirements. However, a few important accountability requirements have not been met. For instance, the FSM's development plan has not been approved by the U.S. government, and it is unclear whether the U.S. government has assessed the RMI's planning documents. Finally, the FSM has not completed single audits for fiscal years 2003 or 2004, and none of the three governments has submitted its required annual compact spending and development report for fiscal year 2004. The Department of the Interior took a significant step in October 2003 to facilitate implementation and oversight of the amended compacts by opening a new office in Honolulu, Hawaii. However, Interior has not determined how much oversight of compact activities in the FSM and the RMI is necessary, though the current level of on-site review is viewed as insufficient. The FSM and RMI governments have each taken actions to establish centralized compact management offices; the RMI government is progressing more rapidly in these efforts than the FSM government."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since fiscal year 1987, the United States has provided economic assistance  to the Pacific island nations of the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM)  and the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) through a Compact of Free  Association. In 2000, we reviewed the accountability over, and impact of,  this compact funding and determined that the U.S., FSM, and RMI  governments had all provided limited accountability over spending and that  U.S. assistance had resulted in little impact on economic development in  both countries. Funding under the original compact expired at the end of  fiscal year 2003. The U.S. government negotiated new compact provisions  with the FSM and the RMI that established continued U.S. economic  assistance from fiscal year 2004 through fiscal year 2023, with the U.S.  Department of the Interior\u2019s Office of Insular Affairs (OIA) responsible for  providing U.S. assistance and monitoring expenditures.

The amended compacts establish annual funding levels ($92.7  million for the FSM and $57.7 million for the RMI in fiscal year 2004) that  are divided primarily between direct grant assistance, which is targeted to  specific areas, with priority in the health and education sectors, and  contributions to trust funds. U.S. grant funding will decrease annually,  with the amount of the decrement added to U.S. trust fund contributions;  earnings from the trust funds are intended to replace grant assistance when  the latter expires in 2023. In addition, numerous accountability  requirements have been added to the amended compacts, including  requirements for quarterly financial and performance reports and  strengthened bilateral interaction.", "To obtain insights regarding initial efforts to implement the amended  compacts, we evaluated actions taken by the U.S., FSM, and RMI  governments since fiscal year 2004 to (1) meet compact funding  requirements and plan for the use of this funding, (2) meet compact  accountability requirements, and (3) establish operations to facilitate  compliance with funding and accountability requirements.", "We reviewed the amended compacts as well as the subsidiary fiscal  procedures agreements and trust fund agreements. We further reviewed  grant agreements as well as budgets, financial data, and performance  reports submitted by the FSM and RMI governments to the U.S.  government. We also examined briefing documents created by the U.S.  government in preparation for annual meetings with the two countries. We  assessed the minutes summarizing the discussion and decisions from these  meetings. We held extensive interviews with officials from OIA and the U.S.  Department of State. In addition, we traveled to the FSM (Pohnpei and  Chuuk) and the RMI (Majuro and Ebeye). We had detailed discussions with  FSM and RMI officials from finance, budget, health, education, public  works, and audit agencies, and we also obtained the views of U.S.  government officials working in each country.

This compact represented a new phase of the unique  and special relationship that has existed between the United States and  these island areas since World War II. The compact provided a framework  for the United States to work toward achieving its three main goals: (1) to  secure self-government for the FSM and the RMI, (2) to ensure certain  national security rights for all of the parties, and (3) to assist the FSM and  the RMI in their efforts to advance economic development and self- sufficiency. The first goal was met; the FSM and the RMI are independent  nations and are members of international organizations such as the United  Nations. The second goal was also achieved. At the time that the compact  was negotiated, the United States was concerned about the use of the  islands of the FSM and the RMI as \u201cspringboards for aggression\u201d against the  United States, as they had been used in World War II, and the Cold War  incarnation of this threat\u2014the Soviet Union. The compact and its related  agreements established several key defense rights for all three countries.  For example, the compact obligates the United States to defend the FSM  and the RMI against an attack, or the threat of attack, in the same way it  would defend its own citizens. Further, through a compact-related  agreement, the United States secured access to military facilities on  Kwajalein Atoll in the RMI through 2016.", "The third goal of the compact\u2014advancing economic development and self- sufficiency for both countries\u2014was to be accomplished primarily through  U.S. direct financial payments to the FSM and the RMI. For 1987 through  2003, U.S. assistance to the FSM and the RMI to support economic  development was estimated, on the basis of Interior data, to be about $2.1  billion. We found previously that many compact-funded projects in the FSM  and the RMI experienced problems because of poor planning and  management, inadequate construction and maintenance, or misuse of  funds. Economic self-sufficiency had advanced but had not been achieved;  although total U.S. assistance as a percentage of total government revenue  fell in both countries, the two nations remained dependent on U.S. funds.  U.S. direct assistance maintained standards of living that were higher than  could be achieved in the absence of U.S. support.", "Another aspect of the special relationship between the FSM and the RMI  and the United States involves the unique immigration rights that the  compact grants. Under the original compact, citizens of both nations were  allowed to live and work in the United States as \u201cnonimmigrants\u201d and could  stay for long periods of time, with few restrictions. Further, the compact  exempted FSM and RMI citizens from meeting U.S. passport, visa, and  labor certification requirements when entering the United States. In  recognition of the potential adverse impacts that Hawaii and nearby U.S.  commonwealths and territories could face as a result of an influx of FSM  and RMI citizens, the Congress authorized compact impact payments to  address the financial impact of these nonimmigrants on Guam, Hawaii, and  the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Amended Compacts of Free Association", "paragraphs": ["In the fall of 1999, the United States, represented by the Department of  State, and the two Pacific island nations began negotiating economic  assistance and defense provisions of the compact that were due to expire  in 2003. The negotiations also addressed immigration issues. Separate  compacts were completed for the RMI and the FSM and went into effect on  May 1, 2004, and June 25, 2004, respectively. Prior to formal  implementation of the amended compacts, the United States provided  funding via a continuing resolution and the Department of the Interior\u2019s  fiscal year 2004 appropriation legislation. According to the Department of  State, the aims of the amended compacts are to (1) continue economic  assistance to advance self-reliance, while improving accountability and  effectiveness; (2) continue the defense relationship, including a 50-year  lease extension (beyond 2016) of U.S. military access to Kwajalein Atoll in  the RMI; (3) strengthen immigration provisions; and (4) provide assistance  to lessen the impact of Micronesian migration on Guam, Hawaii, and the  CNMI.", "The amended compacts\u2019 second objective, continuing the U.S.-RMI defense  relationship, has been addressed, as expiring defense provisions of the  compact have been renewed and U.S. access to Kwajalein Atoll has been  extended. However, one notable difficulty remains regarding this objective;  although the U.S. government negotiated an agreement with the RMI  government that allows for U.S. access to Kwajalein Atoll until 2086, the  RMI government has not reached an agreement with Kwajalein Atoll  landowners (who own the land under use by the U.S. government) that  allows for this long-term access. The U.S. government is not involved in  efforts to negotiate such an agreement, and neither the RMI government  nor the Kwajalein Atoll landowners are actively pursuing resolution of this  issue. The third and fourth objectives have also been addressed. Compact  immigration provisions have been strengthened by, for example, requiring  passports from FSM and RMI citizens entering the United States and  clarifying requirements for bringing FSM and RMI children into the United  States for adoption. Further, the amended compacts\u2019 enabling legislation  appropriates specific annual nonimmigrant impact compensation of $30  million for Guam, Hawaii, and the CNMI for fiscal years 2004 through 2023,  with the distribution of funding between the locations based on periodic surveys identifying the number of FSM and RMI nonimmigrants in each  location."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Continuing Economic Assistance under Amended Compacts", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. government intends to achieve its first objective\u2014continuing  economic assistance to advance self-reliance, while improving  accountability and effectiveness under the amended compacts\u2014by  annually providing direct financial assistance, in the form of grant  agreements, to the FSM and the RMI, for 20 years (fiscal years 2004 through  2023) (see tables 1 and 2). Grant assistance to the FSM and RMI is targeted  to six specific sectors\u2014education, health, public infrastructure, the  environment, public sector capacity building, and private sector  development\u2014although the priority sectors are education and health. RMI  grants must also target some funding to Ebeye and other Marshallese  communities within Kwajalein Atoll. The U.S. Congress, in approving the  amended compacts, also authorized a supplemental education grant for  each country. The Congress determined that rather than remaining eligible  for appropriations under certain education and labor program assistance,  such as Head Start and Job Corps, the FSM and the RMI would instead  receive supplemental direct grant assistance.", "In addition to providing sector grant funds, the amended compacts provide  for the establishment of trust funds for both countries. While providing the  direct grant assistance, the U.S. government will also contribute to the trust  funds for both countries, and the FSM and the RMI will replace the grant  assistance with trust fund earnings beginning in 2024. In addition, the FSM  and the RMI must each make one-time contributions to its trust fund of $30  million, and other donors can contribute to the funds as well. Except for  the fixed amounts set aside as audit grants, the amounts listed in tables 1  and 2 will be partially adjusted for inflation, with fiscal year 2004 as the  base year. Grant funding can be fully adjusted for inflation after fiscal year  2014 under certain economic conditions. Including estimated inflation  adjustments, total U.S. assistance to both countries combined is projected  at more than $3.5 billion over the 20-year assistance period.", "The amended compacts and their subsidiary fiscal procedures agreements  (FPA) also establish numerous new accountability requirements. For  example, under the amended compacts, the United States established a  Joint Economic Management Committee (JEMCO) with the FSM and a  Joint Economic Management and Financial Accountability Committee  (JEMFAC) with the RMI to strengthen management and accountability and  to promote the effective use of the compact funding. Each committee  comprises five members, three from the United States and the other two  from the FSM for the JEMCO and from the RMI for the JEMFAC. The  Departments of the Interior, State, and HHS supply the three U.S.  representatives, with the Department of the Interior representative serving  as Chairman. The FSM and RMI governments select their respective  representatives. The amended compacts require the committees to meet at  least once annually, no later than 30 days before the beginning of the fiscal  year, to review the budgeting and development plans of each of the  governments, approve grant allocations and performance objectives, attach  special conditions to any or all annual grant awards to improve program  performance and fiscal accountability, and evaluate progress made under  the amended compacts. JEMCO and JEMFAC render decisions by majority  vote, except decisions regarding the division of RMI grants, which are  made by consensus. Budget consultations with each country are also  required prior to JEMCO and JEMFAC meetings to ensure that proposed  compact budgets estimate sector grant requirements for the upcoming  fiscal year. In addition, trust fund committees are required to address  issues associated with the operations and investments of the FSM and RMI  trust funds. The trust fund committee for each country is comprised of  representatives from the United States and the FSM or the RMI, and other  contributors may also join the committees. Language contained in the  amended compacts\u2019 enabling legislation states that it is the sense of the  U.S. Congress that U.S. appointees to the trust fund committees \u201cshould be  designated from the Department of State, the Department of the Interior,  and the Department of the Treasury.\u201d", "The FSM and RMI must also adhere to specific financial and performance  reporting requirements as part of the amended compacts and the FPAs. The  FPAs state that financial management systems must meet several standards  addressing financial reporting, accounting records, internal and budget  controls, cash management, and source documentation, and also specify  applicable procedures regarding real property, equipment, and  procurement where compact funds are involved. As part of their budgeting  process, both countries must submit plans for the division of annual  economic assistance among sectors. Additionally, per the terms of the  FPAs, the FSM and RMI must submit quarterly financial status and cash  transaction reports, and final annual financial reports and single audits  must be completed following the end of each fiscal year. Further, for each  sector grant, the FSM and RMI must submit quarterly performance reports  comparing actual accomplishments with program objectives and  identifying any problems or issues encountered during the reporting  period. The FSM and RMI are responsible for the management and  monitoring of the day-to-day operations of all sector grants and their  activities to ensure compliance with all grant terms and conditions. In  addition, the FSM and RMI must prepare and submit an annual report to  the President of the United States on the use of grant assistance and  describe progress toward mutually agreed-upon program and economic  goals. Similarly, the President of the United States must submit an annual  report to the Congress regarding several issues such as general social,  political, and economic conditions in each country; the use and  effectiveness of financial assistance; status of efforts to increase  investments; and recommendations on ways to increase the effectiveness  of assistance and to meet overall economic performance objectives.

Department of State officials emphasized to us that they are primarily  responsible for conducting foreign relations with the two countries and  safeguarding U.S. strategic interests in the region, and these objectives  necessarily include involvement in compact issues. An executive order is  currently under preparation that identifies the specific responsibilities of  U.S. agencies regarding compact matters. Further, OIA coordinates with  HHS, a U.S. JEMCO and JEMFAC member, and in February 2005 a senior  official from HHS began work in OIA\u2019s Honolulu field office (which opened  in 2003) and told us that he provides support to the OIA health sector  efforts under the amended compacts, provides technical assistance for an  array of U.S. federal health grants in the Pacific, and works to improve  coordination with other public health entities in the region, such as the  World Health Organization."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Key Differences between Original Compact and Amended Compacts", "paragraphs": ["The amended compacts differ from the original compact chiefly in that they  provide for direct assistance through sector grant agreements, establish  trust funds, and strengthened accountability and reporting provisions (all  discussed earlier). In addition, unlike the original compact, the amended  compacts do not include a \u201cfull faith and credit\u201d guarantee, which had  made it impracticable for the U.S. government to withhold compact funds.  Instead, the FPAs contain provisions that explicitly allow for the  withholding of funds if compact, FPA, or grant requirements are not met.  Further, the FPAs allow for the suspension of funds if the FSM or RMI  engage in gross negligence, willful misconduct, or material breach of terms  and conditions with respect to the use of financial assistance provided  under the amended compacts. In addition, funds can be withheld if the FSM  and RMI do not cooperate in investigations regarding whether funds are  being used for purposes outside what is authorized in the compact.", "Finally, the FPAs prohibit the FSM and RMI from issuing negotiable or  transferable obligations evidencing indebtedness or encumbrance of  compact economic assistance funds. In 2000, we found that under the  original compact, the FSM and the RMI issued compact revenue-backed  bonds in order to obtain greater funding in the earlier years of the compact.  The funding was used to retire existing debt, pay for capital projects, and  make financial investments.

A resolution adopted by the JEMCO during an August 2004  meeting requires the FSM to move to reach the goal of funding  infrastructure at not less than 30 percent of annual compact grant  funding by fiscal year 2006.

According to a senior OIA official, the FSM needed to use  these grant funds for basic government operations to be able to  adequately support the use of other sector grant funds. As a 2004 grant  condition, the FSM is required to stop funding basic government  operations from Compact grant assistance over a 5-year period.

Compact funds are allocated among the five FSM governments\u2014the  FSM national government and the four state governments\u2014primarily  according to a formula used under the original compact. In addition to  providing funds to the four states, the formula established funding to the  FSM national government, which resulted in a funding allocation  percentage for Chuuk and Pohnpei states that is notably lower than their  percentage of the FSM\u2019s population. An FSM law enacted in January 2005  establishes a very similar distribution among the five governments.", "Although the U.S. government has signed grant agreements for fiscal years  2004 and 2005 that provide for the distribution of funds to the five  governments according to this formula, U.S. government officials have  stated that this formula may not result in grant allocations that reflect  national needs. For example, there are currently substantial differences in  sector per capita funding in the FSM states. We calculated that the Yap  state compact education grant provides at least twice as much funding per  student as the Chuuk state education grant, and almost three times as  much funding per person regarding health grants.

According to an OIA official,  this circumstance has resulted from the time it took the FSM and the RMI  to approve the amended compacts as well as the process involved in  selecting an investment advisor and placing funds with money managers. In  February 2005, the RMI trust fund committee selected a trust fund  investment advisor; no advisor has been selected for the FSM as of mid- May 2005, although the process to select one is under way.", "This situation is important in the context of our prior analysis that raised  questions about the sufficiency of the trust funds to generate earnings that  could replace compact grants beginning in 2024.

The U.S. government has undertaken notable actions during  the early stages of compact implementation that reflect its commitment. It  has embraced new accountability options in the amended compacts by, for  example, requiring data that will facilitate performance measurement and  suspending funds as a result of possible misuse. Further, by holding  infrastructure funding until the countries provide sufficient infrastructure  project and identification management, the U.S. government has taken a  new approach to ensuring the effective use of compact funds. In addition,  by establishing a Honolulu field office and investing in staff to provide  monitoring and oversight, OIA has demonstrated its commitment to  successful implementation of the amended compacts. Such staff are  critical to conducting work in the field to monitor performance and  financial accountability, as OIA\u2019s review of education expenditures in the  FSM state of Chuuk has demonstrated. However, officials from all three  governments believe that more OIA field work is in order.

Both countries have  taken steps to establish centralized offices responsible for ensuring  compact implementation and day-to-day oversight; however, it is too early  to assess how well these offices will meet this goal. Further, both countries  have responded in a positive fashion to many new reporting requirements.  For example, the FSM and the RMI expressed a desire to provide useful  performance reports and have been responsive to working with OIA to  strengthen and improve this new approach to accounting for compact  funds. In addition, both countries have been timely in providing quarterly  financial and performance reports. While both countries are moving to  meet compact requirements, to date the RMI is progressing more quickly  than the FSM in spending authorized grant funding, meeting special grant  conditions, preparing adequate required reports, taking steps to centralize  compact management, and selecting an investment advisor who can work  to maximize trust fund returns.", "Although the three governments\u2019 commitment to meeting compact  requirements is clear, challenges for future performance exist. The failure  of all three governments to complete required annual compact spending  and development reports means that, for the first year under the amended  compacts, there is no assessment of the use of U.S. assistance and initial  performance in key areas such as health and education. Similarly, the lack  of timely single audits deprives the United States of a key source of  information on the FSM\u2019s and the RMI\u2019s compliance with detailed compact  requirements. Additionally, the FSM\u2019s difficulties in preparing a national  infrastructure development plan to obtain substantial infrastructure grant  funding demonstrate the difficulty the country is having integrating state  and national priorities and using compact funds to advance national goals.  Finally, it is unclear why strategic issues, such as the need for planning to  use compact funds to achieve long-term economic advancement or to  address annual grant decreases, are not being actively considered by all  three governments, regardless of the early stage of the amended compacts\u2019  implementation.

We reviewed all fiscal year 2004 and 2005 grant  agreements with both countries, including special terms and conditions  included in these agreements, and identified instances where no grant  agreement had been signed. We examined annual financial data prepared  by the FSM and the RMI to determine the amount of funding that was not  spent for fiscal year 2004 and what sectors were affected by this  circumstance. We discussed the FSM and RMI data with an Office of  Insular Affairs official who has used this information, and determined that  the data are sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our report. We also  corroborated our calculations of unspent funds with this official. We did  not review funding provided to Kwajalein landowners in exchange for U.S.  military access to Kwajalein Atoll.

We then reviewed such issues by  examining documents such as FSM and RMI legislation and documentation  provided to the U.S. government (such as the FSM\u2019s transition plan to shift  ineligible spending under the public sector capacity building grant to local  revenues). To identify FSM education spending per capita, we used FSM  education grant data and divided grant amounts provided to each state by  the student population for each state\u2014the latter data were provided to us  by OIA, which received them directly from the FSM. To identify FSM health  spending per capita, we assessed health grant amounts against FSM  population data.

To identify the  extent of Honolulu office staff travel to the FSM and the RMI, we obtained  the travel records and start dates of all five program specialists and  discussed this information with OIA officials to ensure that the data was  sufficiently reliable for our use. We calculated the percentage of time spent  conducting on-site review in the two countries over fiscal years 2004 and  2005 (through mid-April) time span and compared this to the total work  time for the program specialists.
