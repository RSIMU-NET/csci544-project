State agencies, usually departments of education, are responsible for the statewide administration of the lunch program through the disbursing of federal funds, monitoring of the program, and record keeping. Many of these responsibilities are carried out in cooperation with local school food authorities. Food authorities are responsible for managing school food services for one or more schools or for a school district.", "Schools have traditionally operated their own food services. However, some important changes in the way they provide meals have taken place since the 1980s. Some food authorities have contracted with private food service management companies (FSMC) to operate their school food services. In addition, some schools are offering brand-name fast foods as a part of the lunch program meal or as separate (a la carte) items."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "National School Lunch Program", "paragraphs": ["According to USDA, on a typical school day in fiscal year 1996, the lunch program provided about 26 million students with balanced and low-cost or free lunches nationwide. Of these students, about 25 million, or about 96 percent, attended public schools, and about 967,000, or about 4 percent, attended private schools. Within a school district, schools can choose to participate or not participate in the program. During fiscal year 1995, about 94,000 institutions, including about 89,000 schools and about 5,000 residential child care institutions participated in the lunch program, according to USDA. State education agencies usually administer the program through agreements with food authorities. The federal cost to support school lunches in fiscal year 1995 was about $5.2 billion, including about $613 million in federal commodity donations, such as beef patties, flour, and canned vegetables. The lunch program operates in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories and possessions.", "Schools participating in the lunch program receive cash reimbursements and commodities from the federal government for each meal served. In turn, they must serve lunches that meet federal nutritional requirements and offer these lunches free or at a reduced price to children from families whose income falls below certain levels. For school year 1995-96, schools were reimbursed $1.795 for each free lunch, $1.395 for each reduced-price lunch, and 17.25 cents for each full-pay lunch. In addition, schools received 14.25 cents worth of commodity foods for each lunch served. These lunch program meal reimbursements and donated commodities help to sustain the food services provided by food authorities. However, in some areas, food authorities may incur meal costs that are below or above the lunch program\u2019s reimbursements because of food, labor, and other food service-related cost variations, thus creating surpluses or deficits in some food service budgets.", "USDA has developed a \u201clunch pattern\u201d for five different age and grade categories. (See app. II.) This pattern requires that a school lunch contain five food items chosen from the four basic food groups. The size of the portions varies by these categories; nevertheless each lunch, at a minimum, must contain (1) one serving of a meat or a meat alternate, (2) one serving of a bread or bread alternate, (3) one serving of milk, and (4) two servings of vegetables or fruits. Schools must offer all five food items unless, as provided by the lunch program\u2019s regulations, they use the \u201coffer versus serve\u201d option. Under this option, a school must offer all five food items, but a student may decline one or two of them. All high schools must use the \u201coffer versus serve\u201d option, and middle and elementary schools may use it at the discretion of local officials. According to a 1993 report prepared for USDA, 71 percent of elementary schools and 90 percent of middle schools used this option.", "Participating schools also agree to collect data on the number of meals served and are responsible for other tasks, such as verifying the income of families with students to determine whether the students are eligible for free or reduced-price lunches.", "According to the American School Food Service Association, school lunch preparation usually occurs at individual or centrally located school kitchens. These facilities are operated by the food authorities or, with their approval, by others, such as FSMCs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Food Service Management Companies", "paragraphs": ["In 1970, USDA issued regulations permitting food authorities to contract with FSMCs to operate their school food services. Food authorities may contract with FSMCs for many aspects of their school food service. The commercial organizations that typically contract with food authorities to operate food services include large national companies, such as Marriott, Canteen, and ARAMARK; companies operating regionally or at multiple sites in a state; and companies servicing a single school district.

Unlike FSMCs, these vendors usually do not manage schools\u2019 food service operations. Instead, they provide schools with a food product at a specified time. For example, a pizza vendor may agree to provide a school with fresh, hot pizza for lunch on every other Wednesday.", "Unless a fast-food vendor operates as an FSMC, USDA does not allow these vendors to sell directly to students at school. Instead, these vendors typically sell their food products to a school or its FSMC, which, in turn, sells the products to the students.

In response to this mandate, and as agreed with the offices of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry and the House Committees on Agriculture and on Economic and Educational Opportunities, we (1) determined the extent to which food authorities use FSMCs to operate their food services and the impacts that their use has had on various aspects of the lunch program, such as student participation, school food service employment, the generation of revenues through school meal sales, and a la carte sales of food in schools; (2) described the terms and conditions under which schools that participate in the lunch program use FSMCs; and (3) determined the extent to which schools that participate in the lunch program are provided with fast foods and snack foods in vending machines, described the most frequently used types and brands of fast foods commonly offered, and described their nutritional content.", "Because our preliminary work demonstrated that developing a nutritional profile of the hundreds of different food products available nationwide to students during school hours would be excessively costly, we discussed this issue with the offices of the cognizant committees. Given the technical complexities of the requirement and the limits on our resources and reporting time frame\u2014our mandate required us to complete our work by September 1, 1996\u2014we agreed with the cognizant committees to limit our work on the third objective to (1) presenting nutritional information for a sample of popular brand-name fast food products and (2) describing the types of vending machine foods commonly available in schools participating in the lunch program. As further agreed, we limited our review to the lunch program\u2014the largest of USDA\u2019s school meals programs.", "To address the first objective, we contacted each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia to obtain their school year 1994-95 lists of all food authorities, both public and private, and all food authorities using an FSMC. We then mailed questionnaires to 1,462 food authorities that states had identified as having contracts with FSMCs during the 1994-95 school year. In the course of our review, we identified 75 food authorities that were residential child care institutions, did not participate in the lunch program, or did not have contracts with FSMCs. We excluded these food authorities from the universe of 1,462 food authorities, thereby developing a universe of 1,387 food authorities. Eighty-five percent (1,175) of the remaining 1,387 food authorities returned a completed questionnaire. Hence, our survey results for this group represent only the 1,175 survey respondents that participated in the lunch program and had FSMC contracts during school year 1994-95.", "In addition, we mailed questionnaires to a national random sample of 934 of the food authorities that did not have contracts with FSMCs. Of those, 89 percent (835) of the food authorities returned completed questionnaires. However, 70 of the food authorities reported that they did not participate in the lunch program or did use an FSMC during school year 1994-95. These questionnaires were not included in our analysis. We used the responses from the remaining 765 questionnaires to compare food authorities that had FSMC contracts with those that did not. Our survey results represent the views of about 14,801 food authorities that do not have contracts with FSMCs.", "To address the second objective, we reviewed relevant federal regulations and USDA\u2019s guidance on contracting with FSMCs and collected and analyzed a random sample of 68 food service contracts to identify the selected terms and conditions of these contracts and reviewed relevant federal studies and evaluations of FSMC contracts. The results of our analyses of the 68 contracts can be generalized to about 1,212 of the food authorities participating in the lunch program that had contracts with FSMCs for their school lunch programs during school year 1994-95.", "With respect to the third objective, we mailed questionnaires to a national random sample of 2,450 public school cafeteria managers to obtain information on the extent of their use of brand-name fast foods and the availability of snack foods in vending machines in public schools. The results of this survey are presented in our report entitled School Lunch Program: Cafeteria Managers\u2019 Views on Food Wasted by Students (GAO/RCED-96-191, July 18, 1996). Of this sample, 1,887 cafeteria managers who participated in the lunch program returned a questionnaire. We summarized the data that the respondents provided us with to determine the extent to which brand-name fast foods were used in the lunch program and the types of snack foods sold to students a la carte from vending machines or by canteens during lunch. This information represents the views of cafeteria managers in about 80 percent of the public schools that participated in the lunch program nationwide.", "Three of our data collection strategies relied on statistical sampling, including the survey of food authorities not contracting with FSMCs, the selection of contracts between food authorities and FSMCs, and the survey of cafeteria managers. As with all sample surveys, our statistical estimates based on these data collection strategies contain sampling error\u2014the potential error that arises from not collecting data from all food authorities\u2014on all contracts or from cafeteria managers at all schools.", "We calculated the amount of sampling error for each estimate at the 95-percent confidence level.
