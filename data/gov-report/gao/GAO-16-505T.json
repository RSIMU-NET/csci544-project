We found that in the majority of the  109 significant rules that we reviewed, the rulemaking process was not as  transparent as it could be. For example, in 72 percent of these rules,  there was no explanation for why the rule was designated as significant,  thus triggering additional oversight required by Executive Order 12866.  We made two recommendations based on our review of the cost benefit  analyses included in selected rules. We recommended that (1) OMB work  with agencies to clearly communicate the reasons for designating a  regulation as a significant regulatory action, and explain its reason for any  changes to an agency\u2019s initial assessment of a regulation\u2019s significance;  and (2) OMB encourage agencies to clearly state in the preamble of  significant regulations the section of Executive Order 12866\u2019s definition of  a significant regulatory action that applies to the regulation.

Agencies used various methods to document OIRA\u2019s  reviews which generally met disclosure requirements. However, we  found that the transparency of this documentation could be improved. In  particular, there was uneven attribution of changes made during the OIRA  review period and differing interpretations regarding which changes were  \u201csubstantive\u201d and thus required documentation. Both of these issues had  been identified in our earlier work. We made four recommendations that  OMB provide guidance to agencies to improve transparency and  documentation of the OIRA review process, specifically that OIRA (1)  define what types of changes made as a result of the review process are  substantive and need to be publicly identified; (2) direct agencies to  clearly state in final rules whether they made substantive changes as a  result of OIRA reviews; (3) standardize how agencies label  documentation of these changes in public rulemaking dockets; and (4)  instruct agencies to clearly attribute those changes made at the  suggestion or recommendation of OIRA.

We made eight recommendations in  2003 targeting aspects of the OIRA review process that remained unclear  and where improvements could allow the public to better understand the  effects of OIRA\u2019s review, including that the Director of OMB:  1.  instruct agencies to document the changes made to rules submitted  for OIRA review in public rulemaking dockets and within a reasonable  time after the rules have been published;  2.  define the types of substantive changes made during the review  process that agencies should disclose;  3.  disclose the reasons for withdrawal of a rule from OIRA review;  4.  reexamine OIRA policy that only documents exchanged by agencies  with OIRA branch chiefs and above during the review process need to  be disclosed;  5.  differentiate in OIRA\u2019s database which rules were substantively  changed at OIRA\u2019s suggestion or recommendation and which were  changed in other ways and for other reasons;  6.  define transparency requirements to also include the informal review  period when OIRA says it can have its most important impact on  agencies\u2019 rules;  7.  encourage agencies to use best practice methods of documentation  that clearly describe changes; and  8.  disclose in OIRA\u2019s logs of meetings with outside parties which  regulatory action was being discussed and the affiliation of the  meeting participants.", "OMB staff disagreed with the first seven of these eight recommendations  but did implement the eighth."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Additional Opportunities Exist to Enhance Transparency and Congressional Oversight of Federal Regulations and the Rulemaking Process", "paragraphs": ["Improvements made to the transparency of the regulatory process benefit  the public and aid congressional oversight.

Given both the importance of  guidance and the concerns about its use, in 2007 OMB recognized the  need for good guidance practices. OMB established review processes for  the guidance documents with the broadest and most substantial impact.", "In 2015, we reviewed guidance development processes at four  departments\u2014Agriculture (USDA), Education (Education), Health and  Human Services (HHS), and Labor (DOL)\u2014and 25 of their components.  All four departments identified standard practices to follow when  developing guidance and addressed OMB\u2019s requirements for significant  guidance to varying degrees.

Retrospective analysis can help agencies evaluate how well existing  regulations work in practice and determine whether they should be  modified or repealed. In 2007, we found that agencies had conducted  more retrospective reviews of the costs and benefits of existing regulation  than was readily apparent, especially to the public. We made seven  recommendations to improve the effectiveness and transparency of  retrospective regulatory review. These included that OMB develop  guidance to regulatory agencies to consider or incorporate into their  policies, procedures, or agency guidance that govern regulatory review  activities the following elements:  1.  consideration of whether and how they will measure the performance  2.  prioritization of review activities based upon defined selection criteria;  3.  specific review factors to be applied to the conduct of agencies\u2019  analyses that include, but are not limited to, public input;  4.  minimum standards for documenting and reporting all completed  review results and, for reviews that included analysis, making the  analysis publicly available;  5.  mechanisms to assess their current means of communicating review  results to the public and identifying steps that could improve this  communication; and  6.  steps to promote sustained management attention and support to help  ensure progress in institutionalizing agency regulatory review  initiatives.", "We also recommended that OMB  7.  work with regulatory agencies to identify opportunities for Congress to  revise the timing and scope of existing regulatory review requirements  and/or consolidate existing requirements.", "In 2011 and 2012, the administration issued new directives to agencies  on how they should plan and conduct analyses of existing regulations that  addressed each of our seven recommendations.", "In a 2014 report on reexamining regulations, we found that agencies often  changed regulations in response to completed retrospective analyses, but  could improve the reporting of progress and strengthen links between  those analyses and the agencies\u2019 performance goals. We also  concluded that OMB could do more to enhance the transparency and  usefulness of the information provided to the public. Although we found  that agencies posted their retrospective review plans online, obtaining a  comprehensive picture of the agencies\u2019 progress was difficult because  results were spread across multiple web sites. In addition, consistently  providing links or citations to the supporting analyses and data, and  including more detail on the methodologies and key assumptions used to  estimate savings, would help Congress and the public to better  understand the basis for projected results. We made three  recommendations to OMB to (1) improve reporting on the outcomes of  retrospective regulatory reviews, (2) improve how these reviews can be  used to help agencies achieve their priority goals, and (3) ensure that  OIRA, as part of its oversight role, monitors the extent to which agencies  have implemented guidance on retrospective regulatory review  requirements and confirm that agencies have identified how they will  assess the performance of regulations in the future.

However, the APA and other  statutes permit exceptions to proposed rules to expedite rulemaking in  certain circumstances, such as for an emergency or other \u201cgood cause\u201d  or when issuing rules about an agency\u2019s organization or management. In  2012, we reviewed a generalizable random sample of 1,338 final rules  published over 8 years (from 2003 through 2010) to provide information  on the frequency, reasons for, and potential effects of agencies issuing  final rules without NPRMs. We found that agencies frequently used  available exceptions to issue final rules without prior NPRMs.", "We also found that agencies, though not required, often requested  comments on major final rules issued without an NPRM. However, they  did not always respond to the comments received. This is a missed  opportunity because we found that agencies often made changes to  improve the rules when they did respond to public comments. To better  balance the benefits of expedited rulemaking procedures with the benefits  of public comments, and to improve the quality and transparency of  rulemaking records, we recommended that OMB issue guidance to  encourage agencies to respond to comments on final major rules issued  without a prior notice of proposed rulemaking. OMB stated that it did not  believe it necessary to issue guidance at that time and has not, to date,  taken any action to implement our recommendation. We continue to  believe that the recommendation has merit and urge OMB to reconsider  its prior position.", "In summary, OIRA to date has implemented 9 of the 25 recommendations  we made to improve transparency and effectiveness of the Executive  Order review process and other aspects of federal rulemaking.
