These arrangements include transitional living programs, private residences, and other settings (see figure). Officials we spoke with in five selected states said transitional living programs typically involve private child welfare agencies that lease apartments or facilities for youth, either at a single site or scattered across a geographic area, and offer on-site case management and supports to help youth build independent living skills. For private residences, youth may choose where to live, such as a private or shared apartment. In these cases, youth are typically responsible for their own lease, and may receive minimal supervision compared to youth in transitional living programs. For other settings, states reported options such as college dorms and residential employment training programs. Nineteen states also reported allowing youth under 18 to live in supervised independent living settings in certain instances, such as when they are pregnant, parents, or attending college, although such placements are generally not eligible for federal funding.", "Factors that most states reported considering when placing youth in supervised independent living arrangements include the youth's life skills\u2014for example, their ability to budget finances and schedule medical appointments\u2014as well as their education and employment status. Officials in selected states also said they consider the availability of housing, which may be limited in certain localities due to a lack of affordable housing options or other factors, and the options available to youth with complex needs, such as those who are pregnant and parents.", "Officials in four selected states said they help prepare youth in extended foster care to live independently by providing targeted trainings and other supports, such as financial literacy training.

Data from the Administration for Children and  Families (ACF), within the Department of Health and Human Services  (HHS), show that nearly 102,000 of these children were youth nearing  adulthood (ages 14 and up). Our prior work and other research studies  have found that youth in foster care are likely to face challenges as they  transition to adulthood. For example, studies conducted in three  midwestern states found that youth transitioning to adulthood and out of  state foster care systems at age 18 had lower rates of high school  completion and enrollment in postsecondary education by age 19,  compared with the general population. These youth also experienced  physical or psychological trauma which may have affected their mental  health. Additionally, they faced housing instability and had higher rates of  other economic hardships compared with the general population.", "States may use federal funding to assist youth in foster care as they  transition to adulthood under title IV-E of the Social Security Act (title IV- E), which authorizes federal support for state foster care and adoption  assistance programs. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 (Fostering Connections Act) allowed  states to receive federal reimbursement under title IV-E for a portion of  the cost of extending foster care to certain youth beyond their 18th  birthday, up to age 21. Federal reimbursement under title IV-E is  generally limited to eligible youth removed from homes with very low  incomes, among other eligibility criteria. The Fostering Connections Act  also authorized federal reimbursement to support youth in foster care  ages 18 up to 21 who are placed in a supervised setting in which the  youth is living independently. States generally have discretion to  determine the types of settings that meet this requirement. Such settings  may include independent living arrangements, such as the youth\u2019s own  apartment, with monthly check-ins with a case worker, referred to as  supervised independent living arrangements. The amendments made by  the Fostering Connections Act do not preclude states from placing youth  under age 18 in supervised independent living arrangements. However,  states generally may not seek federal reimbursement for placing youth  under 18 in these settings. In addition, the John H. Chafee Foster Care  Program for Successful Transition to Adulthood (Chafee Program)  provides funding to states for independent living services, such as  mentoring, educational assistance, and vocational training, to support  older youth in foster care and youth who have recently left foster care.  Despite these efforts to increase supports for youth in foster care  transitioning to adulthood, little is known about the living arrangements  offered to youth ages 18 to 21 in states where extended care is offered  (extended-care states), especially how states have set up supervised  independent living arrangements, and the types of services that assist  these youth.", "You asked us to explore the types of independent living arrangements  and services available to older youth.

Additionally, officials in New York and California said in  certain localities, there may be constraints offering certain supervised  independent living settings due to a lack of affordable housing. For  example, officials in one San Francisco area county said some youth who  want to live independently choose to move to a different part of the state,  or even out of state, because their stipend for a private residence is  insufficient to afford an apartment there. Officials in all selected states  also said that there are shortages of foster parents willing to provide care  for youth ages 18 to 21, which can generally affect their options for living  arrangements.", "State and local officials from all five selected states also cited challenges  finding housing options that are equipped to serve certain subpopulations  of youth with complex needs, such as youth with acute mental health  needs, youth that are also involved in the juvenile justice system, and  pregnant and parenting youth. For example, local and private agency  officials said state child welfare agencies may require parenting youth in  supervised independent living settings to be in larger apartments, which  may be too costly to afford. In addition, officials in four selected states  said private agencies may be less likely to accept youth with acute mental  health conditions or youth involved in the juvenile justice system if the  agencies do not have the resources to address their needs.", "In addition to these considerations, officials we spoke with in all five  selected states and other stakeholders said they consider the importance  of giving youth in extended care greater involvement in decision making  as they become adults. Local officials in California said they believe in  allowing youth to take risks and experience the challenges of living  independently while they have support from the child welfare system.  Similarly, local officials in Tennessee said that giving youth choices in  their living arrangements and considering their needs and goals is  important for keeping them engaged in extended care."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most States Reported Using Title IV-E Funding for Supervised Independent Living Arrangements but Several had Low Title IV-E Eligibility Rates for Youth in Extended Care", "paragraphs": ["Most (24 of 26) extended-care states we surveyed reported using title IV- E funds to support youth in supervised independent living arrangements.  Most (19 of 26) states also reported using Chafee Program funds, which  primarily support independent living services, to fund supervised  independent living arrangements. For example, state officials in  Tennessee said that in certain situations when youth need to secure an  apartment quickly, officials may use Chafee Program funds to help with  the deposit. Officials in Illinois told us that they also use some Chafee  Program funds for room and board, particularly for youth who are not title  IV-E eligible.", "In addition to title IV-E and Chafee Program funds, most states reported  using a combination of sources, including other federal funds such as  those available under title IV-B of the Social Security Act, as well as state  and local funds, to pay for supervised independent living arrangements.  All states reported using state funds for supervised independent living  (see fig. 3).", "Although most states reported using title IV-E funds to support supervised  independent arrangements, in several states, few youth in extended care  (regardless of their living arrangement) were eligible for title IV-E  funding. In 14 of the 17 extended-care states for which we calculated  eligibility rates, we found that the majority of youth ages 18 to 21 in care  were not eligible for title IV-E reimbursement in state fiscal year 2017,  meaning that the state was responsible for most or all of the cost of their  care. We found that six of the states had title IV-E eligibility rates of 30  percent or lower. Two states, Virginia and Hawaii, had eligibility rates of  over 70 percent (see fig. 4).", "State officials we spoke with in three of the five selected states said that  ineligibility frequently stems from family income exceeding the income  limit for title IV-E funding. Specifically, title IV-E is limited to youth  removed from homes that would have qualified for cash assistance under  the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program as of July  16, 1996. To receive title IV-E funding, youth must have met eligibility  requirements at the time they were initially removed from their home, or at  the time of their voluntary placement agreement. ACF has reported that  fewer families meet the AFDC income standards over time, thereby  reducing the number of all youth who are eligible for title IV-E funding,  regardless of their age. In 2018, we reported on declining title IV-E  eligibility rates for the entire population of youth in foster care.", "Officials we spoke with in Illinois and Tennessee said they reconsider a  youth\u2019s title IV-E eligibility once the youth turns 18, using the youth\u2019s  income at that point in time. Officials from these two states told us they  close the original foster care case when a young person turns 18 and  then reopen the case when the young person re-enters extended care.  Using this approach, officials said they can base the title IV-E eligibility  determination on the youth\u2019s income at the time of re-entry into the foster  care system, rather than the income of the home from which the youth  was removed upon initially entering foster care. Illinois officials said this  process helped increase the eligibility of their extended-care population  by more than 30 percent since 2012. Officials we spoke with in the  remaining three selected states said they do not use this approach.", "ACF officials said that states can choose to close and re-open cases for  youth in extended care, which would allow new eligibility determinations  based on a youth\u2019s income. However, ACF officials said they do not  monitor states\u2019 choices in this area, or how states\u2019 choices affect their title  IV-E eligibility rate. Officials said they focus on helping states identify  options and provide examples in ACF program instructions so states can  determine what works best with their own policies and procedures.", "Four states (Arkansas, Indiana, Maryland, and Massachusetts) reported  in our survey not claiming title IV-E reimbursements for any youth in  extended care in state fiscal year 2017. Officials in two states, Indiana  and Maryland, reported not claiming title IV-E funds for youth in extended  care at least in part because they use a title IV-E waiver. However,  according to ACF, states can claim title IV-E reimbursements for youth  over 18 in addition to their waiver funds, so these two states may be able  to claim additional title IV-E funds for their extended care population.  State officials in Arkansas told us they have not yet established the  proper procedures, internal controls, and monitoring mechanisms to allow  them to claim title IV-E funds for youth in extended care. Officials said  they do not have systems to track when youth may have lost their jobs or  dropped out of school, which could affect the youth\u2019s eligibility for  extended care."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected States Reported Offering a Range of Training and Other Supports to Prepare Youth in Extended Care to Live Independently", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Youth in Extended Care May Receive Targeted Assistance in Selected States, As Well As Training and Other Supports Offered to All Older Youth in Care", "paragraphs": ["To help youth develop independent living skills and successfully transition  out of care, state and local officials in four of the five selected states  reported offering targeted training and support for youth ages 18 to 21.

For example, officials from  one county in Maryland told us that all youth in foster care are  automatically enrolled in a supervised independent living case  management track when they turn 18. This case management system is  intended to identify a youth\u2019s areas of need and design a plan to prepare  them for living independently, regardless of their current living  arrangement.", "Youth in extended care can also participate in independent living services  that are offered more broadly to all older youth in foster care. Officials in  all five selected states reported offering services that support youth in  extended care in their housing, education, financial literacy, and  employment goals, as well as offering health education, mentoring, and  training on daily living skills (e.g., grocery shopping and budgeting).  Examples of types of services the selected states reported offering to all  older youth include:", "Housing. Officials from Youth Villages described how their  organization assists youth in Tennessee to learn to find and maintain  stable housing.

Officials at a private agency in Illinois told us the youth in  their housing programs have a set schedule to participate in different  life skills activities, such as cooking, doing laundry, and other chores.", "Although officials in all five selected states said they offer a variety of  training and supports to help youth in extended care develop independent  living skills, officials in these states also said that youth may experience  challenges using these skills. For example, officials said youth in private  residences may have difficulty covering their living expenses, which can  lead to evictions. A New York county official said some youth living on  their own may struggle with the lack of structure and the amount of  independence in making their own decisions and setting their schedule.
