This included failure to inventory items used to issue visas, review visa decisions, and follow State's procedures when issuing visas for applicants referred by officers within the post. Lack of full compliance with internal controls increases vulnerability to visa malfeasance. State recently established two headquarters entities to monitor post visa operations. While stronger oversight should help strengthen compliance with internal controls, State has not developed automated software to sort and analyze abnormalities in visa issuances that could indicate potential malfeasance. The Bureau of Diplomatic Security substantiated 28 visa malfeasance cases between 2001 and 2004 involving U.S. employees. The suspects were fired, chose to resign, or were arrested. State investigators could not tell us how many opened cases were referred to Justice for possible prosecution because they had not been routinely collecting that information. In fact, their case records did not permit investigators to identify malfeasance trends or consular managers to identify internal control weaknesses needing attention. Justice's Public Integrity Section successfully prosecuted 10 U.S. government employees. State Diplomatic Security and Justice officials noted that their investigations and prosecutions were impeded by constraints on evidence gathering. Additionally, investigators can not obtain U.S. search warrants to search consular officer's offices or residences overseas.

According to State\u2019s  criminal investigators, some applicants offer bribes to U.S. government  employees in an attempt to obtain visas. The integrity of U.S. government  employees and controls over the visa process are pivotal to preventing visa  malfeasance. Visa officers are professional employees who undergo  extensive background checks, have top secret security clearances, and  receive training and guidance in visa procedures and ethical conduct.  However, some cases of visa malfeasance have occurred involving consular  officers and other U.S. government officials. For example, in 2004, two  consular officers were convicted and sentenced for selling visas for  hundreds of thousands of dollars between 2000 and 2003. In this case,  State\u2019s Bureau of Consular Affairs determined that the malfeasance  occurred in part because of breaches in internal control procedures.

To conduct our review, we  analyzed key internal controls over the visa process identified by State. We  visited posts in six countries: Mexico, Ecuador, Peru, Vietnam, Thailand,  and India. We observed visa adjudications and assessed post adherence to  those internal controls. We also obtained statistics on cases of visa  malfeasance and the investigative outcomes. Additionally, we discussed the  investigative process with State\u2019s Bureau of Diplomatic Security and the  Office of the Inspector General. At Justice, we discussed general factors  affecting Justice\u2019s decisions to prosecute cases and obtained data on the  results of some prosecuted cases.

Each post must designate a primary and backup  accountable consular officer to be responsible for controlled items.  Further, Consular Affairs procedures require controlled items to be  reconciled daily, verified quarterly, and certified annually by senior  consular or post officials.

According to a 2005 State Inspector  General\u2019s report, embassy staff or prominent local figures often appeal to  ambassadors or other mission managers for favorable consideration in  obtaining visas, and consular officers have felt pressure to provide such  assistance. To ensure that post staff refer visas only for qualified  applicants, Consular Affairs has strengthened and formalized its criteria for  issuing referred visas. Prior to 2002, posts individually interpreted the  guidelines on making referrals and many posts did not have formal referral  policies. In 2002, Consular Affairs required posts to establish a formal  postwide referral system. Under this system, referral procedures are to be  reissued annually, and supervisory consular officers are to periodically  review referral activities, specifically noting frequency of referrals by  officer as well as applicant return-to-country rates. Consistent with the new  congressionally mandated biometric and interview requirements, the new  referral criteria require   fingerprinting and photos of all applicants and personal interviews of  nearly all referred visa applicants,  mandatory use of revised referral forms,   certification that the applicant is personally known to the sponsor and  presents no threat to national security,   supervisory approval of the referral request by the sponsor\u2019s supervisor,   scanning of applicant forms and referral requests into the nonimmigrant  visa system to provide a record and an audit trail, and   post management reviews of aggregate visa trends by referrer.", "Since 2002, Consular Affairs has repeatedly reiterated referral criteria in  policy updates and clarifications to overseas posts.

VAU, established in 2003, attempts to detect and prevent  possible employee malfeasance by analyzing consular data from State\u2019s  Consular Consolidated Database.

In some of  these cases, it appeared that the lack of adherence to internal controls  could have played a role in allowing employee malfeasance to go  undetected for a considerable period of time. Consular officials indicated  that strict compliance to internal controls could not prevent malfeasance.  However, they acknowledged that lack of strict compliance could create an  environment that would make it easier to commit malfeasance. The  following are examples of visa malfeasance or alleged visa malfeasance  and how lack of strict compliance with internal controls may have been a  contributing factor in creating an environment where the malfeasance  could take place.", "Consular Affairs requires supervisors to review reports on visa refusals  and issuances to detect anomalous activity. Between 2000 and 2003,  two consular employees at one post sold visas to unqualified applicants.  Diplomatic Security said it did not know how many visas were sold.  However, 181 visas were revoked after the malfeasance was discovered.  Diplomatic Security believes that many of the persons with revoked  visas had already entered the country. We believe that strict compliance  with internal controls could have identified this malfeasance earlier.  Applicants for nonimmigrant visas generally apply at an embassy or  consulate with jurisdiction over their place of normal residence,  although they are not required to do so. However, in this case, there  were a large number of third country nationals receiving visas from the  same officer. Supervisory review of the issuances to the third country  nationals or review of a standard report on visa issuances could have  alerted management to this unusual activity. The consular officer ceased  the illegal activity following a supervisory reprimand but soon was able  to resume selling visas. The convicted employees received a 63-month  sentence and forfeited $750,000 in illicit gains.", "Consular managers are required to continually oversee visa functions  and suspicions of malfeasance must be examined carefully. Between  2000 and 2002 a senior consular officer at a small post accepted  fraudulent applications and documents from a visa broker, issued them  outside the normal process, and returned visas to the broker. After a  supervisory reprimand, the officer revised the fraud scheme and  conspired with the broker to approve visas for applicants with false  passports. The officer received money for processing 85 visas, was  convicted, and received a 24-month sentence.", "During the course of our work, State reported another case of visa  malfeasance where we believe that lack of strict compliance with internal  controls could have been a contributing factor. State requires consular and  post management to periodically review referral activities and check on the  return rates of applicants receiving a visa. Between 1999 and 2001, a State  political officer at a small post allegedly referred unqualified applicants for  visas, according to a State press release issued in April 2005. In the absence  of the senior consular officer, the political officer was also responsible for  visa adjudications and allegedly provided blank visa applications to an  individual, assisted in filling them out, and then issued them to unqualified  applicants. In return for these services the officer allegedly received a  vintage BMW motorcycle. The officer was arrested in 2005.", "Consular Affairs emphasized that although some of its officers have  engaged in visa malfeasance, other U.S. government employees and  Foreign Service nationals have as well. Between 2000 and 2001, a U.S.- based Foreign Agricultural Service officer recommended 99 unqualified  applicants and was able to influence the visa process through his  recommendations and the submission of fraudulent documents, according  to court documents. In exchange, the officer received bribes totaling  $77,400. The officer, who was given the names of ineligible applicants by  visa brokers, provided the applicants, on U.S. Department of Agriculture  letterhead, letters stating that the individuals were agricultural specialists  invited to the United States for official meetings. The officer then sent  follow-up faxes to posts confirming the invitations. The individuals, who all  listed the same destination address, presented the letters at embassy visa  offices and unlawfully obtained visas. The officer was sentenced to 21  months in prison for participating in the visa malfeasance scheme."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Factors Affecting Visa Malfeasance Investigations", "paragraphs": ["Visa malfeasance investigations are impeded by several factors, according  to Diplomatic Security officials, including untimely reporting of alleged  visa malfeasance. The ability to gather evidence is adversely affected, for  example, when allegations are made several years after the alleged  malfeasance occurred and witnesses have been reassigned, or are  unavailable. In particular, entry-level officers, fearing reprisal, may delay  reporting malfeasance until after they have been reassigned to a new post,  according to State officials. In such cases, reconstructing the actions  constituting any malfeasance is difficult because years may have passed  since the incident occurred.", "When visa malfeasance occurs overseas, differences in legal systems can  pose obstacles to investigators. Local laws may not permit the use of U.S.  investigative techniques such as recorded conversations, undercover  operations, or interrogation of suspects, according to Diplomatic Security  officials. Additionally, according to Diplomatic Security investigators,  investigations of local employees may be complicated due to differences in  U.S. and foreign laws. According to Diplomatic Security officials, bribery is  not a criminal offense in some countries and therefore it is difficult and  sometimes impossible to obtain local warrants for searches in these  countries.", "Conflicting priorities may also impede evidence gathering. For example, at  one post, the Diplomatic Security investigator noted that he had to  concentrate on ensuring the security of the post and was not able to devote  adequate attention to investigating a recent allegation of visa  malfeasance. Diplomatic Security officials confirmed that protecting  personnel and infrastructure is the first priority of post security officers.  Additionally, when malfeasance is suspected, Consular Affairs\u2019 and  Diplomatic Security\u2019s differing objectives may affect evidence gathering.  Diplomatic Security officials abroad and in headquarters, as well as Justice  officials, all noted that documenting the illegal activity and gathering a  sufficient amount of evidence to make a criminal case often requires  allowing the suspect to continue working, unaware of the investigation.  Consular Affairs noted that when this occurs, consular management  closely reviews the suspect\u2019s adjudications and monitors his or her  activities to prevent issuances to ineligible applicants. However, Consular  Affairs management interviewed on this issue expressed a preference for  removing suspected individuals from their positions as quickly as possible.  At one post, the ambassador, at the recommendation of the senior consular  officer, took action to remove an employee under investigation in order to  stop even the possibility that a visa could be issued to an ineligible  applicant, thereby ending the covert investigation. As a result, a criminal  case could not be developed, and the employee was dealt with  administratively and was fired."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Malfeasance Prosecutions Face Impediments", "paragraphs": ["Justice\u2019s efforts to prosecute malfeasance are limited by a range of factors,  including the inability to use U.S. warrants to search U.S. employees\u2019  offices and residences overseas, according to Justice. U.S. magistrates  generally cannot issue warrants for overseas searches. Further, Justice  officials noted that they only accept for prosecution cases with sufficient  evidence to warrant convictions.", "Under Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedures, U.S.  magistrates do not have the authority to issue search warrants for locations  outside their districts, such as an embassy or residence overseas.  According to Diplomatic Security officials, the ability to obtain U.S. search  warrants, rather than relying on local warrants issued and executed by the  host government, is important since investigations of visa malfeasance  generally focus on embassy property or diplomatic residences. The U.S.  mission and the residences of certain U.S. diplomats in country are  inviolable, which means that agents of the host government may not enter  the premises without the consent of the head of the mission, according to  State officials. State officials also told us that the United States will never  waive inviolability for the U.S. mission, and, therefore, investigators could  not rely on a host country\u2019s warrant to search an employee\u2019s office at the  U.S. mission. However, in certain instances, State officials said that they  would waive inviolability for the personal residences of U.S. diplomats,  located outside the U.S. mission.", "In instances where inviolability is waived, the United States can use current  tools, such as letter rogatories and Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties, to  request that a host government issue and execute a search warrant under  the host government\u2019s laws. Nonetheless, Diplomatic Security officials  cited many difficulties they say can arise when using these tools. For  example, according to these officials, differences between the United  States\u2019 and some host government\u2019s techniques in gathering evidence can  affect the admissibility of that evidence in U.S. courts. As a result of these  and other difficulties, diplomatic security officials told us that they do not  often utilize these tools to obtain local search warrants.", "In discussing with State and Diplomatic Security officials the possibility of  obtaining additional search authorities under U.S. law, these officials raised  issues regarding the magnitude of the need, as well as concerns over  sovereignty and reciprocity. For example, Diplomatic Security officials  indicated that in approximately six cases in the past year they would have  wanted to conduct searches of employee residences and offices in  connection with suspected visa malfeasance. State officials raised  concerns that should the United States execute U.S. search warrants  overseas, host governments could view this as a challenge to their  sovereignty. Further, if the United States were to execute U.S. warrants  overseas, the question arises whether the United States would have to  extend the same privilege to foreign governments to execute their own  warrants here in the United States."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["A visa system that is beyond reproach, with strong internal controls to  protect against consular malfeasance, is critical to ensuring the integrity of  visa decisions, national security, and U.S. immigration objectives. There is  no way to prevent applicants from offering bribes; therefore, State  recognizes that along with the integrity of its employees, an effective  internal control program is needed to guard against employee malfeasance.  Established internal controls make it more difficult for an employee to  commit visa malfeasance. State has established a system of internal  controls. However, at the posts we visited, we found that compliance with  some of these internal controls was inconsistent. This increases the risk of  visa malfeasance. Furthermore, most consular staff we spoke with did not  know the appropriate way to report suspicions of employee visa  malfeasance, which could hinder investigations. A further weakness to  investigations is the lack of data on allegations and investigations to  identify vulnerable points in the visa process. Finally, U.S. investigators  cannot obtain a U.S. search warrant to search the offices or residences  overseas of employees, which, according to Justice and Diplomatic  Security officials, affects their ability to gather evidence in malfeasance  cases.

This  could be accomplished by (1) improving the software available to the  Vulnerability Assessment Unit to automatically sort data to identify and  analyze abnormalities in post visa issuance statistics that could be an  indication of malfeasance and (2) enhancing the investigative case  tracking systems used by the Bureau of Diplomatic Security in order to  better identify trends and vulnerabilities in the visa process for use by  investigators and consular managers.", "We also recommend that the Secretary of State and the Attorney General  determine whether seeking additional overseas search authorities is  warranted to facilitate investigations of visa malfeasance.

Specifically, the department said it will review and  approve post referral policies, and it has established an ombudsman to  ensure that there is no undue influence on consular officers to issue visas.  To monitor compliance with internal controls, the department plans to  establish an automated control system for controlled items, field test an  automated data mining system of consular activities, and launch a  worldwide fraud case tracking system in 2006. Lastly, the department said  it will work with the Attorney General to determine if additional authority  for overseas searches of employees\u2019 residences and offices is warranted  and, if so, how it could best be achieved.

When available, we also  interviewed consuls general and ambassadors.", "To assess the internal controls designed to prevent the illegal provision of  visas, we asked State to identify the policies, procedures, and key internal  controls governing visa operations. State identified a number of key  internal controls, and, in particular, identified the Consular Management  Handbook (Chapter 600), their Standard Operating Procedures, and the  relevant sections of the Foreign Affairs Manual as sources for these  controls. We obtained and examined the Department of State\u2019s Consular  Management Handbook, Standard Operating Procedures, key sections of  the Foreign Affairs Manual, and documents related to how the department  develops and enforces standards of conduct for visa adjudication officers  from the department\u2019s Bureau of Consular Affairs. To determine if  supervisors were reviewing records of visa issuances, we reviewed on line  reports at posts and at the Vulnerability Assessment Unit (VAU).

These posts are Nogales,  Guadalajara, and Mexico City, Mexico; Quito and Guayaquil, Ecuador;  Lima, Peru; Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi, Vietnam; Bangkok and Chiang  Mai, Thailand; and Mumbai, India. To select the posts to visit, we reviewed  overall post staffing data and issuance rates and selected posts that had  both large and small staffing levels with varied experience. Selected posts  performed a varying amount of adjudications, and some had regional  responsibilities for fraud detection and investigations. Some posts had also  undergone internal reviews and permitted examination of external  oversight functions. Lastly, some posts selected had been the subject of  fraud allegations, enabling the review of investigative procedures. Our  reported results apply to the posts we visited, and we cannot generalize the  results to posts not visited.", "To assess the nature and extent of malfeasance, we examined records  provided by State\u2019s Bureau of Diplomatic Security on investigations of visa  malfeasance involving employees between 2001 and 2004. We reviewed 140  cases collected by Diplomatic Security covering alleged visa malfeasance  involving employees over the last 4 years. The cases reviewed represented  2004, 2003, and 2002, as well as prominent, but not all cases from 2001. The  reports included information on the types of employees being investigated  for visa malfeasance, such as U.S. Foreign Service officers, and employees  of other U.S. government agencies overseas and locally hired staff.  Diplomatic Security does not maintain automated data on employee  malfeasance, and it obtained these reports for us by reviewing its files on  all types of visa fraud and identifying those where employee malfeasance  was involved. While Diplomatic Security reported that it made its best  efforts to obtain complete data from 2002 through 2004, it could not assure  us that it had identified every case that had been opened and involved  employee malfeasance. These data covered 2001 to 2004 because this was  the most recent information available. However, there were a number of  limitations in these data. For example, the information available did not  include a comprehensive set of allegations, nor completely describe the  nature of the fraudulent activity under investigation. We determined that  these data were sufficiently reliable to provide details on approximate  figures of the employee malfeasance cases that were opened, as well as  details about the types of cases. We also obtained information from the  Department of Justice on visa fraud prosecutions by the Public Integrity  Section conducted between January 2001 and March 2005. These data  allowed us to determine how many cases this office in Justice has pursued  in the last 4 years, as well as the status or outcome of those cases.  Additionally, we interviewed officials from State\u2019s Office of the Inspector  General, Consular Affairs\u2019 Office of Fraud Prevention, and its VAU.
