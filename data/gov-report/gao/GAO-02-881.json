Most of the money collected is to be spent on training that improves the skills of U.S. workers. Fifty-five percent of the funds are provided to the Department of Labor for technical skill grants to increase the supply of skilled workers in occupations identified as needing more workers. Labor awards the skill grants to local workforce investment boards, created under WIA to establish local workforce development policies, thereby linking the skill grant program with the workforce system. The boards use the funds to provide training to employed and unemployed people. The National Science Foundation (NSF) receives 22 percent of the funds to distribute as scholarship grants to post-secondary schools that distribute the funds as scholarships for low-income students in computer science, engineering, and mathematics degree programs. As of July 1, 2002, about $197 million has been awarded through the skill grant program; as of May 1, 2002, about $72 million has been awarded through the scholarship grant program.", "Because of your interest in how the United States is meeting the employers\u2019 demand for high-skilled workers, you asked about the skill grant and scholarship grant programs and how they relate to other high- skill workforce development practices. Specifically, we address (1) how the skill grant and scholarship grant programs are being administered to raise the skill level of American workers; (2) whether the skill grant and scholarship training is based on workforce needs and specific jobs that H-1B visa holders fill, particularly in the information technology (IT) industry; and (3) to what extent these programs are coordinated with other workforce development programs at the local and national level to meet high-skill training needs.", "In response to your questions, we surveyed the 43 recipients of skill grants distributed in 2000; visited 12 of these grantees and interviewed the local workforce investment board\u2019s staff, and, at most grantees, the training providers, employers, and participants; visited 6 colleges that received scholarship grants; analyzed data on the participants and outcomes for the scholarship grants; and discussed these programs and other high-skill training with officials from the Departments of Labor and Commerce, NSF, and Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), and industry representatives. Our work was conducted in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards between October 2001 and July 2002. See appendix I for a full discussion of our scope and methodology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, Congress passed legislation that modified the visa program for foreign workers who enter the country with H-1B visas to work in specialty occupations. Changes have included expanding the limits on the number of workers who may be approved for these visas from 65,000 to 195,000, providing Labor with additional enforcement authority, and establishing an employer fee to fund training of American workers. The American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-277) authorized programs to provide technical skills training and scholarships for low-income postsecondary students pursuing high technology fields of study. To fund these programs, it assessed a $500 fee on employers for each person for whom they submitted an application for an H-1B visa. In 2000, the H-1B visa application fee for employers was raised to $1,000. Also, the American Competitiveness in the Twenty-First Century Act (P.L 106-313) clarified some guidelines for administering the skill grant program and included Commerce as a consultant to the skill grant distribution process. The fee for employers who apply for H-1B visa workers, which funds the skill grants and scholarship grants, expires on September 30, 2003. Currently, 55 percent of the fees collected are distributed to Labor for skill grants and 22 percent are distributed to NSF for scholarship grants. The remaining 23 percent of the funds is to be used for other activities. The 2003 Labor budget proposed redirecting the skill grant funding beginning in fiscal year 2003 to reducing the backlog of applications submitted on behalf of foreign workers for permanent residency.", "In 1998, Congress also passed WIA, which replaced the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) and introduced various reforms to the coordination and delivery of federal employment and training services. WIA seeks to create a workforce investment system that connects employment, education, and training services to better match workers to labor market needs. WIA specifies separate funding sources for each of the act\u2019s main client groups  adults, dislocated workers, and youth. The American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act of 1998 linked the H-1B skill grants to federally funded employment and training services administered by Labor by requiring that the grants be awarded to private industry councils, workforce investment boards or regional consortia of these boards.", "Labor is responsible for administering and overseeing the H-1B grant program on a national level, which includes compiling and collecting reports, maintaining an H-1B skill grants website, and providing technical assistance. Labor\u2019s regional offices assign one staff person to each grantee within the region to serve as the front-line contact and monitor of the grantees.", "Through its Office of Policy and Research, Labor has awarded 43 skill grants totaling about $96 million distributed in three separate rounds in February 2000, July 2000, and October 2000, and an additional 24 grants totaling about $67 million were distributed in a rolling award process beginning in December 2001. Workforce investment boards or regional consortia of these can receive skill grants. For each application, a local workforce investment board must indicate that the project is consistent with, and will be coordinated with, the region\u2019s workforce investment efforts. The 2000 law allotted 25 percent of the skill grants to business- related consortia; a first round was awarded in May 2002 to 14 grantees, totaling about $34 million. Labor convenes panels to review grant applications and recommends grantees for selection on the basis of specific criteria, such as target population, service delivery, and ability to meet labor market needs.", "Grantees have been required to submit a quarterly financial report and a quarterly narrative progress report. While Labor did not require a standard format for the narrative progress report until the quarter ending September 30, 2002, some grantees used a template developed by Labor that included numbers for the following: individuals continuing to be served from any quarter, individuals served during the quarter, individuals served since the beginning of the project, individuals newly enrolled, and individuals who exited without completion. Labor limited the amount of money grantees\u2019 could spend on administrative costs to 10 percent of the funding and set the grant period at up to 2 years, although some grantees have received 1 year extensions at no additional cost. Grantees are required to obtain matching funds from other parties; the amount they have been required to obtain ranged from 25 percent to 50 percent of the grant, depending on the round in which they received their grant. Business consortia grantees are required to obtain matching funds of 100 percent of the grant they receive.", "The 2000 law provided specific guidance about the types of training that should be provided under the skill grants, which was absent from the 1998 law. It said that the training is not limited to skill levels commensurate with a 4-year undergraduate degree, but should include the preparation of workers for a broad range of positions along a career ladder. It also required that at least 80 percent of the grants be awarded to programs and projects that train employed and unemployed workers in skills in high technology, information technology, and biotechnology. The 1998 law did not elaborate on the nature of the training authorized and did not mention any particular occupations.", "NSF provides scholarship grants to schools that grant associate, baccalaureate, or graduate degrees. The schools are selected by panels that review applications from postsecondary schools. Students must be majoring in computer science, engineering, or math; must be enrolled in classes full-time; must demonstrate financial need; and must demonstrate academic potential and ability. Initially, only students who were eligible for Pell grants could be eligible for scholarships, but NSF later relaxed this requirement to include students who were eligible for any federal financial aid. Each student receives up to $3,125 per year for up to 4 years. As of May 2002, 277 schools have obtained grants ranging from $24,750 to $760,320 in a series of three rounds of grant awards totaling about $72 million. Schools may ask for an additional 5 percent of the total requested scholarship amount for administrative costs, an increase from the original 2 percent for the first set of grants awarded.

The grant training, which can be used to prepare workers for a range of occupations, can be offered to employed and unemployed individuals in a variety of settings. However, in the scholarship grant program, the postsecondary schools receiving grants provide scholarships toward undergraduate and graduate postsecondary education, with a goal of attracting and retaining low-income students in computer science, engineering, and mathematics degree programs.

For the first three rounds in which skill grants were awarded, workforce investment boards or private industry councils were required to submit grant proposals to Labor; however various partners initiated or implemented the skill grant training program to best meet local workforce needs. Other partners may include employers, unions, for-profit and not-for-profit training institutions, community colleges, public and private 4-year colleges, and other organizations such as business trade or industry associations or community and faith-based organizations. The following sites that we visited exemplify the variety of partner configurations and service delivery options.", "At several sites in various states, the grantee implemented the skill grant using local government, nonprofit or community based organizations that were also administering WIA programs. The skill grant funds were awarded either to employers to train current workers or individuals to upgrade their skill set. For example, one offered businesses grants of up to $50,000 to train their employees in information technology, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, or precision manufacturing; another offered funds for IT training and targeted employed workers as well as dislocated (laid-off) workers, low-income people, and high school students. The local boards advertised the availability of training through standard advertising channels such as flyers, newspapers, and the one- stop centers. The training providers were chosen by the employer or the individuals participating in the programs.", "At a site in California, a major health care provider with thousands of employees partnered with the local board, the union, and training providers to address specific skill shortages within its company. Similarly, at a site in Massachusetts, unions at two manufacturing plants partnered with the local board, training providers, and the employers. For both grants, training was available primarily to company employees. In this arrangement, the local workforce boards were not heavily involved in the operation of the training program, but did connect the grant to the local workforce system. Employers and unions implemented the skill grants in the regions covered by the employers instead of limiting participation to only workers in the area served by the board.", "At a site in D.C., a college initiated and implemented the skill grant, while the local board advised the college and established networks to other partners. The college sought out employers who wanted their underemployed workers to receive IT training. It also marketed the training directly to unemployed individuals. All training occurred at the college administrating the grant.", "At one site in California, the local board partnered with four training providers to offer different IT curriculums to both employed individuals and dislocated workers. The training partners and the board were responsible for recruiting participants for the program.", "The skill grant training programs vary in length and by type of provider; different approaches are taken to respond to employers and trainees\u2019 needs. Training programs at sites we visited were as short as a 1-day course on new software taught through a for-profit training provider and as long as a 2-year college curriculum at a technical college. A grantee has the flexibility to provide different training at different sites. For example, one grantee ran four different IT training programs, each with a different time frame: one on weekends for 9 months at a community college; one summerlong program on weekdays at a community college; one full time for 10 months at a nonprofit training provider; and one with various schedules offered through a major state university continuing education program.", "Depending on the partners and service delivery option for the skill grant, the training can take place in a variety of locations, such as on-site at a company or at a training facility. At one skill grant location, a local community college offered math, electronics, and other courses at the workplace after the close of the workday. Employees could earn an associate degree in computer and telecommunications technology at a convenient location, while upgrading their skills for their employer.", "The skill grant program\u2019s flexibility allows grantees to adjust the content of their training in response to changes in local labor market demands or events. The grant administrators at one site providing training in both health care and IT increased the number of health care training participants and decreased the number of IT training participants in response to changing employer demand for workers. Similarly, a local board that partnered with two large employers to train current workers amended their grant to include training for dislocated workers when one employer had a major lay-off. Participants who had been laid off could continue in the training program.", "Despite the flexibility of the skill grant program, many of the skill grantees experienced challenges during the start-up phase of the grant. On average, grantees took about 4 months from the time the grants were awarded until the programs were operational and began serving individuals. For two, forming new partnerships with employers and training providers took longer than anticipated. For others, the economic downturn that began in 2001 altered their ability to participate. For a few grantees, these obstacles delayed their program start-up 9 months or longer. As a result, several grantees asked or planned to ask for a no-cost extension of up to 1 year beyond the original 2-year grant period.", "Between December 2001 and July 2002, Labor has awarded an additional 38 grants, including 14 awards under the 25 percent allotment reserved for business or business-related consortia. Based on information in the summaries of the funded projects, some of the regional consortia are led by large nationwide corporations such as MetLife, Inc., or General Motors Corporation, while other programs are led by community colleges, or in one case, an organization working to enhance opportunities for the Latino population. Many of the projects cover geographic areas larger than the areas served through a single local workforce board. For example, one project led by a national employer will serve participants in five states: Alabama, Indiana, Michigan, New York, and Ohio. Other projects will serve participants in a broad area of one state or a few selected major metropolitan areas around the country."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Diverse Grant Participants, Though Data Are Limited", "paragraphs": ["In the first three rounds of skill grant awards, the training programs served a range of participants, in part because of the flexibility afforded in the skill grant program. The skill grant programs were not required to select participants on the basis of eligibility factors such as age, income, or employment status of the individuals. However, in its solicitations for grant applications, Labor encouraged grant applicants to reach out to underrepresented groups, such as minorities, women, and individuals with disabilities. Grantees targeted various combinations of employed, dislocated, and unemployed individuals, and specific populations such as youth, disabled, or public assistance recipients. For example, at one site, the grantee targeted two groups: individuals who were employed and wanted to upgrade IT skills or gain a new skill set and unemployed individuals who were seeking a computer-related job. At another site, the grantee used the skill grant program to train high school students in an IT program at the vocational high school and also trained employed, dislocated, and low-income adults using other training providers.", "Data on participant characteristics are limited because Labor did not require standard data on individual participants to be collected and reported.  Until the quarter from July 1 through September 30, 2002, grantees were not required to report on standard data elements.  For that quarter, Labor will be requiring that grantees submit standard information on the status of participants\u2019 training and certain outcomes, such as new job placements and the number of wage increases individuals received as a result of H-1B training. However, the new requirements still do not require specific demographic data on the individual participants or information on the specific levels of training provided.", "Because data collection varies across sites, the responses to our survey questions about participant characteristics vary as well. All grantees provided information on the number of training participants in their program, reporting that a total of 16,590 individuals were enrolled in training between March 1, 2000, and January 31, 2002. Grantees from the first three rounds who collected participant employment data (39 of the 43 grantees) report that approximately three-fourths of skill grant participants are employed workers upgrading their skills. In addition, the data from our survey show that the skill grants are reaching a wide range of ages, though focusing more heavily on ages 22 to 39, as shown in figure 1.", "Because many grantees chose to target employed individuals that want to upgrade skills or change careers, the participants often have some education beyond high school. Information on the educational background of participants in the first three rounds of grants reveals that most of the participants have some college education, many with at least a bachelor\u2019s degree (see figure 2). In one case, a health care training program required that a participant be a registered nurse before receiving training as a nurse specialist in the operating room or critical care.", "Grantees reported that almost 5,000 participants were members of \u201cunderrepresented\u201d groups. Underrepresented groups can include women, minorities, persons with disabilities, and older workers. Information gathered from grantees collecting gender, race, and ethnicity data indicates that a greater percentage of women and African Americans are training for IT occupations in this program than are working in IT occupations nationally. Grantees indicate that 40 percent of the skill grant participants in IT training were female as compared with 27 percent of computer scientists and systems analysts, and computer programmers in the U.S. workforce in 2001, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Further, a higher portion of African Americans and about an equal portion of Hispanics were trained than were present in those key IT occupations, as shown in figure 3.", "In addition to participant demographic data, some grantees collected outcome data, although these data were limited and had not been standardized. In general, such data are not collected until after participants have ended their training. As of January 31, 2002, grantees reported that 7,646 had completed their entire training program. Most of the remaining participants were still in training; the rest were either waiting for training to start at the time of our survey or had left or dropped out of the program (see figure 4). Because grantees did not always collect outcome data, such as certifications obtained or wages that increased, the outcome data are not complete. The data we collected do not identify whether each participant achieved only one or more than one of the outcomes reported, thus the outcomes cannot be compared to the number of participants who completed their training. While limited, the outcomes reported indicate what the training programs achieved. Grantees reported that 1,796 participants were placed in new or upgraded positions; 1,571 participants increased their wages/salaries; 2,582 participants attained skill certifications, such as a Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer; and 1,870 participants attained industry-recognized skill standards. Grantees report a very low number of participants receiving a 2-year or 4-year college degree, which may be due to the 2-year time frame of the skill grant program.", "Because the program is flexible, grantees can choose to measure success with outcomes relevant to their service delivery option. For example, a grantee that is targeting unemployed individuals can measure job placements, while a grantee targeting employed individuals can measure wage gains or job retention. Outcomes measured included student or employer satisfaction, students\u2019 continuation in school, job retention, job placements, wage gains, or upgraded positions. Only 1 of the 43 grantees is planning to measure reduced reliance on H-1B workers as an outcome. Employers and employees we interviewed reported that the training is valuable because it may contribute to an employee\u2019s loyalty to the company or may provide a service within the company that would otherwise have been outsourced. For example, at one skill grant location, employees of a small nonprofit organization learned how to edit and upgrade the company\u2019s website. By gaining the skills through existing staff, the company became more competitive and saved money.", "Even though grantees were interested in tracking outcomes of participants, and had attempted to do so, they encountered a number of challenges. Since the programs were largely based on the needs of employers, the purpose of the training was often to upgrade a worker\u2019s skills, which is not necessarily connected to an easily measured outcome. For example, training that helps a registered nurse become an operating room specialist or helps an employee at an IT firm upgrade his or her skills to keep up with current technology may not be accompanied with a wage gain or promotion. A couple of grantees we visited said that the training helped employees avoid being laid off with the recent dip in the economy. In addition, some skill grantees said they had a difficult time collecting data from private industry employers who were reluctant to give personal information, such as wages, on their employees."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Future Funding for Sustaining Skill Grant Programs Is Uncertain", "paragraphs": ["Although grantees were required to outline a plan in their applications for sustaining their programs beyond the grant period, some skill grantees who were in their last year of funding had not identified definite future funding sources. During our site visits, grantees said that the H-1B grant provided funding to initiate programs. For example, one grantee said it gave their program the \u201cshot in the arm\u201d it needed to start a new and innovative training program. Some grantees hoped that continuing the program would be easier once the program was established. In their survey responses, grantees identified a wide variety of other funding sources they expected to use to sustain the training programs established under the skill grant. The most common sources of funds were other federal programs, WIA program funds (adult, dislocated workers, or youth program), H-1B employers, and tuition assistance/remission (see figure 5).", "However, several grantees we visited did not have definite plans for alternative funding beyond the program\u2019s 2-year limit and may be unable to offer their program in the future. For example, one program that trained in IT areas had planned to seek funding from employers that were hiring graduates of the training program, but with the downturn in the IT industry, employers were not expected to want to contribute as readily. Some grantees were planning to apply for another H-1B skill grant to continue their programs, but whether they would be approved, was not known.", "In the recent grant solicitation, Labor has allowed grantees to reapply to continue a program but has required at least some expansion of the grantee\u2019s program. Previous skill grant recipients were encouraged to apply for another H-1B grant to provide a different approach or scope to skills training, including the option to expand the existing training program. Labor did award one grantee from the first round of awards another H-1B grant in the fourth round to expand its initial IT training program.

As of May 1, 2002, 7,706 students had received scholarships through the program. Scholarship program coordinators at sites we visited noted that students who meet the low-income requirement for this program typically have to work at least part-time, in addition to attending school. According to an NSF official, the scholarships, which are not restricted to tuition, can be used for any expenses related to school, such as housing, transportation, or childcare. School officials said that students could use the time that they would be working at a job to focus on schoolwork. One student said that the scholarship is helping her to finish the program faster because she is required to be a full-time student to receive the scholarship. Moreover, two students thought that the scholarship attracted them to these fields of study when they were debating what major to choose. One student told us that even though she excelled in math in high school, she only considered becoming a math major after she learned about the scholarship opportunity.", "On the basis of data collected by NSF on students who receive the scholarships, the program is attracting a higher proportion of women and minorities than have pursued degrees in computer science, engineering, and mathematics as a whole. As shown in figure 6, scholarship recipients include a greater portion of women and minorities than are included among computer science, engineering, and mathematics degree awardees. Approximately 37 percent of the students in the scholarship program are women, as compared with 24 percent of all students earning computer and information science, engineering and engineering related technologies, and mathematics bachelor\u2019s degrees in 1999-2000, according to Department of Education statistics. Further, the percentage of minority students in the program was higher than the percentage of minority students earning comparable bachelor\u2019s degrees nationally.", "During our visits we found that while the scholarship program is serving low-income students, some of the schools were having trouble filling their scholarship slots. An NSF program official agreed that some of the smaller schools were having trouble filling slots, and that one complaint heard from school representatives responsible for the program was the restrictive requirement that students be eligible for Pell grants to receive an award. Effective January 2002, NSF relaxed this criteria to require that students are federal financial-aid eligible, a less restrictive criteria. The NSF program official estimates that while enrollments appear to have increased since the criteria was relaxed, the effect of this change will not be known for another year; however, he believes the change has made it easier to recruit students.

Its guidance stated that the overall goal of H-1B-financed training is to raise the skills of American workers so that they can fill high- skill jobs presently being filled by temporary H-1B workers. Labor also stated that one key indication of the occupations in demand is the number of employer applications for H-1B foreign workers, and noted that two industries appear to generate the most current H-1B demand\u2014IT and health care.

The goal of the skill grant programs was to provide technical skill training to workers, both for those who were employed as well as those who were unemployed. The American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act that established the program does not refer to any particular occupations and did not elaborate on the nature of the training authorized. The American Competitiveness in the Twenty-First Century Act of 2000 did provide more specific direction, stating that this training is not limited to skill levels commensurate with a 4-year undergraduate degree, but should include preparing workers for a broad range of positions along a career ladder.", "Unlike some other fields, occupations in the IT field are difficult to classify as to the level of education degree they require. The Bureau of Labor Statistics in its Occupational Outlook Handbook has noted that some IT workers have a degree in computer science, mathematics, or information systems, while others have taken special courses in computer programming to supplement their study in other fields, such as accounting or other business areas. The National Workforce Center for Emerging Technologies has identified IT skill cluster titles and the education necessary for the occupations. For several of the occupations, workers can prepare academically with a range of training types, from a 1-year certificate program to a 4-year degree program.", "Labor, when issuing guidance in its solicitations for grant applications for various rounds, provided confusing language when describing the level of training that was appropriate. The solicitations state that the primary target served should be workers who can be trained and placed directly in the high-skill H-1B visa occupations. However, the solicitations also sometimes included other information that allowed training for lower level positions. For example:   The first round\u2019s solicitation also says grantees should reach out to high- and low-skilled workers to train for H-1B occupations related career paths. However, some grantees commented that raising a low-skilled worker to a baccalaureate level in the 2-year grant period could be difficult.", "The two most recent solicitations for applications mirror the change from the 2000 law. They state that the technical skills training is not limited to skill levels commensurate with a 4-year degree and should prepare workers for a broad range of positions along a career ladder.", "Although Labor\u2019s solicitations were unclear as to the level of training that was acceptable, according to Labor officials, they avoided being overly prescriptive to allow grantees flexibility and encourage innovation. In addition, Labor stated that because this was a new program, it was difficult to determine where more clarification was needed until grantees began to ask similar questions. Labor did post some questions and answers about the H-1B skill grant program from two conferences for potential grant applicants on the H-1B Technical Skills Training Grant website. A Labor official also told us that Labor is developing a list of commonly asked grantee questions and answers to those questions, which should be posted in the near future.", "The 43 grantees from the first three rounds provided training for a range of levels of occupations. INS Adjudications Division staff, when asked to assess whether these occupations are equivalent to skill levels needed for H-1B positions, said that many of them could be acceptable H-1B positions, depending on the details of the job descriptions. The agency found that 25 (38 percent) of the 66 occupations in which training was provided could qualify for H-1B occupations, 30 (45 percent) would generally not qualify, and the remaining 11 occupations were too vague to be characterized either way. (See app. V for a full list of the occupations in which skill grant programs trained and INS\u2019s assessment of how the occupations compared with H-1B occupations.) A few employers told us that in some cases the specific skills they needed could be obtained from an H-1B worker, or could be obtained by training a present employee, who already had some knowledge of processes, in specific higher-level skills. For example, a small nonprofit organization that had interviewed outside candidates, including an H-1B worker, for a networking position decided to use the skill grant funds to upgrade an employee\u2019s skill sets instead. Similarly, the general manager at a manufacturing plant said that electronics technicians who were being upgraded to junior engineers would be able to do testing that previously was part of the responsibilities of senior engineers, some of whom were H-1B workers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scholarship Grant Programs Targeted to Meet National Workforce Needs and Train at High-Skill Levels", "paragraphs": ["Students receiving scholarship grants are enrolled in educational areas that prepare students for occupations frequently filled by H-1B visa holders, an indicator of national workforce needs.

Although the students are pursuing a variety of specific course programs, such as automation robotics and actuarial science, their areas of study can be classified into broad categories as shown in figure 8.

According to a NSF official, while programs such as the scholarship grants are complementary to Labor\u2019s workforce programs, NSF\u2019s primary link to the workforce system has been with the Department of Education. At the local level, some of the skill grant representatives said they did not know about the scholarship grants and some of the colleges with scholarship grants did not know about the skill grants. Yet, local grant representatives of both programs were interested in learning more about each other and it appeared that there were some areas where they could have benefited from more coordination. For example, one university official overseeing the scholarship program mentioned that she would like more information on the skill grants because of the many requests about training programs from students who have degrees but still need additional training to be more marketable to employers.", "Within Labor, ETA oversees the WIA adult, dislocated worker, and youth programs and has some other initiatives to address high-skill workforce needs in addition to the skill grants; however, these efforts are not linked together to build on the lessons being learned. For example, ETA assigned regional staff from the Office of Apprenticeship Training, Employer and Labor Services (ATELS) to monitor the skill grants. ATELS also has a major initiative to develop apprenticeships in new and emerging industries such as IT and health care. Yet, according to a national ATELS official, a strong partnership between the skill grant program and ATELS did not develop, which could have led to building a broader infrastructure that connects the skill grants and apprenticeship efforts in high technology industries. A Labor official from the Division of One-Stop Operations within ETA said that a formal mechanism is not currently in place to share information among grant programs such as the skill grant program and other ETA grants and programs. However, these officials did say that the ETA leadership is interested in looking at the role of demonstration grants such as the skill grant program and how they fit into ETA\u2019s ongoing employment and training programs. An example of this type of coordination was demonstrated by Labor\u2019s Boston regional office that convened a series of 3 daylong conferences that focused on current worker training for H-1B grantees and other discretionary grants awarded by Labor.

Labor consulted with Commerce while developing the initial solicitation for grant application for the skill grant program. The 2000 act mandated that role by requiring that Labor consult with Commerce in awarding the grants and requiring Commerce to complete a study of public and private sector high-tech workforce training programs. Commerce staff also served on some of the skill grant application review panels. Yet, Commerce expressed frustration in trying to obtain information from Labor on the skill grant program for their report on workforce training programs.

At the same time, 10 of the grantees said they had difficulty obtaining data on H-1B visa applications to identify employers who used H-1B workers in their areas. A number of grantees contacted Labor, INS, state workforce agencies, and even congressional offices to attempt to track down this information. While some grantees got information from Labor, others did not. Almost a quarter of the grantees said they would like more assistance from Labor in obtaining information on companies hiring H-1B workers or networking with H-1B employers.

The skill grant program\u2019s flexibility allows training at high-skill levels, often in IT-related occupations, while the scholarship program attracts and encourages students to stay in degree programs in the computer science, engineering, or mathematics. Both programs respond to workforce shortages in either the local or national economies.", "Both programs have encountered challenges during their early implementation. Labor\u2019s confusing guidance on the skill grant program has resulted in uncertainty about the type of training that should be provided. Further, Labor\u2019s new reporting requirements, with the first quarterly report due September 30, 2002, do not require grantees to collect data on individual participants or the level of training being provided. Without these data, Labor cannot identify whom the program is serving or whether the training prepares participants for H-1B level jobs or career ladders leading to those jobs. This limits the ability of Labor to adequately assess the program\u2019s effectiveness and limits the ability of Congress to determine whether the program is accomplishing its goals.  The local scholarship grant programs struggled initially with recruiting enough students to fill all available spaces in their programs. However, it appears that this may no longer be a problem now that NSF broadened the program\u2019s financial eligibility requirements.", "Skill and scholarship grantees have had limited opportunities for sharing information on best practices or how they overcame challenging problems. While Labor recently published a report on exemplary practices of H-1B training programs and has convened two national meetings of grantees, there is no mechanism for grantees to exchange information on lessons learned with each other on an ongoing basis. On the basis of our site visits, the scholarship program grantees also expressed interest in having the opportunity to share information with each other. The skill grant and scholarship programs could also benefit from better communication with one another. For example, local one-stop systems could have helped colleges with scholarship grants recruit potential students for the scholarship program. On the other hand, skill grant programs could have benefited by knowing of scholarship programs in their community, since they could be another resource for participants who had trained through the skill grant program but wanted to continue to work toward a college degree in computer science, engineering, or mathematics.", "While many efforts to train high-skill workers are underway by different agencies, these efforts are not coordinated across agencies to build on lessons learned and maximize their impact. The progress made at the local level by the skill grant program in building relationships with employers and identifying skills needed has broader implications for enhancing national efforts to meet high-skill needs. At the national level, Labor has initiated some promising efforts such as analyzing workforce needs in health care and IT, two industries in which employers have expressed concerns about labor shortages. In addition, the partnership between Labor and Health and Human Services to support joint efforts to address the nation\u2019s nursing shortage is a positive example of bridging initiatives across agencies.

In general, Labor agreed with our recommendations, although Labor believed that their new reporting requirements will be sufficient to provide needed information to evaluate the program. NSF generally agreed with the report, and provided technical comments. While Commerce raised concerns about the design of our study, Commerce did not take issue with our recommendations. Commerce was more interested in the recent grants awarded than in the implementation of the first three rounds of grant awards that was the focus of our study. The recent grant awards were so new that information was generally not available on participant characteristics or program operations. Because Congress asked us to focus our study on how H-1B programs are operating, we reviewed programs that were already in place. Overall, Commerce\u2019s comments appear consistent with our findings that Labor has not collected sufficient data on the program to judge its effectiveness.", "The Department of Labor supported our recommendation that the Secretary of Labor take a proactive approach to addressing high-skill workforce needs across the country. Regarding the recommendation about reporting requirements, Labor pointed out that ETA has recently developed a standard format for the quarterly report. However, we believe that the new reporting requirements need to include additional information on participants\u2019 demographic characteristics and the level of training to ensure that Labor and others can evaluate who is being served and how the training relates to occupations that H-1B visa workers fill. Labor concurred with our recommendation that the Department establish mechanisms for grantees to share successful strategies.  In fact, Labor noted that ETA has provided grantees with two studies that include information about grantees\u2019 best practices and also plans to provide additional technical assistance support to the H-1B program that will include information sharing.", "Commerce, in commenting on the draft, was critical of our decision to focus on the skill grants distributed in the first three rounds of grant awards and not on the more recent grantee selections.  Commerce notes that the changes in the law in 2000 governing the skill grants and Labor\u2019s program implementation and grantee selection have had an impact on the composition of the training offered.  We focused our work on the first rounds of grants because we wanted to obtain information on how grantees were implementing programs.  Grantees from the more recent awards begun in December 2001 could have provided little, if any, information on actual participants and training.", "Commerce was also concerned about our presentation of information on identifying the occupations for which grantees should be training. Commerce states that we drew conclusions by comparing labor condition application data and visa petition data from different years.  Our report, however, does not compare these two sources of information, but rather points out that the most recent information available on H-1B visa petitions approved provides a different picture of H-1B workers\u2019 occupations than was identified through the labor condition application data. Further, as we noted in the report, grantees began their analysis of workforce needs with data on H-1B occupations from labor condition applications, but their decisions about occupations in which to train were based on local labor market conditions and employers\u2019 needs. Regarding our reporting on educational requirements for H-1B workers in IT occupations, Commerce commented that we failed to contrast others\u2019 data on the high portion of workers in IT who have a bachelor\u2019s or higher degree with the education profile of participants at grantees we surveyed. The education data we present on participants reflect their education profiles when they entered the programs. Participants may achieve degrees as a result of the training.  Further, we believe that at the time of our survey it was too early to evaluate the number of degrees participants attained because many longer programs were not yet completed.", "We agree with Commerce\u2019s comment that we provide limited information on the level of training being provided; however, this information is the most extensive data grantees could provide and was not available from any other sources prior to our study. Consequently, we have included a recommendation to Labor regarding data collection. Commerce also noted that individual duties could vary within the same occupational title. We recognize in the report that some occupation titles are vague, but believe that the INS analysis that we present is helpful to identify those occupations that could qualify as H-1B occupations, while recognizing that some are too vague to categorize.  In addition, Commerce said we imply that a specific company\u2019s training of junior engineers might reduce this firm\u2019s need for an H-1B worker.  This example was included to point out only that these workers trained with H-1B grants could perform some duties otherwise performed by an H-1B worker. Commerce also comments that we should have explored the implementation of the career ladder concept with grantees. Our discussions of career ladders focused on the level of training provided and led to our discussion in the report about grantees\u2019 desire to have more assistance in developing and defining career ladders.", "Commerce also expressed some concerns regarding our review of the NSF scholarship program. However, the additional areas that they believe we should have explored, such as whether the scholarships are attracting students who would otherwise not have pursued degrees in these disciplines, would have required resource-intensive approaches, such as surveying schools and scholarship recipients, and were beyond the scope of this study.
