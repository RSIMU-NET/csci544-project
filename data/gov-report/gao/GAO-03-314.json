In light of this, IRS should be commended for the various efforts it took to prepare for the 2002 filing season and improve performance. Still, opportunities exist for IRS to further improve aspects of its performance and some of its performance measures. In 2002, IRS's performance included issuing almost all refunds on time, providing more accurate telephone service than in 2001, and meeting many of its 2002 performance goals in all areas. IRS also began measuring the accuracy of assistance at its walk-in sites to obtain better performance data. In addition, IRS's redesigned Web site was easier to access and more user friendly. IRS's improved performance can be traced to its use of performance measures, which are part of its strategy to improve returns processing and taxpayer assistance as shown below. However, GAO identified opportunities for IRS to make further improvements. For example, IRS's suite of telephone measures lacks an indicator of how long callers wait to speak to an assistor--a key aspect of assistance that provides useful information for decision making by external stakeholders. Although not a primary focus of this report, GAO also found that IRS lacked comprehensive plans related to the extent and timing of anticipated workload and staffing changes at its walk-in sites."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In response to your request, this report discusses various aspects of the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s (IRS) performance during the 2002 tax filing season.

To stimulate the economy more rapidly than would be achieved if taxpayers had to wait until they filed their tax year 2001 return to realize the full impact of this rate reduction, the act provided for eligible taxpayers to receive an advance tax refund in 2001. The amount of the refund was to be based on the filing status and amount of taxable income on the taxpayer\u2019s 2000 return.", "Taxpayers who were eligible to receive an advance tax refund in 2001 but who (1) did not receive a check because IRS did not have their current address or (2) did not have enough taxable income in 2000 to qualify for the maximum amount allowable, may have been entitled to a rate reduction credit when filing their tax year 2001 returns. In addition, taxpayers who were not eligible for an advance tax refund, such as those who did not have taxable income in 2000, may have been entitled to a rate reduction credit provided they had taxable income in 2001.", "According to IRS, passage of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 required computer system programming changes that were complicated by frequent revisions as the Congress and the U.S. Treasury worked together to understand the legislative requirements for the rate reduction credit. This resulted in concurrent testing of those and other computer system changes. After the filing season began and large numbers of returns were received with errors related to the rate reduction credit, IRS made additional programming changes until March 2002 to help manage the high number of errors and assist tax examiners in correcting them.", "As shown in table 4, as of September 27, 2002, IRS had identified over 8 million individual returns with rate reduction credit errors, which represented 57 percent of the returns identified with errors and 6.5 percent of the total number of returns processed at that time.", "Taxpayers and tax return practitioners made various types of errors related to the rate reduction credit during the 2002 tax filing season. For example, taxpayers and practitioners filed over 5 million returns in which they failed to claim a credit even though the taxpayers were entitled to one;   about 2 million returns were filed in which a credit was claimed even though the taxpayers had received the maximum advance tax refund in 2001 and thus were not entitled to a credit; and   almost 1 million returns were filed in which a credit was appropriately claimed, but the credit amount was incorrectly computed."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Problems Related to the Rate Reduction Credit Were Identified Early in the 2002 Filing Season", "paragraphs": ["The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) identified and IRS corrected two problems related to the rate reduction credit. One problem involved the lack of advance tax refund data in the National Accounts Profile (NAP) for certain taxpayers. According to TIGTA, IRS corrected this problem by January 11, 2002, thus preventing about 217,000 taxpayers from receiving up to $50 million in rate reduction credits to which they were not entitled. The other problem, which TIGTA attributed to a misinterpretation of programming requirements, involved IRS\u2019s failure to add information in the NAP for some taxpayers who did not receive an advance tax refund. According to TIGTA, it notified IRS of this problem, which could have affected as many as 35 million taxpayers, on January 8, 2002, and IRS made the necessary corrections by January 15, 2002.", "IRS field staff identified another problem in which IRS\u2019s computer system was generating rate reduction credits for some taxpayers who had already received the maximum advance tax refund. According to IRS officials, this problem would have affected no more than about 15,000 taxpayers, who in a worst-case scenario may have received an additional $300 credit, for a total of $4.5 million in potentially erroneous credits.

When IRS originally reviewed these taxpayers\u2019 returns, it was determined that the taxpayers had underclaimed the amount of their rate reduction credits. However, in accordance with IRS policy about making corrections under certain monetary thresholds, IRS did not initially correct the errors or give the taxpayers the additional amounts. During its review of the 2002 filing season, TIGTA pointed out that the policy seemed inequitable because the same kind of threshold was not used in determining the amount of a taxpayer\u2019s advance tax refund\u2014 thus the amount taxpayers received could vary depending on whether they received their money in the form of an advance tax refund or a rate reduction credit. According to IRS officials, these taxpayers\u2019 returns did not go to error correction and, thus, are not included in the number of returns with rate reduction credit errors in table 4\u2014which IRS officials believe contributed to their ability to handle the substantial error- correction workload."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Terrorist Actions Required Tax Relief for Affected Taxpayers and Security Enhancements", "paragraphs": ["The terrorist actions in 2001 created additional challenges to which IRS responded. The September 11, 2001, terrorist actions created challenges by causing additional workload and requiring concurrent testing of the programming changes related to that workload with other testing. For example, according to IRS officials, programmers modified computer systems in order to suppress certain correspondences, such as balance due notices, to taxpayers affected by the terrorist actions. IRS officials also reported that where the correspondence was already printed, processing centers held that correspondence until November. IRS then generated new correspondence with revised balance due dates, for example, and included leaflets with the correspondence that advised taxpayers to contact IRS if they were unable to meet their tax obligations due to the events of September 11.", "Also, as reported by TIGTA in March 2002, IRS, in response to anthrax attacks perpetrated through the mail, \u201cquickly implemented actions to increase security and safety precautions during the filing season.\u201d Those actions included providing additional security in areas where mail is handled, changing mail handling procedures, and providing additional training and protective equipment for employees."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS\u2019s Reorganization Required a Shifting of Computer Files and Affected Processing Performance", "paragraphs": ["As part of its reorganization, IRS shifted computer files to match taxpayer accounts with the operating division responsible for serving the taxpayers. For example, computer files for individual taxpayers were shifted to the computer systems for the Wage and Investment Operating Division (W& I) processing centers and small business accounts were shifted to the computer systems for the centers that now specialize in small business processing and compliance activities. IRS completed this work before the filing season began in spite of the unanticipated challenges associated with the rate reduction credit and terrorist actions.", "According to processing officials, IRS\u2019s ongoing reorganization affected submission processing\u2019s performance in other ways. It contributed to lower overall productivity, in part by changing the predictability of filing patterns. Also, the eight W&I centers no longer process some of the easier business returns and are left with processing the more complicated and time-consuming individual income tax returns, such as those with Schedule Ds (Capital Gains and Losses). Combined with the trend toward increased use of electronic filing by those taxpayers who file simpler tax forms, such as the Form 1040 EZ, IRS officials believe that these changes contributed to slower processing and a corresponding lower productivity rate."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Changes to Third-Party Authorizations in 2002", "paragraphs": ["IRS offers taxpayers a variety of authorizations that allow IRS to disclose or discuss tax return information with a third party. These authorizations range from allowing IRS to discuss the processing of a return, including the status of tax refunds (hereafter referred to as the third-party checkbox authority), to authorizing a third party to receive confidential tax return information. For the 2002 filing season, IRS expanded the third-party checkbox authority to allow the taxpayer to designate any third party, including friends or family members (in 2001, only paid practitioners could be designated). In response to a recommendation in our report on the 2001 filing season, IRS now has a system in place for tracking how use of the third-party checkbox authority facilitated the resolution of issues related to a return\u2019s processing.

When this authority was first used during the 2001 filing season, taxpayers were only allowed to authorize paid practitioners to serve as their designees in resolving problems or answering questions. According to IRS, the expansion of this authority to any third party was intended to reach taxpayers who wanted to have a family member or close associate assist with simple tax inquiries.", "According to IRS, the third-party checkbox authority is part of IRS\u2019s Taxpayer Treatment and Service Improvement Initiative on third-party authorizations. IRS considers this initiative a way to reduce taxpayer burden by reducing the number of notices sent to taxpayers and allowing a designee to talk directly with IRS to resolve issues during a return\u2019s processing. During a typical year, IRS sends out about 8 million notices regarding tax return processing issues. According to IRS officials, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue forecasted that, with this authority and other innovations, such as oral consent authorizations, 90 percent of those situations might be resolved through telephone discussions with designees.", "According to IRS, taxpayers checked the box on about 32.4 million returns as of October 7, 2002. When IRS first implemented this authority in 2001, it lacked a system for tracking how use of the authorization facilitated the resolution of return processing issues. In response to our recommendation that IRS develop a plan for evaluating the implementation and effectiveness of processing initiatives, IRS implemented computer programming changes that now enable it to know not only how many people used the checkbox option but also how many inquiries were received and responded to by type of return and notice.", "IRS officials estimated, based on their tracking, that the 32.4 million returns with marked checkboxes translated to about 4 million fewer pieces of correspondence.

The taxpayer may call IRS and designate a third party to resolve issues relative to the information indicated on the notice. Once an ODC has been established, the taxpayer does not have to be physically present or on the telephone when IRS discloses the tax information to the third party nor does the third party need an authorization number. The ODC does not authorize a third party to receive notices or other written taxpayer information. The authority is valid until the tax related issues are resolved. If the taxpayer receives subsequent notices from IRS, he or she must call or visit IRS and establish another ODC even if it is for the same third party and tax matter.", "An OTIA allows taxpayers to designate third parties to represent them by telephone or in person and to receive notices or account transcripts on open account issues. The taxpayer does not have to receive a notice from IRS before calling to establish an OTIA. Similar to the ODC, the taxpayer does not have to be physically present or on the telephone when IRS discloses tax information to the third party.

The IRS data indicated that timeliness was a problem in January and February (4.2 and 2.4 business days, respectively) but improved substantially in March and April (1.2 and 0.8 business days, respectively). According to responsible IRS officials, the increase in time to respond to E-mail questions was caused by several factors:   The most significant factor was a decision to concentrate on E-mail questions received in the work period just before the start of the 2002 filing season. IRS consolidated the responsibility for responding to all E-mail questions in one site, and there was an inadequate alignment of employees\u2019 skills with the new workload. IRS believed that far more complex questions were received in 2002 than in 2001 because the expanded \u201cfrequently asked questions\u201d section of the Web site was being used by taxpayers to get answers to more common, less complex questions.", "IRS informed us that, for the 2003 filing season, it will be conducting more training and adding another site to answer E-mail questions.

That compares with a 78-percent accuracy rate for a similar time frame in 2001.
