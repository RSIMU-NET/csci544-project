The Army lacked control edits in its system and allowed the substitution and release of classified spare parts under blanket orders for shipment to foreign countries. The Army and DOD policies prohibit the release of classified items, under blanket orders, to foreign countries. GAO identified 3 requisitions in its review, where the item manager released 11 classified digital processors to foreign countries under blanket orders. Because the Army's system did not have control edits in place to validate the substituted parts, classified items were released to foreign countries. Also, the Army has no written policy to determine the actions needed to recover classified items that have been shipped to countries not eligible to receive them. Army officials indicated that the countries were not entitled to receive these items under blanket orders but they could obtain them under a different process; so there is no need to retrieve them, and GAO agreed with their decision. Also, the Army has modified the system to validate substituted parts selected by item managers. The Army lacks control edits in its system to prevent the release of some unclassified items containing military technology requisitioned under blanket orders. Within the 21,663 requisitions that were shipped without a review, GAO found that 387 requisitions were for 2,267 restricted items that foreign countries are prohibited from requesting using blanket orders because the parts require release authority from inventory control points. Also, the Army has no written policies to recover items that have been shipped to countries not eligible to receive them. Army officials said the countries were entitled to request these items, so there is no need to recover the items. The Army has not conducted periodic tests, as required, to validate that its system is accurately reviewing and approving blanket order requisitions. GAO's and the Office of Management and Budget's internal control standards require that a system such as the Army's be periodically tested to ensure that it is working as intended. According to DOD and Army officials, they have not tested the system's logic for restricting requisitions since 1999. Also, the officials stated that the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, in October 1998, directed that no additional funds be used to expand the current system.

Some sales occurred using blanket orders, which are  requisitions for a specific dollar value and are designed to simplify supply  actions on certain categories of items for which foreign military sales  customers will have a recurring need, such as unclassified spare parts,  repair parts, minor components, training films, and publications.  According to DOD policy, the management of classified spare parts and  unclassified items containing military technology is particularly important  given their potential to be released to foreign countries that may use them  against U.S. interests.

A  foreign country representative initiates a request by sending a letter to  DOD asking for such information as the price and availability of goods and  services, training, technical assistance, and follow-on support.

Army  documents also indicate that removing the control edit that identified  requisitions for unclassified items containing military technology would  eliminate an enormous number of labor hours required to research these  parts. The system does not refer for review those requisitions for items  containing military technology because Army officials stated that DOD has  determined that these items are not classified, sensitive, or pilferable;  consequently, the items should not be subjected to controlled physical  inventory requirements. In 1992, DOD changed selected stock numbers  from unclassified to a classification indicating unclassified stock  containing military technology to ensure that parts requiring  demilitarization could be researched if shortages were reported during  depot inventory reviews and do not require protected storage.", "In our earlier review of the Air Force, we reported that the Air Force did  not use control edits to prevent spare parts containing sensitive military  technology from being released to foreign countries. The Air Force plans  to develop criteria for identifying spare parts containing sensitive military  technology and establish appropriate control edits in its automated system  so that requisitions for spare parts containing sensitive military technology  are identified and referred for review. Also, the Air Force uses criteria,  such as federal supply class, to restrict the parts available to foreign  military sales customers.
