At that time, SBI was to include a single solution technology component; SBInet. DHS assigned the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) responsibility for overseeing the SBI contract, including SBInet. In January 2011, DHS announced that it was ending SBInet, and replacing it with a new technology portfolio. GAO was asked to (1) assess CBP's controls over payments to the prime contractor under the original SBInet program, and (2) provide information about the SBI program prime contractor's reporting against small business subcontracting goals. GAO assessed CBP controls against federal standards for internal control and relevant federal regulatory provisions, and summarized data on contractor performance against small business contracting goals."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO's review of CBP's controls over payments to the prime contractor under the original SBInet program identified the need to improve controls in two critical areas. Specifically, GAO found that CBP's design of controls for SBInet contractor payments did not (1) require invoices with sufficiently detailed data supporting billed costs to facilitate effective invoice reviews or (2) provide for sufficiently detailed, risk-based invoice review procedures to enable effective invoice reviews prior to making payments. Although CBP's established procedures were based on the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), GAO identified numerous instances of CBP contracting officers lacking detailed support in the SBInet contractor invoices they received for review. Because CBP's preventative controls were not fully effective, the agency will continue to (1) be impaired in providing assurance that the reported $780 million it already paid to the contractor under the original SBInet program was allowable under the contract, in the correct amount, and only for goods and services provided, and (2) rely heavily on detective controls (such as timely, effective contract closeout audits) for all SBInet funds disbursed. Further, timely action to improve CBP's preventative controls is critical for the estimated $80 million in original SBInet program funds yet to be disbursed. Also, in light of the recent DHS announcement that it is replacing the originally conceived SBInet program with a new technology portfoliobased approach, GAO's findings concerning weaknesses in CBP's design of controls over payments to the prime contractor under the recently ended SBInet program can serve as \"lessons learned\" to be considered in designing and implementing controls as part of the newly announced portfolio-based approach to providing technological support to border security. With respect to performance against small business contracting goals, the prime contractor reported that it met two of the six small business subcontracting goals for the overall SBI program. Specifically, it reported that it met subcontracting participation goals for Historically Underutilized Business Zone and Veteran-Owned small business categories, but was unable to meet the other four small business goals because a large steel purchase significantly reduced the subcontract dollars available for small businesses to participate in the SBI contract."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO makes five recommendations to improve CBP controls over prime contractor payments under the SBInet and the successor technology portfolio, including actions to strengthen invoice review procedures, provide more detailed support, and to better focus closeout audits.

In March 2010, the Secretary of Homeland Security  announced a freeze on all SBInet program disbursements, with the  exception of SBInet contractual agreements to support technology-based  security for a 53-mile section along the Arizona border. In January 2011,  the Secretary directed CBP to terminate the SBInet program as originally  conceived, and instead focus on developing terrain- and population-based  solutions utilizing existing proven technologies. The Secretary also  provided that while the new technology approach should include elements  of the former SBInet program where appropriate, DHS did not plan to use  the current contract to procure any of the technology systems under the  new approach, but rather would solicit competitive offers. Since the  inception of the SBI program, for which Congress has appropriated a total  of about $4.4 billion through fiscal year 2010, about $1.5 billion of that  amount has been available for the original SBInet program. As of January  2011, CBP reported it had paid the prime contractor a total of about   $780 million under the original SBInet program, and had obligated, but not  yet disbursed, almost an additional $80 million.", "In response to your request, this report provides (1) our assessment of  CBP\u2019s controls over payments to the prime contractor related to the  original SBInet program and (2) information about the overall SBI  program prime contractor\u2019s reporting on the extent to which it met small  business subcontracting goals.

The selected task orders included types priced on both a fixed price and  cost reimbursement basis and included both open and closed task orders.  For each of the five task orders selected for review, we obtained and  reviewed available contract documentation, including individual task  orders, task order modifications, statements of work, and invoices. We  also obtained available information related to all 99 invoices submitted  under the five task orders for the purpose of assessing the extent to which  they complied with the original SBInet contract and were properly  supported.", "To address our second objective of providing information about DHS\u2019s  prime contractor\u2019s reporting on the extent to which it met small business  subcontracting goals for the overall SBI program, we obtained and  summarized information from the prime contractor\u2019s Subcontractor Plan,  the prime contractor\u2019s five semiannual Small Business Subcontracting  Review Summit reports from November 2007 through May 2010, and  documentation supporting the prime contractor\u2019s small business  subcontracting award reports.

The SBI Business Operations Division was  responsible for providing CO-approved invoices to CBP\u2019s National Finance  Center (NFC) for processing contractor invoices for payment.", "In carrying out its assigned prime contractor invoice-related  responsibilities under the original SBInet program, CBP relied on the FAR,  HSAR, as well as DHS, CBP, and SBI program policies and procedures.  The overarching policy for federal contracting is the FAR. DHS issued a  supplemental regulation, HSAR, an acquisition manual for DHS  contracting and, in October 2008, CBP\u2019s SBI Contracting Division issued  standard operating procedures (SOP) setting out required review,  approval, and processing steps for all SBI prime contractor invoice  processing.", "Figure 2 provides an overview of CBP\u2019s process for reviewing, approving,  and paying prime contractor invoices under the original SBInet program.", "CBP\u2019s process for reviewing, approving, and paying prime contractor  invoices under the original SBInet program relies on both preventative and  detective controls. Generally, preventative controls are more efficient  and effective than detective controls. CBP\u2019s detective controls began with  SBInet\u2019s prime contractor submitting an invoice to the SBI Contracting  Division\u2019s CO, COTR, and CBP\u2019s NFC for review. After reviewing the  invoice, the COTR was responsible for recommending whether the CO  should approve or reject the invoice. If the CO and COTR approved an  invoice, the CO was to notify the SBI Business Operations Division within  the Program Management Office to check for fund availability. If funds  were available, CBP\u2019s NFC was to be notified to process the invoice for  payment. Further, while not required, CBP\u2019s COs may request the Defense  Contract Audit Agency (DCAA), a defense agency within the U.S.  Department of Defense, to conduct an invoice review or rate verification  for any invoice. In addition, CBP officials told us that the CO will always  request DCAA to conduct a closeout audit (a detective control) for any  task order, although this is not required.

However, CBP\u2019s policies and procedures did not require the invoices to  include any additional supporting detail. Not requiring such detail not only  precluded us from testing whether invoiced costs complied with the  SBInet contract and were properly supported, but, more important,  resulted in numerous instances in which CBP\u2019s COs and COTRs did not  have the detailed support they needed to effectively review the SBInet  contractors\u2019 invoices.

Specifically, regarding our  recommendation to revise CBP\u2019s procedures to require the SBInet  contractor to submit data supporting invoiced costs to CBP in sufficient  detail to facilitate effective CO and COTR invoice review, CBP stated that  it plans to enhance its current required review process by June 30, 2011, to  provide copies of all contractor invoices directly to DCAA. However, DHS  commented that requiring the prime contractor to submit substantial  supporting documentation data where controls are already in place is not  cost-effective. In this regard, we modified our recommendation by deleting  examples of details to accompany invoices in order to allow CBP  flexibility to decide specifically what detailed supporting data are needed.  Nonetheless, as evidenced by numerous CO and COTR requests for more  detailed data to support their invoice reviews discussed previously in our  report, we continue to believe that the contractor should be required to  provide information in sufficient detail to facilitate invoice reviews that  can function as effective preventative controls in this area.", "DHS also concurred in principle with our recommendations to request and  monitor the expeditious completion of DCAA closeout audits. DHS agreed  that there is a need to close out contracts as soon as practical and plans to  continue to discuss with DCAA the importance of completing annual  incurred cost audits so that contracts can be closed. However, DHS  commented that DCAA management, not DHS, ultimately determines the  completion of these audits. As discussed in our draft report, the focus of  our recommendations was on DHS assisting DCAA in efficiently and  effectively carrying out its responsibilities. Specifically, we recommended  that DHS provide DCAA with information on our findings concerning the  SBInet contractor\u2019s invoices to help focus its audit work and coordinate  with DCAA to monitor the status of closeout audits. We continue to  believe that DHS and CBP need to establish a mechanism to monitor  completed closeout audits to ensure that such audits are fully effective  and completed in time to effectively address to any errors or improper  payments identified. By strengthening their monitoring of the status of  DCAA closeout audits, DHS and CBP officials could better help ensure  that corrective actions and lessons learned are effectively implemented  and adopted, as appropriate.
