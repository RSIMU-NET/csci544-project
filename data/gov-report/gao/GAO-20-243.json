However, the department has not assessed the effectiveness and impact of its business centers and as of November 2019, did not plan to do so. Beginning in 2018, USDA created an online monitoring system to compile data on the status of administrative services, with \u201cdashboards\u201d displaying data specific to different administrative services, among other things. However, the department has not used dashboards or associated metrics to assess the effectiveness and impact of the business centers, including their impact on USDA's customer service; human resources, including hiring; and overall functionality. GAO's prior work has shown that a key practice to consider during an agency's reform efforts is establishing clear outcome-oriented goals and performance measures to assess the reform's effectiveness and impact.

Since fiscal year  2010, however, USDA\u2019s budget authority has decreased by about 3  percent in real dollars, and the agency has experienced a reduction of the  equivalent of about 14,400 staff years. The current fiscal environment  and expectations for a high-performing and efficient government  underscore the need for federal agencies to focus on program results and  customer needs, work across organizational lines to help minimize any  overlap and duplication, and build internal management capacity.", "We reported in March 2016 on USDA\u2019s efforts to streamline its  administrative services. At the time, USDA was focused on four priority  areas: workers\u2019 compensation, strategic sourcing (improving procurement  and contracting), shared service centers for certain administrative  services, and space utilization (improving space management of USDA- owned and leased property). Since then, the department has continued  its efforts to reform its administrative services. In May 2017, the  Secretary of Agriculture announced a reorganization of the department to  improve customer service and efficiency. Among other changes, the  reorganization included creation of a new mission area\u2014the Farm  Production and Conservation (FPAC) mission area\u2014to focus on domestic  agricultural issues by grouping together the Farm Service Agency (FSA),  Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), and Risk Management  Agency (RMA). In November 2017, the Secretary identified improving  customer engagement, maximizing efficiency, and improving agency  collaboration as policy goals for the reforms. The Secretary also  announced that the department would establish a business center in each  USDA mission area to provide consolidated administrative services  related to financial management, human resources, information  technology, procurement, property management, and related services. In  its strategic plan for fiscal years 2018 through 2022, USDA also  established a goal to modernize the agency\u2019s information technology  services.", "The administrative services provided by the business centers help USDA  achieve its mission and program goals and are performed throughout the  department\u2019s organizational structure at the headquarters, regional, state,  and local levels.

USDA\u2019s eight mission areas carry out the department\u2019s program  responsibilities through 18 agencies. Five mission areas consist of  multiple agencies, while three consist of a single agency, as shown  below. In general, USDA\u2019s eight mission areas deliver the administrative  services, and the staff offices develop regulations, guidance, and policies  describing how mission areas should deliver those services and oversee  the mission areas\u2019 performance. In addition, the staff offices deliver some  administrative services on a department-wide or shared-services basis.  According to USDA officials, the mission areas are to follow the  regulations, guidance, and policies developed by the staff offices but are  allowed considerable discretion in how they deliver administrative  services based on their missions and program needs. According to USDA  officials and documentation, service delivery is typically handled by a  mission area\u2019s field offices at the regional, state, or local level; however,  with the establishment of the business centers, more service is being  delivered at the mission area\u2019s headquarters level."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USDA Has Established Business Centers in All of Its Eight Mission Areas, and the Business Centers Vary in Establishment Date, Structure, and Services", "paragraphs": ["USDA has consolidated administrative services and established business  centers in all of its eight mission areas in accordance with the Secretary\u2019s  November 2017 memorandum. The eight existing business centers vary  in when they were established. As shown in figure 2, three mission areas  had business centers before the Secretary\u2019s memorandum.", "However, even the mission areas that had business centers before the  Secretary\u2019s November 2017 memorandum subsequently changed the  way they provide administrative services, specifically with regard to  information technology services. Two mission areas\u2014Marketing and  Regulatory Programs and Research, Education, and Economics\u2014added  information technology to their business centers during fiscal year 2019.  In 2019, the Natural Resources and Environment mission area, which  already included information technology in its business center, changed  the position descriptions of certain employees to more accurately reflect  that their major duties are considered to be information technology work.", "Of the five new business centers established since the Secretary\u2019s  memorandum, establishment of the FPAC Business Center entailed the  most significant transformation. Typically, each business center is located  within one of the mission area\u2019s component agencies and the center\u2019s  leader reports directly to that agency\u2019s leadership (see table 2). The  FPAC Business Center is the only business center established as a  separate agency within a mission area.", "Changes that occurred at other mission areas in transitioning to new  business centers included modifying reporting structures for services that  had already been consolidated. For example, according to Rural  Development officials, the mission area had a business services entity  prior to the Secretary\u2019s memorandum. To establish a business center as  envisioned by the Secretary\u2019s memorandum, the mission area changed  the reporting structure for administrative operations in the field.  Previously, field employees associated with an administrative service  reported directly to leadership in Rural Development\u2019s state offices.", "These employees now report directly to headquarters leadership specific  to their administrative service. However, according to Rural Development  officials, no employees were physically moved.", "As of November 2019, most of the business centers were providing all  five of the main administrative services that the Secretary\u2019s November  2017 memorandum envisioned\u2014specifically, financial management,  human resources, information technology, procurement, and property  management. Two business centers have chosen to provide financial  management services differently from the other administrative services.  Specifically:", "Food Safety. According to officials in the Food Safety mission area,  as part of its reorganization, that mission area grouped all of the  administrative services except financial management under the Chief  Operating Officer. However, it grouped the budget office, which  performs financial management services, under the agency\u2019s Chief  Financial Officer because it preferred to keep this office with mission- related program offices, which report directly to the Deputy  Administrator.", "Natural Resources and Environment. Officials in the Natural  Resources and Environment mission area said that unlike other  administrative services, which are grouped under the business center,  financial management responsibilities are divided between the  business center\u2019s Office of Strategic Planning, Budget, and  Accountability and the Forest Service\u2019s Office of the Chief Financial  Officer. According to these officials, this arrangement strengthens  internal controls by separating responsibility for allocating and  spending financial resources from responsibility for accounting for  how the resources are spent.", "One business center\u2014in the Trade and Foreign Agricultural Affairs  mission area\u2014provides information technology and financial  management services for Foreign Agricultural Service employees and  has agreements in place with other USDA components to provide human  resources, procurement, and property management services for the  mission area. According to the Deputy Assistant Secretary for  Administration, USDA accepted these mission areas\u2019 decisions about  financial management because they ensured accountability of field-level  staff to the administrative service\u2019s headquarters leadership."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USDA Has Developed Metrics for Managing Administrative Services but Has Not Assessed the Effectiveness and Impact of Its Business Centers", "paragraphs": ["According to USDA\u2019s Deputy Assistant Secretary for Administration, the  department regularly reviews data on administrative services, including  services provided by the business centers. However, the department  does not use these or other data to assess the effectiveness and impact  of its business centers and as of November 2019 did not plan to do so.", "Beginning in 2018, USDA created an online monitoring system to compile  data from mission areas on the status of their administrative services. The  system has \u201cdashboards\u201d displaying data specific to financial  management, human resources, information technology, procurement,  and property management, among other things. Each of the dashboards  presents metrics gathered from various databases across mission areas.  For example, the dashboards for human resources include the number of  employees by organization, along with their geographic location,  retirement eligibility, occupation, and any skills gaps. According to USDA  officials, the dashboards allow department-level review of a large number  of metrics on a range of administrative activities performed by the  business centers\u2014data that previously were available only to each  mission area. USDA\u2019s Deputy Secretary discusses performance on  various dashboards with mission area and staff office leadership at  quarterly review meetings.", "However, the department has not used dashboards or associated metrics  to assess the effectiveness and impact of the business centers.  Specifically, the department has not assessed the impact that the  business centers have had on USDA\u2019s customer service; human  resources, including hiring; and overall functionality. According to the  Deputy Assistant Secretary for Administration, creating new business  centers and changing existing ones has contributed to positive results,  such as savings from reducing the size of USDA\u2019s vehicle fleet, but  USDA\u2019s Departmental Administration has not systematically compared  USDA\u2019s ability to deliver its administrative services before and after these  reforms. For example, the department has not examined whether the  reforms have enabled mission areas to reduce costs, reduce processing  times, or identify previously unknown issues that need to be addressed.", "According to USDA officials, these business center reforms broadly  addressed the first policy goal in USDA\u2019s May 2018 strategic plan for  fiscal years 2018 through 2022\u2014namely that USDA programs be  delivered efficiently, effectively, and with integrity and a focus on  customer service. However, USDA officials told us that they have not  yet attempted to measure how the business center reforms have met the  three overarching policy goals identified in the Secretary of Agriculture\u2019s  November 2017 memorandum, which called for the business center  reforms to (1) improve customer engagement, (2) maximize efficiency,  and (3) improve agency collaboration.", "In addition, some stakeholders we interviewed expressed concern about  progress toward these goals as USDA works to implement the business  center reforms. For example:", "Staffing vacancies. Some stakeholders raised concerns about the  impact of vacancy rates at business centers on customer  engagement. The two largest business centers created since  November 2017\u2014in FPAC and Rural Development\u2014had position  vacancy rates above 27 percent as of September 30, 2019. Officials  with one group representing farmers who are customers of the FPAC  and Rural Development mission areas told us they were concerned  that (1) vacancies in the business center may be leading to vacancies  among program staff in the field, (2) complaints related to staffing  have increased over the past few years, and (3) staffing vacancies in  the field are negatively affecting customer service. An official from  another group representing farmers told us that the group is hearing  from its members that there have been a lot of changes within USDA  lately and field offices seem to be understaffed and overwhelmed  even after the creation of the business centers, which could be  negatively affecting the quality of customer service. Vacancies at the  FPAC and Rural Development business centers, particularly among  staff responsible for hiring USDA program staff in the field, could  therefore affect both access to and the quality of technical assistance.", "Employee concerns. In the FPAC Business Center, officials from  one union representing employees told us that confusion among  employees about their roles and responsibilities could affect both  internal employee satisfaction and the overall ability of the business  center to serve the FPAC mission and its customers. Specifically,  these union officials noted employees\u2019 confusion about how to  reconcile differences among the work procedures that each of the  three FPAC agencies used before the reorganization. Officials from  this and one other union also stated that employees have reported  that business center leadership has not taken action to address such  employee concerns. As a result, according to officials from both  unions, FPAC business center employees are experiencing low  morale, confusion, frustration, and anxiety about the changes,  affecting their ability to deliver services.", "In response, FPAC officials told us in November 2019 that the FPAC  Business Center is working on empowering employees, hiring,  establishing a culture of accountability, building trust and engagement,  and addressing other issues that have arisen in the business center\u2019s first  year of operation. For example, these officials said they were reviewing  the business center\u2019s organizational structure to determine whether there  is a need for adjustments to further streamline operations and improve  service.", "USDA officials cited several reasons the department has not assessed  the effect of the business center reform effort undertaken in response to  the Secretary\u2019s November 2017 memorandum. According to the Deputy  Assistant Secretary for Administration, the absence of evaluation is partly  attributable to the department\u2019s strategy of delegating responsibility to the  mission areas to implement business centers; this strategy aims to give  the mission area leadership ownership of the reform effort and help  ensure their buy-in. The Deputy Assistant Secretary for Administration  also said that the department has focused on implementing the reforms  called for in the memorandum rather than on evaluating the results.", "USDA officials also pointed out that the reform effort is relatively recent,  with five of the business centers having been created since June 2018.  However, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Administration  acknowledged the importance of evaluating and communicating any  benefits derived from the business center reform effort as it moves  forward.", "Our prior work has shown that a key practice to consider during agency  reform efforts is the establishment of clear outcome-oriented goals and  performance measures to assess the reform\u2019s effectiveness and impact.  As we have previously reported, a performance goal is a target level of  performance expressed as a measurable objective; a performance  measure includes an assessment of results compared with intended  purpose that can be expressed quantitatively or in another way that  indicates a level or degree of performance. Monitoring performance  against goals allows agencies to assess progress and address problems  as necessary. While USDA has not developed goals and measures to  assess the effectiveness and impact of the business center reforms, the  department has set goals for a limited number of administrative services,  including hiring, the number of fleet vehicles, and travel and conference  spending. In addition, parts of the department have developed goals and  measures for the administrative services their business centers provide.  For example, officials in the Research, Education, and Economics  mission area reported nine key performance indicators for their  administrative services, such as specific goals and measures for the  timeliness of posting job opportunity announcements. Developing  appropriate performance goals and measures and systematically  assessing the effectiveness and impact of the business center reforms  could help the department determine whether the reforms are meeting the  Secretary\u2019s overarching policy goals and improving the delivery of  administrative services to support the department\u2019s mission and program  goals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["USDA has established business centers in all of its eight mission areas,  and, according to USDA\u2019s Deputy Assistant Secretary for Administration,  the department regularly reviews data on administrative services,  including services provided by the business centers.
