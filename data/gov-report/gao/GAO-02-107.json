Under the law, state political subdivisions responsible for  conducting elections must assure that polling places used in federal  elections are accessible, as determined by the state. Exceptions are  allowed if the state determines that all potential polling places have been  surveyed and no accessible place is available, and the political subdivision  cannot make one temporarily accessible. In these cases, voters with  disabilities who are assigned to inaccessible polling places must be, upon  advance request, either reassigned to an accessible polling place or  provided another means for voting on Election Day. These requirements  present a challenge to state and local election officials because achieving  accessibility\u2014which is affected by the type of impairment and various  barriers posed by polling place facilities and voting methods\u2014is part of a  larger set of challenges they face in administering elections on a periodic  basis.", "Because nationwide information on the accessibility of voting for people  with disabilities is dated and has significant limitations, you asked us to  study voting access for people with disabilities, including access to polling  places and alternative voting methods.  This study is part of a broader body  of GAO work about election procedures and election reform issues that we  are doing at the request of various members of the Congress.  This report  (1) examines state and local provisions and practices for assuring voting  accessibility, both at polling places and with respect to alternative voting  methods and accommodations; (2) estimates the proportion of polling  places with features that might facilitate or impede access, including  features of polling booths and voting accommodations; and (3) identifies  efforts and challenges to improving voting accessibility.", "To examine provisions for assuring voting accessibility, we reviewed state  statutes and regulations pertaining to voting accessibility\u2014both at polling  places and with respect to alternative voting methods\u2014for all 50 states and  the District of Columbia.  We also reviewed written policies and other  guidelines that we identified or were provided by chief election officials for  all states, the District of Columbia, and a statistical sample of 100 counties,  selected to be representative of all counties in the contiguous United States  with the exception of those in Oregon. (The county selection process is  described later in this section.)  In addition, we interviewed election  officials in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and in the 100 counties in  our sample to identify practices for assuring voting accessibility. However,  we did not verify the implementation of state and county provisions or  practices.", "To estimate the proportion of polling places in the contiguous United States  with features that might facilitate or impede access for people with  mobility, dexterity, and visual impairments, we visited randomly selected  polling places across the country on Election Day (Nov. 7, 2000).  We used a  two-stage sampling method that created a nationally representative sample  of polling places in the contiguous United States. The first stage involved  randomly selecting 100 counties.  We based the probability of each county\u2019s  selection on the size of its voting age population so that heavily populated  counties, which tend to have more polling places than less-populated  counties, would have a greater chance of being included in the sample.  The  second stage involved randomly selecting eight polling places in each  county.  We then visited no less than 3 and up to 8 polling places per county,  for a total of 496 polling places on Election Day. At each polling place,  using a composite of various federal and nonfederal accessibility  guidelines, we took measurements and made observations of features of  the facility and voting methods that could potentially impede access\u2014such  as no accessible parking, steep ramps, high door thresholds, and voting  booths that did not accommodate voters in wheelchairs.  We also  interviewed poll workers in charge of the polling place to identify  accommodations offered at the polling place\u2014such as curbside voting  outside the polling place, and poll worker assistance and other voter aids  inside the voting room. We documented our observations and interviews  with poll workers in a data collection instrument we developed.  However,  because the extent to which any given feature may affect access is  dependent upon numerous factors\u2014including the type or severity of an  individual\u2019s disability\u2014we were not able to determine whether any  observed feature prevented access.  Accordingly, we do not categorize  polling places as \u201caccessible\u201d or \u201cinaccessible.\u201d Moreover, we were not able  to determine whether curbside voting or other accommodations offered at  polling places actually facilitated voting. Finally, we did not assess whether  our observations on Election Day were consistent with state and county  provisions or practices.", "To identify efforts and challenges to improving voting access, we  interviewed election officials in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and  the 100 counties in our sample to obtain their views on the challenges  associated with improving the accessibility of polling places and voting  equipment. We also interviewed selected election officials and  representatives of disability organizations to obtain their views on the costs  of accessible voting equipment and the extent to which alternative voting  methods and accommodations improve access for voters with disabilities.", "See appendix I for more information on our methods; appendix II for a  copy of our data collection instrument; and appendix III for a list of the  people, counties, states, and organizations we contacted.", "We performed our work from May 2000 to July 2001 in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Holding federal elections in the United States is a massive enterprise,  administered primarily at the local level.  On Election Day, millions of  voters visit polling places across the country, which are located in schools,  recreation centers, churches, various government buildings, and even  private homes. For the 2000 election, counties and other local  jurisdictions deployed about 1.4 million poll workers and more than  700,000 voting machines to polling places across the country.Each of the  50 states and the District of Columbia also play a role in elections, by  establishing election laws and policies and providing oversight in their  respective states.  The federal government\u2019s role in the administration of  elections is fairly limited.  The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is  generally responsible for regulating the financing of elections, serving as a  clearinghouse for information on elections, and providing advice and  assistance to state and local election administrators.", "While federal elections are generally conducted under state laws and  policies, a few federal laws apply to voting and some provisions specifically  address accessibility issues for voters with disabilities. Most notably, the  Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and Handicapped Act (VAEHA),  enacted in 1984, requires that political subdivisions responsible for  conducting elections assure that all polling places for federal elections are  accessible to elderly voters and voters with disabilities. Two exceptions  are allowed: (1) in the case of an emergency as determined by the chief  election officer of the state, and (2) when the chief election officer of the  state determines that all potential polling places have been surveyed and no  such accessible place is available, nor is the political subdivision able to  make one temporarily accessible in the area involved.  Any elderly voter or  voter with a disability assigned to an inaccessible polling place, upon his or  her advance request, must be assigned to an accessible polling place or be  provided with an alternative means for casting a ballot on the day of the  election. Under the VAEHA, the definition of \u201caccessible\u201d is determined  under guidelines established by the state\u2019s chief election officer, but the law  does not specify what those guidelines shall contain or the form those  guidelines should take.  The VAEHA also contains provisions to make  absentee voting more accessible and provides for voting aids at polling  places.", "The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) also applies to voting.  Title II of the ADA and implementing regulations require that people with  disabilities have access to basic public services, including the right to vote;  however, it does not strictly require that all polling place sites be  accessible. Under the ADA, public entities must make reasonable  modifications in policies, practices, or procedures to avoid discrimination  against people with disabilities. Moreover, no individual with a disability  may, by reason of the disability, be excluded from participating in or be  denied the benefits of any public program, service, or activity.  State and  local governments may comply with ADA accessibility requirements in a  variety of ways, such as by redesigning equipment, reassigning services to  accessible buildings or alternative accessible sites, or altering existing  facilities or constructing new ones. However, state and local  governments are not required to take actions that would threaten or  destroy the historic significance of an historic property, fundamentally alter  the nature of a service, or impose undue financial and administrative  burdens.  Moreover, a public entity is not required to make structural  changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in  achieving compliance. In choosing between available methods of  complying with the ADA, state and local governments must give priority to  the choices that offer services, programs, and activities in the most  integrated setting appropriate.", "Title III of the ADA covers commercial facilities and places of \u201cpublic  accommodation\u201d such as restaurants, private schools, and privately  operated recreation centers.Such facilities may also be used as polling  places.  Under Title III, public accommodations must make reasonable  modifications in policies, practices, or procedures to facilitate access for  individuals with disabilities. They are also required to remove physical  barriers in existing buildings when it is \u201creadily achievable\u201d to do so, that is,  when it can be done without much difficulty and expense, given the public  accommodation\u2019s resources.  In the event that removal of an architectural  barrier cannot be accomplished easily, the accommodation may take  alternative measures to facilitate accessibility. All buildings newly  constructed by public accommodations and commercial facilities must be  readily accessible; alterations to existing buildings are required to the  maximum extent feasible to be readily accessible to individuals with  disabilities, including those who use wheelchairs.", "Finally, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA) provides that any voter  requiring assistance to vote \u201cby reason of blindness, disability, or inability  to read or write may be given assistance by a person of the voter\u2019s  choice\u2026.\u201d", "Although these federal laws support the right to vote for persons with  disabilities, concerns continue to be expressed about voting opportunities  for people with disabilities.  One recent study reported that people with  disabilities were about 15 percent less likely to vote than those without  disabilities\u2014even after controlling for demographic and other factors  related to voting\u2014and suggested that voting behavior of people with  disabilities is affected by access to polling places.According to a recent  analysis of Census data, nearly 1 out of 5 Americans has some type of  disability, and more than 1 in 10 has a severe disability.  For Americans 65  and over, 54.5 percent have a disability and 37.7 percent have a severe  disability.", "Such concerns about voting opportunities have prompted action on the  part of policymakers and other interested parties.  For example, members  of the Congress recently proposed several amendments to the VAEHA that  were intended to improve voting access. In addition, the Election  Center\u2019s National Task Force on Accessible Elections, composed of state  and local election officials and representatives of disability organizations,  met in 1999 and issued a guidebook to assist local election officials in  improving voting access. Furthermore, following reports that elderly  voters were unable to decipher ballots and that voting equipment created  overcounts and undercounts in the 2000 election, members of the Congress  and other policymakers have proposed a number of election reforms,  including provisions for further improving voting access for people with  disabilities. Finally, the FEC has been working toward incorporating  accessibility standards for electronic voting equipment into the update of  its 1990 voluntary standards for computer-based voting equipment. In  addition, the IEEE-SA Standards Board has recently approved a project to  develop a standard by which electronic voting equipment may be evaluated  for, among other things, accessibility."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State Provisions and County Practices for Assuring Voting Accessibility Vary Widely", "paragraphs": ["Considerable variation exists in how states and counties attempt to meet  the needs of voters with disabilities, both at polling places and through  alternative methods of voting.  Consistent with the VAEHA, all states and  the District of Columbia have established provisions that address voting  accessibility at polling places.  However, state provisions vary in a number  of ways, including whether these provisions take the form of statute or  regulation, which carry the force and effect of law, or whether they exist  only in policy.  Similarly, states and counties vary in how they select,  inspect, and modify polling places to assure their accessibility.  Finally, if  some polling places are not or cannot be made readily accessible, all states  have provisions for voters with disabilities to vote absentee either on or  before Election Day.  Many but not all states also have provisions for other  alternative voting methods or accommodations to facilitate voting by  people with disabilities on or before Election Day."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "State Provisions for Addressing Accessibility of Polling Places Vary Widely", "paragraphs": ["All states have laws and other provisions concerning voting access for  people with disabilities, including their access to polling places, but the  extent and manner in which these provisions promote accessibility vary  from state to state.  This variation is consistent with the VAEHA, which  requires that states establish guidelines but does not prescribe what those  guidelines should contain.  We found that state provisions vary in several  ways, including the type or nature of the voting access provision and  whether they exist in statutes or regulations\u2014which carry the force and  effect of law\u2014or in policy documents.  For example, table 1 shows that 36  states have a statute or regulation stating that all polling places should be  accessible, 7 states have a policy that requires or suggests that all polling  places be accessible, and 8 states have no such provisions.  Similarly, while  some states have statutes or regulations covering Braille or large-type  ballots or magnifiers for visually impaired voters, the majority of states  have no such provisions.  Overall, we found that some states have  numerous provisions addressing voting and polling place accessibility,  while some states have very few.  (See app. IV, tables 9 and 10, for a  detailed listing of each state\u2019s provisions.)", "Even when states have similar types of provisions, the extent to which the  provisions promote access varies considerably.  For example, while some  states\u2019 statutes recommend that all polling places be accessible, other  states require it without exception.  In addition, some provisions are more  explicit or exacting in promoting access than others.  For example,  according to one state\u2019s statutes, all voting systems acquired on or after  September 1, 1999, must comply with Title II of the ADA and must provide  a practical and effective means for voters with most types of physical  disabilities to cast a secret ballot. In contrast, another state\u2019s regulations  require a large-handled stylus for punching the ballot."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Counties Are Generally Responsible for Assuring Polling Place Accessibility, but Practices Vary", "paragraphs": ["Consistent with the VAEHA, we found that primary responsibility for  assuring accessibility of polling places, through selecting, inspecting,  and/or modifying polling places or voting systems, typically rests with  counties or local governments.  Although there are many similarities in how  counties carry out their responsibilities, there are also some key  differences in their approach and level of effort for assuring polling place  accessibility.  For example, although counties and local governments are  generally responsible for selecting polling places, we estimate from our  county survey that, in at least 27 percent of all counties, accessibility to  people with disabilities is not cited among the criteria used in the selection  process.  Additionally, while all polling places in at least 68 percent of all  counties are inspected by county or local governments to determine if they  meet voting accessibility policies, the frequency of these inspections varies  widely.  Some polling places may be inspected as frequently as once a year,  while others may only be inspected upon selection or after a complaint or  remodeling.  Moreover, in a few counties, polling places conduct their own  inspections.", "In addition, it is the county or local election office that is generally  responsible for ensuring that polling places are accessible, such as by  making and financing any polling place modifications and purchasing  accessible voting equipment.  Since 1995, in at least 32 percent of all  counties, temporary or permanent modifications were made to polling  places to improve their accessibility. With respect to acquiring accessible  voting equipment, county or local election officials in over 92 percent of all  counties have the authority to decide the type of voting machines to be  used. However, most states have established voting system standards with  which counties must comply; some of these state standards require  accommodations for individuals with disabilities, some do not.", "While counties and local election officials typically have primary  responsibility for assuring the accessibility of polling places, table 2 shows  that states provide varying types of assistance.", "Moreover, the amount of assistance provided by states can vary widely for  similar types of assistance.  For example, to assure accessibility of polling  places, one state conducts an annual accessibility survey of polling places,  provides inspection training for county officials, and performs inspections  of polling places.  In contrast, another state only offers guidance to local  officials on how to comply with disability standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State Provisions and County Practices Regarding Alternative Voting Methods and Accommodations Vary", "paragraphs": ["As shown in table 3, states provide alternative methods for voting on or  before Election Day, but vary in the number and kind of alternatives and  accommodations they make available to voters with disabilities.  For  example, in accordance with the VAEHA, all states allow absentee voting  for voters with disabilities without notary or medical certification  requirements.However, the dates by which absentee ballots must be  received vary considerably, with some states requiring that, to be counted,  the ballot must be received before Election Day.  In addition, 17 states  permit permanent absentee voting, allowing voters with disabilities to  receive absentee ballots on a continuing basis without reapplying for a  ballot before each election.  Further, 19 states have provisions for notifying  voters in advance about the accessibility of their assigned polling places.  Other accommodations that some, but not all, states allow include curbside  voting; taking ballots to a voter\u2019s residence; and allowing voters to use  another, more accessible polling location either on or before Election  Day. (See app. IV, table 10 for a detailed state-by-state listing of alternative  voting methods provided.)", "Although states may offer similar types of voting alternatives and  accommodations, wide variation exists in how these alternatives and  accommodations are implemented.  For example, one state requires that all  registered voters be notified of the accessibility of their polling place by  mail at least 21 days before the election.  The notice must inform the voter  of his or her right to curbside voting or to vote by absentee ballot.  In  comparison, another state only recommends that a list of accessible polling  places be published in a newspaper no later than 4 days before the election.", "Finally, in states that have no provisions for particular alternative voting  methods or accommodations, county and local government practices may  vary.  For example, in a number of states that have no provision for  curbside voting, we found that some counties and local governments offer  curbside voting and some do not.  Similarly, in a number of states that  lacked provisions for allowing voters to use an alternative voting place on  Election Day, our county survey data showed that some counties and local  governments offer this alternative and some do not."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Most Polling Places Have Features That May Impede Access, but Most Also Provide Accommodations That May Facilitate Voting", "paragraphs": ["Voting access for people with disabilities may be impeded by a variety of  physical features at polling places; however, accommodations to facilitate  voting are often made available.  Although the extent to which any given  feature may prevent access is unknown, most polling places in the  contiguous United States have one or more physical features that may pose  challenges for voters with disabilities.  These features include a lack of  accessible parking and barriers en route from the parking area to the voting  room.  Figure 2 shows key features we examined. Such potential  impediments can be found at all types of buildings, both public and private.  Additionally, the voting methods and equipment used inside polling places  may pose challenges for some voters with disabilities.

These potential impediments would primarily affect individuals with  mobility impairments. Although curbside voting is not available at a  number of polling places with potential impediments, as noted earlier, all  states have provisions for absentee voting, and many states provide for  other alternative voting methods or accommodations that may facilitate  voting by people with disabilities on or before Election Day.", "As shown in figure 4, most polling places with potential impediments also  offer curbside voting: of the 84 percent of polling places that have one or  more potential impediments, 67 percent offer curbside voting.  Figure 4  also shows that most of the potential impediments occur in two of the four  location areas we examined\u2014en route from the parking area to the  building, and at the entrance of the building.  For example, 57 percent of all  polling places have some type of potential impediment from the parking  area to the building, such as unpaved/poor surfaces, or paths or ramps with  slopes that exceed the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility  Guidelines, which could hinder the approach of a voter in a wheelchair.  Appendix V contains a listing of some of the potential impediments in each  location area.", "We also found that many polling places have more than one potential  impediment, some of which occur in more than one location area.  For  example, figure 5 shows that 63 percent of all polling places have two or  more potential impediments.  Further, in the four location areas we  examined, we found that 52 percent of polling places have potential  impediments in more than one location area.  A small percentage of all  polling places (5 percent) have a potential impediment in all four location  areas.", "Our polling place data also show that potential impediments to access  occur at fairly high rates regardless of the type of building used as a polling  place.  Table 4 shows that, for each type of building, 76 percent or more  have potential impediments to voting access for people with disabilities.", "Moreover, about 70 percent of all polling places are in facilities\u2014such as  schools, recreational/community centers, city/town halls, police/fire  stations, libraries, and courthouses\u2014potentially subject to either Title II or  III of the ADA, irrespective of their use as polling places. Our polling  place data show that, of the polling places located in these types of  facilities, about 84 percent have one or more features that may present  challenges to physical access for voters with disabilities. Potential  impediments found at these facilities include high door thresholds, ramps  with steep slopes, and a lack of accessible parking.  However, under the  ADA, only new construction and alterations must be readily accessible, and  we did not determine the date that polling place facilities were either  constructed or altered.  In addition, due to the number of possible  approaches for meeting ADA requirements on accessibility to public  services and because places of public accommodation need remove  barriers only where it is easy to do so, our data do not allow us to  determine whether polling places with potential impediments would meet  ADA requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Inside the Voting Room", "paragraphs": ["Inside the voting room, many of the voting methods and the equipment  used may prove challenging for voters with certain types of disabilities.  Figure 6 shows that the use of ballots marked by a pen or pencil\u2014  traditional paper ballots and mark-sense ballots used with optical scanning  equipment\u2014is the most widespread voting method.  This method is  followed in prevalence by punch-card ballots, direct recording electronic  (\u201celectronic\u201d) voting equipment, and lever machines.  Table 5 details the  potential challenges these methods may present to voters with visual or  dexterity impairments. In addition, voters in wheelchairs may have  difficulty reaching and manipulating the handles on lever machines, and  they also may find it difficult to reach and press the buttons on electronic  voting equipment.  Although electronic voting equipment may pose  challenges for some voters with disabilities, some types of this method may  be adapted with audio and other aids to accommodate a range of  impairments.", "For voters experiencing difficulties using these various voting methods, we  found that one or more accommodations may be provided.

Comments from both state and county  election officials indicate that problems finding accessible buildings can  occur in both rural and urban locations.  For example, in rural areas, the  lack of buildings or the existence of rough terrain can create difficulties;  whereas in cities, a lack of parking or the prevalence of older buildings that  may be not accessible can be a problem.", "However, even when accessible buildings exist in an area, election officials  may lack the authority to use them.  While some county election officials  told us they had the authority to use public buildings as polling places,  other officials indicated that they did not have this authority.  Furthermore,  states and counties generally lack the authority to require the owners of  private buildings to make their buildings available for elections.  According  to our survey results, at least 26 percent of all counties find it difficult to  provide accessible polling places because buildings are under the control  of persons who do not want them to be used as polling places.  In addition,  while at least 86 percent of the counties can provide private building  owners some compensation for the use of their buildings, the amount may  be limited to paying janitorial costs or a small usage fee\u2014sometimes less  than $100 per facility\u2014which may not serve as a persuasive incentive.", "One option for overcoming the limited supply of accessible buildings is to  modify buildings, for example by installing ramps or widening doorways.  While election officials have reported some success with this option, some  indicated that their ability to make modifications has been impeded by  authority limitations and funding constraints.  For publicly held buildings,  we found that the county or local election office has the authority to order  permanent modifications to public polling places in less than one-third of  the counties.  For privately held buildings, election officials generally need  the owners\u2019 permission to make temporary or permanent modifications.  In  addition, some state and county election officials indicated that funding  constraints could also limit needed modifications.  Despite these  limitations, we estimate that, in at least 32 percent of all counties, one or  more polling places may have been modified, either temporarily or  permanently, since 1995 to improve accessibility.  Furthermore, while  election officials may not have the authority or funding to alleviate all  accessibility problems, there may still be opportunities for some  improvements, such as using signs to designate accessible parking and  pathways."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Providing Accessible Voting Equipment Is Hindered by Funding Constraints and Concerns about Reliability and Security", "paragraphs": ["Most state election officials told us that limited funding is one of the main  barriers to improving voting accessibility, especially with regard to  providing more accessible voting equipment.  While some states may  provide funds to ease this burden, according to our county survey, the  county and local levels of government generally bear the cost for  purchasing, leasing, or modifying voting equipment.  Although a number of  election officials and disability advocates we interviewed agreed that the  new electronic voting equipment can accommodate a wider range of  disabilities than other voting methods, they also expressed concern that it  can be expensive, despite dramatic price reductions in the recent past.At  the time of our interviews, election officials estimated that each electronic  voting unit can cost from $3,000 to about $6,000, with attachments to  enable voting by people with various disabilities costing up to an additional  $1,000 per unit. Moreover, competing priorities for funding at a local level  may limit funding for improving voting accessibility, according to several  election officials we interviewed.  For example, counties needing road  improvements may decide to pave roads rather than purchase or lease new  voting equipment.", "In addition to costs, concerns about the reliability and security of  electronic equipment can discourage its adoption, according to election  officials we interviewed.  For example, without the traditional paper ballot  to rely upon, some election officials fear that the equipment could be  tampered with to produce unreliable or fraudulent election outcomes. One  state official told us that several of the counties in his state that are  accustomed to paper ballots do not want electronic voting machines, even  if the state pays for them. Also state election official told us that some  officials are concerned because this newer technology does not create  traditional paper ballots and would not, therefore, allow for a standard  ballot recount to verify the election outcome. However, newer electronic  systems have enhancements that allow voters to confirm their selections  and that improve the ability of election officials to verify election results.", "Although some counties indicated that they had purchased or were  considering the purchase of newer electronic voting equipment, a number  have indicated that they had made improvements to their existing  equipment to enhance voter accessibility.  For example, some counties  reported modifying existing voting machines\u2014for example, by making  them adjustable\u2014so that individuals who need to vote in a sitting position  can vote independently.  Some counties using punch-card equipment  reported providing a larger stylus to make it easier for those who could not  grip or otherwise vote using a regular stylus.  Also, some county officials  told us that, upon request, they try to provide special aids\u2014such as Braille  sleeves for the paper ballot and an accompanying audiotape or Braille  ballots\u2014so that blind individuals can vote independently, although we did  not observe such aids on Election Day.", "While incremental improvements to older voting technology may enable  more people with disabilities to vote independently, some election officials  and disability advocates we interviewed believe these measures have  shortcomings.  For example, according to spokespersons for national  advocacy groups for people with disabilities, blind voters may not be  comfortable with audiotapes because using them is time-consuming and  does not allow them to independently confirm that they marked their  ballots correctly.  Moreover, only a small percentage of blind individuals  have the Braille proficiency needed to vote using a Braille ballot.  In  addition, some voters with severe dexterity problems may not be able to  mark their ballots even with a larger punching stylus or special writing  implement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Alternative Voting Methods and Accommodations Provide Options, but Also Present Access and Implementation Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Expanding the availability of alternative voting methods or  accommodations can provide voters with additional options, but  implementing these changes can present election officials with legal,  administrative, and operational challenges.  For example, expanding the  use of curbside voting could allow more voters with disabilities to cast  their votes at neighborhood polling places on Election Day.  For election  officials, implementing curbside voting requires having staff trained and  available to assist voters outside the polling place.  Moreover, in some  states where curbside voting is either prohibited or not currently used,  policymakers would need to be convinced that providing this  accommodation would not increase the potential for fraud as a result of  ballots being taken out of the polling place facility.  Disability advocates  told us that this accommodation and other alternatives represent important  and needed options for some voters with disabilities; at the same time,  advocates believe that such alternatives do not provide an equal  opportunity to vote in the same manner as the general public and should  not be viewed as permanent solutions for inaccessible polling places.", "Given the limited availability of accessible polling places, other options  that could allow more voters with disabilities to vote at a polling place on  Election Day include reassigning them to another, more accessible polling  place or creating accessible superprecincts in which voters from more than  one precinct would all vote in the same building.  For voters with  disabilities, reassignment to more accessible polling places may require  them to travel farther to vote.  For election officials, some challenges to  reassigning voters are ensuring that they have notified the voter, trained  poll workers, and provided an appropriate ballot at the reassigned location.  In comparison, superprecincts could inconvenience many voters by  requiring extra travel for those whose polling place was relocated.  The  challenge in creating a superprecinct that is also accessible is finding an  accessible facility of sufficient size and amenities to meet the needs of a  large number of voters.", "In addition, some alternatives and accommodations allow individuals to  vote before Election Day, including voting in person at early voting sites or  using less restrictive absentee voting options, such as \u201cno excuse\u201d or  permanent absentee voting. Some voters may prefer voting before  Election Day because it provides greater flexibility and convenience.  For  example, some voters with disabilities may want to use an absentee voting  alternative and may find permanent absentee voting more convenient than  reapplying every election.  However, the various limitations and  requirements of these voting options, such as traveling to an early voting  site or providing a doctor\u2019s certification to qualify for permanent absentee  voting, may discourage the use of these options by some voters with  disabilities whose only obstacle to voting as others do is an inaccessible  polling place.  For election officials, establishing early voting sites and  expanding the number of absentee voters add to the cost and complexity of  running an election.  In addition, some election officials told us that  policymakers in their states are reluctant to adopt or expand voting  options\u2014for example, to allow permanent absentee voting\u2014because they  fear it may increase the risk of fraud.  At the same time, these options have  been adopted by a number of states.  A unique early voting option chosen  by Oregon\u2019s voters is universal vote-by-mail.  While there were challenges  in implementing this method, such as establishing uniform statewide voting  procedures, there have also been benefits, such as reducing the cost of  holding an election, according to an Oregon election official.", "Internet voting\u2014an alternative that has been only used on a limited basis to  date\u2014also presents increased participation opportunities and  implementation challenges.Internet voting could potentially provide  voters the convenience of voting from remote locations, such as their  homes, and thereby provide another option for increasing voter  participation.  However, numerous election officials and others have  expressed concerns about the security and reliability of the Internet and  lack of widespread access to it.

The first stage was the selection of a sample of  counties.  Each of those counties was then treated as a \u201ccluster\u201d of polling  places.  In the second stage, we selected a sample of polling places from  each cluster.", "Because there is no central list of all of the polling places in the United  States, the first stage of our sampling method started with a list of all  counties, since most elections are administered at the county level.For  cost and efficiency reasons we confined our list of counties to those in the  contiguous United States, thus excluding the states of Alaska and Hawaii.  We also excluded the state of Oregon because, since 1998, elections in that  state have been conducted almost exclusively by mail.  The final number of  counties from which we sampled was 3,074.  Because the unit of analysis  we were ultimately interested in was the polling place, we used a  probability proportional to size sampling method to select the counties.  We  wanted to base the probability that a particular county would be selected  on the number of polling places in that county, so that counties with many  polling places would be more likely to be selected than counties with few.  Since information on the number of polling places in each county is not  readily available, we based our selection of counties on the size of the  voting-age population of each county (age 18 and over), with more- populous counties more likely to be selected than less-populous counties.  We considered the voting-age population to be an acceptable correlate to  the number of polling places.  We therefore arranged our list of counties so  that, for each county, the probability of selection would be proportional to  the size of its voting-age population.  We then randomly selected, without  replacement, 100 counties from that list.", "The second stage of our sampling method involved selecting from each  county the specific polling places to be visited.  Once the 100 counties were  selected, we contacted county election officials and asked for the most  recent listing of all polling places in each. From each county list, we  randomly selected eight polling places for a total sample of 800 polling  places.  These 800 polling places were located in 33 states.  Our sampling  method produced a representative sample of polling places in the  contiguous United States.

That  is, each team was given an ordered list of polling places to visit and was  expected to follow the order number in making their visits.  If for some  reason a polling place in a particular county was skipped, all polling places  farther down that list were dropped from the sample.  Thus, for example,  polling site number five was not included in the final sample unless polling  sites one through four had also been visited.", "In addition, some counties did not allow us to visit their polling places on  Election Day itself, but made the sites available to us on an alternative date.
