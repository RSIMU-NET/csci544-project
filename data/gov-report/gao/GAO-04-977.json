In response to the competitive environment, corporates are offering new and more sophisticated products and services, expanding their use of technology, and seeking opportunities to merge or collaborate with other corporates. The corporates' financial condition as measured by profitability and capital ratios remained close to a range that has prevailed since the mid-1990s. However, since 2000, a large influx of deposits, coupled with low returns on traditional corporate investments, has constrained earnings and caused a downward trend in corporates' overall profitability. To generate earnings, corporates increasingly have targeted more sophisticated and potentially riskier investments, but appear to be managing risk by shifting toward more variable-rate and shorter-term investments, providing a potentially better match for the relatively short-term nature of their members' deposits. However, the corporates' changing business environment and utilization of more sophisticated and riskier investments increases the importance of NCUA regularly assessing its oversight processes to ensure that corporates are properly managing these risks. NCUA has strengthened its oversight of corporates by creating a centralized office for oversight, revising regulations, implementing risk-focused supervision, and hiring specialists. However, NCUA faces challenges in identifying networkwide problems on a consistent basis, using specialists effectively, providing relevant guidance on mergers, and assuring the quality of corporates' internal controls. Although NCUA identified deficiencies during its examinations, it has not systematically tracked their resolution or evaluated trends in examination data, which could help anticipate emerging issues facing corporates. NCUA also did not fully consider all risks when allocating resources or assigning specialists to examinations, leading to NCUA overlooking some information system deficiencies. Although corporates continue to consider mergers to remain competitive, NCUA had not developed adequate guidance for submitting and reviewing merger proposals.

In  turn, the member credit unions have about 82 million members, to whom  they provide deposit, loan, and some investment services. U.S. Central  Credit Union (U.S. Central), a nonprofit cooperative, is owned by  corporates (serves as the \u201ccorporate for the corporates\u201d) and it serves its  members much like corporates serve their credit union members\u2014which  the federal regulator for credit unions, National Credit Union  Administration (NCUA), and the corporate network refer to as natural  person credit unions.", "We last conducted a comprehensive review of corporates and their  oversight by NCUA in 1991.

Since that time, assets placed in corporates  have grown, corporate credit union business strategies have changed, and  NCUA has significantly changed its approach to oversight. In light of the  evolution of corporate credit union operations and the change in NCUA\u2019s  supervisory approach, and as part of our overall review of the credit union  industry, you asked us to review a number of issues involving corporates  and NCUA. Based on discussions with your staff, we assessed (1) the  changes in financial condition of corporate credit unions since 1992 and (2)  NCUA\u2019s supervision and oversight of corporates, particularly with regard to  how it identifies and addresses safety and soundness issues.", "To assess the changes in the financial condition of corporates, we analyzed  corporate credit union call report data from December 1992 to December  2003, and reviewed internal corporate credit union analyses and  independent studies of the industry from rating agencies. We also  conducted a legislative and regulatory review to determine the key  legislative and regulatory changes affecting corporates since 1992. To  depict the business environment that can affect the financial condition of  corporates, we administered a questionnaire to all 31 currently operating  corporates, and interviewed NCUA and credit union trade organization  officials. To assess how NCUA\u2019s supervision of corporates identified and  addressed safety and soundness issues, we reviewed NCUA documentation  on its risk-focused examination program and reviewed examinations and  NCUA management reports for all corporates from 2001 through 2003. We  also conducted a detailed review of NCUA workpapers for 10 corporates  and interviewed the examiners who were responsible for supervising these  corporates. In addition, we conducted site visits to seven corporates,  selected based on their size, geographic location, and whether they were  state or federally chartered, or were granted expanded investment  authorities. Appendix I provides additional details on our scope and  methodology. Appendix II provides a list of all 31 corporates that were  active as of December 31, 2003, and appendix III contains a copy of the  structured questionnaire.

They are nonprofit financial cooperatives that are owned by  natural person credit unions (that is, credit unions whose members are  individuals), and provide lending, investment, and other financial services  to these credit unions. For example, corporates offer loans to member  credit unions, which in turn use these loans to meet the loan demands of  their individual members. However, corporates are not the only financial  institutions that provide products and services to credit unions. For  example, some credit unions may also obtain loans from Federal Reserve  Banks or Federal Home Loan Banks. Additionally, corporates offer credit  unions investment products and investment advice, but credit unions can  also obtain these services from broker-dealers or investment firms. Finally,  corporates also offer automated settlement, securities safekeeping, data  processing, accounting, and electronic payment services, which are similar  to the correspondent services that large commercial banks have  traditionally provided to smaller banks. With an emphasis on safety and  liquidity, corporates seek to provide their members with higher returns on  their deposits and lower costs on products and services than can be  obtained individually elsewhere. However, corporates\u2019 limited ability to  generate profits\u2014as nonprofit institutions, owned and controlled by their  primary customers\u2014constrains their ability to build a financial cushion  against adverse financial conditions or unexpected losses.", "Since 2000, corporates have experienced deposit inflows from natural  person credit unions that increased corporates\u2019 assets and shares.  Corporates act as a \u201cliquidity sponge\u201d for the underlying natural person  credit union system, and the cyclical rise and fall of corporates\u2019 assets and  shares (deposits) are rooted in the deposit flows of the natural person  credit unions. Thus, these inflows and outflows of deposits, which are  beyond corporates\u2019 control, affect their measures of financial  strength\u2014such as profitability and capital ratios. As we discuss later in the  report, this has exacerbated the stress on their financial condition.", "Since 1992, the number of corporates in the corporate network has  decreased, with assets more concentrated in larger institutions. (See fig. 1  for an illustration of the network\u2019s geographic distribution.) Mainly as a  result of mergers, corporates have decreased in number from 44, at the end  of 1992, to 30 as of December 31, 2003, excluding U.S. Central. On average,  corporates also have become larger, with the median asset size (excluding  U.S. Central) increasing from $450.6 million in 1992 to $1.2 billion at the  end of 2003. However, the corporate network still encompasses small and  large institutions, ranging in size from $7.3 million in assets to $25 billion,  as of December 31, 2003. In addition, asset concentration in the network  has become more pronounced since 1992. Excluding U.S. Central, at the  end of 1992 the three largest corporates accounted for approximately 42  percent of the corporates\u2019 total assets. By the end of 2003, these corporates  accounted for roughly half of corporates\u2019 total assets and the largest  corporate accounted for about one-third.", "As shown in figure 2, the credit union industry is organized into three  closely connected groupings. At the \u201ctop\u201d or retail level, as of December 31,  2003, there were the 9,488 credit unions that served roughly 82 million  individual customers. In the middle are the 30 corporates, which serve  credit unions by investing the cash they have not lent out and by providing  loans and other financial services to the credit unions. Finally, on the  \u201cbottom\u201d or wholesale level is U.S. Central, which provides corporates a  range of products and services, similar to those that corporates provide to  credit unions.", "Since their inception, corporates\u2019 primary functions have been to accept  deposits and make loans to their members. In addition, today, they also  provide investments and other financial services to credit unions, and  corporates over time have broadened the types of products and services  they offer. Most corporates offer  electronic services, such as the Automated Clearing House (ACH) and   correspondent services, such as settlements with the Federal Reserve  and other financial institutions;  check services, including collection and settlement of money orders and  traveler\u2019s checks;  credit card settlement; and   education and training.", "However, corporates now offer or plan to introduce new products and  services such as online training, electronic bill payment, Internet banking,  asset/liability management (ALM), and brokerage services. For more  detailed information on the products and services corporates offered or  planned to offer, see appendix IV.", "While the first credit union in the United States started in 1909, the first  corporate did not start operations until 1968. Many corporates grew out of  the various state credit union leagues and initially served only single states  or regions. Over time, corporates were granted national fields of  membership that allowed them to expand the number of credit unions they  served. While corporate credit union membership can be national,  corporates can have either a state or federal charter. As of December 31,  2003, 18 of the 31 corporates, including U.S. Central, were state-chartered.  In terms of oversight, NCUA has authority for supervision and examination  of federally chartered corporates. Under the dual-chartering system, the  supervisory authorities for those states that have state-chartered  corporates are primarily responsible for supervision of these institutions.  However, since all corporates provide deposit, liquidity, and correspondent  services to federally insured credit unions, NCUA also has regulatory  authority over state-chartered corporates and assesses the risks federally  insured, state-chartered corporates and noninsured, state-chartered  corporates present to the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund  (NCUSIF). This assessment, which is essentially an examination of the  corporates\u2019 operations, is performed jointly with state supervisory  authorities during their examinations of state-chartered corporates.", "Part 704 of NCUA\u2019s regulations, together with the relevant provisions of the  Federal Credit Union Act of 1934, constitutes the primary federal  regulatory framework for both state- and federally chartered corporates.  NCUA first issued Part 704 in 1982. Since our previous report on corporates  in 1991, NCUA made significant revisions to Part 704 in 1998 and 2002  relating to risks, capital, investments, and other areas covered by this  report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Corporate Network Faces an Increasingly Challenging Business Environment, Creating Potential Stress on Its Financial Condition", "paragraphs": ["Like other financial institutions, corporates face a challenging business  environment that affects their financial condition and is characterized by  increasing competition, changing product and service offerings, and rapid  technological advances.

To obtain the corporates\u2019 views on their business environment,  we distributed a questionnaire to the entire network and achieved a 100  percent response rate. The corporates reported that they faced competition  from outside the corporate network from entities such as banks,  broker-dealers, the Federal Reserve System, and Federal Home Loan  Banks. About 87 percent of the corporates reported that they also faced  competition from other corporates despite the cooperative nature of the  network. In addition, in recent years (since 2000), corporates have received  a large inflow of deposits from their natural person credit union members,  which had increasing amounts of unloaned funds because of the \u201cflight to  safety\u201d that occurred in the wake of the stock market downturn. These  inflows increased corporates\u2019 assets, pressuring them to ensure that they  received sufficient returns when investing these funds to maintain  adequate capital levels and fund operations. However, over the last several  years, low interest rates have reduced the returns that corporates could  obtain on their investments, which has put stress on their overall  profitability.

Industry observers have noted  that mergers are an effective strategy to attain economies of scale  necessary to afford investments in technology and skilled personnel;  however, if poorly implemented, mergers have the potential to impact  operating performance.

This is due in part to regulatory changes that allowed  corporates to use other, less permanent (or relatively weaker) forms of  capital in addition to retained earnings.", "Beginning in 1998, Part 704 of NCUA regulations expanded the definition of  regulatory capital by defining capital as the sum of reserves and undivided  earnings (that is, retained earnings) and permitted corporates to include  two other, less permanent forms\u2014paid-in capital and membership capital.  More specifically, reserves and undivided earnings include all forms of  retained earnings, including regular or statutory reserves and any other  appropriations designated by management or regulatory authorities. NCUA  currently defines \u201ccore capital\u201d for corporates in Part 704 as retained  earnings plus paid-in capital. Retained earnings, which are internally  generated, are the most permanent form and the primary component of  corporates\u2019 capital. Both paid-in capital and membership capital, which are  from external sources, are less permanent forms of capital, suggesting they  provide a relatively weaker cushion against adverse financial events. Prior  to July 1, 2003, paid-in capital was defined as a member deposit account  with an initial maturity of at least 20 years. However, NCUA now requires  paid-in capital to be a more permanent form of capital (a perpetual  dividend account), available to cover losses that exceed reserves and  undivided earnings. NCUA had noted that, due to its high cost, paid-in  capital would be used by corporates as a bridge during short periods of  stress, such as rapid growth, and should not be used for long periods. While  NCUA\u2019s redefinition of paid-in capital has increased the relative  permanence of this form of capital, membership capital represents funds  contributed by members that have either an adjustable balance with a  required notice of withdrawal of at least 3 years or are term certificates  with a minimum term of 3 years. As such, membership capital is probably  best thought of as a form of subordinated debt, which can protect the  insurance fund in the event of a corporate failure.", "As shown in figure 4, corporate capital rose from $2.9 billion in 1998 to $5  billion at the end of 2003. Retained earnings accounted for 41 percent of  total capital in 1998 but declined to around 36 percent of total capital at the  end of 2003. Paid-in capital increased from around 6 percent of total capital  in 1998 to around 10 percent in 2003. Membership capital shares have  consistently represented the largest percentage of capital, typically around  50 percent, and have been steadily accounting for a greater percentage of  capital since 2000. Thus, while the capital of corporates continues to rise,  corporates have increasingly relied on less permanent (that is, relatively  weaker) forms of capital.

According to NCUA, this regulatory change gave  corporates added flexibility with which to diversify their portfolios and reduce investment concentration. In particular, these securities could be  used in an attempt to limit credit risk by lowering concentrations in certain  industries or geographical areas and creating a more diversified portfolio.  Also, lower-rated securities could be purchased because they carried a  particularly attractive return for their credit rating or provided a good mix  of credit risk and interest-rate risk given the other holdings of a corporate.  According to NCUA and corporate officials, the ability to hold such  lower-rated securities in their portfolios (as opposed to having to sell a  security immediately if it were downgraded) might provide these  institutions more flexibility in disposing of an investment that suffered a  rating downgrade.

Based on our review of information provided by the three corporates  that have the authority to invest in these securities, as well as discussions  with their officials and risk management staff, corporates either have made  few such investments or none. Further, officials at the three institutions  indicated that they did not plan to use their authority to purchase BBB  rated securities.", "However, it is not clear to what extent corporates will take advantage of  this investment flexibility in the future, which has implications for NCUA  oversight that we discuss later in this report. If corporates were to hold or  invest in BBB rated securities to a greater extent, these investments might  create additional risks to the corporate network if not managed properly. In  general, like other financial institutions, a corporate\u2019s vulnerability to risk  depends on its overall portfolio and the amount of capital that is backing it.  Some have suggested that corporates tend to be relatively thinly capitalized  compared with other financial institutions, which may raise concerns over  potential additional exposure to risk. For example, the Department of the  Treasury has raised concerns that allowing corporates to invest in BBB  rated securities could weaken the safety and soundness of the corporate  network because the amount of capital held in the corporatesmight not be  commensurate with the risks associated with these lower credit quality  investments."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "NCUA Strengthened Its Oversight of Corporates, but Could Do More to Anticipate and Address Emerging Network Issues", "paragraphs": ["NCUA has made numerous changes over the last several years to  strengthen its oversight of corporates but faces challenges in such areas as  networkwide assessments, obtaining and utilizing technical staff resources,  developing merger guidance for corporates, and assuring the quality of  corporates\u2019 internal control structures. Specifically, NCUA established a  separate office dedicated to the oversight of corporates, and revised its  corporate regulation (Part 704) to improve corporates\u2019 management of  credit, interest-rate, and liquidity risks. NCUA also adopted a risk-focused  supervision and examination approach, and trained or hired a limited  number of specialists to help oversee increasingly complex operations at  corporates. However, NCUA has not put in place a system to track the  resolution of deficiencies or evaluate trends in examination data and  therefore may not be able to anticipate emerging issues within the network.  Further, NCUA has not systematically considered certain operational risks,  such as weak information system controls, when assigning specialists to  examinations, which may have led to NCUA overlooking certain problems  or not ensuring that problems were corrected in a timely manner. While  continued consolidation of the corporate network appears likely, NCUA  has not developed merger guidance specific to corporates, and its  examiner guidance has not ensured that merger proposals were assessed  consistently. Thus, NCUA\u2019s inadequate guidance has increased the risk that  resulting decisions may not be in the best interests of corporates or their  members, or may negatively affect the safety and soundness of corporates.  Also, as corporates have invested in more complex technologies and added  more sophisticated products and services, the importance of NCUA\u2019s  oversight of corporates\u2019 internal controls has increased. However,  corporates are not subject to the internal control reporting requirements  imposed on other financial institutions of similar size that help to ensure  safety and soundness, as defined under the Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA). This raises a question  about whether NCUA has the necessary information to assess corporates\u2019  internal controls."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "NCUA Made Several Major Improvements in Oversight Since 1991", "paragraphs": ["Since 1991, NCUA has strengthened its oversight of corporates by  reorganizing staff, revising regulations, and changing examination and  supervisory focus. NCUA established the Office of Corporate Credit Unions  (OCCU) in 1994, partly in response to problems with selected investments  at U.S. Central. Within this new office, NCUA centralized its supervision  of corporates and increased the number of examiners dedicated to  supervision and examination of corporates. According to NCUA officials,  prior to this change, NCUA examiners lacked adequate training and  expertise to examine activities undertaken by corporates, since they spent  most of their time examining natural person credit unions, whose  operations generally are less complex than those of corporates. Further, in  1992, NCUA had 12 examiners dedicated to the oversight of 44 corporates  and U.S. Central. As of June 2004, NCUA had 22 examiners plus three  information systems specialists and one payments system specialist hired  to help oversee the 30 corporates and U.S. Central.", "NCUA also revised its corporate regulation (Part 704) in 1998 to increase  measurement and monitoring of interest-rate, liquidity, and credit risk  within the corporate network. The revisions to Part 704 were in response  to the failure of Capital Corporate Federal Credit Union in January 1995  and GAO and other recommendations for NCUA to improve its oversight of  corporates. The 1998 revisions required corporates to measure and report  on the impact of interest-rate and liquidity changes on their net economic  value. Corporates also were required to change the methods used to  calculate their investment concentration limits\u2014moving from a calculation  that used an asset base to one that consisted of core capital (reserves and  undivided earnings and paid-in-capital). Corporates could use this method  to improve their management of credit risk by matching the risks  associated with investment concentrations with capital, which protects  corporates if investment risks lead to losses.", "NCUA also implemented a risk-focused supervision and examination  approach in 1999 to concentrate its resources on the high-risk areas within  corporate operations. Similar to the examination approach taken by other  financial institution regulators, the risk-focused approach is intended, in  part, to better employ examiner resources and improve examination  results by emphasizing the areas of greatest risk. Under this approach,  examiners have greater discretion to identify areas that require their  attention and allocate their time accordingly. Further, examiners can  determine when and where to employ the assistance of specialists with  skills tailored to the activities of the institution, as its operations become  more complex. According to NCUA officials, OCCU also began to promote  examiners who had experience in investments and asset/liability  management to the position of capital market specialist. As of August 2004,  OCCU had five capital market specialists. Additionally, NCUA\u2019s Office of  Strategic Program Support and Planning (OSPSP) had three investment  specialists with private-sector financial market experience that could assist  OCCU\u2019s capital markets specialists. For example, OSPSP investment  specialists participate in selected examinations of corporates that have  expanded investment authorities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NCUA Identified Deficiencies but Did Not Systematically Track Their Resolution or Evaluate Trends in Examination Data", "paragraphs": ["NCUA\u2019s risk-focused approach has helped it identify weaknesses in  corporates\u2019 operations and require corrective actions at corporates;  however, we found that NCUA did not methodically aggregate and track  the resolution of deficiencies or systematically conduct trend analyses to  identify recurrent or networkwide issues. We have reported that sound  risk-focused examination practices rely on the regulator\u2019s ability to  maintain an awareness of industrywide risk. Other depository institution  regulators, such as the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board  of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the Office of Thrift  Supervision reported that they have mechanisms in place to conduct some  degree of industrywide assessments of their depository institutions.  Further, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) tracks and  analyzes trends in examination findings and their resolution in several  ways. For example, after each examination, FDIC reviews, analyzes, and  enters findings and their resolution into various databases. In addition,  FDIC gathers information on its institutions\u2019 internal controls to report on  local, regional, and national trends in bank performance and identify  activities, products, and risks that affect banks and the banking industry.", "Based on our review of about 100 risk-focused examinations for all  corporates and U.S. Central from January 2001 through December 2003,  NCUA examiners had identified deficiencies\u2014most frequently in the areas  of asset/liability management, investments, management, funds transfer,  and information systems\u2014but we could not always determine if corporates  had resolved these deficiencies. NCUA also had established time frames for  correcting deficiencies and procedures for corporates to take actions to  address the deficiencies. According to NCUA, corporates must prepare  plans that specify the action needed and identify the corporate official  responsible for implementing the plan. Further, NCUA reported that  examiners typically verify the resolution of deficiencies during an  examination or on-site supervision, actions that examiners were expected  to document in the examination workpapers. Examiners assigned to  subsequent examinations also were to review the deficiencies from the last  examination report to see what corrective action had been implemented.  NCUA reported that based on the severity of the deficiency, as a matter of  practice, resolutions might be noted in the examination report or in the  workpapers.", "However, after reviewing these examination reports and other NCUA  oversight documents, we were unable to consistently determine whether  the deficiencies NCUA had identified for individual corporates had been  resolved. The executive summaries included in some examination reports  noted that deficiencies from the previous year had been addressed, but this  practice was not standard for all of the exam reports we reviewed. For  example, 14 of 38 examination reports we reviewed had discussed the  status of deficiencies and whether they were resolved. Moreover, the  corporate examiners\u2019 guide did not stipulate that examiners should  document the resolution of prior deficiencies when preparing the final  examination report. NCUA officials told us that the examiner-in-charge  tracked the status of deficiencies at individual institutions and reported  this information in monthly examiner reports. While these reports  documented the status of deficiencies, information on the status was not  included or consolidated in monthly reports prepared for the OCCU  Director or in quarterly reports to NCUA\u2019s Board. As a result, NCUA  management may have been unaware of issues related to the resolution of  examination deficiencies, as can be seen in the following examples:  In the review of one corporate\u2019s examinations, we noted that its  information system disaster recovery site did not meet NCUA  requirements (for site location and a separate power system) for at least  3 years. The examination documentation we reviewed did not issue a  deficiency finding detailing the weaknesses of the recovery site. After  further review, we found that the disaster recovery site was located at  the chief executive officer\u2019s home for at least 6 years before the  examination report detailed the need to replace the disaster recovery  site.", "At another corporate, NCUA acknowledged in the examination that the  institution had not addressed information systems deficiencies related  to information security for 3 years. However, in the prior year\u2019s  examination, NCUA had no mention of recurring problems with  information systems at this corporate.", "NCUA issued a deficiency finding in the area of accounting and financial  reporting for a corporate after it had submitted 13 months of data  inaccuracies in its 5310 call reports, exposing the corporate to financial  and reputation risk.", "NCUA management believed that its existing examination processes and  available information (such as call reports, examiner reports on  corporates, internal monthly management and quarterly reports, and staff\u2019s  institutional knowledge) provided it with sufficient information to assess  the adequacy and timeliness of corporates\u2019 corrective actions. For  example, NCUA officials stated that OCCU management reviews all  examination reports prior to issuance, including any noted deficiencies. In  the regulator\u2019s view, this practice provides an additional layer of oversight  and evaluation. Additionally, OCCU emphasized that its monthly  management reports serve as a key supervision tool to assess issues,  trends, and corrective action at individual corporates. Despite OCCU\u2019s  practices for coordinating and overseeing individual examinations, these  practices were informal (that is, we did not identify guidance or formal  operating procedures) and appeared to operate independently of one  another. Additionally, these processes and practices did not constitute a  system that would aggregate the number and type of deficiencies occurring  at all corporates.", "According to NCUA officials, their current practices kept them abreast of  potential overall issues affecting the network without the need for a  separate system to catalogue the deficiencies. For example, OCCU has  trained three corporate program specialists to support field examiners,  who track issues and trends in their assigned corporates and meet  periodically with OCCU management to discuss issues and trends across  the corporate system. They also noted that the examination review process  had identified a number of issues or trends such as the need to address  Bank Secrecy Act-related issues. However, NCUA officials also said that at  the request of their corporate program specialists, they were developing a  database to track deficiencies identified in examinations to better track  their resolution. They did not specify the planned completion date for this  database.", "NCUA\u2019s current system has relied on interaction between the different  offices, examiners, and specialists involved in oversight of corporates. A  tracking system may have helped NCUA to identify, anticipate, or  otherwise address some of the information system weaknesses we noted  above. More specifically, without such a system for tracking examination  findings and their resolution, NCUA\u2019s ability to identify the extent and  duration of a problem at an individual corporate is limited, which may  prevent the timely resolution of deficiencies. Similarly, the lack of a  tracking system that aggregates deficiencies diminishes NCUA\u2019s ability to  identify networkwide problems readily, assist examiners-in-charge in  developing examination plans, and devise strategies to address issues  before they become a significant safety and soundness concern."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NCUA Did Not Systematically Consider Certain Risks When Allocating Resources or Scheduling Specialists for Examinations", "paragraphs": ["NCUA has not systematically considered corporates\u2019 risk management  (both quality and capacity) when allocating resources and scheduling  specialists for examinations. Federal depository institution regulators,  under the auspices of the Federal Financial Institution Examination  Council (FFIEC)\u2014of which NCUA is a member\u2014had issued guidance on  how to systematically determine when to assign specialists to an  examination. In addition, FDIC and Office of the Comptroller of the  Currency (OCC) have issued specific guidance on the frequency with which  specialty examinations should be conducted. For example, OCC\u2019s guidance  requires that information systems examinations be consistently conducted  at least every 12 to 18 months for community banks with assets of less than  $1 billion, with a minimum objective of assessing the quantity of  transaction risk and the quality of risk management, including staff  capacity and skills. By contrast, NCUA has not established a minimum level  of involvement of specialists in examinations.", "Since we noted that NCUA had identified a number of problems in  information systems at the corporates and were concerned that they had  relatively few specialists in this area, we reviewed FFIEC\u2019s Information  Systems Examination Handbook, which also provides a process by which  regulators can determine when and where to employ information systems  specialists. We used this handbook to assess how NCUA deployed  examiners, relative to best practices and guidance as exemplified in the  handbook. According to this handbook, information systems examiners  must judge risk posed by the quantity of transactions and quality of the institution\u2019s risk management. Assessing aggregate risk allows examiners  to weigh the relative importance of both the quantity of transactions and  the quality of risk management for a given institution and direct the  activities and resources for the regulators\u2019 supervisory strategies. Under  this approach, a smaller corporate with a low volume of transactions and  weak risk management could pose a risk to the network equal to that of a  large corporate with a high volume of transactions and a strong risk  management program.", "We reviewed examination-planning documents for all 31 corporates to  determine how NCUA evaluated these risks when determining the  frequency at which specialists would be assigned to examinations. We  found that NCUA documented its assessment of operations risk in these  planning documents, but did not explicitly discuss the quality of risk  management for various functions and operations when determining if  specialists should be assigned to examinations. For example, in some  cases, we found that the examination-planning documents only provided a  single line stating that an information systems specialist was not needed on  the next examination and did not document the reason for this assessment.  While the planning documents were not clear about NCUA\u2019s decision  process for assigning specialists to examinations, it also was not clear to us  whether NCUA routinely or consistently considered various operational  weaknesses at these corporates when assigning specialists.", "An external review of OCCU in 2002 concluded that NCUA\u2019s complement of  two information systems specialists and one payment system specialist did  not appear to be sufficient to adequately oversee the corporate network  and that OCCU should consider hiring additional specialists in these areas.  NCUA believes it has sufficient specialists to examine the 31 corporates;  however, it has made this determination without fully assessing the  corporates\u2019 business environment and networkwide challenges. NCUA  tended to assign specialists on the examinations of larger corporates or  those implementing newer systems and less so on examinations of smaller  corporates or examinations of established systems at large corporates.  According to NCUA, specialists had limited or no involvement in  examinations at the 12 smallest corporates (with assets of less than $1  billion) from 2001 to 2003. During the same period, specialists were  annually involved in the examination of the eight corporates with assets  above $2.6 billion. While this approach appears reasonable, the limited  involvement of specialists under such circumstances may have contributed  to important information system weaknesses at corporates that were either  not identified by NCUA or not promptly corrected. For example, U.S.  Central\u2019s automated clearing house (ACH) software had deficiencies that  led to a system failure that delayed payments to customers of 2,200 natural  person credit unions for nearly 2 days. According to NCUA, information  systems specialists had reviewed the system\u2019s performance in prior  examinations. However, because the Automated Clearing House (ACH)  software was mature and U.S. Central staff was monitoring its  performance, NCUA did not consider it a high-risk component of U.S.  Central\u2019s operations and had not reviewed it recently. As a result,  weaknesses in their backup procedures and routine maintenance,  insufficient capacity (noted in prior examinations but not satisfactorily  resolved), and other deficiencies that resulted in the outage were not  corrected. NCUA has stated that it is reviewing its procedures to determine  if such systems should receive a minimum level of review. NCUA has also  acknowledged that the ACH delay resulted in financial loss and increased  reputation risk to the corporate network.", "NCUA also faces other obstacles to conducting more systematic  evaluations of risk\u2014both in assuring that corporates have the capacity for  managing risks and ensuring that, as a regulator, it has the staff to assess  the quality and operations in corporates\u2019 risk management functions. As  noted previously, corporates have been operating in a challenging  investment environment, with additional authorities to make lower-rated  investments. Consequently, the quality of risk management at corporates  has grown in importance. While the results of our review of the risk  management function at the three largest corporates suggested that these  corporates were taking appropriate steps to assess and mitigate their risks,  these corporates had a relatively small number of staff in their risk  management functions. More specifically, the largest corporates and U.S.  Central were using sophisticated financial models to assess and manage interest-rate, credit, and liquidity risks. But a rating agency and external  auditor have expressed concerns about small staff sizes and how they  affect these corporates\u2019 continued ability to evaluate and manage risks and  undertake succession planning should key staff leave. The loss of any such  staff at a corporate could hamper its ability to undertake the sophisticated  analyses needed to evaluate risks. The thinness of corporates\u2019 risk  management staffs indicates that NCUA should routinely assess  corporates\u2019 investment risk. However, as we noted earlier, NCUA also has a  limited number of specialists to conduct comprehensive evaluations of risk  management at corporates. Given that the risk-focused approach allows  judgment in assigning resources to areas of greatest concern, the thinness  of corporates\u2019 risk management staff, in combination with the limited  number of specialists at NCUA, suggests that continued attention to  corporates\u2019 investment strategies may help to ensure that corporates are  adequately undertaking their risk management functions. Therefore, this  may require NCUA to reassess its staffing levels and consider the costs and  benefits of adding additional examiners or specialists to adequately  monitor and oversee the growing complexity of corporates\u2019 operations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "As Corporate Network Consolidates, Merger Approval Process Could Be Improved with Better Guidance", "paragraphs": ["As part of its regulatory authority to ensure the safety and soundness of  corporates, NCUA reviews and approves corporate merger applications.  Some corporates, NCUA, and trade-organization officials indicated that  consolidation in the network\u2014as a result of mergers\u2014would likely  continue over the next several years. However, with more mergers likely,  NCUA has not developed specific guidance for corporates preparing  merger proposal packages. In contrast, NCUA has issued guidance for  natural person credit unions that provides step-by-step instructions for  completing the merger process, and NCUA refers corporates to this  guidance. However, NCUA has recognized that this guidance may be  insufficient for corporates. In its guidance to examiners, who are  responsible for evaluating merger proposal packages, NCUA has suggested  that capital ratios unique to corporates, defined in Part 704 of NCUA\u2019s Rules  and Regulations, were more appropriate than the probable asset share ratio applicable to natural person credit unions. However, in the guidance on  mergers available to corporates on its Web site, NCUA has not indicated  that corporates needed to include this information. In our review of five  merger packages recently approved by NCUA, we found that three merger  packages were initially submitted without the corporate capital ratios  defined in Part 704.

However, only one  of the five merger proposals we analyzed was submitted with this  additional information. Other corporate\u2019s proposals required revisions or  were approved without additional information being provided. One  corporate stated they believed the merger process could be improved and  made less cumbersome if NCUA provided clearer or more specific  guidance for corporates.

Under Sarbanes-Oxley, public companies are required to establish and  maintain adequate internal control structures and procedures for financial  reporting. In addition, a company\u2019s auditor is required to attest to, and  report on, the assessment made by company management on the  effectiveness of internal controls. As a result of FDICIA and  Sarbanes-Oxley, reports on management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness  of internal controls over financial reporting and the independent auditor\u2019s  attestation on management\u2019s assessment have become a normal business  practice for financial institutions and many companies.", "While NCUA has issued a letter to corporates indicating that selected  provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, including the provision on  internal control reporting standards, may be appropriate to consider,  NCUA has not mandated that corporates adopt this standard. Given that  other depository institutions of similar size are required by FDICIA to  adhere to the internal control reporting requirements to ensure safety and  soundness, NCUA\u2019s lack of such a requirement for corporates raises the  question of whether NCUA has the necessary information to adequately  assess corporates\u2019 internal controls.

Increased competition,  large fluctuations in inflows and outflows of deposits, in combination with  low interest rates, have created potential stress on the financial condition  of corporates and U.S. Central. While corporates\u2019 assets have increased  rapidly, their ability to increase earnings remained constrained. As a result,  corporates have increased their investments in privately issued,  mortgage-related and asset-backed securities, which can increase returns  but require more sophisticated analysis and monitoring. The change in  corporates\u2019 investment profile is another indication of the growing  complexity in their operations. Since some corporates have been allowed  to invest in lower-rated securities (although few have), this could introduce  increased risks in the system if not managed properly. With the changing  operating and investment environments, this increases corporates\u2019  potential vulnerability to different financial stresses\u2014and requires that  corporates and their regulator, NCUA, place continued attention on their  risk-assessment and monitoring strategies.", "NCUA has made strides in strengthening its oversight of corporates,  particularly with the adoption of a risk-focused approach, certain  regulatory changes, and the hiring or training of specialists in information  and payment systems and capital markets. We believe these actions have  helped NCUA to more effectively oversee corporates. However, based on  issues we identified, we believe NCUA should do more to anticipate and  address emerging network issues. In particular, a tracking system used in  conjunction with other measures, such as information from its  management and call reports, could provide timely and significant  information to NCUA that would help ensure that its risk-focused approach  addressed individual as well as networkwide risks. The relatively small  number of specialists during a time of increased competition and growing  complexity in corporate operations raises additional concerns since NCUA  had not systematically incorporated specialists in planning risk-focused  examinations, or tracked recurring or pervasive issues throughout the  network. We believe this makes it difficult for NCUA to determine the  number and type of specialists that are needed or to anticipate problems to  adequately monitor or oversee the corporate network. Further, with the  continued consolidation in the network, NCUA\u2019s guidance was inadequate  to ensure that examiners consistently evaluate proposed corporate  mergers. Without sufficient guidance for corporates and examiners, NCUA  lacks assurances that decisions on corporate mergers are consistently  being made using appropriate criteria and information or that these  decisions are consistently being made in the best interests of their  members and NCUSIF. We believe that corporates and NCUA examiners  would benefit from better guidance since consolidation, through mergers,  is likely to continue. The growing complexity in operations and the  products that corporates have introduced also raise important concerns  about whether NCUA can ensure that corporates\u2019 internal controls, which  are central to monitoring operations and risk management, are properly  assessed and monitored. However, NCUA has not required corporates to  follow the same internal control reporting requirements (defined under  FDICIA) as other financial institutions that face similar risks.

Additionally, NCUA is of the opinion that the rule\u2019s \u201cmodest  expansion\u201d of permissible investment graded securities, combined with its  reduction in credit concentration limits, results in a stronger corporate  network\u2014that corporate management is better positioned to compete,  within prudent safety and soundness thresholds, than under the previous  rule. NCUA also pointed out in its comments that as of June 30, 2004, 97  percent of the network\u2019s rated long-term securities are rated AAA. Based  on the high quality and diversification of the network\u2019s investments, NCUA  believes credit risk is minimal. NCUA stated that it has addressed  controlling interest-rate risk in the corporate rule and its assessment of the  network\u2019s investment portfolio interest-rate risk is minimal. We  acknowledged in our report that corporates either have made few or no  investments in BBB rated securities, and they indicated that they did not  plan to use their authority to purchase such investments. However, it is not  clear to what extent corporates will take advantage of this investment  flexibility in the future, which has implications for NCUA\u2019s oversight,  especially given the thinness of risk-management staff at corporates.  Further, we share Treasury\u2019s concerns that allowing corporates to invest in  BBB rated securities could weaken the safety and soundness of the  corporate network because the amount of capital held in the corporates  might not be commensurate with the risks associated with these lower  credit quality investments.", "While NCUA concurred with the report\u2019s recommendation for the need to  provide corporates with specific merger guidance to facilitate the  regulatory review process, NCUA did not concur with the report\u2019s  conclusion that improved guidance to examiners is needed to ensure  mergers meet the goals of serving members while not placing NCUSIF at  undue risk. NCUA stated in its comments that it has adequate procedures  in place, and that every corporate merger package prepared by OCCU is  reviewed by NCUA\u2019s Office of General Counsel prior to being presented to  the NCUA Board for action. As stated in the report, NCUA officials told us  that they considered several factors when approving corporate mergers  such as consolidated budgets and conversion plans for information  systems that NCUA has not discussed in the natural person credit union  guidance. However, we found that only one of the five merger proposals we  analyzed was submitted with this additional information and, therefore, we  do not believe that NCUA\u2019s guidance to examiners was sufficient to ensure  that examiners consistently evaluate corporate mergers. As stated in the  report\u2019s conclusions, without sufficient guidance, NCUA lacks assurances  that decisions on corporate mergers are consistently made using  appropriate criteria and information or that these decisions are made in the  best interests of their members and NCUSIF. While clear criteria and  consistency in review are important, improving examiner guidance for  mergers is also necessary to help protect against forbearance on the part of  NCUA.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from its  issuance.

Our analysis, based on  Forms 5300 and 5310 data supplied by NCUA, included calculating  descriptive statistics and key financial ratios and describing trends in  financial performance and the structure of the industry. The information  included Form 5300 data from the end of 1992 through the end of 1996 and  monthly Form 5310 data from January 1997 through December 2003. Our  analysis relied upon selected balance sheet and income statement data  such as assets, shares, investments, capital, net economic value (NEV), and  various income measures and ratios that are commonly used to assess the  financial condition of financial institutions. The transition in 1997 from  Form 5300 (still used by natural person credit unions) to Form 5310, which  is specifically designed for corporates, entailed numerous changes in  reporting. Furthermore, significant regulatory changes, effective in 1998,  also resulted in numerous changes to the information reported on Form  5310 for 1998. Overall, these changes resulted in the deletion of some items  from the financial reports and the addition of others. Subsequently, in some  cases the data were not comparable across time. For example, NEV, which  is a measure of interest-rate risk, was added to Form 5310 in 1998; thus, we  were only able to conduct analysis on this measure from 1998 to 2003. In  our prior report on natural person credit unions, we reviewed NCUA\u2019s  procedures for verifying the accuracy of the Form 5300 database and found  that the data were verified on an annual basis, either during the corporate  credit union\u2019s examination, or through off-site supervision. We determined  that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. We  also performed a data reliability assessment on data from January 1997  through December 2003 for Form 5310, which involved electronic testing of  the data and obtaining information from NCUA on its data verification  procedures. We found that the data were verified for accuracy on a monthly  basis and determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of this report.", "To augment our analysis and obtain a more comprehensive assessment of  corporates\u2019 financial condition and risks, we reviewed internal corporate  credit union financial analysis reports from selected corporates,  independent evaluations of corporate risk controls and models, and  external studies of the industry from major rating agencies, such as Fitch,  Moody\u2019s, and Standard and Poor\u2019s. We also met with selected NCUA  examiners and risk management staff at corporates to better assess how  corporates were managing their risks. In addition, we reviewed internal  documents and analyses dealing with risk monitoring and control from  several corporates in order to assess how well these corporates could  assess and manage risk."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NCUA\u2019s Supervision of Corporates", "paragraphs": ["To assess how NCUA\u2019s supervision of corporates identifies and addresses  safety and soundness issues, we conducted a review of key legislative and  regulatory changes affecting corporates since 1992. We reviewed NCUA  documentation on its risk-focused program, including NCUA examination  reports, their corresponding three-year plans, and the Office of Corporate  Credit Union (OCCU) management reports for all 31 corporates for 2001- 2003. We conducted interviews with OCCU management and with OCCU  examiners-in-charge for 10 corporates. In addition, we visited seven  corporates. We developed a structured questionnaire for all 31 corporates  to solicit their views on what challenges individual institutions and the  collective corporate network faced. We reviewed past GAO and U.S.  Department of the Treasury reports on corporates and NCUA, internal  reviews of OCCU, and an external review of OCCU performed by an  outside auditing firm. We also contacted officials from the Federal Deposit  Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), the  Office of the Comptroller of Currency (OCC), and the Board of Governors  of the Federal Reserve System. Lastly, we interviewed trade association  officials.", "As part of our legislative review, we reviewed the Federal Credit Union Act  to determine the legislative authority for corporates and NCUA\u2019s Part 704,  which is the primary regulation governing corporates. Specifically, we  reviewed the Federal Register for all changes made to Part 704 since 1992  to understand the rationale behind these changes. We also obtained  summaries from NCUA, which provided their rationale for the changes and  brief descriptions of the changes to specific sections of Part 704.", "To assess NCUA\u2019s documentation for its risk-focused program, we reviewed  NCUA\u2019s Corporate Examiner\u2019s Guide, which describes the policies and  procedures under which examiners are to implement the risk-focused  program. The guide describes procedures for off-site monitoring, on-site  examinations, information required in an examination report, and  coordination with state supervisory authorities for corporates that have a  state charter.", "Also, as part of our assessment of NCUA\u2019s risk-focused examination  program, we reviewed about 100 examinations for the 31 currently  operating corporates, corresponding 3-year plans, and OCCU monthly  management and quarterly reports for the period January 2001 through  December 2003. For the review of examinations, we developed a data  collection instrument (DCI) to collect 3 years\u2019 worth of information for  each of the 31 corporates. The DCI enabled us to aggregate examination  areas appearing in a large number of corporates over the time period  reviewed that could be potential networkwide issues due to their  prevalence or persistence. Examples of findings identified by NCUA in the  various examination areas included errors or problems associated with  5310 reporting, accounting procedures, asset/liability management, Bank  Secrecy Act compliance, contingency planning, corporate governance,  credit analysis, funds transfer, information systems, interest-rate risk,  investment, lending, and management.", "The 3-year plans included information on the last examination and financial  profiles\u2014for example, daily average net assets (DANA), capital ratios, and  net economic value (NEV). These plans also contained the supervision type  of the corporate, supervision plans, Corporate Risk Information System  (CRIS) ratings, and in some cases, requests for information system, payment system, or capital market specialists for the next examination or  supervision contact.", "The OCCU monthly management reports covered areas such as OCCU\u2019s  administration news, trends in corporates, significant problem case  corporates, other significant program issues, miscellaneous corporate  information, information on internal or external affairs, board action items,  and the next month\u2019s calendar. The quarterly reports provided a brief  update of events since the previous report, a summary of corporate  network trends, the current status of e-commerce in corporates, specific  discussions on 20 percent to 50 percent of individual corporates, and the  future outlook for corporates and OCCU during the next quarter and  beyond.", "We met with OCCU management to follow up on questions generated from  our review of the examinations, 3-year plans, and OCCU monthly  management and quarterly reports. We also selected a judgmental sample  of 10 corporates from which to gather additional information about NCUA  oversight. These corporates were selected based on asset size, geographic  location, charter type, level of expanded investment authority, and  significant findings in the examinations. We obtained NCUA\u2019s most recent  examiner workpapers for these 10 corporates to review how NCUA  supported its findings. We also met with the examiner-in-charge and, when  possible, capital market specialists for the 10 corporates to better  comprehend their approach to examining the corporate credit union and to  understand the support and rationale for some examination findings. In  addition, we visited 7 of the 10 corporates to observe and discuss their  operations, risk management practices, and interactions with NCUA. We  selected these 7 based on their asset size, geographic location, type of  charter (state or federal), and whether they had expanded investment  authorities. We interviewed senior management and some board and  supervisory committee members. We asked structured questions of  officials from various departments within the corporates. The departments  included investments, risk management, accounting, internal audit,  external audit, information systems, and product support. We obtained  policies and procedures for various areas within the corporates, including  investments, lending, and risk management. We also obtained  documentation packages, which were submitted to the asset/liability  committees of corporates for some of the institutions we visited, to review  investments and their impact on the risk within the corporates. We also  observed corporates\u2019 physical environment to determine the types of  safeguards that were in place, particularly for information technology.", "We developed a structured questionnaire to collect information from the  corporate network that focused on their perspectives about various  components of the industry.
