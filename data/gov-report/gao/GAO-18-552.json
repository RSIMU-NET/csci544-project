According to a business case developed by TSA for Congress in 2017 and TSA officials, TSA expected implementation of the TSO Basic Training program to provide efficiencies to the delivery of new-hire training for TSOs and to enhance the professionalism and morale of newly hired screeners. For example, GAO observed that TSO Basic Training facilities have airport checkpoint equipment and x-ray image simulators for students to practice skills, eliminating the challenge of finding available equipment and training times in a busy airport environment. According to program officials, centralized training also provides trainees with an increased focus on the TSA mission and instills a common culture among TSOs.", "TSA's Office of Training and Development (OTD) updates and modifies the TSO Basic Training curriculum in response to evolving security threats and evaluations of effectiveness, among other factors. For example, OTD holds regular meetings with TSA's Office of Security Operations\u2014the office responsible for managing TSO performance\u2014to discuss issues such as imminent threats. The offices also discuss analyses of TSO effectiveness identified through covert tests, in which role players attempt to pass threat objects\u2014such as knives, guns, or simulated improvised explosive devices\u2014through the screening checkpoints. The two offices identify ways to address issues identified in covert testing, which are then incorporated into TSO Basic Training. OTD also gathers input from TSO Basic Training instructors and from participants to adjust training curriculum.", "TSA has implemented a training evaluation model but has not yet established specific program goals and performance measures to assess TSO Basic Training. The Kirkpatrick model used by TSA is a commonly-accepted training evaluation model endorsed by the Office of Personnel Management and used throughout the federal government. While TSA reported expected benefits of TSO Basic Training in its business case and implemented the Kirkpatrick model to begin assessing training, it has not yet identified specific goals that the program is expected to achieve, nor has it developed applicable performance measures to evaluate progress toward goals, as called for by leading management practices for training evaluation. TSA officials told GAO that TSO Basic Training is a relatively new program and they planned to collect more data on TSO screening performance before further evaluating the potential impacts of the training program. However, TSO Basic Training serves as the foundation for TSOs to learn core skills and procedures, and it is important to establish goals and measures to better assess the effectiveness of the training they receive.

According to TSA, in fiscal year 2017, more than 771 million  passengers were screened at 440 airports across the United States.", "Since its inception, TSA has frequently adapted its standard operating  procedures (SOP) to address new and evolving threats to aviation  security. For instance, after the discovery of a plot to take the ingredients  for an improvised explosive device\u2014including hydrogen peroxide  disguised as soda\u2014onto multiple aircraft, TSA limited the amount of  liquids passengers could bring onto planes from outside the airport.  Transportation Security Officers (TSOs) at airports follow SOPs that guide  screening processes and utilize technology such as advanced imaging  technology (AIT) scanners or walk-through metal detectors to screen  passengers and their accessible property. TSOs have annual training  requirements, which are developed and implemented by TSA\u2019s Office of  Training and Development (OTD). TSOs also receive basic training upon  being hired.

OSO is responsible for allocating TSO  staff to airports, scheduling TSO work hours and training availability, and  developing SOPs that govern how TSOs screen passengers and  baggage. OTD is responsible for developing initial and ongoing training  curricula for TSOs based in part on SOPs. Within OTD, a dedicated team  is located at the Academy to manage updates at TSO Basic Training.", "In accordance with the Aviation and Transportation Security Act,  screeners must complete a minimum of 40 hours of classroom instruction,  60 hours of on-the-job training, and successfully complete an on-the-job  training examination. Until 2016, new TSOs completed these training  requirements at or near their home airports through the New Hire Training  Program (NHTP). Since TSA centralized the TSO Basic Training program  in January 2016, TSOs fulfill these training requirements through  classroom training at the Academy as well as training at their home  airports prior to the Academy and on-the-job training after completion of  TSO Basic Training. During the 2 weeks spent at the Academy, TSOs  receive 80 hours of training on standard operating procedures, threat  detection, and the use of screening equipment. Prior to attending TSO  Basic Training, new TSOs complete computer-based prerequisite training  and may shadow experienced TSOs at a checkpoint. TSO Basic Training  allows for participants to be trained at a dedicated facility with more  hands-on training than was possible for NHTP (see Appendix I for a  comparison of the two programs).", "As shown in table 1, of the $53 million obligated from January 2016  through March 2018, TSA obligated $18.2 million for procurement and  development of the modular buildings on the FLETC campus used for  TSA training, as well as associated hardware and set-up obligations such  as audio/video equipment and fully operational simulated checkpoints.  TSA obligated an additional $12 million in fiscal year 2016 and $13.7  million in fiscal year 2017 for the delivery of TSO Basic Training, including  associated student travel and related equipment. TSA officials told us  that due to continuing budget resolutions that funded the government  between October 2017 and March 2018, TSA was not able to fully fund  the interagency contract between TSA and FLETC to support the TSO  Basic Training course in fiscal year 2018 at the beginning of the year. For  this reason, TSA does not yet have 2018 training obligations available for  reporting through its accounting system. However, based on the average  cost per student in fiscal year 2017 of about $2,300 to attend TSO Basic  Training, TSA estimates total training obligations of approximately $9.1  million in the first half of fiscal year 2018."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TSA Established the TSO Basic Training Program at the Academy to Obtain Benefits from Centralized Training", "paragraphs": ["According to the business case for TSO Basic Training and TSA officials,  implementation of the TSO Basic Training program at the Academy was  anticipated to provide a number of potential benefits. The anticipated  benefits identified generally align under two distinct categories: (1)  efficiencies and improvements obtained through the centralized delivery  of training, and (2) enhanced professionalism and \u201cesprit de corps\u201d  obtained through bringing newly hired screeners together for centralized  training. Collectively, these benefits were also envisioned by TSA  headquarters officials to have a positive impact on screening  effectiveness and public perception of the TSA workforce.", "Based on several analyses of training delivery options that TSA has  conducted since 2008, TSA determined that a centralized training  academy would have a number of potential benefits relative to the  decentralized training previously administered at field airports through  NHTP. Among the potential efficiencies and improvements cited by TSA  are:  Increased consistency and standardization. According to TSA  documents and OTD headquarters officials, centralized training  provides a standardized curriculum that serves as a foundation for the  skills, knowledge, and equipment used across an array of different  airport environments. The TSA business case and other supporting  analyses note that such an approach offers greater consistency of  training delivery and a better mechanism for developing, delivering,  and evaluating course content.", "Equipment availability and expanded course content. TSO Basic  Training includes a full suite of dedicated checkpoint equipment and  x-ray image simulators for students to practice learned skills,  eliminating the challenge of finding available equipment and training  times in a busy airport environment (see figure 2). Officials told us that  being more familiar with the screening equipment increases TSOs\u2019  readiness for on-the-job training when they return to their home  airports. Initial test results also indicate that participants trained at the  Academy receive higher pass rates on end-of course assessments of  x-ray image interpretation skills than those who received their initial  training at their home airports. Specifically, according to TSA data, of  the 5,877 test-takers who received training at TSO Basic Training in  2016, 91.5 percent passed the Image Interpretation Test on their first  attempt. In contrast, 83.2 percent of the 1,458 test-takers who  received training at local airports in 2016 passed the test on their first  attempt. In addition, the Academy curriculum incorporates new  learning opportunities, including a live demonstration of improvised  explosive devices and an active shooter drill, both of which would be  difficult to reproduce within the airport environment, according to TSA  officials.", "Dedicated faculty and instructor development. TSO Basic Training  offers a dedicated faculty and support staff focused exclusively on  training TSOs. According to TSA officials, before TSO Basic Training,  training at individual airports was often conducted by TSOs for whom  instruction was a collateral duty, whereas instructors at the Academy  have full-time training responsibilities and enhanced opportunities to  learn from each other, increase their professional training skills, and  provide feedback on the delivery of course curriculum.", "Centralized facility and shared logistics. By locating the TSA Academy  at FLETC, TSA is able to take advantage of the services and logistical  support that FLETC provides. Specifically, FLETC services and  logistics include accommodations, meals, and transportation, thereby  reducing the administrative demands on TSA personnel and allowing  students a focused and efficient training experience. Additional  efficiencies cited by TSA officials include lower overall costs for office  space, janitorial services, and other operational costs because such  costs are shared by the 96 agencies that use FLETC. According to  TSA officials, conducting training at FLETC can also help TSA  accommodate hiring surges and better augment future training, if  needed. For example, TSA officials reported that the facility has surge  capacity from its current capacity of 240 students up to 300 new  students if sufficient instructors are available.", "According to TSA documents and training officials, another key benefit of  centralized training is the opportunity to enhance professionalism and  help foster camaraderie and esprit de corps. TSA anticipates that  centralized, standardized training will not only provide trainees with an  increased focus on the TSA mission and operational environment, but  can serve to instill a common culture and sense of belonging among the  broader community of TSOs nationwide. In its business case, TSA notes  that centralized training of new recruits is a common model employed by  the armed forces and other federal law enforcement agencies within  DHS, such as U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the U.S. Coast  Guard. According to the business case, by bringing together newly hired  TSOs from around the country, TSA also hopes to inspire in its trainees a  singular identity and unity of purpose, which previous analyses generally  found lacking as part of the decentralized training approach.", "The business case also associates such increases in professionalism and  esprit de corps with greater employee satisfaction and the potential for  reduced attrition. Analysis conducted by TSA in 2017 provides some  initial support for positive trends in these areas. For example, results of a  2017 TSA employee engagement survey indicated that respondents who  attended TSO Basic Training reported higher scores in categories  including Organizational Commitment, Job Satisfaction, and Overall  Morale versus respondents who did not attend. TSA also reported a 19  percent reduction in the attrition rate during the first 180 days of being  hired for those attending TSO Basic Training at the Academy in 2016  versus those who received their initial training at field airports through the  New Hire Training Program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Factors Considered in Updating the TSO Basic Training Curriculum Include Evolving Security Threats and Input from Course Participants", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "OTD Uses Information from OSO to Update the TSO Basic Training Curriculum to Address Evolving Security Threats", "paragraphs": ["OTD updates and modifies the TSO Basic Training curriculum based, in  part, on regular communications from OSO, the office responsible for  developing SOPs for screening operations and managing TSO  performance. Officials from both offices told us that OSO provides  information to OTD on changes to SOPs as soon as changes are made  so they can update the TSO Basic Training curriculum. For instance, in  2017, when OSO began planning major changes to the SOPs, the office  gave OTD information about the planned SOP revisions, as well as the  airports where the new SOPs would be piloted. In response, OTD  modified its curriculum and was able to provide revised training for new  TSOs based at airports that were piloting the program, while providing  TSOs at all other airports the prior version of training. OTD officials noted  that in some cases TSA must quickly update SOPs to reflect imminent  threats. According to officials, a plan is in place to make changes to TSO  Basic Training curriculum in response to emerging or imminent threats,  although such threats have not been experienced since the establishment  of TSO Basic Training in 2016.", "In addition to changes in SOPs, OSO officials indicated they may also  change the timing of when TSOs employed by TSA attend TSO Basic  Training. Specifically, officials told us that OSO plans to implement a new  model for TSO Basic Training in which TSOs will attend TSO Basic  Training 2 to 6 months after they are hired rather than as soon as is  practical. According to TSA, the agency is pursuing this change to,  among other things, implement a transparent career path for TSOs  employed by TSA and to encourage and reward skill development. During  the 2 to 6 months prior to attending TSO Basic Training, TSOs will  perform checkpoint tasks that require training that can be delivered at the  airport as soon as they are hired, such as checking passengers\u2019 travel  documents and helping passengers move through the checkpoint. Once  TSOs are able to perform these initial tasks, they will attend TSO Basic  Training at the Academy, Officials told us they are preparing for the  change by modifying the TSO Basic Training curriculum to eliminate  subjects that will be covered at the airports and to emphasize skills that  more experienced TSOs will need, such as performing physical searches  of passengers. TSA plans to implement the revised model beginning in  August 2018.", "Finally, OTD receives information on TSO performance and uses that  information to inform TSO Basic Training curriculum. For example, two  TSA offices\u2014OSO and the Office of Inspections\u2014perform regular  effectiveness testing of airport checkpoints through covert testing and  share the results with OTD. After each covert testing event, each office  conducts interviews with TSOs to determine the factors that contributed to  their effectiveness at identifying prohibited items. Officials told us that  OSO and OTD hold regular meetings to discuss the analyses of covert  testing failures and ways in which training curriculum can be modified to  address the reasons for the failures, which are then incorporated into the  TSO Basic Training curriculum. Office of Inspections officials noted that  they participated in the development of the TSO Basic Training curriculum  and provide regular reports to OTD on covert testing results."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "When Making Updates to TSO Basic Training Curriculum, OTD Considers Feedback from Instructors, Course Participants, and Contractors", "paragraphs": ["OTD gathers input from TSO Basic Training participants, instructors, and  contractors on ways to update the curriculum.

They can also provide feedback and suggestions during \u201ctrain the  trainer\u201d sessions, in which all instructors participate when TSO Basic  Training is updated. Instructors told us that all sessions include an  opportunity for instructors to provide feedback after reviewing the new  curriculum. Officials told us that they take instructors\u2019 feedback into  account when implementing new curriculum. For instance, officials told us  that at the suggestion of instructors, they added time for discussion at the  end of each checkpoint lab to help capture and share lessons learned.", "OTD also collects feedback from TSOs who have participated in the  course, both at the end of their two weeks at the Academy and several  months after their completion of the course. At the end of TSO Basic  Training, OTD collects feedback from participants through a survey with  both multiple choice and open-ended questions. The survey includes  questions on the course curriculum and instructor performance. Officials  told us that they regularly review the results of the survey and consider  whether it is appropriate to address the feedback by modifying TSO Basic  Training. For instance, the most often provided feedback for altering the  curriculum was to increase the time in hands-on training using screening  equipment in the Academy\u2019s simulated checkpoints. In response, OTD  officials told us they added nearly 5 hours of hands-on training to the 80- hour program in addition to the 6 hours that had previously been a part of  the curriculum.", "In addition to collecting feedback from TSO Basic Training participants  and instructors, TSA officials told us that TSA regularly uses a contractor  to support the design and development of training courses and to assess  existing courses, including TSO Basic Training. In 2016, the contractor  conducted an evaluation of the instructional integrity of the TSO Basic  Training curriculum. The resulting report made a number of  recommendations to improve the curriculum and structure of TSO Basic  Training, many of which OTD has implemented. For instance, the  contractor recommended that TSO Basic Training include more  opportunities for review of the material to reinforce TSOs\u2019 understanding.

In addition, these practices highlight the importance of agencies having  clear goals about what the training or development program is expected  to achieve as a precursor to developing such measures. When designed  effectively, performance measures help decision makers (1) determine  the contributions that training makes to improve results, (2) identify  potential gaps in performance, and (3) determine where to focus  resources to improve results. In particular, incorporating valid measures  of effectiveness into training programs can enable an organization to  better ensure that desired changes occur in trainees\u2019 skills, knowledge,  and abilities.", "According to OTD officials, the TSO Basic Training program was  established on an accelerated schedule in late 2015 as one of multiple  efforts to improve training delivery and help enhance screener  effectiveness. Officials stated that the program is still relatively new and  they plan to collect several additional years of data on system-wide  screening performance before conducting efforts to further evaluate the impact of the training. They reported that the lack of performance  measures is also due to the inherent difficulty of tying specific training  initiatives to broader organizational results. Officials told us that once  TSOs return to their home airports after TSO Basic Training, they are  exposed to additional on-the-job training and differing airport cultures,  which make it difficult to isolate the effects of TSO Basic Training.  However, senior training officials agreed that establishing applicable  goals and performance measures for the TSO Basic Training program  would be helpful to support ongoing efforts and better measure program  progress.", "We recognize that developing metrics to assess the performance of  training programs on broad organizational results can be challenging.  However, there are additional opportunities to develop program goals and  performance measures as part of the training evaluation efforts at the  Academy to help ensure that participants can demonstrate proficiency in  performing core technical skills before returning to their home airports.  We believe that developing goals for a training program does not need to  wait for years of data. Goals reflect desired results, connected to an  agency\u2019s mission, which a program plans to achieve. In the over 2 years  of using TSO Basic Training, TSA has not stated what results the training  program is to achieve.", "TSOs provide a crucial function to help ensure passenger safety, and it is  important to have goals aligned with this mission, as well as associated  measures of effectiveness of the training they receive at TSO Basic  Training to determine the extent to which they are able to fulfill their  important role.

Additional options  could include measuring employee morale as indicated by TSOs on their  Kirkpatrick Level 1 surveys at the completion of the training program, and  comparing these results against applicable program goals for employee  morale that TSA could establish related to TSO Basic Training. By  identifying annual goals and measures for TSO Basic Training, TSA will  also be better positioned to move forward with Level 4 of the Kirkpatrick  Model to evaluate the impact of training on broader organizational results.

DHS agreed  with our recommendation that TSA establish specific goals for the TSO  Basic Training program and develop performance measures that can be  used to assess if the program is achieving desired outcomes. In addition,  in its written comments DHS outlined steps to address this  recommendation.", "With regard to performance goals, TSA plans to establish broad goals  that include successful screening and improved morale, among others.   The stated goals are an appropriate response to our recommendation  that TSA develop goals specifically for TSO Basic Training.  These  actions, if implemented effectively, should address the intent of our  recommendation.", "With regard to developing performance measures that can be used to  assess program outcomes, TSA intends to leverage existing mechanisms  through its Kirkpatrick Model evaluations to measure program success.   As we noted in the report, implementing the first three levels of the  Kirkpatrick Model are positive steps that document certain benefits of  TSO Basic Training, but they do not address specific goals or  performance measures. Kirkpatrick Model Level 2 evaluations include  proficiency exams administered prior to TSOs\u2019 departure from the  Academy. Data from these evaluations, in conjunction with specific goals,  may provide quantifiable metrics that could inform further refinement of  the TSO Basic Training curriculum. However, the surveys being used by  TSA for Level 3 of the Kirkpatrick Model do not include metrics that would  allow TSA to measure the program\u2019s effectiveness and ensure  accountability toward results. Specifically, the surveys do not demonstrate  whether TSO Basic Training is reaching goals related to successful  screening or improved morale because survey results are influenced by  factors outside of the training program. We will continue to monitor TSA\u2019s  efforts in this area.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and other interested  parties.
