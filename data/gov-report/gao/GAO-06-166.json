DHS has already provided some liability protection to three of the four current private screening contractors. However, DHS officials stated that they cannot provide additional coverage, which would render contractors virtually immune from all pertinent claims, because TSA has not finalized performance standards that would allow DHS to determine if contractors will perform as intended--a criterion that must be satisfied before providing such additional protection. Recently enacted legislation shields airports from virtually all liability resulting from the negligence or wrongdoing committed by a private screening company or its employees. TSA has also taken action to improve the screener hiring process by granting contractors and TSA airport officials more input and flexibility in the hiring process. Additionally, TSA has defined the roles and responsibilities for SPP stakeholders--TSA airport staff and private screening contractors, among others--in its August 2005 SPP transition plan. However, the details in this plan have not been shared with private screening contractors, and all four contractors we interviewed were unclear about TSA staff roles and responsibilities at the airports they served. TSA has stated that the SPP will operate at a cost that is competitive with equivalent federal operations and will achieve cost-savings where possible. Over the last 3 years, TSA has awarded cost-reimbursement contracts with an award fee component for screening services at four of the five airports currently using private screeners. The award fee is based, in part, on contractor cost-savings. However, opportunities for TSA cost-savings may be limited because under the cost-reimbursement contracts TSA bears most of the cost risk--the risk of paying more than it expected. TSA plans to shift more cost risk to contractors by competitively awarding fixed-price-award fee contracts for screening services at the four smallest airports that will participate in the SPP. TSA also plans to competitively award fixed-price contracts for screening services at larger airports, but stated that they cannot do so for up to 2 years--when officials believe that screening costs at larger airports will be better known. TSA has developed performance goals and has begun drafting related measures and targets to assess the performance of private screening contractors under the SPP in the areas of security, customer service, costs, workforce management, and innovation. For example, one of the measures would require contractors to ensure that new hires receive required training. TSA's related target for this measure is that 100 percent of new hires will complete required training. These same measures and targets will also be used by DHS to assess whether to award full liability coverage under the SAFETY Act. TSA officials stated that DHS must approve the draft performance measures and targets before they can be finalized. As of January 2006, DHS had not yet completed its review."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA), enacted after the  terrorist attacks of 2001, required the federal government to take over the  job of screening airline passengers and their checked baggage from the  private sector. Among other things, ATSA further required that the  Transportation Security Administration (TSA) initiate a 2-year security  screening pilot program at up to five commercial U.S. airports. The  purpose of this pilot program, as defined by TSA, was to test the feasibility  of utilizing private-sector screeners to screen passengers and their  checked baggage in a post-9/11 environment, by allowing private-sector  screeners\u2014hired and managed by private screening companies under  contract to TSA\u2014to provide screening services in lieu of federal screeners  at selected airports, with TSA oversight. The pilot program ran from  November 2002 to November 2004. During that time, four private  screening contractors served the five pilot program airports (one  contractor served two airports).", "In November 2004, as the private screener pilot program concluded, ATSA  required that TSA begin allowing all commercial airports to apply to TSA  to transition from a federal to a private screener workforce. To support  this effort, TSA created the Screening Partnership Program (SPP) to allow  all commercial airports an opportunity to apply to TSA for permission to  use qualified private screening contractors and private-sector screeners.  Currently, the four contractors that participated in the private screener  pilot program are under contract to TSA to provide screening services at  the five airports they have already been serving, and all five airports that  participated in the pilot program have applied and been accepted to  participate in the SPP. In February 2006, TSA competitively awarded a  new contract for screening services for one of the five pilot program  airports. Also, during the 16 months since the SPP was initiated, two  additional airports have applied to the SPP. TSA approved one of these  airport\u2019s application and in December 2005 awarded a contract to a private  screening contractor\u2014a contractor currently providing screening services  at two of the five pilot program airports\u2014that enabled this airport to  transition from federal to private screeners in February 2006. The other  airport withdrew its application.", "In November 2004, we reported on TSA\u2019s preliminary efforts to allow  airports to apply to use private screening contractors to perform  passenger and checked baggage screening services through the SPP, and  how private screening contractors would compete to provide those  services. We reported that key stakeholders we interviewed\u2014private  screening contractors, airport operators, and aviation associations\u2014were  concerned about several aspects of the program. Specifically, stakeholders  expressed concerns about liability protection\u2014whether and to what  extent private screening contractors and airports would be liable in the  event that threat objects or weapons were not detected at passenger  screening checkpoints or in checked baggage, leading to a terrorist  incident. At issue was whether the Support Anti-terrorism by Fostering  Effective Technologies Act of 2002 (the SAFETY Act) would offer private  screening contractors and airport operators federal protection from  potential lawsuits arising out of or resulting from aviation-related acts of  terrorism. These stakeholders also were concerned about the degree of  management control they would have over various aspects of screening  services, including how roles and responsibilities would be divided among  Federal Security Directors (FSD) and their staff and private screening  contractor managers and staff.", "In this report, we address (1) TSA\u2019s and the Department of Homeland  Security\u2019s efforts to determine whether and how liability protection will be  provided to private screening contractors and airports that participate in  the SPP, and actions taken on other stakeholder concerns related to  participation in the SPP; (2) how TSA has determined it will achieve cost- savings goals for screener operations through the SPP, specifically with  respect to the choice of contract used, and contract terms; and (3) TSA\u2019s  progress in developing and implementing performance goals, measures,  and targets to assess the performance of the private screening contractors  who will participate in the SPP.", "To satisfy our objectives, we analyzed documentation related to TSA\u2019s SPP  and the 2-year private screener pilot program that preceded the SPP and  interviewed various officials. Specifically, we interviewed 24 federal  aviation officials within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and  TSA, including FSDs at seven airports (the five pilot program airports and  two airports that applied to participate in the SPP, namely, Elko Regional  Airport in Elko, Nevada, and Sioux Falls Regional Airport in Sioux Falls,  South Dakota); airport operators at all five airports with private screeners  and the private screening contractors at these airports; officials with the  two airports that have applied to participate in the SPP; officials with two  aviation associations that represent hundreds of airports, including many  large commercial airports; and a major liability insurance provider. To  determine how TSA responded to stakeholder concerns about liability  protection and other issues related to participation in the SPP, we  reviewed SPP program guidance developed for airports, the SAFETY Act,  and related documents obtained from DHS. Additionally, we reviewed  ATSA provisions related to the SPP and our related reports, and  interviewed DHS officials about the SAFETY Act\u2019s applicability to the SPP.  To assess the status of TSA\u2019s efforts to achieve cost-savings in screener  operations through the SPP, we reviewed the contracts and pilot program  extension contracts TSA executed with the current private screening  contractors, TSA\u2019s contracting policies and guidance, and the Federal  Acquisition Regulation. We also reviewed an independent consultant\u2019s  study prepared for TSA that evaluated the costs of screening at 15 airports,  including all 5 pilot program airports. In addition, we interviewed TSA  officials about their choice of contract type to award for the SPP. To  assess TSA\u2019s progress in developing and implementing performance goals  and measures to assess the performance of the private screening  contractors that participate in the SPP, we reviewed TSA\u2019s draft  performance quality assurance surveillance and award fee plan for the  SPP.

ATSA established the TSA and charged it with  responsibility for strengthening security in all modes of transportation,  including aviation. One of the most significant changes mandated by ATSA  was the shift from the use of private-sector screeners to perform airport  screening operations to the use of federal screeners. Prior to ATSA,  passenger and checked baggage screening had been performed by private  screening companies under contract to airlines. ATSA required TSA to  create a federal workforce to assume the job of conducting passenger and  checked baggage screening at commercial airports. The federal workforce  was to be in place by November 2002. At the same time, ATSA mandated  that TSA establish a 2-year pilot program using qualified private screening  companies to screen passengers and checked baggage, with TSA  oversight. Pursuant to section 108 of ATSA, TSA selected five airports,  one from each airport security category, to participate in the pilot  program. TSA also competitively selected four contractors (one  contractor serves two airports) to conduct screening at the pilot airports.  Table 1 lists the airports and private screening contractors that  participated in the pilot program.", "Section 108 further permitted the more than 400 commercial airports using  federal passenger and checked baggage screeners to apply to TSA to use  private rather than federal screeners at the conclusion of the pilot.  Beginning on November 19, 2004, all commercial airports with federal  security screening became eligible to apply to opt-out of using federal  screeners through the newly established SPP. An airport operator may  submit to TSA an application to have the screening of passengers and  checked baggage at an airport be carried out by the screening personnel of  a qualified private screening company, under a contract entered into  between the private screening contractor and TSA. In addition to assessing  airport applications for using private screeners, as part of the SPP, TSA  plans to select qualified private screening companies that apply and meet  ATSA and TSA requirements to conduct screening, including airports that  seek to apply to serve as the private screening contractor.", "The five airports selected to participate in the pilot program have applied  and been accepted to the SPP. TSA awarded, on a non-competitive basis,  new extension contracts (that replaced the original pilot program  contracts) to the incumbent private screening contractors at the five pilot  program airports effective November 19, 2004. The contracts enable the  four private screening contractors to continue performing screening  operations through May 18, 2006. As in the original pilot program  contracts, the new contracts require private screening contractors to  adhere to several ATSA provisions, including that:  the level of screening services and protection provided at the airport  under the contract will be equal to or greater than the level that would  be provided at the airport by federal government personnel;  the private screening company be owned and controlled by a citizen of  the United States;  the private screening company, at a minimum, meet employment  standards, compensation and benefits rates, and performance  requirements that apply to federal screeners; and    all private screener candidates meet the same minimum qualifications  as federal screeners, including U.S. citizenship (or being a national of  the United States), high school diploma or equivalent, English  proficiency, and pass a criminal background check.", "TSA will make the final decision to approve any application submitted for  participation in the SPP and reserves the right to consider airport specific  threat intelligence and an airport\u2019s record of compliance with security  regulations and security requirements to determine the timing of any  transition to private screening.

The FAR provides  that when a reasonable basis for firm pricing does not exist, other contract  types (such as cost reimbursement) should be considered, and  negotiations should be directed toward selecting a contract type that will  appropriately tie profit to contractor performance. As a service continues  to be contracted over time, however, and after experience provides a basis  for firmer pricing, the FAR advises that cost risk should shift to the  contractor and a fixed-price contract should be considered. The FAR  specifically states that contracting officers should avoid protracted use of  a cost-reimbursement contract after experience provides a basis for firmer  pricing.

This company  administers a computer-based aptitude test, mental and physical tests,  and conducts background checks at regional assessment centers. The  contractor is under no obligation to accept these applicants.", "Option 2: Contractors may use TSA\u2019s assessment company for the  aptitude test alone, and develop and implement additional assessment  activities on their own, provided they meet ATSA requirements and  TSA guidance.", "According to TSA officials, all four private screening contractors have  selected from these two options for hiring screeners. The contractors\u2019  views about the hiring process were mixed. For example, one contractor  we interviewed said that because TSA has allowed it to conduct its own  assessments, the length of the entire assessment process has been reduced  from several months to 2 weeks. This contractor, which was using option  two, is now conducting key parts of the assessment process. According to  this contractor, its use of option two has resulted in a more efficient,  effective, and significantly less costly process. A second contractor using  option two stated that it had established a new hire recruitment,  assessment, and training program. According to this contractor, its use of  option two has resulted in its ability to identify more qualified screener  candidates, improve screener retention, and fill screener vacancies on an  as needed basis. However, the other two contractors remained concerned  about the length of time the assessment process lasts. One of these  contractors stated that the duration of the process was still so long that  potential screeners found other jobs first and dropped out of  consideration. This contractor, which was using option two, proposed  using FSD staff to conduct the assessments to streamline and shorten the  assessment process. According to TSA officials, TSA did not accept this  suggestion because TSA\u2019s Office of Human Resources determined it would  have been too costly to allow FSD staff to conduct the assessments. TSA  officials stated that they offered the contractor the same assessment  options that are available to all airports with federal screeners. Officials  further stated that they will continue to examine all aspects of the  assessment process in an effort to offer greater efficiency and flexibility in  screener hiring for both federal and contract screeners."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TSA Has Taken Steps to Clarify SPP Roles and Responsibilities between Federal and Private Sectors, but Questions about Division of Labor Remain", "paragraphs": ["While TSA has defined the roles and responsibilities for FSDs, FSD staff,  and private screening contractors, among others, in its August 2005 SPP  transition plan, the details contained in this plan have not been  communicated to or shared with private screening contractors. TSA and  SPP procurement officials stated that they consider the transition plan to  be an internal document that TSA does not intend to distribute outside of  the agency. However, officials stated that the information on roles and  responsibilities under the SPP would be available to prospective private  screening contractors as part of the SPP contracting process. Additionally,  TSA SPP officials stated that they presumed that FSDs had communicated  this information to the current private screening contractors. Further, TSA  officials stated that TSA\u2019s June 2004 guidance on the SPP provides  information on roles and responsibilities of SPP stakeholders. However,  our review of the guidance found that it did not clearly delineate the roles  and responsibilities of TSA airport staff and the private screening  contractors. For example, the guidance did not include any information on  the roles and responsibilities of some TSA airport staff, such as screening  managers and training coordinators, and did not clarify how their roles  and responsibilities would differ from those of the private screening  contractors. Additionally, the four private screening contractors we  interviewed had questions about the roles and responsibilities of TSA staff  at the airports they served, including screening managers and stated that,  in their view, TSA had not clearly defined the roles and responsibilities of  TSA staff at airports participating in the SPP. When asked whether FSD  and FSD staff roles and responsibilities were clear, one contractor stated  that he did not believe that TSA had recognized that the roles of training  managers and screening managers at airports using federal or private  screeners are different. A second contractor stated that, in his view, TSA  had not standardized the roles and responsibilities of TSA airport staff  across the five airports currently using private screeners. Similarly, a third  contractor stated that TSA roles and responsibilities need to be more well- defined, particularly the role of FSD airport staff and TSA local contract  staff. Finally, the fourth contractor stated that the separation of roles and  responsibilities has been a major challenge on a daily basis in part because  TSA staff at screening checkpoints assert control and impose operational  changes at the checkpoints\u2014tasks that the contractor believes it is  responsible for, rather than TSA staff. This contractor identified the need  for TSA to clearly define the roles of the various stakeholders involved in  the SPP and to establish guidelines on TSA\u2019s oversight and regulatory  responsibilities at airports participating in the SPP.", "In September 2005, in reporting on the ability of FSDs to address airport  security needs, we stated that TSA airport stakeholders (including airport  operators) at some of the airports we visited stated that the FSD\u2019s role  was not sufficiently clear, and at least one stakeholder at every airport we  visited said such information had never been communicated to them. We  recommended that DHS direct TSA to communicate the authority of the  FSD position, as warranted, to FSDs and all airport stakeholders. In  response, TSA agreed to update the role of the FSD and communicate this  information to airport stakeholders. As of December 2005, however, TSA  had not yet implemented this recommendation, but stated that the matter  is being considered by a TSA steering committee. In addition, a consulting  firm that evaluated the private screening pilot program in April 2004  recommended that TSA clearly delineate the roles and responsibilities  among federal and private screening managers and their staff and include  this information in its contracts with the private screening contractors.  Based on our review of the June 2004 guidance on the SPP and the  contracts awarded to the current private screening contractors in  November 2004, TSA had not included this information. TSA officials  stated that they plan to clearly delineate roles and responsibilities of the  FSD, FSD staff, and private screening contractors in the forthcoming SPP  contracts.", "According to our standards for internal controls, agency management  should ensure there are adequate means of communicating with external  stakeholders on issues that may have a significant impact on the agency\u2019s  ability to achieve its goals. By not sharing detailed information on roles,  responsibilities, and authorities described in the SPP transition plan with  all FSDs and private screening contractors, TSA may be missing an  opportunity to support the effective performance and management of  essential functions related to the screening process.

However, despite TSA\u2019s use of cost-savings as a basis for a  portion of the award fees, opportunities for government cost-savings may  be limited because under the cost-reimbursement contracts the  government bears most of the cost risk\u2014the risk of paying more than it  expected. TSA plans to shift more cost risk to contractors by competitively  awarding fixed-price-award fee contracts for screening services at the four  smallest airports that will participate in the SPP.

However, opportunities for cost savings are somewhat limited  because of various requirements that contractors must meet in performing  the contract. Specifically, under ATSA, private screening companies must  provide compensation and other benefits to contract screeners at a level  not less than that provided to federal screeners. Further, the contracts  require that contractors ensure that security checkpoints are staffed in  accordance with TSA\u2019s standard operating procedures and other  government requirements and that the screeners have the qualifications  and training established by the government. While these government  airport security standards must be met, TSA has structured its existing  contracts to provide some incentives to contractors for cost savings.  Specifically, over the last 3 years, TSA has awarded cost-reimbursement  contracts with an award fee component for screening services at four of  the five airports currently using private screeners. These contracts  provide for payment of allowable incurred costs, to the extent prescribed  in the contract (typically up to a specified cost ceiling). In addition, the  government also agrees to award a separate amount (base fee) fixed at  inception of the contract and an award amount (award fee) that the  contractor may earn in whole or in part during performance that is  sufficient to provide motivation for excellence in such areas as quality,  technical approach, and cost-effective management. The amount of the  award fee to be paid is determined by the government\u2019s judgmental  evaluation of the contractor\u2019s performance in terms of the criteria stated  in the contract.", "Because cost-savings and contract management account for 20 percent of  the award fee determination for the current screening services contracts,  these contracts do provide some incentive for contractor cost efficiency.  Specifically, the award fee plan establishes the expectation that  contractors will provide screening services with cost efficiencies and  innovation, while meeting the security standards, mission objectives, and  compensation levels required by ATSA and TSA, respectively. These cost  and contract management factors include:    Overtime/personnel costs-\u2013evaluates the contractor\u2019s ability to control  overtime and personnel costs.", "Innovation/continuous improvement-\u2013evaluates the contractor\u2019s ability  to build on previous experiences/accomplishments and utilize  innovative approaches, techniques and tools.", "Other direct/indirect cost-\u2013evaluates the contractor\u2019s ability to control  direct labor cost and overtime costs and its ability to effectively  manage its subcontract costs through use of competition to the  greatest extent practicable and through documented cost analysis  substantiating the reasonableness of subcontract costs.

Specifically, under cost-reimbursement contracts, the government must  reimburse the contractor for all allowable costs as provided in the  contract.  TSA plans to shift most cost risk to its contractors by moving to  a fixed-price-award fee contract in the next 1 to 2 years. A fixed-price type  of contract places upon the contractor the maximum risk and full  responsibility for all costs and resulting profit or loss, providing maximum  incentive for the contractor to control costs and perform efficiently.  Further, in a competitive environment, pricing by contractors for a fixed- price contract would be subject to marketplace pressures that would  provide incentives for the contractor to control costs and reduce prices in  order to win the contract. The award fee component of a fixed-price  contract is used to motivate the contractor by relating the amount of profit  or fee payable under the contract to the contractor\u2019s performance in the  areas of operations, management, contract compliance, and human  resources. Because the contract is fixed-priced, the award fee portion  does not assess cost management.", "TSA has awarded a fixed-price-award-fee contract to the contractor  providing screening services at the smallest of the five airports using  private screeners, while the contracts for screening services for the other  four airports remain as cost-reimbursement contracts. TSA officials stated  that the fixed-price contract was awarded for the one airport (on a  noncompetitive basis) because costs there were considered predictable  and therefore a reasonable basis for firm pricing by the contractor existed.  Table 3 provides information on TSA\u2019s contracts with current private  screening contractors.", "TSA officials stated that as of February 2006, TSA had awarded, was  planning to award, or was in the process of awarding, additional fixed- price contracts on a competitive basis for screening services at three other  small airports (categories II, III, and IV) under the SPP. TSA officials  acknowledged that cost-reimbursement contracts place most of the cost  risk on the government, rather than the contractor, but said the agency  would not award fixed-price contracts for screening services at the two  larger airports using private screening contractors for another 1 to 2 years.  TSA officials stated that they would not award fixed-price contracts to  these contractors because they did not know the costs of screening at the  larger airports, where they believe costs are variable, and therefore they  believe that TSA would be at greater risk of awarding a contract for a  higher cost than might actually be necessary. TSA officials acknowledged  that TSA already had, through an independent cost-data study, identified  and collected some cost and performance data on passengers and checked  baggage screening operations at 15 airports with private and federal  screeners, including four category X and four category I airports and all  five pilot program airports. This study, which was completed in October  2004, looked in particular at cost drivers\u2014factors that contribute to  overall expenses. Moreover, an April 2004 studyconducted for TSA by a  consulting firm estimated how much TSA spent for screening operations at  each of the five pilot program airports\u2014including contract payments as  well as costs borne by TSA\u2014and compared the results with estimates of  how much TSA would have spent had it actually conducted the screening  operations at those airports.", "TSA officials stated that the cost information identified in these two  studies provided useful data to help determine the costs of screening at  airports currently using private screeners, but said additional information  is needed to assist in transitioning to fixed-price contracts for screening  services at larger airports. Specifically, TSA officials stated that additional  cost information based on the actual costs of participating in the SPP is  needed for the larger airports because the SPP contracts differ in two key  ways from the pilot and extension contracts that TSA previously awarded.  First, the SPP contracts will include specific performance measures and  targets that the contractors must meet. Second, the contracts will allow  for contractors to recommend and, if approved, implement innovations,  and to select among options for assessing screener candidates and training  screeners. The officials stated that it would therefore be difficult for  prospective SPP contractors for the larger airports to accurately estimate  the costs of providing screening services for a fixed-price contract for  larger airports. As a result, TSA officials stated that they needed up to   2 additional years to determine estimated costs in order to potentially  transition to fixed-price contracts, and therefore would continue using  cost-reimbursement contracts with the largest airports (categories X and  I) for that period. By using competitive bidding procedures to award  fixed-price contracts to qualified firms, as TSA contemplates, TSA will also  help to bring marketplace pressures to bear on competitors\u2019 proposed  costs and fees or prices and could enable TSA to maximize contractors\u2019  incentives to control costs and ensure that the contractor, rather than the  government, will bear more of the cost risk associated with performance  of private screening operations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Performance Goals and Measures Developed by TSA to Assess SPP Contractors Have Not Been Approved by DHS", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "TSA Has Developed Performance Measures to Evaluate Security, Cost, Innovation, and Other Facets of Contractor Performance under the SPP, but DHS Has Not Approved These Measures", "paragraphs": ["TSA has developed performance goals and draft measures and targets to  assess the performance of private screening contractors under the SPP,  but DHS has not yet approved them or established a time frame for doing  so.

Performance measures are the yardsticks to assess an agency\u2019s  success in meeting performance goals, while a performance target is a  desired level of performance expressed as a tangible, measurable  objective, against which actual achievement will be compared. Together,  these performance metrics are used to assess an agency\u2019s progress toward  achieving the results expected. We reported in April 2004 that without data  to assess the performance of private screening operations, TSA and airport  operators have limited information from which to plan for the possible  transition of airports from a federal screening system to a private system.  In our November 2004 report, we stated that TSA had begun drafting  performance measures for this purpose.

The performance indicators for the  four measures for which targets have not yet been set by TSA are to be  specific to each airport participating in the SPP. TSA stated that it has  established baseline data for these four performance measures describing  how federal screeners or private screening contractors have actually  performed at individual airports, over time, as well as an overall average of  performance. Using the baseline data as a starting point, performance  targets would then be set for each airport. For example, if a baseline  shows that historically, all airports met the performance measure for  screener recertification pass rates 70 percent of the time, TSA would set  the target measure at or above 70 percent. TSA officials stated that they  are currently working to identify incentives to encourage better results at  airports that have historically not met TSA\u2019s performance standards for  passenger and checked baggage screening. TSA is considering providing  financial incentives for a limited time in an effort to quickly move its  airports to meet TSA\u2019s baseline level of performance.", "TSA officials stated that DHS must approve the draft performance goals,  measures, and targets before they can be finalized, but as of January 2006,  DHS had not yet done so, and had not set a deadline for doing so.

Until the draft performance measures are  finalized by DHS, TSA will not be able to implement its performance  measures for the SPP. According to our standards for internal controls,  agencies must have systems in place for measuring, reporting, and  monitoring program performance. In addition, as we have reported in our  prior work on the importance of using the Government Performance  Results Act (GPRA) to assist with oversight and decision making, credible  performance information is essential for the Congress and the executive  branch to accurately assess agencies\u2019 progress toward achieving their  goals. Further, the draft measures and targets TSA developed for the SPP  will also be used by DHS to determine whether to award private screening  contractors certification status under the SAFETY Act.

As of January 2006, only 7 of over  400 airports that were eligible to apply to participate in the SPP had  submitted an application. While we did not attempt to identify the reasons  for the small number of applicants to the SPP, a contributing factor may be  airports\u2019 concerns about liability. In November 2004, we reported that half  of the airport operators we interviewed (13 of 26) were concerned about  airport liability in the event that a private screener failed to detect a threat  object that led to a terrorist incident. Aviation associations that represent  hundreds of airports have also identified liability as a major concern  among airports. Although Congress\u2019 recent effort to shield airports from  liability in the fiscal year 2006 DHS appropriations act may address this  concern, there have been no additional applicants since the act was  passed. Furthermore, by extending a level of federal liability protection  through the SAFETY Act to current private screening contractors, DHS  has laid the groundwork for future contractors to potentially receive  comparable protection. Ongoing concerns among prospective participants  in the SPP regarding the availability of the most extensive level of  protection under the SAFETY Act\u2014certification\u2014may be alleviated once  TSA finalizes a standard of performance for private screening contractors  that DHS can utilize to determine if contractors have demonstrated that  they will perform as intended.", "As TSA moves forward with implementing the SPP, several opportunities  exist for strengthening the management and oversight of the program.  First, SPP applicants need clear information on what their roles and  responsibilities are to be at airports where a privatized screener workforce  operates with federal oversight. The absence of such guidance may affect  the ability of responsible officials to effectively and efficiently manage  screening checkpoints and the screener program in general. Additionally,  without clear and specific information on roles and responsibilities of  private screening contractors under the SPP, it may be difficult for  prospective SPP contractors to develop an informed estimate of their  personnel needs and associated costs under the SPP\u2014information that is  needed for the competitive bidding process.", "Second, in addition to concerns about liability protection, airports in the  past expressed concerns about the degree of management control they  would have over various aspects of screening services. Since then, TSA  has provided additional operational flexibilities to private screening  contractors, such as granting contractors and FSDs more input and  flexibility in the screener hiring process. Contractors have reported  efficiencies they have achieved as a result of these flexibilities, including  using fewer screeners than authorized by TSA. Although steps have been  taken to address concerns regarding airports\u2019 liability and the need for  contractors to have additional management control over various aspects  of screening services, only two additional airports, in addition to the five  pilot program airports, applied to participate in the SPP.  We believe that  identifying the underlying reasons for the small number of applicants to  the SPP may be helpful to TSA and others in assessing what, if any,  changes may be needed to the program.", "Third, while TSA is not required to adhere to the Federal Acquisition  Regulation with respect to contracting practices, it has acknowledged the  advantages of fixed-price contracts in situations where costs are  reasonably understood. To this end, TSA has begun the contract award  process for the four smaller airports using a fixed-price type of contract.  TSA has decided to continue to use cost-plus-award-fee contracts rather  than fixed-price contracts with private screening contractors providing  services at the larger airports for at least an additional 1 to 2 years so that  it can continue to collect information on the costs of screening operations  at these airports. Using fixed-price contracts, as TSA plans to do, would  result in the contractors assuming substantial cost responsibility from the  government related to screener operations and help ensure that private  screening contractors deliver the most cost-effective services, while  ensuring that TSA and ATSA requirements related to maintaining airport  security are met. The use of competitively awarded fixed-price contracts  should provide a built-in incentive for contractors to identify cost-saving  opportunities and innovations, which in turn may help reduce costs of  screening contracts at the larger airports using private screeners. TSA  could make these cost-savings opportunities available to airports with  federal screeners, as appropriate, thereby transferring the efficiencies  identified by the private sector to the federal government.", "Finally, until DHS approves the performance goals, measures, and targets  for the SPP, it will not have a mechanism in place beyond the ongoing  contracts for assessing the performance of private screening contractors.

Further, we reviewed TSA\u2019s transition plan and other  SPP guidance to identify TSA\u2019s current and planned approaches for  identifying screening program costs. We also reviewed TSA\u2019s activity- based costing study that assessed the cost of passenger and checked  baggage screening operations at 15 airports, including the 5 that  participated in the 2-year pilot program using private screeners. We  determined that the results of the activity-based costing study were  sufficiently reliable for the purpose of our review. Finally, to gather  perspectives on opportunities for cost-savings under the SPP, we  interviewed TSA SPP and contracting officials, the four contractors  currently providing screening services, the seven airport directors who  applied to the SPP and the FSDs at these airports, and representatives of  the American Association of Airport Executives and the Airports Council  International. We did not review TSA\u2019s actual determination of the amount  of contractor award fee. Nor did we review the conduct of TSA\u2019s  performance evaluation boards or fee determining official in evaluating  contractor performance against award fee criteria (including cost-savings)  and determining the amount of the contractors\u2019 award fee. However, we  did verify that TSA had evaluated contractor performance (including cost- savings) in making award fee determinations.", "To assess TSA\u2019s progress in developing and implementing performance  goals, measures, and targets to assess the performance of the private  screening contractors who will be participating in the SPP, we reviewed  the terms of TSA\u2019s award fee process specified in the current contracts  and TSA\u2019s draft quality assurance surveillance and award fee plan. We also  reviewed TSA\u2019s June 2004 guidance on the SPP, other guidance-related  material TSA developed for private screening contractors and airports  regarding the SPP, TSA\u2019s contracts for the private screening contractors  currently providing screening services, TSA testimony at congressional  hearings, and our prior reports that addressed issues related to the SPP  and the use of private-sector screeners. A listing of our prior reports is  contained in appendix IV. Additionally, we interviewed TSA headquarters  officials responsible for the SPP.", "We performed our work from March 2005 through March 2006 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, David Alexander, C.
