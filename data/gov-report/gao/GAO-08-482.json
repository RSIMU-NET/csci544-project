GAO determined (1) how EPA regions implement the SPCC program, (2) the data EPA has to implement and evaluate the program, and (3) whether some states' tank programs suggest ways for EPA to improve its program. GAO surveyed all 10 EPA regions and interviewed officials in EPA and six states selected on the basis of experts' recommendations, among other criteria."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["EPA allows regional offices flexibility to implement the SPCC program according to their individual circumstances. These differences account, at least in part, for regional variations in the number of SPCC inspections. According to GAO's survey, during fiscal years 2004 through 2006, EPA regions conducted 3,359 SPCC inspections--less than 1 percent of EPA's estimate of SPCC facilities--ranging from 184 in Region 10 to 745 in Region 6. Furthermore, because of regional differences in the number of inspections and the enforcement mechanisms used, the number of SPCC enforcement actions also varied. While EPA allows regional flexibility, it has begun implementing SPCC policies and procedures to promote consistency in how the SPCC regulations are interpreted and enforced. EPA has information on only a portion of the facilities subject to the SPCC rule, hindering its ability to identify and effectively target facilities for inspection and enforcement, and to evaluate whether the program is achieving its goals. Because facilities subject to the SPCC rule do not have to report to EPA, the agency can only estimate the universe of SPCC-regulated facilities and must try to identify them through such means as oil spill data, state referrals, and Internet searches. Through inspections, EPA determines if the facility is subject to the rule. While inspections of known SPCC facilities are generally risk-based, the risk assessments exclude the large number of estimated SPCC facilities that have not yet been identified and that may pose more serious threats than those currently targeted for inspection. EPA is developing a national database to promote standard data collection across regions and expand the facility information available to regional managers. However, this database is limited to previously inspected facilities and will not enable EPA to identify SPCC facilities beyond those already known. Ultimately, incomplete information on which facilities are subject to the SPCC rule, and where and how often leaks may occur, prevents EPA from effectively targeting inspections to facilities that potentially pose the highest risks. Furthermore, EPA does not have performance measures to examine the program's effectiveness. EPA is developing additional measures, but without more complete data on the SPCC-regulated universe, these measures cannot gauge the program's accomplishments. The tank inspection programs of Florida, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, New Mexico, and Virginia can provide EPA with insight on potential improvements to the SPCC program. For example, five of the six states use tank registration and reporting systems to collect data on oil storage facilities, giving them information on the universe of facilities subject to state regulations. These states can therefore inspect all their facilities or target those they believe present the highest risks of spills. By taking a similar approach, EPA would have more complete data for setting inspection priorities based on risk. Furthermore, because these states have detailed knowledge of their facilities, EPA could benefit from increased coordination with them, when, for example, it identifies facilities and targets inspections."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Industrial and other facilities store billions of gallons of oil\u2014from  Industrial and other facilities store billions of gallons of oil\u2014from  petroleum products to vegetable-based cooking oils\u2014in aboveground  petroleum products to vegetable-based cooking oils\u2014in aboveground  storage tanks at various locations throughout the United States.

EPA  directly administers the SPCC program, in contrast to some other EPA  programs, which the agency authorizes the states to implement. The Clean  Water Act does not provide EPA with the authority to authorize states to  implement the program in its place. To ensure that facility owners and  operators are meeting SPCC requirements, EPA regional personnel inspect  regulated facilities to determine their compliance with regulations. EPA\u2019s  Office of Emergency Management (OEM) and Office of Enforcement and  Compliance Assurance (OECA) support the regions by developing and  amending SPCC regulations and compliance assistance materials,  providing general guidance on how to conduct inspections and  enforcement actions, facilitating communication and coordination among  regions, and conducting research on the incidence of oil spills, cleanups,  and environmental harm. OEM and OECA provide general guidance to  regional offices on how to implement the SPCC program, and regional  offices decide which facilities to inspect and when and how to proceed  with administrative or civil judicial enforcement actions consistent with  national guidance.", "In 1989, we reported that certain areas of the SPCC program lacked either  the necessary data or procedures to ensure consistent and effective  program implementation and recommended ways to strengthen the  program. Among other actions, we recommended that EPA (1) develop an  inventory of aboveground oil storage facilities because it had little  information on facilities that might be regulated by the SPCC rule and (2)  provide uniform instructions to its regions for conducting and  documenting inspections at SPCC facilities. In 1995, we reported that EPA  had taken steps to address these recommendations but had not fully  implemented them.", "While EPA is solely responsible for ensuring that facilities comply with  SPCC regulations, a number of states have established their own parallel  regulations and programs whose goal\u2014preventing leaks from  aboveground oil storage tanks\u2014is similar to that of the SPCC program.  These programs may differ from EPA\u2019s program in type and extent of  regulations and in their implementation. For example, while EPA\u2019s  program regulates those facilities that could discharge quantities of oil into  or upon U.S. navigable waters and adjoining shorelines, some states  regulate facilities that have the potential to spill oil into groundwater and  surface waters. In addition, some states do not have separate, formal spill  prevention programs, but may inspect aboveground storage tanks as part  of other regulations, such as state fire prevention codes. Because states  differ in their approaches to regulating aboveground storage tanks, in  some states, both EPA and the state may inspect some facilities, while in  other states, EPA may be the sole regulatory agency inspecting oil storage  facilities.", "To hold federal agencies systematically accountable for achieving results  from their programs, such as EPA\u2019s SPCC Program, the Congress passed  the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993. The act  requires EPA and other federal agencies to develop strategic plans  covering at least 5 years and submit them to the Congress and the Director  of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). In addition, GPRA  requires agencies to prepare annual performance plans that establish goals  for the upcoming fiscal year that are aligned with the agencies\u2019 long-term  strategic goals that are described in their strategic plans. These annual  performance plans must include results-oriented annual goals that are  linked to program activities and indicators that the agency will use to  measure performance against these goals.", "In this context, you asked us to review EPA\u2019s SPCC program. Specifically,  we (1) determined how EPA regions implement the SPCC program,  especially inspection and enforcement activities, (2) identified the data  EPA has available to implement and evaluate the SPCC program, and (3)  examined the extent to which tank programs in selected states offer  examples of ways that EPA might improve its implementation of the SPCC  program.", "To review EPA regions\u2019 practices in implementing the SPCC program, we  surveyed all 10 EPA regions to determine, among other things, how they  identify facilities to inspect, the number of inspections each region has  conducted in recent years, how many SPCC inspectors have received  training, and the number of those inspected facilities that complied with  SPCC regulations and, for those that did not comply, the number of  enforcement actions taken. We also discussed the regions\u2019 responses to  our survey in detail with regional officials. To determine what SPCC data  EPA officials have available, we spoke with EPA officials to identify the  agency\u2019s data sources for enforcing SPCC regulations, determine how the  agency uses the data, and determine the data\u2019s overall limitations. Finally,  we interviewed officials from aboveground oil storage tank programs in  six states\u2014Florida, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, New Mexico, and  Virginia\u2014to understand the nature of their programs and how they are  implemented, to identify practices that might be applied to EPA\u2019s program,  and to learn about any coordination between these states\u2019 programs and  EPA\u2019s SPCC program.

The  President subsequently delegated this responsibility to EPA. In 1973, to  meet this responsibility as it relates to oil discharges, EPA issued the Oil  Pollution Prevention Regulation\u2014also referred to as the SPCC rule\u2014 which outlined the actions oil storage facilities that store greater than  certain quantities of oil must take to prevent, prepare for, and respond to  oil spills before they reach U.S. navigable waters or adjoining shorelines.  In 1974, the SPCC rule took effect and EPA initiated the SPCC program.  Under this program, regulated facilities must implement procedures and  methods and have certain equipment to prevent oil discharges from  reaching U.S. navigable waters and adjoining shorelines. SPCC requires  facilities to prepare oil spill prevention plans that spell out (1) design,  operation, and maintenance procedures to prevent spills from occurring  and (2) countermeasures to control, contain, clean up, and mitigate the  effects of an oil spill.", "In 1994, in response to directives in the Oil Pollution Act of 1990\u2014which  amended the Clean Water Act\u2014EPA established specific requirements for  a subclass of SPCC facilities, including that these facilities develop and  implement Facility Response Plans (FRP). According to EPA, there are  about 4,100 FRP facilities nationwide\u2014less than 1 percent of the  estimated SPCC-regulated facilities. FRP facilities are those that, because  of their location, could reasonably be expected to cause substantial harm  to the environment by discharging oil into or on U.S. navigable waters,  adjoining shorelines, or the exclusive economic zone. Under EPA  regulations, facilities are considered FRP facilities if they have (1) 42,000  gallons or more of oil storage capacity and transfer oil over water or (2) 1  million gallons or more of oil storage capacity and meet other specific  criteria, such as risking injury to sensitive environments or the shutting  down of public drinking water intake. Owing to the higher risk they pose,  FRP facilities are subject to more stringent rules and regulations than  other SPCC facilities, primarily focusing on response preparedness. For  example, FRP facilities must submit for EPA\u2019s review and possible  approval, plans that identify the individual having full authority to  implement removal actions at the facility and the resources available to  remove a discharge, and describe the training, testing, and response  actions of persons at the facility, among other things. Even though FRP  facilities are subject to more stringent requirements than other SPCC  facilities, they are required to have SPCC plans and are also inspected  through the SPCC program.", "In response to some major oil spills, our 1989 report, and similar findings  by an EPA taskforce, the agency proposed revisions to the SPCC rule in  1991, 1993, and 1997 and finalized these amendments in 2002. These  amendments made over 30 changes that EPA considers major to the SPCC  rule, such as including new subparts outlining the requirements for various  classes of oil; revising the applicability of the regulation; amending the  requirements for completing SPCC plans; and strengthening tank integrity  testing requirements, among other changes. The final rule also contained a  number of provisions designed to decrease regulatory burden while  preserving environmental protection. Since then, EPA  in 2006, made several major changes to the SPCC rule to further reduce  regulatory burden, including an amendment that allows certain smaller  facilities, identified as \u201cqualified facilities,\u201d storing up to 10,000 gallons of  oil, to prepare self-certified SPCC plans and in October 2007, proposed further changes to streamline the SPCC  requirements to, among other things, reduce regulatory burden on  industries such as farms and oil production facilities. The agency plans to  make these changes final in late 2008.", "Although EPA amended the SPCC rule in 2002 and 2006, the new  requirements have not taken effect because EPA extended the date by  which facilities were to come into compliance with these revised  requirements in 2003, 2004, 2006, and 2007. That is, owners and operators  of facilities operating on or before August 16, 2002, must continue to  maintain their SPCC plans based on current SPCC requirements and then  must amend them to ensure compliance with the amended requirements  by July 1, 2009. Facilities beginning operations after August 16, 2002, have  until July 1, 2009, to prepare and implement a plan. EPA made this latest  extension to, among other things, give owners and operators of facilities  the time to fully understand the 2002 and 2006 amendments and the  further revisions that are planned for implementation in 2008, and to make  changes to their facilities and plans. We reported on the reasonableness of  the economic analyses EPA performed in support of the 2002 and 2006  amendments to the SPCC rule in July 2007. We found that the economic  analysis of the 2002 amendments had several limitations that reduced its  usefulness for assessing the amendments\u2019 benefits and costs. We also  found that although EPA\u2019s economic analysis of the 2006 amendments  addressed several of the 2002 limitations, it also had some limitations that  reduced its usefulness for assessing the amendments\u2019 benefits and costs.", "EPA delegates implementation of the program to its 10 regional offices,  which carry out inspection programs to ensure that the facilities are in  compliance with the SPCC regulations. Figure 1 shows the locations of  EPA\u2019s 10 regions.", "When EPA inspects a facility, it typically sends one or more inspectors  from the region to the facility. These visits generally begin with a list of  questions about the facility, such as confirming that the facility meets the  criteria for the SPCC rule and asking whether it has an SPCC plan. The  inspectors will then review the plan to see if it contains information  required under the SPCC rule, including facility diagrams, training of  employees, security measures, containment structures, and records of  facility inspection and tests. The inspectors then tour the facility and  examine how the plan is being implemented by, for example, inspecting  equipment and taking notes and photographs. After the inspection, a  compliance determination that completes the inspection process for that  facility is made unless observed noncompliance warrants another fact- finding inspection.", "Before informing facility owners or operators of any violations found,  inspectors may discuss their observations with supervisors and  enforcement and compliance staff to determine what actions to take. This  process generally takes several weeks, but can take up to several months,  depending on the severity of the violations. Determining whether a penalty  is appropriate or determining appropriate penalties for violations depends,  among other things, on the seriousness of the violation, the economic  benefit to the facility owner or operator resulting from the violation, the  degree of the facility owner\u2019s or operator\u2019s culpability in the violation, and  any history of violations at the facility. When a violation is found, EPA may  send a \u201cnotice of deficiency,\u201d \u201cletter of violation,\u201d or similar notice to the  owner or operator. The owner or operator could also receive an  Expedited Settlement Agreement (ESA) offer to settle the violations by  paying a penalty between $500 and $2,500 and promptly correcting any  violations found. Finally, EPA could seek the issuance of an  administrative penalty order against the owner or operator, or submit a  judicial referral for penalties to the Department of Justice. Typically, the  investigation is considered closed when, in cases where there is a  deficiency but not a penalty, corrective actions are taken, or when a  penalty is issued, when the penalty payment is received and corrective  action is performed.", "EPA headquarters annually determines how funds for implementing the  Oil Program are allocated to regional offices. The budget allocation for the  Oil Program combines funds for oil spill prevention (SPCC), preparedness  (FRP and area contingency planning), and response infrastructure. As  shown in table 1, the total operational budget allocated for EPA Oil  Program activities in fiscal year 2006 was $12 million and, in fiscal year  2007, $12.3 million. In fiscal year 2006, EPA allocated between 5 and 10  percent of the total operational budget for Oil Program activities to each  EPA regional office. In fiscal year 2007, EPA\u2019s allocation for Oil Program  activities to each EPA regional office ranged between 5 and 9 percent.  EPA regional offices determine how they will use the allocated funds to  implement the SPCC program in their regions, including how they will  manage inspection and enforcement activities.", "According to EPA headquarters and regional officials, most funds for oil  spill response come out of another fund\u2014the Oil Spill Liability Trust  Fund\u2014which is managed by the U.S. Coast Guard. Although EPA receives  some funding from the emergency response portion of the Oil Spill  Liability Trust Fund for response activities, there are no funds provided  for additional staff to conduct inspection activities. The staff that perform  other oil spill activities, including SPCC inspections, also conduct  response activities. Thus, when there is a high level of response activity,  there may be an impact on prevention and preparedness activities,  including the number of SPCC inspections.", "In our 1989 report, we made several recommendations to EPA\u2019s  Administrator to strengthen SPCC regulations and the program. Among  other things, to strengthen SPCC regulations, we recommended that EPA  require that (1) aboveground storage tanks be built and tested in  accordance with industry or other specified standards, (2) facilities  develop response plans for spilled oil beyond the facilities\u2019 boundaries,  and (3) storm water drainage systems be designed and operated to prevent  oil from passing through them. EPA included provisions in the 1991 SPCC  proposed amendments to implement the recommendations regarding tank  integrity testing and storm water drainage systems and finalized these  amendments in the 2002 rule. In 1994, EPA partially addressed our  recommendation regarding submitting response plans when it began  requiring FRP facilities to submit plans as required by the Oil Pollution  Prevention Act of 1990. This act required the President to issue regulations  for response plans for oil or hazardous substances for facilities that,  because of their location, could reasonably be expected to cause  substantial harm to the environment by discharging into or on U.S.  navigable waters and adjoining shorelines, or the exclusive economic  zone. EPA, however, did not require response plans from other SPCC  facilities.", "Furthermore, our 1989 report recommended that EPA take the following  four actions to improve its implementation and evaluation of the SPCC  program:    better define the training needs for the agency\u2019s SPCC inspectors because  each of EPA\u2019s regions had established a training program for SPCC  inspectors using different program styles, curricula, and manuals;   develop instructions for performing and documenting inspections because  EPA had not required the regions to follow uniform inspection or  documentation procedures, allowing regions in many cases to let  inspectors rely on their experience and knowledge;   establish a national policy for fining violators because, in the absence of a  policy, regions had adopted inconsistent polices and rarely assessed fines;  and   develop a system of inspection priorities, based on a national inventory of  tanks, because, without knowing the location and number of facilities or  tanks, EPA could not assess the relative risk of spills to the environment  or target for inspections the facilities most in need of attention.", "In 1993, the Congress passed GPRA, requiring all federal agencies to (1)  develop and submit strategic plans covering at least 5 years to the  Congress and the Director of OMB, (2) set annual performance goals  consistent with the goals and objectives in the strategic plans, and (3)  annually compare actual program results with established performance  goals and report this information to the Congress. Under the act, agencies  are to prepare annual performance plans that articulate goals for the  upcoming fiscal year that are aligned with their long-term strategic goals  described in the strategic plans. These annual performance plans must  include results-oriented annual goals linked to program activities and  indicators that the agency will use to measure performance against the  results-oriented goals.

EPA  allows flexibility because the EPA regional offices often have different  numbers and types of regulated facilities and staffing arrangements, and  face different geographic challenges in implementing the SPCC program.  Partly because of these regional differences, the number of facilities  inspected and the level of enforcement taken have varied across regional  offices in recent years. To promote consistency in how SPCC regulations  are interpreted and enforced, while allowing for this variation, EPA has  also developed a training curriculum for inspectors and guidance on how  to conduct SPCC inspections and penalize violators."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "EPA Allows Regional Offices Flexibility in Implementing the SPCC Program", "paragraphs": ["While EPA has budgeted similar amounts for each region\u2019s SPCC activities  in recent years, its regional offices may use varying staffing arrangements  to conduct inspections. According to our survey, Regions 1 and 2 use only  EPA regional employees for SPCC inspections, while other regions, such  as Region 6, employ several contractors and EPA personnel to perform  these inspections. In many regions, EPA on-scene coordinators, whose  primary function is emergency response, also conduct SPCC inspections.  In addition, some EPA regions employ their regional and contract staff full  time on SPCC inspections, while other regions\u2014such as Region 6\u2014in  addition to the personnel dedicated to SPCC inspections, have several  employees who split their time between SPCC inspections and inspections  for other EPA environmental regulations or programs. Furthermore,  inspectors may differ in how they allocate their time. For example,  according to Region 5 officials, their inspectors divide their time between  enforcement activities and inspection activities, while Region 6 and 8  officials told us that they have separate offices and staff members to  perform these activities. Table 2 shows the regions\u2019 SPCC staffing and  amount of time spent on SPCC-related activities in fiscal year 2006, such  as planning for inspections, conducting outreach to facilities, visiting  facilities, and documenting inspection results.", "EPA officials told us that some regional variation in staffing and time spent  on SPCC-related activities is inevitable and necessary owing to different  management structures, geographic size, and number and type of  regulated facilities. For example, some regions, such as Region 8\u2014which  is responsible for Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah,  and Wyoming\u2014must take into consideration significant travel costs, while  Region 1\u2014which is responsible for Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts,  New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont\u2014has much lower travel  costs. In addition, EPA Region 6, which is considered to have a large  portion of the nation\u2019s oil business, uses several contractors or grantees as  well as EPA inspectors to conduct inspections. Finally, Region 10 has  unique travel challenges associated with remote facilities in Alaska and, in  particular, North Slope operations.", "According to EPA officials, partly as a result of the differences in how the  regions staff the SPCC program, and the travel issue associated with the  geographical differences in the regions, the number of facilities each EPA  region has inspected in recent years has varied. Also, the number of SPCC  inspections may be affected when it is necessary for EPA regional staff\u2019s  time to be dedicated to unique response operations (such as Hurricane  Katrina).", "Our survey shows that EPA\u2019s regional offices inspected a total of 3,359  facilities for compliance with the SPCC rule from fiscal year 2004 through  fiscal year 2006, or less than 1 percent of EPA\u2019s estimate of the number of  SPCC-regulated facilities in the United States. However, the number of  facilities inspected in each EPA region varied in these years\u2014from 184 in  Region 10 to 745 in Region 6. (See fig. 2.)", "The percentage of facilities complying or not complying with SPCC  regulations at the time of inspection also has varied across regional  offices. For example, as shown in figure 3, in fiscal year 2006, the rate of  facility noncompliance\u2014measured as the percentage of inspected  facilities found to be not fully complying with the requirements\u2014ranged  from a low of 26 percent in Region 3 to a high of 98 percent in Region 8,  according to our survey. The average rate of facility noncompliance of  inspected facilities across regional offices was about 59 percent.", "We also found regional differences in the extent of enforcement actions  taken against inspected facilities\u2014as measured by the percentage of  noncompliant facilities that were subject to enforcement action in fiscal  year 2006\u2014from a low of zero for Regions 7 and 10 to a high of 84 percent  in Region 6. According to EPA officials, these regional differences are due  to various reasons, including how each EPA region has historically defined  \u201ccompliance\u201d and the types of enforcement actions each region uses. For  example, some regions may use ESAs as an enforcement action more than  others. ESAs allow EPA officials to negotiate compliance with facility  owners without using traditional enforcement mechanisms. According to  EPA, ESAs also use fewer EPA resources and promote quick settlements  with violators. They can take between 30 and 60 days to complete, while  traditional enforcement mechanisms can take years to settle, depending  on the violation, the type of facility, and the extent of any court-ordered  corrective actions. The shorter time frame allows those regions that use  ESAs to conduct enforcement actions against a relatively large proportion  of noncompliant facilities. Currently, all regions except Region 5 use ESAs  to varying degrees, and that is a factor in the large variation in  enforcement activities across regions. Region 5, which covers most of the  Great Lakes states, does not use ESAs at all, because, according to Region  5 officials, they focus on taking enforcement actions against the more  serious noncompliant cases that would result in larger Class II  administrative penalties, rather than the less serious cases where they  could use ESAs.", "EPA\u2019s use of ESAs in recent years has outpaced the agency\u2019s use of the  more resource intensive traditional enforcement mechanisms. According  to our survey, EPA regional offices concluded a total of 111 ESAs in fiscal  year 2006, compared with 21 settlements using traditional enforcement  mechanisms. EPA Regions 1, 3, 6, and 9 each issued ESAs in more than 25  percent of the cases in which inspectors found facilities were  noncompliant. Together, these four regional offices concluded 97 of the  111 ESAs issued by all regional offices in fiscal year 2006, with Region 6  alone issuing 60 ESAs. In addition, according to officials in Region 6, they  believe that their use of ESAs has resulted in increased compliance  through word of mouth by regulated facilities about the mechanism. EPA  headquarters officials stated that given that the SPCC requirements are  performance-based, they continue to learn from and share information  with the regions about alternative approaches to achieve facility  compliance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EPA Has Developed SPCC Policies and Procedures to Promote Consistent Enforcement of SPCC Regulations", "paragraphs": ["While regional offices have flexibility in implementing the SPCC program  to address factors unique to each region, EPA has taken steps over the last  several years to promote consistency in how the regions interpret and  enforce the SPCC regulations.

As a result,  SPCC inspectors were conducting inspections after meeting different  training requirements, and had different levels of knowledge and skills.", "EPA had not required its regions to follow uniform procedures for  conducting and documenting inspections, and had not developed written  procedures on how to conduct inspections.

While we agreed that  frequent inspections would promote compliance, we stated that greater  compliance would most likely be achieved if penalties were assessed.", "As a result of these findings, we recommended that EPA define and  implement minimum training needs for inspectors, develop instructions  for performing and documenting inspections, and establish a national  policy for penalizing violators of SPCC regulations.", "In response to these recommendations, EPA developed a new training  protocol. It now requires inspectors to be trained both in the basic  principles of inspections and in the conduct of SPCC inspections. EPA  now requires 40 hours of specific SPCC/FRP classroom time that provide  inspectors with information on the history and scope of the SPCC and FRP  rules, relevant vocabulary, inspection requirements, tank integrity testing  procedures, SPCC and FRP plan review, and enforcement issues and  procedures. EPA requires all media inspection programs to train their  inspectors in basic inspector training, health and safety training, and  program-specific inspector training. The SPCC/FRP training program is  standard across EPA, and is offered to new inspectors approximately  every 6 months. EPA also offered 8- to 12-hour \u201cshort courses\u201d that it  designed to temporarily fulfill training requirements while it developed the  40-hour program training following the 2002 rule requirements. While  these short courses are condensed versions of the 40-hour SPCC/FRP  course, they were not intended to be long-term substitutes for the more  extensive training sessions. In addition to classroom training, EPA  requires on-the-job training, in which new inspectors shadow more  experienced inspectors during site visits, training for inspection  supervisors, and annual refresher courses. The on-the-job and refresher  training is offered in the regions and nationally at certain training events.", "According to our survey, 73 percent of individuals who inspected at least  one SPCC facility in 2006 met the full requirements for classroom  training\u2014that is, they had received basic inspector training in combination  with the mandatory 40-hour SPCC/FRP-specific program. Figure 4 shows,  for fiscal year 2006, the training level of inspectors who inspected at least  one facility.", "In 2005, EPA issued national guidance to facilitate consistent  understanding among regional inspectors on how to apply provisions of  the SPCC rule. This guidance has been incorporated into the EPA national  inspector training that EPA regional inspectors receive, and it is also  available to owners and operators of facilities that may be subject to SPCC  requirements. Inspectors use the inspection and plan review checklists  included in the guidance as they inspect a facility to ensure that they  conduct complete inspections. In visits to three SPCC facilities in three  EPA regions, we found that inspectors were using the checklist. In  addition, regional officials told us that the guidance provided them with  information on how to enforce the SPCC regulations and also helped them  in answering facility owners\u2019 questions on compliance. OEM has also  developed and presented specialized inspector training courses that  address topics related to corrosion, integrity testing, and production  sector operations.", "EPA further addressed our 1989 recommendations by issuing a national  penalty policy for SPCC enforcement in 1998. Among other things, this  EPA policy describes the penalties that EPA can collect through  administrative and enforcement actions for SPCC violations and includes a  minimum settlement penalty calculation, which generally describes what  EPA would accept as a settlement. The policy also lays out a process that  EPA enforcement officials can use to determine the level of seriousness of  different SPCC violations and their associated penalties.

We  stated that a national inventory could gather the information necessary to  assess the relative risks of spills and allow EPA to develop a system of  inspection priorities, which would require national guidance on how to  select facilities for inspection. While EPA did not directly act upon our  recommendation, in 1991 it proposed a rule to require any facility subject  to the SPCC rule to make itself known to the agency on a onetime basis,  and subsequently sought OMB\u2019s approval to collect data from all facilities  that might be covered by the SPCC rule. However, as we noted in our 1995  report, OMB stated that EPA had not adequately justified the proposed  reporting requirements and did not approve the request.", "EPA conducted a survey in 1995 to estimate the number and size of oil  production and storage facilities in most industries regulated by the SPCC  rule. Since then, EPA has updated its estimates of the number of facilities  in the SPCC universe, but it still does not know the exact universe of  facilities and their locations. In the preamble to the 2002 amendments to  the SPCC rule, EPA explained that it had decided not to pursue the  proposed notification requirement because it was still considering  whether to establish a paper or an electronic notification system. EPA  officials recently stated that the agency has still not fully considered a  notification requirement. According to EPA officials, the agency also has  not developed national guidance on how to target facilities for inspection,  although it has crafted a framework in preparation for this guidance. EPA  officials stated that the agency plans to develop this guidance, but it has  not yet established a schedule for completing it. However, this guidance  will not be based on an assessment of the relative risks of spills across all  facilities because EPA does not have such information.", "Because EPA has incomplete information about which and how many  facilities are subject to the SPCC rule, the regional offices attempt to  identify SPCC facilities through a variety of indirect means and limited  information sources. For example, according to our survey, 9 out of 10  EPA regional offices reported that they use oil spill data from the National  Response Center (NRC) to identify regulated facilities and target them for  inspection. NRC data track the incidence of oil spills as they are reported  to NRC, but these data do not always associate spills with the specific  facilities where they originated or include detailed information about  those facilities. In addition, if any information is later collected on the  actual source or facility responsible for an oil spill, NRC does not update  its database. Consequently, NRC data generally can alert SPCC program  officials to the possibility that SPCC facilities may be in the area of a  reported spill rather than positively identifying any facilities as being  subject to the rule.", "Nine out of 10 regional offices also reported using referrals from state  agencies or other institutions to identify SPCC facilities and target  inspections. For example, officials in EPA Region 3\u2014which covers  Delaware, the District of Columbia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and  West Virginia\u2014stated that, for the last 2 years, the region has requested all  the states in its region to provide a list of facilities that the states would  like inspected, and then incorporated these facilities into its inspection  planning for the fiscal year. The region then submits the list of facilities to  be inspected to the states for comment.", "According to an EPA official, the agency\u2019s reliance on incomplete spill  data and state referrals does not allow it to target facilities for inspection  on the basis of their relative spill risks. EPA officials told us that, to a  certain extent, the fact that they know about a facility at all\u2014because of  past spills and state referrals\u2014can be an indication that the facility poses a  relatively high risk. However, EPA does not have sufficient information to  determine with any certainty how the risks posed by these facilities  compare with those of other as yet unknown and not inspected SPCC- regulated facilities.", "EPA regions have also used other strategies to both identify SPCC  facilities and target them for inspection. For example, Region 6 has  developed its own geographic information system (GIS)\u2014the On-Scene  Coordinators Area Response System (OSCARS)\u2014to identify facilities that  may pose a high risk of spills into or upon navigable waters and adjoining  shorelines. OSCARS provides regional inspectors with a graphics-based  tool that integrates basic geographic information with separate location- based data sets, such as the location of lakes, waterways, and roads with  industrial infrastructure, such as regulated facilities and pipelines. The  output from this tool can be used by officials to help identify and pinpoint  the location of facilities and prioritize their inspections based on potential  risk and other criteria. EPA officials told us that OSCARS may have some  outdated information because it is costly to update, but they considered  this an acceptable limitation. According to Region 6 officials, OSCARS has  allowed them to more effectively target problem sites and identify  egregious regulation violators. They consider OSCARS of particular  importance in Region 6, in which 116 counties contain a large proportion  of the nation\u2019s petroleum facilities and exhibit high-risk characteristics  such as the potential to cause significant and substantial harm to the  environment or public health if a large release into or upon navigable  water occurs. In addition, according to Region 6 officials, all EPA regions  have the capability to develop GIS systems for SPCC- and FRP-regulated  facilities to respond promptly to an oil spill.", "Some other EPA regions use certain other criteria to conduct as many  inspections as possible given resource constraints, as the following  examples show:    According to Region 5 and 8 officials, inspectors will visit a chosen  location and inspect as many facilities as they can in that area within a  week.", "Region 3 officials stated that although the region inspects facilities in all  the states within their region, each fiscal year they perform more  inspections in Delaware and Maryland than in Virginia because of the  travel funding limitations.", "Several EPA regional officials stated that they try to identify and target  additional facilities to inspect by, among other things, talking to the local  population, consulting the Internet and local Yellow Pages, or through  \u201cdrive-by sightings.\u201d", "None of the data sources that regional offices consult when trying to  identify and target facilities necessarily indicate that a facility is subject to  SPCC regulations. Regional officials stated that SPCC inspectors  sometimes identify and visit a facility, only to discover that the facility is  either not subject to the SPCC rule or, if it is a facility established after  2002, will not be subject to the regulations until July 2009. EPA officials  said that visits to non-SPCC facilities waste limited inspector time and  program resources. In contrast, if SPCC inspectors find that the facility is  subject to SPCC regulations, they can conduct a full inspection.", "Recognizing the constraints on their ability to identify and effectively  target facilities for inspections, the regions also conduct outreach  activities to encourage compliance. To inform owners of facilities that may  be subject to SPCC regulations of their obligations, EPA regions we spoke  with devote substantial time to outreach activities. For example, Region 5  officials told us that an estimated 75 percent of their time spent on SPCC  activities is devoted to outreach and compliance assistance. These  activities include, among other things, attending seminars and educating  facility owners through regular mail, e-mails, and calls about SPCC  regulations.

The expanded database  will include information from the following sources:    The Integrated Compliance Information System (ICIS). Since 2005, EPA  has required regional SPCC inspectors to record their inspections in ICIS,  a central database designed to track the number of inspection and  enforcement cases across several EPA programs. However, EPA officials  told us that ICIS is not particularly useful to program managers in  implementing the SPCC program. For example, ICIS records the initial  investigation and enforcement outcomes of investigation cases, but it does  not allow the user to track a facility\u2019s progress in coming into compliance  after violations have been found. As a result, the regions\u2019 use of ICIS is  largely limited to checking facilities\u2019 inspection histories when considering  them for inspection, to determine if the facility has been inspected  previously and if it has a history of violations.", "Regional databases. Most regional offices also maintain their own  program databases, in addition to ICIS, to track open SPCC cases and the  number of inspections.

According to these state officials, this can range from  occasional discussions to no contact at all. For example, New Jersey  officials stated that they are in contact with their counterparts in EPA  Region 2 and share information on their regulated universes and are  invited by the region to participate in certain inspections. However,  although Region 5 officials stated that they often contact all the states in  their regions, including inviting those with tank programs to accompany  them on inspections, Minnesota officials stated that they have little or no  communication with EPA Region 5 aboveground storage tank officials.  They stated that they do not receive advance notification of when EPA  Region 5 plans to conduct SPCC inspections in their state and often learn  about an EPA inspection only after it takes place, when the region copies  the state on any compliance correspondence with the facility. In addition,  a Florida official stated that the EPA region does not contact the state  program about its SPCC program activities in the state, such as when it  conducts inspections or training. Officials in several states said that  further contact between their offices and EPA regions\u2019 SPCC programs  could improve EPA\u2019s identification and targeting of SPCC-regulated  facilities because the states have more detailed data on their regulated  community and have established relationships with the facility owners in  their states. For example, a Missouri official said that further coordination  between the SPCC program in Region 7 and Missouri\u2019s inspection program  could be useful to the SPCC program because the state maintains close  ties with facility owners to be better aware of the regulated community.", "Although EPA regions conduct outreach activities to educate facility  owners on their responsibilities under the SPCC regulations, officials in  several of the states we contacted told us that these efforts needed  improvement. Several of these officials stated that they find facility  owners are confused about the relationship between SPCC regulations and  state regulations. For example, Missouri officials told us that facility  owners want to comply with both state and SPCC regulations but they  often do not because the difference between the two types of regulations  is often confusing. Given this confusion, according to state officials,  coordinating federal and state outreach activities\u2014such as educating  facility owners about SPCC and state regulations through seminars or  conferences\u2014is important to provide the regulated community with more  complete and comprehensive information. State officials told us that  increased coordination by EPA regions with the states on outreach  activities, such as educating facility owners on the SPCC program and  state regulations, could benefit both the SPCC and state tank programs by  making these efforts more comprehensive. For example, a Minnesota  official told us that the state recently learned that EPA had held training  sessions with facility owners in Minnesota after they had occurred and  that the state would like EPA to contact them prior to any planned training  for the regulated community so that information on state aboveground  storage tank rules could be distributed at the same time.

Recently, however, training sessions in Minnesota  were limited to those requested by trade groups.", "State officials also noted that outreach efforts in their state programs have  contributed to better compliance. According to state officials, working  closely with facility owners maximizes compliance and minimizes the  need for legal actions. For example, a Missouri official told us that the  state program has between 10 and 50 active enforcement cases ongoing on  any given day. However, he said the state has imposed penalties only five  or six times over the last 20 years because working with facility owners  helps to eliminate the need for formal penalties. Similarly, Florida tries to  work collaboratively with facility owners to gain compliance. Florida\u2019s  program is relatively decentralized; the state contracts with the counties to  conduct inspections.

EPA\u2019s current method of identifying facilities subject to the  SPCC rule\u2014through referrals, the Yellow Pages, and Internet searches\u2014 does not allow the agency to use its limited resources effectively to  identify facilities most at risk of leaking oil. Without more comprehensive  data on the universe of facilities that are subject to the SPCC rule, EPA  cannot employ a risk-based approach to target its SPCC inspections to  those facilities that pose the greatest risks of oil spills into or upon U.S.  navigable waters and adjoining shorelines. Similarly, incomplete  information on the universe of SPCC facilities prevents EPA from  determining whether and to what extent the SPCC program is achieving its  goals. But even with the needed data, EPA will be unable to measure the  program\u2019s success unless and until it develops reliable performance goals.

One such  approach would be to initiate a facility registration program, similar to  that of some states we contacted.

While this mechanism would likely involve  some costs to both EPA and the individual facilities, it would also increase  the agency\u2019s knowledge of the SPCC universe and allow it to better target  its inspection resources on the basis of the relative risks posed by the  facilities, which may outweigh the increased costs. There may also be  other options available to EPA to expand its knowledge of the SPCC  universe at a lower cost and that may be worth the agency exploring.", "Greater coordination with states may also help EPA to fill its SPCC data  gap.

To determine what data EPA officials have  available to implement the SPCC program, we spoke with EPA region  officials to determine the agency\u2019s data sources for identifying facilities  and targeting them for inspection, and for enforcing SPCC regulations;  how the agency uses the data; and the data\u2019s overall limitations. To obtain  this information, we visited EPA Regions 3, 5, and 6 because they  conducted the most inspections of all the EPA regions over a 3-year period  and to achieve geographical diversity. We visited an SPCC facility in each  of these regions with EPA officials to observe how SPCC inspectors  conduct their work.", "To obtain information on both how the program is implemented and what  data sources the agency uses, we conducted a survey of SPCC program  officials in all 10 EPA regions. In this survey, we sought to determine,  among other things, how the regions identify and target facilities to  inspect, the number of inspections each region has conducted in recent  years, how much training an SPCC inspector receives, and the number of  those inspected facilities that complied with SPCC regulations and, for  those that did not comply, the number and type of enforcement actions  taken. On November 30, 2006, we e-mailed the survey with a cover letter to  officials in the 10 regions that were primarily responsible for day-to-day  management and implementation of SPCC requirements. We also issued  an addendum to each region on December 5, 2006, when it was brought to  our attention that two questions in the survey regarding the training of  inspection staff posed some confusion. Completed surveys were received  by December 18, 2006. To supplement the survey and to elaborate on  survey responses, in addition to the three regions we visited, we followed  up by telephone with four regions\u20141, 2, 7, and 8. The calls helped us  obtain more specific examples of how EPA regions identify and target  SPCC facilities for inspection. A copy of our survey used in this review is  in appendix II. It includes the aggregate responses to the survey and  summaries of open-ended questions from all 10 EPA regions, when  appropriate. The practical difficulties of conducting any survey may  introduce errors, commonly referred to as nonsampling errors. For  example, respondents may have difficulty in interpreting a particular  question or may lack information necessary to provide a valid and reliable  response. In order to minimize these errors, we conducted a pretest of the  draft survey with two EPA regions\u20144 and 8\u2014over the telephone. We  made changes to the content and format of the survey after this review  based on the feedback we received.", "To understand the nature of states\u2019 aboveground oil storage tank programs  and how they are implemented, to identify potential options that might be  applied to EPA\u2019s program, and to learn about any coordination between  these states\u2019 programs and EPA\u2019s SPCC program, we first reviewed the  Aboveground Storage Tank Guide, Vols. I and II, by the Thompson  Publishing Group, which includes a comprehensive section on individual  state aboveground storage tank regulations. We found that although many  states regulate aboveground storage tanks in a piecemeal fashion through  various state statutes, including adopted versions of uniform fire codes,  such as the Uniform Fire Safety Standards, the International Fire Code,  and the National Fire Protection Association\u2019s code, some states have  developed comprehensive regulatory programs. After our analysis of this  information, we spoke with the Association of State and Territorial Solid  Waste Management Officials (ASTSWMO) and other state officials who  recommended we speak to several states that they considered to have  well-run aboveground storage tank programs. We then selected our states  based on these recommendations, as well as geographical considerations  such as whether the states were in diverse areas of the United States. We  also limited our selection to one state each for a particular EPA region.
