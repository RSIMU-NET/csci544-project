Since 1990, we have regularly reported on government  operations that we identified as high risk due to their greater vulnerability  to fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement, or the need for  transformation to address economy, efficiency, or effectiveness  challenges. Our high risk program, supported by this committee and the  House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, has brought  much-needed focus to problems impeding effective government and  costing billions of dollars each year.", "In November 2000, we published our criteria and process of determining  those areas across government deemed to be high risk. That document,  based on input we received from Congress and the executive branch,  including heads of major agencies and the Chief Financial Officers  Council, specified that to determine which federal government programs  and functions should be added to GAO\u2019s High Risk List, we consider  whether the program or function is of national significance or is key to  government performance and accountability. Further, we consider  qualitative factors, such as whether the risk  involves public health or safety, service delivery, national security,  national defense, economic growth, or privacy or citizens\u2019 rights, or  could result in significantly impaired service, program failure, injury or  loss of life, or significantly reduced economy, efficiency, or  effectiveness.", "In addition, we also review the exposure to loss in quantitative terms,  such as the value of major assets being impaired; revenue sources not  being realized; or major agency assets being lost, stolen, damaged, or  wasted. We also consider corrective measures planned or under way to  resolve a material control weakness and the status and effectiveness of  these actions.", "When legislative, administration, and agency actions, including those in  response to our recommendations, result in significant progress toward  resolving a high-risk problem, we remove the high-risk designation.

In addition, top  administration officials have continued to show their commitment to  ensuring that high-risk areas receive attention and oversight. The Office  of Management and Budget (OMB) regularly convenes meetings for  agencies to provide progress updates on high-risk issues. When a high- risk issue area ranges across agencies, OMB coordinates with  representatives from multiple agencies to participate. These meetings  typically include OMB\u2019s Deputy Director for Management, top leadership  from the agencies, other administration and agency staff members  responsible for addressing the high-risk issue, as well as myself and  others from GAO.", "This congressional and agency commitment is critical to resolving high- risk issues. For example, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)  has made considerable progress in transforming its original component  agencies into a single cabinet-level department and positioning itself to  ultimately achieve its full potential.

While this method of contracting can save the  government money and effort when properly managed, it also poses a  variety of risks.", "In 2005, we designated the management of interagency contracting as  high risk due in part to unclear lines of accountability between customer  and assisting agencies and the potential for improper use, including out- of-scope work and noncompliance with competition requirements. We  identified the continuing need for additional management controls and  guidance and clearer definitions of roles and responsibilities as keys to  addressing these issues. We also highlighted challenges agencies faced  in fully realizing the benefits of interagency contracts, including the lack of  data and the risk of potential duplication when new contracting vehicles  are created. To address these issues, we identified the need for a policy  framework and business case analysis requirements to support the  creation of certain new contracts and improved data on existing  interagency contracts.", "As detailed in our 2013 high risk update report, we are removing the  management of interagency contracting from the High Risk List based on:  (1) continued progress made by agencies in addressing identified  deficiencies, (2) establishment of additional management controls, (3)  creation of a policy framework for establishing new interagency contracts,  and (4) steps taken to address the need for better data on these  contracts.", "Specifically, most agencies have taken steps to implement and reinforce  interagency contracting policies to address prior concerns about the  improper use of these contracts. For example, we have noted  improvements in procedures used in making purchases on behalf of the  Department of Defense (DOD)\u2014the largest user of interagency contracts.  These included better defined roles and responsibilities and enhanced  controls over funding procedures. Additionally, the DOD Inspector  General has reported a significant decrease in problems with DOD  procurements through other federal agencies in congressionally  mandated reviews of interagency acquisitions. With respect to  management controls, Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provisions  on interagency acquisitions were revised to require that agencies make a  best procurement approach determination to justify the use of an  interagency contract and prepare written interagency agreements  outlining the roles and responsibilities of customer and assisting  organizations. As we recently reported, OMB analyzed reports from the  24 agencies that account for almost all contract spending government- wide and found that most had implemented management controls to  reinforce the new FAR requirements and strengthen the management of  interagency acquisitions. All 24 agencies also reported having oversight  mechanisms to ensure their internal controls were operating properly. In  response to congressional direction and our prior recommendation, OMB  established a policy framework in September 2011 to govern the creation  of new interagency contract vehicles. The framework addresses  concerns about potential duplication by requiring agencies to develop a  thorough business case prior to establishing certain contract vehicles.  Finally, in response to our recommendations, OMB and the General  Services Administration have taken a number of steps to address the  need for better data on interagency contract vehicles. These efforts  should enhance both government-wide efforts to manage interagency  contracts and agency efforts to conduct market research and negotiate  better prices.", "Importantly, congressional oversight sustained over several years has  been vital in addressing the issues that led this area to be designated  high risk. Removing the management of interagency contracting from the  High Risk List does not mean that the federal government\u2019s use of these  contracts is without challenges. But, we believe there are mechanisms in  place that OMB and federal agencies can use to identify and address  interagency contracting issues before they put the government at  significant risk for waste, fraud, or abuse. We also will continue to monitor  developments in this area.", "Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Business Systems Modernization (BSM)  is a multi-billion dollar, highly complex effort that involves the  development and delivery of a number of modernized tax administration  and internal management systems as well as core infrastructure projects  that are intended to replace the agency\u2019s aging business and tax  processing systems.", "In 1995, we identified serious management and technical weaknesses in  IRS\u2019s modernization program that jeopardized its successful completion.  We recommended many actions to fix the problems, and added IRS\u2019s  modernization to GAO\u2019s High Risk List. In 1995, we also added IRS\u2019s  financial management to GAO\u2019s High Risk List, due to long-standing and  pervasive problems that hampered the effective collection of revenues  and precluded the preparation of auditable financial statements. We  combined the two issues into one high-risk area in 2005 since resolution  of the most serious financial management problems depended largely on  the success of the business systems modernization program. Throughout  the years, Congress conducted oversight of the BSM program by, among  other things, requiring that IRS submit annual expenditure plans that  needed to meet certain conditions, including a review by GAO. Because  of the significant progress made in addressing the high-risk area, starting  in fiscal year 2012, Congress did not require the submission of an annual  expenditure plan.", "GAO, Investment Management: IRS Has a Strong Oversight Process But Needs to  Improve How It Continues Funding Ongoing Investments, GAO-11-587 (Washington,  D.C.: July 20, 2011).", "Engineering Institute\u2019s Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI),  which calls for disciplined software development and acquisition practices  which are considered industry best practices.

Among other impacts, climate  change could threaten coastal areas with rising sea levels, alter  agricultural productivity, and increase the intensity and frequency of  severe weather events. As observed by the United States Global Change  Research Program, the impacts and costliness of weather disasters\u2014 resulting from floods, drought, and other events such as tropical  cyclones\u2014are expected to increase in significance as what are  considered \u201crare\u201d events become more common and intense due to  anticipated changes in the global climate system. Moreover, according to  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s National Climatic  Data Center (NCDC), the United States has sustained 144 weather and  climate-related disasters since 1980, in which overall damages reached  or exceeded $1 billion each, with 14 events in 2011 and 11 events in  2012.

For example, we reported in September 2012 that  major disaster declarations have increased over recent decades to a  record of 98 in fiscal year 2011 compared with 65 in 2004. Had FEMA  adjusted the indicator on which it principally relies to determine whether to  recommend that a jurisdiction receive public assistance funding, to reflect  changes in personal income and inflation, 44 percent and 25 percent  fewer disaster declarations, respectively, would have met the threshold  for public assistance during fiscal years 2004 through 2011. Over that  period, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) obligated  more than $80 billion in federal assistance for major disasters. The  federal government\u2019s exposure to major disasters continues to pose risks.  Most recently, Congress provided more than $60 billion in budget  authority for disaster assistance in the wake of Superstorm Sandy.", "We have found that the federal government is not well positioned to  address the fiscal exposure presented by climate change, and needs a  government-wide strategic approach with strong leadership to manage  related risks. We reported in 2009 that while policymakers increasingly  viewed climate change adaptation\u2014defined as adjustments to natural or  human systems in response to actual or expected climate change\u2014as a  risk-management strategy to protect vulnerable sectors and communities  that might be affected by changes in the climate, the federal  government\u2019s emerging adaptation activities were carried out in an ad hoc  manner and were not well coordinated across federal agencies, let alone  with state and local governments. Subsequently, in May 2011, we  reported that there was no coherent strategic government-wide approach  to climate change funding and that federal officials do not have a shared  understanding of strategic government-wide priorities. At that time, we  recommended that the appropriate entities within the Executive Office of  the President clearly establish federal strategic climate change priorities,  including the roles and responsibilities of the key federal entities, taking  into consideration the full range of climate-related activities within the  federal government.

Polar-orbiting satellites constantly  circle the earth in an almost north-south orbit providing global coverage of  environmental conditions that affect the weather and climate. As the earth  rotates beneath it, each polar-orbiting satellite views the entire earth\u2019s  surface twice a day. In contrast, geostationary satellites maintain a fixed  position relative to the earth from a high-level orbit of about 22,300 miles  in space. Used in combination with ground, sea, and airborne observing  systems, both types of satellites have become an indispensable part of  monitoring and forecasting weather and climate. Polar-orbiting satellites  provide the data that go into numerical weather prediction models, which  are a primary tool for forecasting weather days in advance\u2014including  forecasting the path and intensity of hurricanes and tropical storms.  Geostationary satellites provide frequently-updated graphical images that  are used to identify current weather patterns and provide short-term  warnings.", "In regards to polar satellites, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration (NOAA) must make decisions about (1) whether and how  to extend support for legacy satellite systems so that their data might be  available if needed, (2) how much time and resources to invest in  improving satellite models so that they assimilate data from alternative  sources, (3) whether to pursue international agreements for access to  additional satellite systems and how best to resolve any security issues  with the foreign data, (4) when and how to test the value and integration  of alternative data sources, and (5) how these preliminary mitigation plans  will be integrated with NOAA\u2019s broader end-to-end plans for sustaining  weather forecasting capabilities.

Among the additional actions needed are  resolving the role of the two housing-related government-sponsored  enterprises\u2014Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac\u2014that continue operating  under government conservatorships. However, a new challenge for the  markets has also evolved as the decline in private sector participation in  housing finance that began with the 2007-2009 financial crisis has  resulted in much greater activity by FHA, whose single-family loan  insurance portfolio has grown from about $300 billion in 2007 to more  than $1.1 trillion in 2012.

In June 2012, DHS identified the resources needed to  implement most (154 of 173) of its corrective actions, but needs to  continue to identify resources for the remaining corrective actions;  determine that sufficient resources and staff are committed to initiatives;  work to mitigate shortfalls and prioritize initiatives, as needed; and  communicate to senior leadership critical resource gaps. DHS also  identified ways in which it is leveraging resources to implement corrective  actions, which is particularly important in light of constrained budgets. For  example, in October 2012, DHS reported that it is pooling resources and  working across functional lines to create cross functional, matrixed teams  and executive steering committees to ensure timely implementation of the  strategy. However, it is too soon to determine whether this approach is a  sustainable way for DHS to address the resource challenges and capacity  gaps that have affected its implementation efforts at the department and  component levels.", "Demonstrated, sustained progress. DHS has made important progress  in implementing corrective actions across its management functions, but it  has not yet demonstrated sustainable, measurable progress in  addressing key challenges that continue to remain within these functions  and in the integration of those functions. DHS has implemented a number  of actions demonstrating the department\u2019s progress in improving its  management functions. For example, DHS established the Office of  Program Accountability and Risk Management in October 2011 to be  responsible for the department\u2019s overall acquisition governance process.  DHS also established a formal IT Program Management Development  Track and staffed Centers of Excellence with subject matter experts to  that as of March 2012, approximately two-thirds of the department\u2019s major  IT investments we reviewed (47 of 68) were meeting current cost and  schedule commitments (i.e., goals). Additionally, in the financial  management area, DHS has reduced the number of material weaknesses  in internal controls and obtained a qualified audit opinion on its fiscal year  2012 financial statements. DHS has also implemented common policies,  procedures, and systems, such as those related to human capital, across  its management functions.", "However, DHS still has considerable work ahead in many areas. For  example, in September 2012, we reported that most of DHS\u2019s major  acquisition programs continue to cost more than expected, take longer to  deploy than planned, or deliver less capability than promised. We  identified 42 programs that experienced cost growth or schedule slips, or  both, with 16 of the programs\u2019 costs increasing from a total of $19.7 billion  in 2008 to $52.2 billion in 2011\u2014an aggregate increase of 166 percent.  Further, while DHS has defined and begun to implement a vision for a  tiered governance structure to improve information technology (IT)  management, we reported in July 2012 that the governance structure  covers less than 20 percent (about 16 of 80) of DHS\u2019s major IT  investments and 3 of its 13 portfolios. DHS has also been unable to  obtain an audit opinion on its internal controls over financial reporting, and  needs to obtain and sustain unqualified audit opinions for at least two  consecutive years on the department-wide financial statements. Finally,  federal surveys have consistently found that DHS employees are less  satisfied with their jobs than the government-wide average. Key to  addressing the department\u2019s management challenges is DHS  demonstrating the ability to achieve sustained progress across the 31  actions and outcomes we identified as needed to address the high-risk  designation, to which DHS agreed. As shown in table 1, we believe DHS  has fully addressed 6, mostly addressed 2, partially addressed 16, and  initiated 7 of the 31 key actions and outcomes.", "To more fully address our high-risk designation, DHS needs to continue  implementing its Integrated Strategy for High Risk Management and show  measurable, sustainable progress in implementing its key management  initiatives and corrective actions and achieving outcomes. In doing so, it  will be important for DHS to: make continued progress in addressing the 31 actions and outcomes  and demonstrate that systems, personnel, and policies are in place to  ensure that progress can be sustained over time; maintain its current level of top leadership support and sustained  commitment to ensure continued progress in executing its corrective  actions through completion;  continue to implement its plan for addressing this high-risk area and  periodically report its progress to Congress and GAO;  closely track and independently validate the effectiveness and  sustainability of its corrective actions and make midcourse  adjustments, as needed; and monitor the effectiveness of its efforts to establish reliable resource  estimates at the department and component levels, address and work  to mitigate any resource gaps, and prioritize initiatives as needed to  ensure it has the capacity to implement and sustain its corrective  actions.", "We will continue to monitor DHS\u2019s efforts in this high-risk area to  determine if the actions and outcomes are achieved and sustained.", "Additional information on this area is provided on page 161 of our 2013  high risk update."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Sustaining Attention on High-Risk Programs", "paragraphs": ["Overall, the government continues to take high-risk problems seriously  and is making long-needed progress toward correcting them.

In our 2011  high risk update, we highlighted additional challenges agencies faced in  fully realizing the benefits of interagency contracts, including the lack of  data and the risk of potential duplication when new contracting vehicles  are created. Duplication among interagency contracts can result in  missed opportunities to leverage the government\u2019s buying power and may  adversely affect the administrative efficiencies and cost savings expected  with their use.

In  response to congressional direction and our prior recommendation, OMB  established a policy framework in September 2011 to govern the creation  of new interagency contract vehicles. The framework addresses  concerns about potential duplication by requiring agencies to develop a  thorough business case prior to establishing certain contract vehicles.  The guidance further requires senior agency officials to approve the  business cases and post them on an OMB website to provide interested  federal stakeholders an opportunity to offer feedback. OMB then is able to  conduct follow-up with sponsoring agencies if significant questions,  including ones related to duplication, are raised during the vetting  process.

In response to our  recommendations, OMB and GSA have taken a number of steps to  address the need for better data on interagency contract vehicles. These  efforts should enhance both government-wide efforts to manage  interagency contracts and agency efforts to conduct market research and  negotiate better prices. To promote better and easier access to data on  existing contracts, OMB has made improvements to its Interagency  Contract Directory, a searchable online database of indefinite-delivery  vehicles available for interagency use. It has also posted information on  government-wide acquisition contracts and blanket purchase agreements  available for use under the Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative on an  OMB website, accessible by federal agencies.

We suggested that Congress  consider authorizing NFIP to account for long-term flood erosion in its  flood maps, and the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of  2012 requires FEMA to use information on topography, coastal  erosion areas, changing lake levels, future changes in sea levels, and  intensity of hurricanes in updating its flood maps. While these  provisions respond to our suggestion to Congress, their ultimate  effectiveness will depend on their implementation by FEMA.

The importance of such data was recently highlighted by the advance  warnings of the path, timing, and intensity of Superstorm Sandy.", "Since the 1960s, the United States has used both polar-orbiting and  geostationary satellites to observe the Earth and its land, oceans,  atmosphere, and space environments. Polar-orbiting satellites constantly  circle the Earth in an almost north-south orbit providing global coverage of  environmental conditions that affect the weather and climate. As the Earth  rotates beneath it, each polar-orbiting satellite views the entire Earth\u2019s  surface twice a day. In contrast, geostationary satellites maintain a fixed  position relative to the Earth from a high-level orbit of about 22,300 miles  in space. Used in combination with ground, sea, and airborne observing  systems, both types of satellites have become an indispensable part of  monitoring and forecasting weather and climate. For example, polar- orbiting satellites provide the data that go into numerical weather  prediction models, which are a primary tool for forecasting weather days  in advance, including forecasting the path and intensity of hurricanes and  tropical storms. Geostationary satellites provide frequently-updated  graphical images that are used to identify current weather patterns and  provide short-term warnings.", "For more than 40 years, the United States has operated two separate  operational polar-orbiting meteorological satellites systems: the Polar- orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite series, which is managed by  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)\u2014a component  of the Department of Commerce; and the Defense Meteorological  Satellite Program (DMSP), which is managed by the Air Force. The  government also relies on data from a European satellite program, called  the Meteorological Operational (MetOp) satellite series. These satellites  are positioned so that they cross the Equator in the early morning,  midmorning, and early afternoon in order to obtain regular updates  throughout the day.", "With the expectation that combining the two separate U.S. polar satellite  programs would result in sizable cost savings, a May 1994 Presidential  Decision Directive required NOAA and DOD to converge the two  programs into a single new satellite acquisition, which became the  National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System  (NPOESS). However, in the years that followed, NPOESS encountered  significant technical challenges in sensor development and experienced  program cost growth and schedule delays, in part due to problems in the  program\u2019s management structure. After several restructurings and  recurring challenges, in February 2010, the Executive Office of the  President\u2019s Office of Science and Technology Policy announced that  NOAA and DOD would no longer jointly procure NPOESS; instead, each  agency would plan and acquire its own satellite system. Specifically,  NOAA, with support from the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration (NASA), would be responsible for the afternoon orbit, and  DOD would be responsible for the early morning orbit. The U.S.  partnership with the European satellite agency for data from the  midmorning orbit would continue as planned.", "Subsequently, NOAA initiated its replacement program, the Joint Polar  Satellite System (JPSS). JPSS consists of a demonstration satellite\u2014 called the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP)\u2014launched in  October 2011; two satellites, with at least five instruments planned for  each, to be launched by March 2017 and December 2022, respectively;  two stand-alone satellites to accommodate three additional instruments;  and ground systems for the entire program. The program is currently  estimated to cost $12.9 billion. In June 2012, we reported that NOAA and  NASA made progress in establishing the JPSS program and in launching  and operating the demonstration satellite, but noted that program officials  expect there to be a gap in satellite observations before the first JPSS  satellite is launched.", "Specifically, NOAA officials anticipate a gap in the afternoon orbit from 18  to 24 months between the time that NPP reaches the end of its lifespan  and when the first JPSS satellite is fully ready for operational use. We  identified other scenarios where the gap could last from 17 to 53 months.  For example, the gap would be 17 months if NPP lasts 5 years until  October 2016 and JPSS is launched as planned in March 2017 and  undergoes a 12-month on-orbit checkout before it is fully operational.  Alternatively, if NPP lasts only 3 years\u2014which NASA engineers consider  possible due to poor workmanship in the fabrication of the instruments\u2014 and JPSS launches 1 year later than currently planned, the gap in  satellite observations could reach 53 months. Figure 1 depicts a potential  gap in the afternoon orbit.", "After NPOESS was disbanded, DOD also began planning its own follow- on polar satellite program. However, it halted work in early 2012 because  it still has two legacy DMSP satellites in storage that will be launched as  needed to maintain observations in the early morning orbit. The agency  currently plans to launch its two remaining satellites in 2014 and 2020.  Moreover, DOD is working to identify alternatives to meet its future  environmental satellite requirements. However, in June 2012, we reported  that there is a possibility of satellite data gaps in DOD\u2019s early morning  orbit. The two remaining DMSP satellites may not work as intended  because they were built in the late 1990s and will be quite old by the time  they are launched. If the satellites do not perform as expected, a data gap  in the early morning orbit could occur as early as 2014.", "Satellite data gaps in the morning or afternoon polar orbits would lead to  less accurate and timely weather forecasting; as a result, advanced  warning of extreme events would be affected. Such extreme events could  include hurricanes, storm surges, and floods. For example, the National  Weather Service performed case studies to demonstrate how its  forecasts would have been affected if there were no polar satellite data in  the afternoon orbit, and noted that its forecasts for the \u201cSnowmaggedon\u201d  winter storm that hit the Mid-Atlantic coast in February 2010 would have  predicted a less intense storm further east, with about half of the  precipitation at 3, 4, and 5 days before the event. Specifically, the models  would have under-forecasted the amount of snow by at least 10 inches.  Similarly, a European weather organization recently reported that  NOAA\u2019s forecasts of Superstorm Sandy\u2019s track could have been  hundreds of miles off without polar-orbiting satellites\u2014rather than  identifying the New Jersey landfall within 30 miles 4 days before landfall,  the models would have shown the storm remaining at sea.", "In June 2012, we reported that while NOAA officials communicated  publicly and often about the risk of a polar satellite data gap, the agency  had not established plans to mitigate the gap. At the time, NOAA officials  stated that the agency would continue to use existing satellites as long as  they provide data and that there were no viable alternatives to the JPSS  program. However, our report noted that a more comprehensive  mitigation plan was essential since it is possible that other governmental,  commercial, or foreign satellites could supplement the polar satellite data.  For example, other nations continue to launch polar-orbiting weather  satellites to acquire data such as sea surface temperatures, sea surface  winds, and water vapor. Also, over the next few years, NASA plans to  launch satellites that will collect information on precipitation and soil  moisture. Because it could take time to adapt ground systems to receive,  process, and disseminate an alternative satellite\u2019s data, we noted that any  delays in establishing mitigation plans could leave the agency little time to  leverage its alternatives. We recommended that NOAA establish  mitigation plans for pending satellite gaps in the afternoon orbit as well as  potential gaps in the early morning orbit.", "In September 2012, the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and  Atmosphere (who is also the NOAA Administrator) reported that NOAA  had several actions under way to address polar satellite data gaps,  including (1) an investigation on how to maximize the life of the  demonstration satellite, (2) an investigation on how to accelerate the  development of the second JPSS satellite, and (3) the development of a  mitigation plan to address potential data gaps until the first JPSS satellite  becomes operational. The Under Secretary also directed NOAA\u2019s  Assistant Secretary to, by mid-October 2012, establish a contract to  conduct an enterprise-wide examination of contingency options and to  develop a written, descriptive, end-to-end plan that considers the entire  flow of data from possible alternative sensors through data assimilation  and on to forecast model performance. In October 2012, NOAA issued a  mitigation plan for a potential 14 to 18 month gap in the afternoon orbit,  between the current polar satellite and the first JPSS satellite. The plan  identifies and prioritizes options for obtaining critical observations,  including alternative satellite data sources and improvements to data  assimilation in models. It also lists technical, programmatic, and  management steps needed to implement these options.", "However, these plans are only the beginning. The agency must make  difficult decisions on which steps it will implement to ensure that its  mitigation plans are viable when needed. For example, NOAA must make  decisions about (1) whether and how to extend support for legacy satellite  systems so that their data might be available if needed, (2) how much  time and resources to invest in improving satellite models so that they  assimilate data from alternative sources, (3) whether to pursue  international agreements for access to additional satellite systems and  how best to resolve any security issues with the foreign data, (4) when  and how to test the value and integration of alternative data sources, and  (5) how these preliminary mitigation plans will be integrated with the  agency\u2019s broader end-to-end plans for sustaining weather forecasting  capabilities. NOAA must also identify time frames for when these  decisions will be made. We have ongoing work assessing NOAA\u2019s efforts  to limit and mitigate potential polar satellite data gaps.", "Geostationary environmental satellites transmit frequently updated  images of the weather currently affecting the United States to every  national weather forecast office in the country. These are the satellite  images that the public often sees on television news programs. NOAA  plans to have its $10.9 billion Geostationary Operational Environmental  Satellite-R (GOES-R) series replace the current fleet of geostationary  satellites, which will begin to reach the end of their useful lives in 2015.", "The GOES-R program has undergone a series of changes since 2006  and now consists of four geostationary satellites and a ground system.  However, problems with instrument and ground system development  caused a 19-month delay in completing the program\u2019s preliminary design  review, which occurred in February 2012. In June 2012, we reported that  GOES-R schedules were not fully reliable and that they could contribute  to delays in satellite launch dates. Program officials acknowledged that  the likelihood of meeting the October 2015 launch date was 48 percent.", "While NOAA\u2019s policy is to have two operational satellites and one backup  satellite in orbit at all times, continued delays in the launch of the first  GOES-R satellite could lead to a gap in satellite coverage. This policy  proved useful in December 2008 and again in September 2012 when the  agency experienced problems with one of its operational satellites, but  was able to move its backup satellite into place until the problems were  resolved. However, beginning in April 2015, NOAA expects to have only  two operational satellites and no backup satellite in orbit until GOES-R is  launched and completes an estimated 6-month post-launch test period.  As a result, there could be a year or more gap during which time a  backup satellite would not be available. If NOAA were to experience a  problem with either of its operational satellites before GOES-R is in orbit  and operational, it would need to rely on older satellites that are beyond  their expected operational lives and may not be fully functional. Any  further delays in the launch of the first satellite in the GOES-R program  would likely increase the risk of a gap in satellite coverage.", "In September 2010, we reported that NOAA had not established  adequate continuity plans for its geostationary satellites. Specifically, in  the event of a satellite failure, with no backup available, NOAA planned to  reduce its operations to a single satellite and if available, rely on a  satellite from a foreign nation. However, the agency did not have plans  that included processes, procedures, and resources needed to transition  to a single or foreign satellite. Without such plans, there would be an  increased risk that users would lose access to critical data. We  recommended that NOAA develop and document continuity plans for the  operation of geostationary satellites that included implementation  procedures, resources, staff roles, and timetables needed to transition to  a single satellite, foreign satellite, or other solution. In September 2011,  NOAA developed an initial continuity plan that generally includes these  elements. Specifically, NOAA\u2019s plan identified steps it would take in  transitioning to a single or foreign satellite; the amount of time this  transition would take; roles of product area leads; and resources such as  imaging product schedules, disk imagery frequency, and staff to execute  the changes. In December 2012, NOAA issued an updated plan that  provides additional contingency scenarios.", "However, it is not evident that critical steps have been implemented,  including simulating continuity situations and working with the user  community to account for differences in various continuity scenarios.  These steps are critical for NOAA to move forward in documenting the  processes it will take to implement its contingency plans. Once these  activities are completed, NOAA should update its contingency plan to  provide more details on its contingency scenarios, associated time  frames, and any preventative actions it is taking to minimize the possibility  of a gap. We have ongoing work assessing NOAA\u2019s actions to ensure  that its plans are viable and that continuity procedures are in place and  have been tested.", "Additional information on this area is provided on page 155 of our 2013  high risk update."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Narrowing High-Risk Areas", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Management of Federal Oil and Gas Resources", "paragraphs": ["Progress has been made in one of the three areas we identified in our  2011 High Risk List\u2014the Department of the Interior\u2019s (Interior)  reorganization of its oversight of offshore oil and gas activities.", "Reorganization. In October 2011, following the transfer of the Minerals  Management Service\u2019s oil and gas revenue collection functions to the  newly created Office of Natural Resources Revenue, Interior  established two new bureaus to provide oversight of offshore  resources and operational compliance with environmental and safety  requirements. The new Bureau of Ocean Energy Management  (BOEM) is responsible for leasing and approval of offshore  development plans while the new Bureau of Safety and Environmental  Enforcement (BSEE) is responsible for lease operations, safety, and  enforcement. Because the responsibilities of these two bureaus are  closely interconnected and depend on effective coordination, Interior  developed memoranda and standard operating procedures to define  roles and responsibilities and facilitate and formalize coordination.  Interior also enacted numerous policy changes intended to improve its  oversight of offshore oil and gas activities, such as new requirements  and policies designed to mitigate the risk of a subsea well blowout or  spill. In July 2012, we concluded that Interior has fundamentally  completed its reorganization of its oversight of offshore oil and gas  activities.", "In ongoing and future reviews, our primary focus will be to assess  Interior\u2019s remaining challenges to managing oil and gas resources\u2014 revenue collection and human capital. In so doing, we will also continue  to consider Interior\u2019s reorganization and its effect on the agency\u2019s ability  to oversee federal lands and waters.", "Revenue collection. In 2008, we reported that Interior collected lower  levels of revenues for oil and gas production than all but 11 of 104 oil  and gas resource owners whose revenue collection systems were  evaluated in a comprehensive industry study\u2014these resource owners  included many other countries as well as some states. We  recommended that Interior (1) undertake a comprehensive  reassessment of its revenue collection policies and processes and (2)  establish a balance between collecting revenues and ensuring that  public lands and waters remain an attractive option for oil and gas  development. In response to our recommendation, Interior contracted  for a study called \u201cComparative Assessment of the Federal Oil and  Gas Fiscal System\u201d with the goal to inform decisions about federal  lease terms, such as royalties, by consistently comparing the federal  oil and gas fiscal systems with those of other countries and identifying  ways to increase revenues and improve diligent development. Interior  completed this study in October 2011 but Interior is still in the process  of deciding if and how to use the results of the study to alter its lease  terms. In addition, Interior continues to work to implement a number of  our recommendations directed at improving Interior\u2019s ability to conduct  oil and gas production verification inspections. Finally, Interior is  working to implement our recommendations to correct numerous  problems with it\u2019s efforts to collect data on oil and gas produced on  federal lands, including missing data, errors in company-reported data  on oil and gas production, sales data that did not reflect prevailing  market prices for oil and gas, and a lack of controls over changes to  the data that companies reported. We are currently engaged in a  review of Interior\u2019s revenue collection practices that will evaluate,  among other things, Interior\u2019s progress in addressing our  recommendations.", "Human capital. We have reported that the bureaus responsible for  oversight and management of federal oil and gas resources on federal  lands and in federal waters\u2014Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and  the Minerals Management Service (the predecessor to BOEM and  BSEE)\u2014have encountered persistent problems in hiring, training, and  retaining staff. For example, in 2010, we found that both BLM and the  Minerals Management Service experienced high turnover rates in key  oil and gas inspection and engineering positions, potentially affecting  their oversight of oil and gas development on federal leases. For fiscal  years 2012 and 2013, Congress provided funds to BOEM and BSEE  in the Gulf of Mexico to establish higher minimum rates of pay for key  positions\u2014chiefly geophysicists, geologists, and petroleum  engineers\u2014for up to 25 percent of the usual minimum rate of pay.  BOEM and BSEE officials in the Gulf of Mexico told us that the pay  increase reduced attrition rates for these positions. However, it is  uncertain how Interior will address staffing shortfalls to oversee  offshore resources in the long term. In July 2012, we reported that  Interior was creating a new training program for its inspection staff  (such as BSEE\u2019s National Offshore Training Program to train  inspectors and engineers), but that it may take up to 2 years before  new inspection staff are fully trained. Further, human capital issues  also exist at BLM and the management of onshore oil and gas. For  example, BLM faces similar challenges in hiring, training, and  retaining staff for key positions but Interior has not received  congressional approval or funds to establish higher minimum rates of  pay for these positions as did BOEM and BSEE. We are currently  engaged in a review of Interior\u2019s efforts to meet its human capital  challenges. As part of this effort, we will focus on the causes of  Interior\u2019s human capital challenges, actions taken, and how Interior  plans to measure the effectiveness of corrective actions.", "Additional information on this area is provided on page 76 of our 2013  high risk update."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOE\u2019s Contract Management for the National Nuclear Security Administration and Office of Environmental Management.", "paragraphs": ["To recognize progress at the Department of Energy (DOE) on the  National Nuclear Security Administration\u2019s (NNSA) and Office of  Environmental Management\u2019s (EM) execution of nonmajor projects\u2014 projects with values of less than $750 million\u2014we are shifting the focus of  its high-risk designation to major contracts and projects executed by  NNSA and EM, those contracts and projects with values of $750 million or  greater.

In addition, DOE has continued to release guides  for implementing its revised order for Program and Project Management for  the Acquisition of Capital Assets (DOE O 413.3B), such as for cost  estimating, using earned value management, and for forming project  teams. Further, DOE has taken steps to enhance project management and  oversight by requiring peer reviews and independent cost estimates for  projects with values over $100 million and by improving the accuracy and  consistency of data in DOE\u2019s central repository for project data.", "Challenges remain for the successful execution of major projects. NNSA  and EM are currently managing 10 major projects with combined  estimated costs totaling as much as $65.7 billion. We have continued to  document significant cost increases and schedule delays as well as  technical challenges impacting project design. NNSA is tasked with  modernizing the nation\u2019s aging nuclear weapons production facilities, a  challenging effort that will take years and cost billions of dollars. EM faces  ongoing complex and long-term challenges in removing radioactive and  hazardous chemical contaminants\u2014left over from decades of weapons  production\u2014from soil, groundwater, and facilities. Billions of dollars have  already been spent, and will continue to be spent over the coming  decades to treat and dispose of this waste. In recognition of the  significance of these challenges, particularly in a time of fiscal constraint,  in 2012, multiple committees of the Senate and House of Representatives  held oversight hearings focused on needed improvements to DOE  contract management and project performance. Further, the National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 includes provisions  significant to considerations about NNSA contract and project  management, such as cost containment provisions for two of NNSA\u2019s  largest construction projects, both of which have experienced cost and  schedule delays; a requirement that NNSA submit to Congress reports  including expected cost savings associated with the award of contracts to  manage and operate NNSA facilities; and creation of an advisory panel to  make recommendations on revising the governance of the nuclear  security enterprise.
