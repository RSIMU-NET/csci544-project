In the design phase of the targeting process, USAID does not provide sufficient guidance on whether and how to target specialized food products. Specifically, USAID's guidance on design currently is neither up-to-date nor complete, and does not adequately address key benefits and risks that inform decisions on whether and how to target specialized food products. In USAID's monitoring and evaluation phases, weaknesses limit targeting effectiveness and hinder decision making. USAID currently does not require monitoring of key indicators needed to determine the level of targeting effectiveness. For example, during implementation USAID does not monitor actual recipients in its emergency programs. Furthermore, its evaluations do not systematically address targeting effectiveness. Without adequate guidance, monitoring, and evaluations, USAID cannot ensure targeting effectiveness in its food assistance programs.

In fiscal year 2011, with funding authorized  under the Food for Peace Act, the U.S. Agency for International  Development (USAID) reported that it spent approximately $1.7 billion on  food assistance that reached over 46 million people in 48 countries. Of  this total, USAID spent approximately $1.2 billion on emergency  programs to help alleviate hunger and malnutrition in countries affected  by natural or man-made disasters, such as drought or conflict. USAID  programs provide three types of food assistance products: (1) traditional  food products, such as wheat, corn, and sorghum; (2) traditional  specialized food products, such as corn soy blend (CSB), a nutritionally  enhanced commodity; and (3) new specialized food products, such as  ready-to-use supplementary or therapeutic foods.

As  defined by USAID, targeting is any method by which an intervention is  designed or implemented so that benefits can accrue selectively to only a  portion of the overall population. Targeting may be categorized by  geographic area or eligibility criteria, which are usually defined by  recipients\u2019 characteristics, such as age, gender, income level, asset level,  or nutritional status. For the purposes of this report, we define the  effectiveness of targeting as the degree to which USAID and its  implementing partners are able to (1) accurately assess needs and  identify recipients using appropriate eligibility criteria, and (2) ensure that  the food assistance provided reaches and is consumed by the targeted  recipients as defined by the eligibility criteria. While targeting may never  be perfect, targeting error indicators can be used to assess effectiveness.  These indicators include the percentage of intended recipients that did  not receive food assistance or the percentage of people who were not  eligible for assistance but still received it.", "Effective targeting is important, particularly in the context of constrained  resources, continuing humanitarian and food emergencies, and  increasing focus on addressing malnutrition in vulnerable populations.

Furthermore, gathering reliable data on transient  populations is challenging. For example, USAID and an implementing  partner in Ethiopia told us that in some areas of the country, it is difficult  to determine the number and location of people in need of food  assistance, particularly pastoralists, who move often as a traditional way  of life and to cope with drought or natural disasters. As a result, it is  difficult for implementing partners to accurately assess the needs in a  particular geographic area and design an appropriate food assistance  program.", "In addition, natural disasters or conflicts may raise security concerns,  hindering ability to reach targeted recipients. We recently reported that  security concerns prevented WFP from conducting field monitoring of  food distribution to determine whether the food rations reached the  originally targeted recipients in some high-risk areas of Ethiopia, Kenya,  and Somalia. For example, WFP noted that it has been unable to  access six districts in the Somali region of Ethiopia since May 2011. As a  result, WFP\u2019s ability to collect data to ensure that the intended recipients  received their food assistance in these high-risk areas is limited.", "USAID and implementing partners have taken some measures to improve  data quality by building capacity through technology, training, and other  activities. For example, USAID funds the Famine Early Warning Systems  Network (FEWS NET), which is used to monitor and prepare for changes  in food assistance needs. FEWS NET monitors and analyzes vulnerability  information, using multiple sources such as satellite imagery and field  observations. Moreover, some countries, such as Ethiopia, have  established national statistical offices that can assist in collecting data for  targeting food assistance. In addition, a 2011 report on food assistance  stated that implementing partners are working on increasing the speed,  accuracy, accessibility, and comparability of information. Implementing  partners in two countries we visited told us that they are using mobile  devices, such as tablets and phones, to collect recipient and distribution  data. The use of technology enables the implementing partners to better  identify and track recipients throughout the program and identify needs. In  the aforementioned example about excess ration size in a Guatemala  program, the implementing partner used tablets to collect information on  recipient consumption patterns. In this way, the implementing partner  ultimately discovered the ration error and corrected the ration size for  each household, freeing up resources to reach more recipients as a  result. Also, implementing partners in Guatemala and Sri Lanka indicated  that they train their staff and community volunteers on data collection, and  work with the host governments to improve the governments\u2019 ability to  collect data. In addition, some countries, such as Sri Lanka, have  conducted repeated assessments of food assistance needs over several  years, which can lead to improvements in the precision of the data  collected.", "Barrett, et al., 67. partner in Guatemala stated that data need to be improved continuously  to measure outcomes and impacts of targeting, particularly for programs  with a nutritional objective."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Host Government Policies May Cause Distortions, Limiting Targeting Effectiveness", "paragraphs": ["Host government policies may lead to distortions, hampering targeting  effectiveness, but implementing partners have made some efforts to  reduce these adverse effects.

In addition,  some host country governments have been criticized for underestimating  actual needs or directing implementing partners to operate only in certain  geographic areas, due to political or other reasons. As a result,  implementing partners may not be able to reach recipients or locations  most in need of food assistance. For example, an implementing partner  in Ethiopia reported to USAID that the government of Ethiopia set an  artificial quota for the number of people targeted in each household that in  some cases did not reflect the actual needs, and severely hampered the  partner\u2019s ability to reach vulnerable groups as a result. However, USAID  and implementing partner officials in Ethiopia also told us that working  with the government\u2019s distorted figures is less challenging now than in the  past, due in part to recent efforts of local and regional government  officials to improve the validity and documentation of needs assessments  as well as better stakeholder coordination.", "In some instances, however, host government policies may facilitate  targeting efforts.

For  example, in Ethiopia, USAID officials told us that to increase  transparency, donors are working with the government to introduce  software tools and technology that facilitate access to information and  increase public awareness and thereby discourage government  authorities from manipulating data on food assistance needs. Moreover,  to help facilitate distribution of food assistance to intended recipients in  Guatemala, implementing partners stated that it is essential to closely  coordinate with government authorities at the beginning of the targeting  process to obtain approval for the use of new products and to set up the  appropriate distribution channels and protocol. In addition, in Sri Lanka,  an implementing partner told us that it plans to use local organizations to  conduct independent verification of the potential recipient list, which is  largely selected by the government. Doing so would help the  implementing partner ensure that only recipients who qualify for food  assistance are included on the list, increasing the likelihood that food  assistance reaches the intended recipients.

The 2011 Food Aid Quality Review (FAQR)  report and the 2011 WFP guidance on targeted food assistance  programs acknowledge that sharing of specialized food products is a  concern, and according to a 2011 USAID assessment of a food  assistance program in the Somali region of Ethiopia, sharing of food  rations is widespread. In addition, in countries we visited, USAID and its  implementing partners told us that both CSB and traditional food products  are routinely shared within and among households in some  communities\u2014a finding we previously reported in 2011. The 2011  USAID assessment also notes that sharing is an established coping  mechanism for the recipient community when not everyone in the  community receives food rations.

Specifically,  implementing partners have employed various strategies to teach  recipients how to use specialized food products and have monitored  recipient food ration consumption. For example, one implementing  partner in Guatemala requires pregnant or lactating women to attend  education sessions, where they learn about the benefits of the specialized  food products and how to properly prepare them, before they can receive  rations. Implementing partners in Guatemala also print culturally relevant  instructional images on the food packages or the canvas bags given to  recipients to carry the rations. The images explain how to prepare the  food products and depict the type of person for whom the products are  intended\u2014such as a pregnant woman or a child under 2 years of age.  One of these implementing partners reported that it had seen an  improvement in recipient participation in these education sessions and  expected that these sessions would reduce sharing.", "In addition, implementing partners use community volunteers to monitor  effectiveness or consumption of food products. For example, in  Guatemala, implementing partners train \u201cmother leaders\u201d\u2014mothers who  are also recipients\u2014to provide training to other recipients on how to  prepare food and monitor outcomes by, for example, observing  improvement in a child\u2019s weight or overall health appearance. In Sri  Lanka, another implementing partner uses health volunteers from the  recipient community and coordinates with the host government to ensure  that specialized food products are consumed by the children through  monthly monitoring of their nutritional status at government-run clinics  and weighing stations.

This inadequate guidance hinders decision making on whether to use  these products. As discussed earlier, the benefit of specialized food  products is that, while more costly, they are also more nutritious, or of  higher quality, than traditional food products. However, USAID has not  quantified or clearly defined the degree of benefit that specialized food  products may provide. In 2011, we reported that in recent years,  nutritionists have debated the appropriateness of using fortified and  blended foods to prevent and treat malnutrition in young children 6 to 24  months old, who have smaller stomachs, making it more difficult for them  to eat enough of the product to obtain sufficient nutrients. As a result,  the benefits of some traditional specialized food products are not clear. In  addition, limited information on new specialized products is available.

A key targeting risk  is that various factors implementing partners face in-country may reduce  targeting effectiveness to such a degree that the additional cost of using  specialized food products outweighs the potential benefit. This trade-off  becomes more significant with the higher cost of new specialized food  products, for which the cost per ration can be more than triple the cost of  traditional food products. Poor data quality, host government policies, and  sharing may reduce implementing partners\u2019 ability to identify and reach  recipients, but USAID\u2019s existing guidance does not adequately inform  decisions on whether the reduction in targeting effectiveness is of such a  degree that the use of specialized food products is no longer justified.", "USAID is taking some steps to enhance guidance on whether and how to  use new specialized food products, but fully up-to-date and complete  guidance will not be completed until at least late 2013.

Effectively targeted programs reduce the magnitude of these errors.  USAID guidance states that monitoring should be used to measure  progress toward planned program results. Additionally, FANTA  guidance states that monitoring efforts should allow USAID and its  implementing partners to assess the extent to which targeted recipients  received intended food assistance. According to a USAID official,  USAID field staff do consider targeting during their routine monitoring of  food assistance programs. In addition, USAID requires its implementing  partners to collect some data, such as the number of intended recipients  for all food assistance programs, and requires other indicators to be  monitored depending on the type of program\u2014emergency or  development. However, USAID does not currently require sufficient  monitoring of key indicators consistent with program goals that would  allow its implementing partners to report on levels of targeting  effectiveness. For example, it cannot determine the effectiveness of a  program targeting children under 2 because it does not monitor the age of  the actual recipients in either emergency or development programs.", "USAID monitoring is inadequate for both emergency and development  programs because it does not monitor key data on recipients that would  allow USAID to measure whether food assistance is actually reaching the  intended recipients. Specifically, for emergency programs, USAID collects  the total number of intended recipients from its implementing partners, but  does not collect the total number of actual recipients or indicators such as  breakdowns of age and gender for intended or actual recipients.  According to USAID, these types of more specific indicators may not be  as important for some emergency programs that focus solely on rapid  lifesaving. However, these indicators are important for emergency  programs that do have specific targeting goals, such as reaching severely  malnourished children. For development programs, USAID collects both  the total number of intended and actual recipients from its implementing  partners, but as with its monitoring of emergency programs, does not  collect data on key indicators such as breakdowns of age and gender.  Without monitoring full sets of data for both intended and actual  recipients, including key indicators consistent with program goals, USAID  has limited ability to learn about the magnitude of targeting errors or the  degree to which its implementing partners are achieving their program  goals.", "According to USAID and implementing partner officials, it is particularly  complex to gather monitoring information on indicators related to targeting  effectiveness about actual recipients, due in part to cost and data quality  issues. These challenges are heightened for programs using new  specialized food products, which are designed to provide nutritional  benefits to very specific vulnerable groups, such as malnourished children  or pregnant or lactating women. Identifying and selecting recipients for  such programs requires using indicators that are more complex than  those used for programs designed for the general population. Some of  the indicators, such as nutritional status, are costly to measure and prone  to errors. For example, implementing partners we spoke with during our  fieldwork in Guatemala and Sri Lanka told us that they have difficulty in  collecting data for some indicators in other, non-USAID programs using  new specialized food products due to resource constraints, lack of  technical capacity by some local NGO staff, or problems with unreliable  data.", "USAID is making improvements in monitoring of some nutrition-focused  development programs, for example, by planning to require implementing  partners to collect data on the age of young children, a common criterion  for new specialized food products. However, as mentioned earlier,  indicators key to measuring targeting effectiveness are not consistently  monitored across all USAID food assistance programs. According to the  Standards of Internal Control in the Federal Government, program  managers need to compare actual performance to planned results and  analyze significant differences. Without reporting targeting  effectiveness, USAID cannot compare actual targeting effectiveness to  planned results. As a result, USAID may not be able to make fully  informed targeting decisions for both ongoing and future food assistance  programs. For example, USAID may not be able to track the performance  of food assistance programs\u2019 targeting over time or across programs and  may therefore miss opportunities to identify improvements to the targeting  effectiveness of these programs.", "USAID\u2019s targeting evaluations are not systematic, in part, because they are not routinely  conducted. USAID requires evaluations to be completed for all of its development  programs but does not require them for its emergency programs. Instead, emergency  programs are required to submit Annual Results Reports, which contain many of the same  types of information as evaluations, but for which no baseline assessment is conducted.  According to USAID officials, the difference between these requirements is due to the fact  that emergency programs are by nature typically in places where there may not be the  time or resources available to do a proper baseline assessment. evaluations that discussed targeting effectiveness included information on  the magnitude of inclusion or exclusion errors and the level of community  satisfaction with targeting. For example, USAID\u2019s evaluation of an  emergency program in Zimbabwe discussed inclusion and exclusion  error, a key measure of targeting effectiveness, within a section focused  exclusively on targeting. Similarly, USAID\u2019s evaluation of an emergency  program in Ethiopia mentioned the level of community satisfaction with  targeting: almost 90 percent of the respondents to a survey of community  members were generally satisfied with the fairness of the program\u2019s  targeting. Some evaluations, however, contained only a brief mention of  targeting in general, with no mention of targeting effectiveness. For  example, an evaluation of a development program in Bolivia mentioned  targeting and contained tables showing monitoring indicators for the  baseline compared against the final evaluation, but did not explain how  the recipients were originally targeted or how the final evaluation results  were verified. Other evaluations, such as a 2011 evaluation of a  development program in Guatemala, did not discuss targeting or targeting  effectiveness at all.", "USAID policy and guidance call on USAID and its implementing partners  to use evaluations as opportunities to learn about past programs to inform  decision making for new programs. USAID policy calls for evaluations to  \u201csystematically generate knowledge about the magnitude and  determinants of program performance, permitting those who design and  implement programs\u2026to refine designs and introduce improvements to  future efforts.\u201d USAID guidance states that evaluations should assess  the extent to which the program is meeting its stated objectives. For  example, if a program is providing food assistance to a vulnerable  subpopulation, effective targeting is an important program objective.  However, USAID\u2019s evaluations of its food assistance programs do not  systematically address targeting effectiveness, and as a result, the  agency\u2019s ability to assess the extent to which a program is meeting its  stated objectives is hindered, and it may miss opportunities for learning  lessons that could be useful when designing new programs or improving  ongoing ones."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The use of specialized food products, especially some of those most  recently introduced, offers the promise of providing better nutrition to the  most vulnerable. However, the increased cost of these new specialized  products means that their use may likely reduce the overall number of  recipients receiving food assistance under a fixed program budget\u2014a  quality-quantity trade-off. Choosing more costly specialized food products  over less costly traditional food products may be the optimal policy option  in certain circumstances, including areas with a high percentage of  children suffering from hunger and malnutrition. However, the  achievement of this policy goal requires effective targeting of food  assistance so that food ultimately reaches the intended recipients. If food  assistance is not targeted effectively, the program may fail to achieve its  nutritional goals while simultaneously feeding fewer people.", "USAID recognizes the need to update and broaden its guidance on the  use of specialized food products, but this revision will not be completed  until late 2013 at the earliest. Issuance of improved interim guidance  related to food assistance targeting will help USAID and its implementing  partners make better-informed decisions about whether and how to  deploy the range of food products that are available, particularly new  specialized products. Moreover, the monitoring and reporting of key  indicators consistent with program objectives are necessary to ensure  that specialized food products are, in fact, reaching intended recipients.

In addition, we met with officials  at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the U.S. Department of  State. We also spoke with academics, experts, and practitioners  associated with research institutes, universities, and NGOs. We  examined USAID program documents, including guidance and tools,  related to food assistance targeting processes. Furthermore, we  conducted fieldwork in four countries\u2014Ethiopia, Guatemala, Sri Lanka,  and Zimbabwe\u2014and met with officials from U.S. missions, implementing  partners, and relevant host government agencies. We also convened a  roundtable of 10 practitioners and experts\u2014including representatives  from implementing partners such as NGOs and WFP, academia, and  research organizations\u2014to discuss in-country factors that affect the ability  of USAID and its partners to target vulnerable groups, as well as the  guidance and monitoring and evaluation tools that USAID and its  implementing partners use to target food assistance activities (see app. II  for the list of participating organizations in our roundtable).", "To provide context and background, we analyzed data from USAID and  WFP to identify trends in U.S. funding for international food assistance  and procurement data on the use of traditional and specialized food  products. As these data were for background purposes, we did not  assess their reliability. In addition, we reviewed data that we reported on  in 2011 concerning cost information for specialized food products relative  to traditional food products. We then reviewed similar data to obtain  updates about the costs and relative length of feeding for these products  and interviewed USAID, WFP, and Tufts University about the reliability of  the updated data. We used this information to create an analysis  comparing the amount of time various commodities could be provided for  the cost of other commodities. We found that these updated data were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report, in that they  demonstrated the order of magnitude of the relative cost of different types  of food products used in food assistance programs. Although commodity  prices may fluctuate and suggested feeding lengths may vary by program  or individual recipient, the data were sufficiently reliable to demonstrate  that there are large differences in the cost of feeding, depending on the  products used. In addition, we reviewed various literature on the targeting  process, as well as USAID guidance and tools to facilitate targeting  decisions.", "To describe in-country factors USAID and its implementing partners face  in targeting vulnerable groups, we reviewed literature on targeting and  new specialized food products issued by academics, research institutes,  implementing partners, USAID contractors, UN organizations involved in  humanitarian assistance, and independent international organizations;  spoke with in-country officials such as relevant host government officials  and implementing partners; and obtained the input of our roundtable  participants.", "To examine the extent to which USAID\u2019s targeting process supports  effective targeting, we analyzed responses and information from the  general methodologies listed above.

We reviewed information from USAID about the  product types, costs, and tonnage of new specialized food products  purchased since fiscal year 2010. We interviewed USAID about the  sources of this information and also compared it to data about these  products from other sources of information. These included the requests  for applications that USAID provides to its implementing partners for new  specialized food products, including ready-to-use therapeutic foods and  lipid nutritional supplements; USAID\u2019s commodity price calculator; and  relevant legislation authorizing the use of these products. We found that  the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report, in that  they showed the magnitude and trends of purchases of new specialized  food products with USAID funding in recent years. To examine the extent  to which USAID monitors and evaluates targeting effectiveness and other  related information, we analyzed monitoring information provided to us by  USAID about numbers of planned recipients and actual beneficiaries for  Title II food assistance programs since 2009. We reviewed current USAID  policies and procedures on monitoring and evaluation. We also reviewed  guidance provided by Food and Nutrition Technical Assistance (FANTA),  under a cooperative agreement with USAID. This guidance covers  aspects of monitoring and evaluation, such as the performance measures  to be used for food assistance programs. Through searches of USAID\u2019s  website and discussions with cognizant officials, we identified a total of 30  final evaluations of USAID programs going back to 2009. Final  evaluations are conducted at the end of a program. However, USAID  could not assure us that it had provided all of the evaluations conducted  for its development programs, and also noted that it does not require  evaluations of its emergency programs. We selected 20 of these final  evaluations for review based on the following criteria: we included all 3  final evaluations for the single-year programs, and selected 17 final  evaluations for the multi-year programs to ensure that we had coverage  by year and geographic region.

Some experts suggest that,  although an individual daily ration of a new specialized food product may  be relatively expensive, it may ultimately be less costly overall because it  may be fed for a shorter period of time based on its suggested length of  use. However, we found that some new specialized food products with a  relatively shorter suggested length of use may still cost relatively more  overall. For example, as shown in the table, although an RUTF\u2019s  suggested length of use (42 to 90 days) for a child 6 to 23 months old is  shorter than that of a traditional grain-based ration (90 to 120 days), the  RUTF may still cost more overall ($17.77 to $41.40) than the grain-based  ration ($2.07 to $7.45).
