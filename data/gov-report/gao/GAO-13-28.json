In performing that work, GAO identified indications of possible weaknesses in selected processes, systems, and controls relied on to reasonably assure the validity and accuracy of reported Army active duty military payroll that were beyond the scope of that audit. GAO subsequently completed work on those issues and is presenting the results in this report. GAO (1) assessed the design of key controls for payroll accuracy and (2) determined the extent to which the Army and DFAS-IN have monitoring controls to identify and address any systemic weaknesses. GAO compared selected Army and DFAS-IN processes, systems, and controls for assuring payroll accuracy to applicable internal control standards and to applicable provisions of law, regulations, and policies and procedures. GAO also interviewed officials and examined related data and information."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO identified deficiencies in the design of key control procedures relied on by the Army and the Defense Finance and Accounting Service-Indianapolis (DFAS-IN) to detect errors in payroll disbursements to active duty Army military personnel. Specifically, GAO found that the Army's procedures for reviewing Unit Commander Finance Reports (UCFR) do not (1) provide for monitoring of required UCFR reviews to better assure detection of payroll errors, (2) require reporting on completed UCFR reviews in all cases, and (3) clearly establish time frames for completing and reporting on UCFR reviews. GAO's analysis of DFAS data on military pay debts and Army investigations of potential fraud completed over the past 2 years identified numerous instances of the effect of errors or irregularities in Army active duty payroll disbursements that went undetected for lengthy periods of time, including some that were not detected for up to 2 years or until the soldier left the Army. For example:", "A soldier who separated from the Army in 2009 continued to receive active duty pay totaling about $185,000 until 2011.", "A soldier who was absent without leave from January 2010 to September 2011 received military pay of $33,268 to which she was not entitled.", "A soldier under investigation for possible fraud allegedly received over $34,000 in paratrooper and language proficiency pay but did not have a documented record of jumps performed or up-to-date proficiency certifications.", "GAO's analysis determined that the Army could reduce its risk of lengthy delays in detecting and correcting pay errors with more stringent UCFR monitoring and reporting requirements.", "GAO also found that DFAS and the Army have procedures and metrics in place that focus on the timeliness of manual processing and payroll adjustments for error corrections. However, they do not have procedures and metrics to enable them to gather data on active duty pay errors that were related to causes other than timeliness, such as over- and underpayments, data entry errors, and unauthorized payments. Further, the design of existing Defense Joint Military Pay System-Active Component and DFAS-IN Case Management System procedures for transaction processing and error correction did not provide for monitoring to capture data on all types of pay errors and their causes that would be useful in identifying the extent to which there are any additional systemic payroll control weaknesses. For example, an Army National Guard colonel deployed on active duty to Afghanistan reported that he experienced financial hardship when his military pay was stopped for 1-1/2 months. The absence of data on the extent and causes of all types of Army active duty military payroll errors impairs the Army's ability to identify and address any adverse trends that may indicate the existence of other systemic control weaknesses. Overall, the control deficiencies that GAO identified increase the risk that the nearly $47 billion in reported fiscal year 2011 Army active duty military payroll includes Army servicemembers who received pay to which they were not entitled and others who did not receive the full pay they were due. Further, to the extent that errors in Army active duty pay are not identified and addressed in a timely manner, they can have a negative effect on soldier welfare and, ultimately, could erode soldiers' focus on their Army mission."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO made five recommendations to strengthen Army and DFAS monitoring and reporting controls over Army active duty military payroll accuracy.

Consequently, we determined that the Army did not have a central  repository of official military personnel records and other documents  affecting pay that was maintained, updated, and validated.

However, as shown in  figure 1, because AR 37-104-4 and Army Vice Chief of Staff guidance  only require UCFRs to be submitted if corrections or updates are needed,  the Army and DFAS-IN do not have positive assurance that all UCFRs  were appropriately reviewed. However, current Army regulations do not  include any requirements to monitor the effectiveness of required UCFR  reviews. Further, the lack of a mandatory requirement to submit UCFRs  impairs the ability of the Army and DFAS-IN to obtain a population of  UCFRs that could be used to periodically monitor and test the  effectiveness of UCFR reviews for assuring the accuracy of active duty  Army military payroll transactions. DFAS-IN and Army officials  acknowledged that UCFR review and submission could be a useful  compensating control if submission of the reports was a mandatory  requirement whether or not corrections or updates are needed. Further,  monitoring to better ensure that appropriate review of monthly UCFRs in  concert with a requirement for mandatory UCFR submission within a  certain number of days could provide a useful compensating control for  assuring active duty Army military payroll accuracy by providing early  detection of the types of payroll errors and irregularities that we identified.", "The current reporting requirement also limits the effectiveness of the  requirement for monthly UCFR reviews.

The Army  Financial Management Command Director and DFAS-IN\u2019s Mil Pay Ops  Director stated that DOD-wide military payroll metrics, including the  Army\u2019s military payroll metric, are designed to track timeliness but not  accuracy and emphasized that they believe transaction timeliness is the  best primary metric for monitoring the accuracy of soldier pay. However,  all pay errors are not a result of timeliness issues as discussed later in  this report; errors also occurred as a result of certain overpayments, data  entry errors, unauthorized payments, and fraud. DFAS-IN and the Army  do not have monitoring procedures in place to accumulate and analyze  pay problems that are not related to timeliness. Consequently, DFAS-IN  and the Army do not accumulate data and do not have a corresponding  metric to track pay accuracy for all types of military pay and entitlements.  If not corrected, this condition could impede the Army\u2019s ability to respond  to a financial audit because to the extent that auditors cannot rely on  controls, they will need to increase transaction testing. Moreover, to the  extent that errors in Army active duty pay are not identified and  addressed in a timely manner, they can have a negative effect on soldier  welfare and, ultimately, could erode the focus on Army mission readiness.", "The Directors of DFAS-IN and the Army Financial Management  Command stated that DFAS and the Army monitor and follow up on late  submissions of pay-affecting documents. The Directors stated that not all  late submissions of pay changes indicate pay errors. For example, the  Directors explained that if a commander approves and military orders are  issued for retroactive promotions, they recognize that the pay amounts  could be viewed as inaccurate until the retroactive promotions are  processed. However, the retroactive nature of the adjustment does not  indicate that there was an error. While timeliness is the issue in these  cases, the retroactive effective date of the promotion indicates both  timeliness and accuracy are issues of concern because servicemembers  were paid an incorrect amount for a period of time. According to the  DFAS-IN Mil Pay Ops Director, the Office of the Secretary of Defense  Personnel/Pay Council\u2019s Pay Performance Metrics include such  retroactive payments in the timeliness \u201cmetric\u201d for processing of military  pay transactions within 30 days of the effective date. However, the 20-day  CMS metric for timeliness does not consider the period of time during  which a pay amount was incorrect.", "Our analysis determined that if DFAS-IN wanted to accumulate separate  information on types of active duty Army military pay errors, it would need  to establish criteria and perform a labor-intensive review of the details of  approximately 300,000 CMS cases annually, survey DMPOs for  information on active Army military pay errors they correct locally but are  not required to document and report, and consider the extent to which  other processes identify error corrections in order to extract information  on errors by pay category and the causes of those errors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Data on Payroll Adjustments for Underpayment or Overpayment of Active Duty Military Pay Are Not Used to Help Identify Potential Systemic Control Weaknesses", "paragraphs": ["The system that DFAS-IN uses to pay Army active duty soldiers (DJMS- AC) does not have the capability to identify and report the extent and  causes of under- and overpayments and other types of payroll errors  related to active duty Army soldier pay. As a result, DFAS-IN is not able  to analyze the extent to which there may be any systemic control  weaknesses that need corrective action. Without the ability to detect and  correct systemic weaknesses, over- and underpayments are likely to  continue, creating a financial burden for soldiers who did not receive all  the pay they were due and soldiers who received more than their entitled  amounts and were subjected to collection action. Either problem may  pose financial hardship for the soldiers and detract from their focus on  mission.", "Underpayments occur when the events that increase basic pay and  allowances are not reflected in a military pay transaction at the time they  occur. Underpayments also occur when a soldier is not paid in a timely  manner for special pays when the related certification training is  completed. When underpayments are identified and confirmed, DFAS- IN pays them to the soldier in the next paycheck. Underpayments affect  soldiers\u2019 personal finances, especially when they are not resolved in a  timely fashion. For example, a colonel in the Army National Guard  reported experiencing numerous underpayments throughout his 28 years  of service, including suffering financial hardship when he was on active  duty in 2003 to Afghanistan and his active duty pay was stopped for 1-1/2  months. He also stated he did not receive hardship duty pay and hostile  fire pay while on a deployment to Southeast Asia, which took  approximately 1-1/2 years to correct. Further, he reported that his pay  problems have persisted, with the most recent being in January 2012.", "Overpayments may occur when a servicemember returns from a combat  zone deployment to a duty station in the United States and the Army  personnel system fails to notify the pay system. Overpayments are  recovered through withholding from the soldier\u2019s subsequent pay.

DFAS-IN officials explained that DJMS-AC does not  have unique transaction codes that identify adjustments to active duty  Army soldiers\u2019 pay. As a result, adjustments for underpayments of military  pay are entered with the same codes as those used for original military  pay transactions. Therefore, although DFAS-IN can identify the total  number of transactions by type of pay and allowance, it cannot separately  identify the number or causes of underpayments made to active duty  servicemembers. Further, DFAS-IN cannot provide a detailed breakdown  of the reasons for and dollar amounts of overpayments because DJMS- AC is not configured to capture information on the detailed causes of  overpayments of pay and allowances. Instead, debt reason codes in  DJMS-AC relate generally to the type of pay and allowance debt that is  being assessed against a soldier\u2019s pay account, such as basic allowance  of housing or hostile fire pay. The DFAS-IN Mil Pay Ops Director said it  would be too costly to change the current system to include transaction  codes related to correction of under- and overpayments. The Director of  the Army Financial Management Command and Army G-1 officials told us  that user requirements for the Integrated Personnel and Pay System- Army (IPPS-A), which is intended to replace the Army\u2019s DJMS, include  this type of functionality. However, IPPS-A full functionality for military  payroll is not targeted for implementation until the third quarter of 2016.

Further, CMS does not capture  and accumulate data on the types and causes of pay errors that are  corrected by DMPOs and finance offices. Without a CMS monitoring  capability, the Army is limited in its ability to identify and address any  additional systemic military payroll control weaknesses.", "Our analysis of Mil Pay Ops processes determined that CMS serves as  an electronic file folder that accumulates documents needed to resolve  military pay issues with the capability to identify information on types of  cases, such as separations, and their status to ensure that they are  processed or corrected within DFAS timeliness metrics. Our analysis of  unaudited CMS data showed that the CMS process adopted for Army  payroll cases has processed an average of 310,000 DJMS-AC system- generated cases and manual cases annually since fiscal year 2008,many of which involved problems with multiple types of pay transactions.  For the first 11 months of fiscal year 2012, approximately half of the  cases processed were manual cases. We determined that both the  manual and the system-generated case categories contain cases that  relate to error corrections. However, CMS processes do not require the  identification of the types of cases or the extent to which they relate to  error corrections. Because CMS does not capture and accumulate data  on all corrections of military payroll errors, it does not serve as an  effective monitoring control for providing DFAS-IN and the Army the  ability to determine the extent and nature of active duty Army military pay  errors and identify systemic weaknesses and their causes in order to  design appropriate corrective actions, leaving the Army at risk of  continuing errors.", "For example, our analysis and discussions with DFAS-IN officials  regarding pay system rejects\u2014DJMS-AC system-generated transactions  that were not allowed to process in DJMS-AC\u2014determined that some of  these system-generated rejects relate to error corrections. For example,  the reject analysis reports contain error codes that identify the type of  transactions that DJMS-AC controls did not allow DJMS-AC to process.  The reject analysis report breaks out the number of rejects that are to be  sent to DMPOs or finance offices for correction and those that must be  corrected centrally by DFAS-IN and have a CMS case created for  tracking and visibility. DMPO officials told us that upon receiving reject  reports, they would contact military units to alert them about any  unusually high numbers of errors in a pay category, such as basic  allowance for housing.

Accordingly, it is important that the Army implement appropriate and  effective compensating controls, including monitoring controls to assess  the quality of performance over time. Improved procedures for monitoring  and reporting on monthly UCFRs\u2014which detail most pay and allowance  information for soldiers\u2014could provide an important compensating control  for assuring payroll accuracy. In addition, because DFAS-IN and the  Army do not have a comprehensive accuracy metric for military payroll  and current processes, systems, and controls are not designed to identify  and document the extent and cause of payroll errors, irregularities, and  corrections, DFAS-IN and the Army are limited in their ability to determine  the overall accuracy of Army active duty military pay or whether there are  any related unidentified systemic weaknesses that should be corrected.  Without immediate action to address these deficiencies, DFAS-IN and the  Army will not be able to assure that soldiers are paid timely and  accurately.

DOD stated that the  bonus amounts presented in table 1 of this report are not payroll errors,  but instead arise when servicemembers leave the service before the end  of their service commitments. We disagree. We recognized in the report  that an unearned bonus occurs when a servicemember does not fulfill the  service contract, causing all or a portion of the bonus to be unearned. We  also pointed out that doing so has resulted in the largest amount of Army  military pay-related out-of-service debt.", "Further, DOD stated that our audit approach focused solely on the design  of the controls without analysis of whether undetected errors exist and  whether the recommended additional activities would efficiently detect  any missed errors. DOD is correct that the focus of this engagement was  on the design of controls, as discussed in detail in the scope and  methodology section of this report. However, because we identified flaws  in the design of controls, we determined there would be little benefit in  testing the implementation of a flawed control. Further, as discussed in  our report, because the flawed design of the UCFR process does not  provide positive assurance that payroll errors will be detected and  corrected, we reviewed the results of other processes, including DFAS\u2019s  debt and claims management information related to military payroll debt  and Army CID\u2019s investigations of potential fraud, to determine if those  processes identified any errors or irregularities that went undetected for  lengthy periods of time.", "With regard to our three recommendations to strengthen UCFR controls,  DOD partially agreed, stating that it concurred fully with the goal of  improving the accuracy of military pay to the extent that cost-effective  corrective actions are warranted. However, we continue to believe that  the design of the UCFR process is not fully effective in providing positive  assurance of military payroll accuracy. Consequently, as discussed in our  report, UCFR reviews do not provide an effective compensating control.  Accordingly, we believe that our recommendations in this area are  appropriate and are intended to help strengthen the design of existing  processes and controls to help improve DOD\u2019s ability to rely on UCFR  reviews as a compensating control. Our first recommendation is directed  at establishing a requirement for periodic monitoring of the effectiveness  of UCFR reviews. Because the current UCFR control as designed  requires reporting only if deficiencies are found, it is not possible to  monitor and test the extent to which required reviews were effective in  identifying military payroll errors. Our second recommendation to  enhance the control design is directed at revising AR 37-104-04, Military  Pay and Allowances Policy, to require unit commanders to document  completion of all monthly UCFR reviews, and our third recommended  enhancement calls for the Army to clarify the required time frame for  submitting UCFRs. DOD\u2019s response to all three recommendations was  that by February 28, 2013, the Army, working with DFAS, will complete  statistically valid tests to determine to what extent payroll errors occur and  whether any identified errors can be efficiently detected and prevented  before payment by implementing additional control activities. However, as  discussed in our report, Army and DFAS systems and processes do not  currently capture data on all errors and their causes. Consequently, it is  not clear how DOD will identify a statistically valid universe for testing to  support a decision on whether additional actions are warranted to  strengthen the UCFR process as a compensating control.", "With respect to our two recommendations directed at actions needed to  improve monitoring of payroll accuracy, DOD also partially agreed, stating  that DFAS believes that it has procedures and metrics to gather  comprehensive data for all types of payroll errors, including both  timeliness and improper payments. However, as discussed in our report,  DOD does not have a comprehensive metric for monitoring the accuracy  of soldier pay. Specifically, we found that Army and DFAS payroll  processes and systems capture data on pay timeliness but do not capture  data on all errors and the causes of the errors. All pay errors are not a  result of timeliness issues. Our report discusses pay errors resulting from  overpayments, data entry errors, unauthorized payments, and potential  fraud. We identified errors that were not detected and corrected for  several months or, in some cases, for several years. Further, errors are  not captured and reported when detected if they are corrected within 30  days of the effective date. DOD also stated that DFAS would analyze  military payroll metrics to determine whether any gaps exist between  current timeliness metrics and accuracy and the errors discussed in our  report. However, without developing criteria to identify and capture data  on all types of payroll errors, a review of current processes and metrics is  likely to be ineffective in identifying such gaps. In responding to our  recommendation to develop an interim mechanism for identifying and  analyzing the extent and causes of all types of errors (until such  functionality can be implemented in IPPS-A), DOD stated that if gaps are  discovered in its analysis, it would take steps to correct them. However, a  onetime DFAS-IN analysis of payroll metrics to identify gaps in timeliness  and accuracy would not serve the purpose of establishing an interim  mechanism.", "DOD\u2019s letter is reprinted in its entirety in app. 1.
