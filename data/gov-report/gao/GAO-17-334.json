GAO analyzed data on the number of pediatric and adult trauma centers in the United States relative to the pediatric population under 18 years of age. GAO used 2015 data on trauma centers from the American Trauma Society's Trauma Information Exchange Program and 5-year population estimates for 2011-2015 from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey, which were the latest available data at the time of GAO's analysis.

Among states, the proportion of children who lived within 30 miles of these pediatric trauma centers varied widely. In areas without pediatric trauma centers, injured children may have to rely on adult trauma centers or less specialized hospital emergency departments for initial trauma care. Some studies GAO reviewed, including nationwide studies, found that children treated at pediatric trauma centers have a lower mortality risk compared to children treated at adult trauma centers and other facilities, while other state-level studies GAO reviewed found no difference in mortality. Further, some studies GAO reviewed and stakeholders GAO interviewed suggest that more information is needed on outcomes other than mortality for children treated at pediatric trauma centers because mortality can be a limited outcome measure, as overall mortality is low among severely injured children.", "Two agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)\u2014the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH)\u2014have grant programs and other activities that support hospital-based pediatric trauma care. For example, HRSA's Emergency Medical Services for Children Program provides grants to integrate pediatric emergency care\u2014which encompasses care for both traumatic injury and illness\u2014into states' larger emergency medical services systems. GAO also found that federal activities related to hospital-based pediatric trauma care and other emergency care are coordinated through an interagency group and arrangements among agencies.

More children die of injury each year than from all other causes  combined. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  (CDC), more than 8,000 children under 18 years of age suffered fatal  injuries in 2015. Further, according to the latest available CDC estimates,  unintentional injuries to children under 18 that resulted in hospitalization  combined for an estimated $22.9 billion in medical and other costs in  2010.", "Most traumatic injuries\u2014including those to children\u2014are treated in a  hospital emergency department. However, for severe physical injuries,  emergency departments may not have the equipment or personnel  resources necessary to effectively provide treatment, so severely injured  patients may be transported directly to a trauma center or transferred to a  trauma center by an emergency department. Trauma centers are facilities  with the specialized resources needed to care for patients with severe  physical injuries. Not all trauma centers have pediatric-specific  capabilities. Pediatric trauma centers have the specialized resources\u2014 providers, equipment, and expertise\u2014needed to care for children with  severe physical injuries.", "Concerns have been raised that many children may not have ready  access to pediatric trauma centers. For example, a 2009 study estimated  that at least 17.4 million children across the United States could not reach  a pediatric trauma center within an hour by air or ground transportation.  Similarly, a 2005 study estimated that 46.7 million people (both adults and  children) did not have access to a trauma center within an hour\u2019s travel  time. Timely access to appropriate hospital-based pediatric trauma care  can be significant in limiting death or disability for injured children.  Further, in 2006 the Institute of Medicine reported that emergency care  services\u2014including trauma care\u2014for children have traditionally been  fragmented, with emergency medical services, trauma centers, and public  health agencies focused on their separate missions.

To assess the reliability of the data  from the American Trauma Society Trauma Information Exchange  Program on the number and location of trauma centers in the United  States, we interviewed a knowledgeable official about the process for  collecting the data and verified the location and level of trauma centers in  selected states by comparing the data to publicly available lists of trauma  centers from the American College of Surgeons, state emergency  medical services websites, and other official state and hospital websites.  To assess the reliability  of the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s American  Community Survey 5-year population estimates of children under 18, we  reviewed relevant documentation and performed data checks to check for  outliers, errors, and consistency.

Making this designation is the responsibility of state or sometimes local  entities, such as a state\u2019s office of emergency medical services. While the  criteria used to designate a trauma center\u2019s level can vary from state to  state, most states have adopted guidelines that are either the same as or  similar to the guidelines developed by the American College of Surgeons  Committee on Trauma (ACS-COT). Table 1 summarizes the general  criteria for trauma centers based on the ACS-COT guidelines.", "Types of trauma centers. There are two types of trauma centers\u2014 pediatric and adult.

Pediatric  trauma centers have dedicated resources to treat injured children and can  be either stand-alone children\u2019s hospitals or distinct units within larger  hospitals.", "A pediatric trauma center must meet all the same requirements that an  adult trauma center must meet, as well as additional requirements. For  example, according to ACS-COT guidelines, a level I pediatric trauma center must have at least two surgeons who  are board certified in pediatric surgery and must admit 200 or more  injured children younger than 15 annually; and a level II  pediatric trauma center must have at least one board- certified pediatric surgeon and must admit 100 or more injured  children younger than 15 annually.", "Pediatric trauma centers are expected to provide trauma care for the  most severely injured children and have a leadership role in education,  research, and planning with other trauma centers and non-trauma center  hospitals in their geographic area with regards to care for injured children.", "ACS-COT recommends that pediatric trauma centers be used to the  fullest extent feasible to treat traumatically injured children; however, due  to the limited number and geographic distribution of these centers, ACS- COT recognizes that adult trauma centers or non-trauma centers must  provide initial care for injured children in areas where specialized pediatric  resources are not available. Research shows that even in states that  designate trauma centers, nearly half of injured children\u201445 percent\u2014 are treated at non-trauma centers. Many of these non-trauma centers  where injured children receive treatment do not treat a high volume of  pediatric patients and may not have the equipment recommended for  treating children.

Another study from 2016 that examined hospitalizations nationwide for  injured adolescents aged 15 to 19 had a similar finding.

Both studies found that after  adjusting for injury severity, mortality was lower for children who were  taken directly to a pediatric trauma center compared with children who  were initially taken to a local hospital.", "In contrast, three of the studies we reviewed did not find a significant  difference in the risk of mortality for children treated at pediatric trauma  centers compared to children treated at adult trauma centers. All three  of these studies were state-level analyses rather than analyses based on  a national sample. For example, two studies, which each examined data  for adolescents from a single state, did not identify significant differences  in mortality among adolescents treated at pediatric and adult trauma  centers.

Seven studies examined outcomes other than  mortality, but according to some of the studies we reviewed and  stakeholders we interviewed, more information is needed on outcomes  other than mortality for children treated at pediatric trauma centers.  Further, as some studies note, mortality can be a limited measure for  determining quality of care or a trauma center\u2019s contribution to survival,  because overall mortality is low among severely injured children. One  2015 study found that adding a pediatric trauma center in Delaware  decreased the frequency of pediatric splenectomies\u2014a procedure that  removes a child\u2019s spleen.

One study from 2016 that we  reviewed noted that in the pediatric trauma literature there are no  longitudinal studies on the long-term effects\u2014both physical and  psychological\u2014of trauma on children. In addition, another study we  reviewed indicated that the selection of outcome measures for analysis  was constrained by what was available in the dataset used for the  study. One stakeholder we interviewed told us that mortality is one of  the few outcomes related to pediatric trauma that is captured in  databases, because most trauma registries and other databases were  initially developed to capture data for adult patients. Moreover, a few  stakeholders told us that the pediatric trauma system is not as well  developed as the adult trauma system and that both pediatric trauma care  and research have tended to occur in isolation.
