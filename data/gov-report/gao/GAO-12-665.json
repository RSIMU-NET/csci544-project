MEPs, a type of pension plan maintained by more than one employer, have been supported as an option that could expand coverage by lowering administrative costs. For this report, GAO examined (1) the characteristics of private-sector MEPs, (2) the advantages and disadvantages of MEPs and how their perceived advantages are used to market them, and (3) how IRS and Labor regulate MEPs.", "GAO interviewed MEP sponsors, pension experts, officials at the Department of Labor (Labor), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), and analyzed the primary source of pension data reported to the government\u0097the Form 5500."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Little is known about the characteristics of private sector multiple employer plans (MEP), especially information regarding the employers that participate in them. Although no participating employer information is currently collected in the Form 5500, the primary source for pension information reported to the government, some plan-level information on MEPs is available. GAO\u0092s analysis of 2009 plan-level data shows that the bulk of MEP participants and assets resided in the largest 25 private-sector MEPs. Three major sponsor types emerged among the top 25 plans: large corporations, associations, and professional employer organizations (PEO), which are firms that provide payroll and other human resources services to clients. These sponsor types differ in various ways, but notably, associations and PEO sponsors GAO interviewed tended to have a large number of employers participating in their plans. Little is also known about a fourth category of sponsor type called \u0093open\u0094 MEPs, a type of MEP in which employers in the plan share no common relationship or affiliation with the other employers in the plan. This sponsor type appears to have come about in response to 2002 IRS guidance that allowed certain PEOs to avoid tax disqualification of their pension plans if they were converted to MEPs. Soon after this guidance was issued, practitioners began offering open MEPs.", "MEPs are marketed as providing several advantages for employers over single-employer plans, but GAO found that these advantages may not always be unique to MEPs. MEPs are marketed as providing reduced fiduciary liability, administrative responsibility, and cost. However, other types of single-employer plans may also offer reduced fiduciary responsibility and third-party administrators can reduce administrative responsibilities. Overall, among MEP representatives and pension experts, there was no consensus on whether or not open MEPs or PEO-sponsored MEPs could substantially expand pension coverage. Given that employers do not directly oversee the plan, there was also some concern from Labor officials regarding the risk of MEP abuses, such as charging excess fees or mishandling the plan\u0092s assets. Additionally, because all of the participating employers are responsible for maintaining the MEP, if one employer becomes noncompliant with the tax requirements the plans of all the employers in the MEP may lose their tax-qualified status.", "Labor regulates MEPs for participant protections under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), while the IRS regulates them for preferential tax treatment under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). However, ERISA places requirements on plans that are not required under the IRC, and Labor and IRS do not coordinate to reduce the impacts of defining a MEP differently. For example, although Labor recently opined that open MEPs are a collection of single plans, each separately sponsored by participating employers for their employees, open MEPs still qualify for preferential tax treatment under the IRC. Pension experts told GAO that such differing treatment can create compliance challenges. For example, an open MEP may be able to file a single annual report for the IRS but may also have to file annual reports for each of its component plans for Labor. Pension experts agreed that compliance guidance from either agency would be helpful."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that Labor lead an effort to collect data on the employers that participate in MEPs.

An employer who adopts a  master or prototype plan completes an adoption agreement to elect  certain options specified in detail in a separate plan document, but  generally the provider or sponsor centrally administers the plan and, in  the case of a master plan, pools the assets of the adopting employers into  a central investment trust.

The vast  majority of pension plans are single-employer plans. More specifically,  MEPs account for only 318 defined benefit plans and 4,593 defined  contribution plans.

For example, especially  in the case of defined benefit plans, as long as a participant remains an  employee of an employer within the association, they can change jobs  and continue earning additional benefits and vesting service credit  towards association plan benefits. Moreover, because MEPs can pool  resources, the plans can offer a broad enough array of benefit options to  satisfy association members and participants.

This usually  includes administering a suite of human resources functions for the client  such as payroll services, a worker\u2019s compensation program, and a health  insurance plan. Additional services may also be offered or required, but  each PEO representative we interviewed said their PEO also offered a  401(k) defined contribution plan.

As PEO-sponsored MEPs  continued to grow, one firm, TAG Resources, LLC, started a new type of  MEP: a defined contribution plan it called an \u201copen\u201d MEP. differences between PEO MEPs and open MEPs appear to be that open  MEPs do not (1) offer payroll management or other administrative  services PEOs typically offer, or (2) purport to be an employer of plan  participants.

However, we found that these  advantages may not always be unique to MEPs. Based on our  interviews with MEP representatives and the fact that, as stated earlier in  this report, PEO and open MEPs are new and different compared to the  other MEP types, it may be that PEO MEPs and open MEPs are the only  MEP types marketing MEPs to employers. Consequently, the following  section focuses on the advantages of MEPs overall in the context of how  they would be presented to employers.", "Reduced fiduciary liability\u2014According to all of the PEO and open MEP  representatives we interviewed, the firms that offer MEPs take on some  fiduciary duties that would otherwise remain solely with the employers if  employers managed their own plans; however, exactly how much relief  from liability, if any, the firm can provide to employers is unclear. In  taking some of the fiduciary responsibility, these firms have control over  the management or assets of the plan, which, according to one MEP  representative, includes fund selection, due diligence in tracking the  investment performance, and employee communication. Prior GAO work  identified the burden of fiduciary liability as a possible impediment to  small-employer plan sponsorship. According to one open MEP  representative, reducing fiduciary liability is the primary reason employers  participate in MEPs. Our prior work suggests this may be because some  employers are not familiar with how to manage a plan. However, there  may be other ways for employers to gain the same degree of reduced  fiduciary responsibility as afforded by a MEP. For example, we found a  firm marketing its willingness to establish and manage the investments of  single-employer plans on the behalf of individual employers.", "In contrast to the claims made by some MEP representatives, several  plan representatives and pension experts we spoke with said firms that  offer MEPs cannot assume all fiduciary liability on behalf of the  participating employer. Although a firm that offers a MEP can generally  control the plan on behalf of the participating employers, as Labor notes  on its website, at a minimum, the employers must still select a MEP to  join, which is considered a fiduciary function, and retain responsibility to  monitor the plan\u2019s investments and fees. However, some MEP marketing  materials we reviewed may give an impression that enrolling in MEPs  eliminates fiduciary liability for employers entirely. Further, two of the  MEP representatives stated that MEPs did eliminate fiduciary liability for  employers.", "Reduced administrative responsibility\u2014All of the PEO and open MEP  representatives we interviewed said firms that offer MEPs assume  administrative responsibilities that employers would retain if they  managed their own plans. Several MEP representatives said MEP  administrators can complete the record keeping and annual testing, and  submit required filings such as a single Form 5500 for the MEP on behalf  of all the participating employers. Additionally, a couple of the  interviewees said that employers not already offering plans might find it  easier and faster to join a MEP than to create their own administrative  structure with a single-employer plan. However, our prior work has shown  that individual sponsoring employers can also use service providers to  perform administrative functions similar to those that MEPs offer.  Further, PEOs that offer payroll services may offer similar plan  administrative services for small employers that sponsor a single- employer plan through the PEO. Consequently, it is unclear how, if at  all, the administrative services offered by a MEP differ significantly from  those offered for a single plan through a PEO. Finally, a couple of MEP  representatives identified the difficulty involved with tracking some of the  administrative tasks needed for a MEP if the participating businesses did  not have a common payroll remitter. One pension expert thought that this  complexity increased the chance that the MEP could fail to meet some of  its administrative responsibilities.", "Reduced cost\u2014All of the PEO and open MEP representatives we  interviewed thought that participating in MEPs may offer reduced costs as  compared to single-employer plan sponsorship since participating  employers can pool assets to obtain the lower pricing available to the  larger plans. Additionally, several interviewees described how employers  may not need to pay for additional services from third-party administrators  or financial experts, which may be similar to what our prior work  described as bundled services. Further, while enrolling in MEPs can save time for employers without a prior plan, as mentioned earlier, a  couple of interviewees said MEPs may also save money since the  employer will not need to spend money to create an initial plan document  for a new single-employer plan. Lastly, in some cases, a firm offering a  MEP is only required to conduct a single plan audit, which a few  interviewees told us can be expensive for individual employers  sponsoring their own plans. This may reduce costs for larger participating  employers; however, employers with fewer than 100 participants are not  required to audit their plans.", "Overall, no consensus existed among MEP representatives and pension  experts on whether or not MEPs such as PEO MEPs or open MEPs  would substantially expand pension coverage. Several MEP  representatives thought that MEPs had the potential to expand coverage,  especially among small to mid-size employers that could benefit from the  potential administrative and cost advantages. However, a couple of  pension experts were skeptical that open MEPs would have much of an  impact in expanding retirement plan coverage. For example, one pension  expert said employee demand, rather than cost benefits offered by MEPs,  drives whether or not a business sponsors a plan. In our prior work, small  employers reported that employees may prefer to have health care  coverage or may not be interested in participating in a retirement plan.  The pension expert also observed that small businesses do not  extensively research retirement plans or actively seek them out. As a  consequence, marketing may be the biggest determinant of MEP growth.  Additionally, while a couple of the MEPs we spoke with had offerings for  employers to start new plans through the MEP, several targeted  businesses with existing plans. For example, an open MEP  representative said their adopting employers usually have over 100  employees or plan assets of $2 million to $5 million.", "There is also concern about whether MEPs are any more or less prone to  abuse than other types of pension arrangements. Labor officials said the  potential for inadequate employer oversight of the MEP is greater  because employers have passed along so much responsibility to the  entity controlling the MEP. Labor officials noted that potential abuses  might include layering of fees, misuse of the assets, or falsification of  benefit statements. One pension expert agreed that there was potential for MEPs to charge excess fees without the enrolled employer being  aware of those fees. While Labor officials acknowledged that single- employer plans could be subject to similar abuses, they cautioned that  MEPs\u2019 structure and operation could make them particularly susceptible  to such abuses.", "Finally, a number of interviewees identified the \u201cbad apple rule\u201d as a  potential problem for MEPs. Specifically, in order to retain its tax-qualified  status and the associated tax advantages for the employer and  employees, IRS requires the firm offering the MEP to annually test each  employer to ensure that the contributions or benefits provided under the  plan do not discriminate against rank-and-file workers in favor of highly  compensated employees. If the tests find that one participating  employer discriminated against its rank-and-file workers, this might cause  the entire MEP to be considered noncompliant. However, many MEP  representatives we had spoken with said that, to date, they had never  needed to expel a participating employer because of noncompliance and  that making voluntary compliance corrections with the IRS was not  difficult."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS and Labor Treat MEPs Differently, Reflecting a Lack of Coordination", "paragraphs": ["Labor and IRS treat MEPs differently because they are charged with  interpreting different titles of ERISA. Labor is primarily responsible for  interpreting and applying Title I of ERISA, which, among other things,  defines an employee benefit plan. In contrast to Labor, IRS is  responsible for determining whether plans qualify for preferential tax  treatment under Title II of ERISA, which amended the IRC. For Labor\u2019s  purposes, under ERISA a plan can be maintained only by an employer,  an employee organization, or both. For the IRS\u2019s purposes, the IRC  does not contain a definition of \u201cemployee benefit plan,\u201d nor does it  include any explicit requirement that a plan be maintained by an employer  or an employee organization.", "Labor and IRS have not fully coordinated their statutory interpretations  related to MEPs with Labor\u2019s advisory opinions. On May 25, 2012, Labor  issued two advisory opinions on open MEP arrangements and found an  open MEP was not a single employee benefit plan under Title I of  ERISA. However, applying tax law, IRS has found at least one open MEP, operating since 2003, qualified for preferential tax treatment. IRS  officials said IRS does not take into consideration a MEP\u2019s status under  Title I of ERISA when considering whether it qualifies for preferential tax  treatment. IRS focuses solely on compliance with IRC provisions. In the  advisory opinions, Labor, and more specifically EBSA, opined that it  considers the participating employers in an open MEP to be sponsoring  their own plans for their own employees. The advisory opinions mean that  an open MEP is simultaneously considered both a single plan by IRS, for  purposes of certain tax laws, and a series of plans by Labor. This  presumably means that an open MEP will have to file annual reports on  behalf of each individual employer to satisfy Labor and also as one single  plan to satisfy IRS. Filing both ways would create duplications in reporting  and redundancies in Form 5500 data.", "The May 25th advisory opinions are the latest in a series of advisory  opinions dating back to at least the late 1970s on benefit plans  maintained by multiple employers. On both MEWAs (arrangements providing welfare benefits such as health coverage) and MEPs, Labor has  held that multiple employers may maintain a single plan through a bona  fide employer group or association of employers. However, Labor has  been careful to define the nature of such an association in advisory  opinions. A bona fide association may establish a plan because Labor  considers the association to be an \u201cemployer\u201d under section 3(5) of  ERISA. Labor clarified in the May 25th opinions that it interprets the  term \u201cemployer\u201d in ERISA as having the same meaning whether applied  to MEWAs or MEPs.", "Labor and Treasury are required to coordinate under ERISA. IRS have discussed these issues, but they have not coordinated to  develop rules, policies, or practices to reduce the duplication of reporting  and the burden of compliance with ERISA. IRS officials said they  recognize the need to work with Labor on these issues, but they have not  yet formulated the changes that may need to be implemented.

An open MEP\u2019s  fiduciaries can conduct new plan audits, assure employer compliance  with ERISA fidelity bond requirements, and file Form 5500s for each  employer, according to an open MEP representative and a pension  expert.

Some representatives of MEPs sponsored by PEOs and associations  reported that the opinions had no impact on their plans.", "The advisory opinions may also affect federal oversight of open MEPs. A  pension expert said open MEPs would be more likely to be selected for  an IRS audit as a result of the increased reporting. The pension expert  also suggested that disaggregating open MEPs into their underlying  ERISA plans may reveal prohibited transactions that were not obvious  before.", "The advisory opinions could also lead to higher costs for open MEPs.  Treating participating employers as plan sponsors will be expensive,  according to some MEP representatives and pension experts. Some open  MEP representatives said firms would pass costs associated with  compliance on to plan participants. One representative estimated  administrative fees covering plan maintenance costs could increase by up  to 50 percent and that increased costs will create a disincentive to plan  formation and contract pension coverage.", "MEP sponsors have already raised questions about the broader  applicability of the advisory opinions. Specifically, they have made  informal inquiries to Labor as to whether their pension benefit  arrangements are in fact open MEPs. Labor officials encouraged those  sponsors to submit a formal request for an advisory opinion. Labor  officials said each advisory opinion is based on the facts presented and,  as established under its procedure for advisory opinions, only the parties  described in the request for the opinion may rely on the opinion. However,  advisory opinions provide a legal interpretation of ERISA and a  discussion of factual situations that may be useful to persons not subject  to it. Labor officials said that they issued opinions on two different plan  structures to show that the agency\u2019s reasoning would hold under various  circumstances.", "Compliance assistance from Labor or IRS would help open MEP  sponsors navigate the compliance requirements, according to two  pension experts. One pension expert said that prompt guidance would be  vital since certain plan sponsors submit requests for IRS determinations  of their plans\u2019 tax-qualified status on a 5-year cycle, and MEPs are in  such a cycle now. However, IRS officials reported that as of June 21,  2012, they were still in the process of analyzing Labor\u2019s advisory  opinions, and did not yet know if they would need to change their  determination procedures accordingly. IRS officials told us it was  premature to consider changes to their determination procedures until  they analyze the full impact of the opinions and more fully discuss them  with Labor. IRS officials noted any such change would necessitate an  outreach program to employers and practitioners. Labor officials said they  are responding to inquiries by open MEPs on a case-by-case basis as  part of their normal compliance and enforcement activities.", "Policy questions may still need to be addressed. One pension expert  explained that while Advisory Opinion 2012-04A clarified Labor\u2019s position  on open MEPs, it did not explain Labor\u2019s underlying policy concerns in  detail. The opinion also did not provide Labor\u2019s view on the potential of  open MEPs to lower plan costs or expand coverage. One pension expert  suggested Labor officials may have felt bound to the agency\u2019s prior  position by decades of existing precedent. However, another pension  expert suggested Labor could have deemed open MEPs to be plans  under ERISA but gave greater weight to its objective of ensuring benefit  security. Both open MEP representatives and these pension experts said  open MEP-like designs will continue to receive the attention of  policymakers, given interest in expanding pension coverage.

However, given that no  data are collected on participating employers in MEPs, pension experts  and agency officials cannot determine how employers utilize MEPs, let  alone how beneficial the MEP design may be to employers and plan  participants. While MEPs have long been affiliated with associations or  complicated employer relationships, new sponsor types have emerged  that call into question the current understanding of these relationships,  which are a key aspect of ERISA\u2019s requirements on employee benefit  plans. Furthermore, it appears that actions taken by IRS, while providing  some relief to certain PEOs has fostered the adoption of these new  sponsor types of MEPs, including the most recent: \u201copen\u201d MEPs. Yet, at  this time, no one knows for certain how many open MEPs there are, who  is in them, or how they may affect future pension coverage. To identify  ways to assess, mitigate, and monitor risks of MEPs in the future, Labor  needs comprehensive and more current information about MEPs and  their designs.", "There also appears to be a lack of coordination between IRS and Labor  on the application of different statutory requirements to MEPs. Newer  MEP designs appear to be a result of practitioners interpreting IRS  guidance on their tax-qualified status as a broader endorsement of their  plan designs. However, following the IRC, IRS does not take into account  ERISA Title I standards for employee benefit plans when determining tax- qualified status. The IRS may continue to find that an open MEP qualifies  for preferential tax treatment and promoters may use such qualification as  a tool for marketing their arrangements to employers\u2014even though Labor  does not consider an open MEP to be a single employer benefit plan  under ERISA. Inadequate coordination, rather than setting the  groundwork for sound, sensible, and cost-efficient oversight, is likely to  lead to future compliance uncertainty and may ultimately risk participants\u2019  retirement security.", "Labor\u2019s recently issued advisory opinions, consistent with previous  opinions on employee benefit plans, establish that a common  employment nexus or other genuine organizational relationship unrelated  to the provision of benefits is required to maintain a pension plan among  multiple employers.

We added language in our report to reflect this  coordination.

Further, our report contains evidence that the conditions the agencies  believe would warrant modifying or formalizing agreements are already  evident, namely concerns about compliance and the possible impacts of  the opinions. Additionally, our report notes that the advisory opinions do  not preclude the IRS from determining that open MEPs qualify for  preferential tax treatment in the future. Currently, each of the three  primary agencies regulating MEPs uses different criteria to define these  plans for plan sponsors and administrators.
