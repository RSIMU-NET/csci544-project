VA's fee basis care utilization also increased from about 821,000 veterans in fiscal year 2008 to about 976,000 veterans in fiscal year 2012.", "GAO found that several factors affect VA medical centers' (VAMC) utilization of fee basis care--including veteran travel distances to VAMCs and goals for the maximum amount of time veterans should wait for VAMC-based appointments. VAMCs that GAO reviewed reported that they often use fee basis care to provide veterans with treatment closer to their homes--particularly for veterans who are not eligible for travel reimbursement. In addition, VAMC officials reported that veterans are often referred to fee basis providers to ensure that VAMC-based clinics that would otherwise treat them can meet established VA wait time goals for how long veterans wait for an appointment. However, GAO found that VA has not established goals for and does not track how long veterans wait to be seen by fee basis providers.", "VA's monitoring of fee basis care spending is limited because fee basis data do not currently include a claim number or other identifier that allows all charges from a single office visit with a fee basis provider or an inpatient hospital stay to be analyzed together.

Our final analysis of fee basis data  included all records of fee basis care except those for pharmacy-only fee  basis payments. We excluded pharmacy-only fee basis care because:   it (1) represents a very small portion of fee basis care spending   ($0.002 billion for fiscal years 2008 through 2012), (2) represents a very  small portion of fee basis care utilization (11,750 unique veterans for  fiscal years 2008 through 2012), (3) applies only to reimbursements of  veterans for medications that they paid for as part of emergency care that  was reimbursed by VA, and (4) could not be separated out into service- connected and non-service-connected emergency care categories.

VA officials from  the six VAMCs we examined reported that the types of clinical services  offered at their facilities affected veterans\u2019 utilization of fee basis care. For  example, officials from the Alexandria VAMC explained that their facility  does not meet VA\u2019s requirements for providing orthopedic surgery  services to veterans and does not provide these services. As a result,  they refer veterans who need these services to fee basis providers.  Similarly, officials from the Biloxi VAMC explained that they do not have  the ability to offer radiation therapy for cancer treatment at their medical  center. As a result, they refer veterans who need radiation therapy to fee  basis providers and reported that their VAMC has little control over  increases in fee basis spending for these services.", "In some cases, a VAMC may not be able to provide some services to  veterans because they do not have the right mix of clinical specialists to  accommodate complications that may arise during surgery. For example,  for a VAMC to offer joint replacement surgery, the facility must be  equipped with an orthopedic specialist capable of performing the surgery  and a number of additional providers to assist in the event of an  emergency complication during surgery. For joint replacement surgeries,  these additional providers include a thoracic surgeon and a neurologist  who both must be available within 15 minutes by phone or 60 minutes in  person, if needed. If these criteria for additional providers are not met, the  VAMC is not authorized to perform joint replacement surgeries even if the  VAMC has an orthopedic specialist capable of performing the surgery.  When VAMCs are unable to provide services due to these requirements,  they may rely on fee basis care to obtain these services for veterans.", "In other cases, VAMCs are unable to recruit specialists and as a result  cannot offer some clinical services to veterans. When such recruiting  challenges arise, VAMCs may rely on fee basis care to ensure veterans  can receive medical services. For example, officials from the Las Vegas  VAMC explained that they have difficulty recruiting several types of  specialists\u2014including vascular surgeons, pulmonologists, and  gastroenterologists. These officials explained that they are exploring ways  to provide relocation incentives to help recruit specialists; however, they  noted recruiting is difficult because recent medical school graduates often  want the opportunity to conduct medical research in addition to patient  care and the Las Vegas VAMC does not have a research program.", "The distance that veterans have to travel to receive medical care is also a  critical factor influencing whether they are treated in VAMCs or referred to  fee basis providers. Traveling long distances for medical care is often  impractical for veterans, particularly those receiving ongoing outpatient  medical care, such as dialysis or radiation therapy for cancer. The  decision about whether a veteran can physically tolerate the travel to a  VAMC or should be referred to a fee basis provider in the community is a  clinical judgment VA providers make in consultation with VAMC fee basis  care unit staff. Officials from all six of the VAMCs we reviewed reported  that utilization of fee basis care was affected by the distance that veterans  must travel to receive VAMC-based care. For example, the Biloxi VAMC  serves veterans from four states along the Gulf Coast, including many  who live more than 300 miles from the facility. Officials from the Biloxi  VAMC explained that the significant travel distance that some veterans  face when traveling from their homes to the VAMC for care is  burdensome and may not be appropriate for all veterans. As a result,  these officials said that their VAMC frequently refers veterans to fee basis  providers within the veterans\u2019 own communities to reduce this burden.  Similarly, officials from the Alexandria VAMC explained that many times  they also refer veterans to fee basis providers in veterans\u2019 own  communities to lessen the travel burden.", "Another related factor that can increase fee basis utilization involves  whether veterans referred to fee basis providers are eligible for  reimbursement for travel costs through VA\u2019s beneficiary travel program.  VA\u2019s beneficiary travel program reimburses eligible veterans for travel  from their home to either their primary VAMC, another VAMC, or to a fee  basis provider that can provide the care they need. Under VA\u2019s  beneficiary travel program regulations, veterans are eligible for travel  reimbursement only if they meet one of several criteria\u2014including having  a service-connected disability rating of 30 percent or more, or an annual  income below a specified threshold. Therefore, veterans who do not  meet these criteria cannot receive reimbursement for travel costs to  another VAMC for treatment. Under these circumstances, veterans may  see a fee basis provider closer to their residences, according to VA  officials, even though fee basis care may cost VA considerably more than  the cost of treatment in a VAMC. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs has  authority under the beneficiary travel authorizing statute to provide travel  reimbursement to additional categories of veterans. However, VAMCs  only have the authority to reimburse veterans who meet the eligibility  requirements of the beneficiary travel program as outlined in VA  regulations. In order to allow VAMCs to reimburse additional veterans  for travel, VA would need to revise its regulations to include additional  categories of veterans.", "Officials from one VAMC and a few VISNs we reviewed told us they often  send veterans who are not eligible for travel reimbursement to fee basis  providers instead of referring them to other VAMCs that can provide the  care because VA cannot compensate them for their travel to another VA  facility. For example, officials from the Biloxi VAMC explained that the  Houston VAMC is able to provide veterans with high-quality interventional  cardiology services, such as cardiac catheterization and cardiothoracic  surgery, which are not available at the Biloxi VAMC. However, if a veteran  is not eligible for beneficiary travel, the Biloxi VAMC will refer them to a  fee basis provider to lessen the financial burden on the veteran even  though, in some cases, care from a fee basis provider may cost the Biloxi  VAMC $30,000 to $40,000 more than if the veteran were treated at the  Houston VAMC. Biloxi VAMC officials said that they have asked their  VISN to allow them to reimburse additional veterans for travel to the  Houston VAMC for services that facility can provide, but they were  informed that VA\u2019s beneficiary travel regulations do not permit them to  offer travel reimbursements to veterans not eligible for beneficiary travel  benefits.", "As part of the fee basis preauthorization process, VAMC or VISN officials  do not evaluate whether it would be less expensive to send veterans to  another VAMC for treatment rather than sending them to a fee basis  provider. In requesting authorization for a veteran to see a fee basis  provider, VAMC providers do not currently include information on the  likely costs of the fee basis care.", "VA\u2019s policy for determining the desired appointment date is unclear. A veteran\u2019s desired  appointment date is the date on which the patient or provider wants the patient to be seen.  In the case of a veteran new to the system, the desired appointment date should be  determined based on the veteran\u2019s preferred appointment date. See GAO, VA Health  Care: Reliability of Reported Outpatient Medical Appointment Wait Times and Scheduling  Oversight Need Improvement, GAO-13-130 (Washington, D.C.: Dec. 21, 2012). awarded each fiscal year.developing these performance contracts, wait times for care received  from fee basis providers are excluded from these performance measures  and VISN and VAMC directors\u2019 performance contracts do not include  specific goals for wait times for fee basis care.", "According to VA officials responsible for  VA officials from all six VAMCs we reviewed reported that they routinely  refer veterans to fee basis providers to help ensure that veterans receive  timely care and that their facilities meet performance goals for wait times  for VAMC-based care. For example, Biloxi VAMC officials said they refer  veterans to fee basis providers to avoid having longer wait times for  veterans in VAMC-based clinics that would cause the Biloxi VAMC to fall  short of its performance goal for VAMC-based care wait times. Similarly,  officials from the Alexandria VAMC explained that their medical center  sends veterans to fee basis providers solely to meet the wait time goals  for the VAMC. They said that veterans needing treatment in several  specialties\u2014including audiology, cardiology, and ophthalmology\u2014are  referred to fee basis providers to help the Alexandria VAMC meet its  goals for VAMC-based clinic wait times.", "While serving veterans in a timely way is important and sending them to  fee basis providers may provide veterans more timely service, VA does  not track how long it takes veterans to be seen by fee basis providers at   For example, officials from the Alexandria VAMC explained  all VAMCs.that they often refer veterans to fee basis providers when the Alexandria  VAMC\u2019s wait times are too long, but fee basis providers in their  community also face capacity limitations and may not be able to schedule  appointments for veterans any sooner than the VAMC-based provider.  Since VA does not require all VAMCs to track wait times for fee basis  providers, little is known about how often veterans\u2019 wait times for fee  basis care appointments exceed VAMC-based appointment wait time  goals. Because VA has no data on wait times for veterans treated by fee  basis providers, it is not possible to determine if veterans are receiving  comparable access to fee basis providers as veterans receiving care from  VAMC-based providers."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "VAMC Officials Reported Three Areas with the Potential to Reduce Fee Basis Spending and Utilization", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Expanding VAMC Capacity", "paragraphs": ["Efforts to provide either increased capacity or additional VAMC-based  health care services have helped VAMCs reduce their utilization of fee  basis care, according to officials from all six VAMCs we reviewed. For  example, Durham VAMC officials explained that they recently completed  an operating room expansion at their facility, which has allowed them to  bring more surgical services back into the VAMC and reduce their  reliance on fee basis surgical services. These officials also said that the  Durham VAMC is preparing to expand its inpatient psychiatric unit by  adding six additional inpatient beds, which will reduce their reliance on  fee basis providers for treating veterans when VAMC-based psychiatric  beds are at capacity. Durham VAMC officials reported that the operating  room expansion saves an estimated $18 million annually and the  additional six VAMC-based psychiatric unit beds saves the facility an  estimated $3.4 million annually. In another case, Biloxi VAMC officials  reported that in 2010 they reduced their reliance on fee basis providers  for pulmonary function tests by purchasing additional equipment and  hiring an additional technician to increase the VAMC-based capacity to  provide these tests. As a result, officials have seen a drop in the number  of veterans referred to fee basis providers for this service and fee basis  costs for pulmonary function tests decreased by about $112,000 between  fiscal years 2010 and 2012.", "Such expansions require a careful analysis of the benefits and costs of  the expansion. Before a VAMC expands its capacity, VA requires VAMCs  to develop a business case for the expansion as part of VA\u2019s annual  consideration of capital investments. These business cases must  address several elements\u2014including a financial analysis and safety  issues. For example, Durham VAMC officials explained that to make  these decisions about expanding its operating room and inpatient  psychiatric bed capacity they reviewed weekly fee basis reports that  included cost and volume information on the most common services that  their VAMC provided through fee basis care and used these reports to  make decisions about which Durham VAMC-based services should be  expanded.", "However, some VAMC officials noted that it may not always be more cost  effective for VAMCs to provide these services. For example, officials from  the Salisbury VAMC explained that they planned to build a VAMC-based  dialysis unit to reduce the number of veterans they referred to fee basis  providers for dialysis treatments. However, when they compared the cost  of building a dialysis unit to the cost of providing veterans dialysis  treatments through fee basis providers, they determined that fee basis  care was as cost-effective as building a dialysis unit.", "DOD medical facilities colocated with nearby VAMCs offer an alternative  to veterans receiving care from more costly community-based fee basis  providers. Currently, VA and DOD have a policy that allows the  departments to charge one another at least 10 percent less for clinical  services than they would in locations without sharing agreements. As of  June 2012, there are nearly 200 active sharing agreements in place  between VA and DOD that range in complexity and scope from sharing a  single service to agreements that govern the sharing of multiple  services.", "Two of the six VAMCs we reviewed\u2014located in Las Vegas and Biloxi\u2014 share resources with neighboring DOD health care facilities to provide  lower-cost care to veterans. The Las Vegas VAMC has a sharing  agreement with Nellis Air Force Base for some health care services,  including cardiac and radiation oncology services. Similarly, the Biloxi  VAMC has several sharing agreements with Air Force and Navy medical  facilities along the Gulf Coast for some health care services. Officials from  both these VAMCs reported that they refer veterans to these DOD  facilities before sending them to fee basis providers in the community  because the reimbursement rate for services provided in DOD medical  facilities is lower than the Medicare rates used to reimburse fee basis  providers. Officials from both the Las Vegas and Biloxi VAMCs explained  that they first explore whether care is available through sharing  agreements with nearby DOD medical facilities before referring the  veterans to fee basis providers.", "Another critical factor affecting fee basis care spending and utilization is  the timely transfer of veterans receiving inpatient care from fee basis  providers back to VAMC-based care. This is particularly relevant  because, as we discussed earlier, VA has spent almost $1.3 billion over  the last 5 years on emergency inpatient services for veterans through the  Millennium Act and about $4.6 billion on preauthorized inpatient fee basis  care. (See app. II.) As a result, it is important that VAMC staff closely  monitor the conditions of veterans receiving inpatient care from fee basis  providers to ensure that they are transferred to VAMCs once their  conditions stabilize. Officials from all six VAMCs we examined reported  that transferring veterans being treated by fee basis providers back to  VAMC-based care when appropriate can be a way of reducing the cost of  inpatient fee basis care. According to officials at two VAMCs, this is  because VAMC inpatient bed capacity limitations that required a veteran  to be referred to an inpatient fee basis provider can change during the  course of a veteran\u2019s hospital stay in non-VA facilities.", "While officials from all six VAMCs we reviewed noted that transferring  veterans back to inpatient VAMC-based care can help reduce fee basis  utilization and spending, we found some VAMCs have more robust  monitoring methods than other VAMCs for tracking veterans being treated  by fee basis providers through their utilization management programs.  Specifically, we found the following:", "Three of the VAMCs we reviewed had a more formal approach that  was integrated with their utilization management programs to actively  identify circumstances when veterans being treated as inpatients by  fee basis providers could return to the VAMC to complete their  inpatient care. For example, the Salisbury VAMC has a transfer  coordinator program specifically designated to actively identify such  circumstances. The Salisbury VAMC employs a nurse case manager  who visits veterans during their inpatient stays with fee basis  providers and identifies changes in veterans\u2019 conditions that will allow  them to return to the VAMC, and coordinates veterans\u2019 transitions  back into VAMC-based care. According to Salisbury VAMC officials,  this program has allowed them to transfer veterans back to the VAMC  to complete their care once the veterans\u2019 conditions have stabilized.", "In contrast, the other three VAMCs we reviewed had a more passive  approach that was limited to tracking veterans\u2019 progress through  information given to them by the veterans\u2019 inpatient fee basis  providers. For example, the Alexandria VAMC\u2019s transfer coordinator  monitors veterans\u2019 inpatient fee basis care; however, this information  is rarely used to transfer veterans back to the VAMC to complete their  treatment.", "Although ensuring that VAMCs are incorporating fee basis care into their  utilization management programs would enable VA to more efficiently  identify when opportunities exist for some veterans to be transferred back  to lower-cost VAMC-based care, VA does not currently require all VAMCs  to conduct such review. Specifically, VA\u2019s current utilization  management policy does not require VAMCs to incorporate reviews of  inpatient fee basis care into their VAMC-based utilization management  programs.how to most effectively track veterans receiving inpatient care from fee  basis providers, which has allowed VAMC programs to take a variety of  forms.

Analysis of fee  basis data is an important aspect of monitoring that allows VHA CBO staff  to look for outliers in spending and utilization, mistakes in fee basis claims  data, potential lost opportunities to reduce spending and utilization, and to  assess more long-term considerations\u2014such as adjusting the level of fee  basis care services or assessing potential areas for VAMC-based service  expansion. However, the usefulness of this monitoring method as an  oversight tool is significantly limited due to the way fee basis data are  collected and reported to the VHA CBO.", "Currently, VA\u2019s data system collects claims data for each individual  service provided by a fee basis provider\u2014such as the physician\u2019s time,  surgical procedures, hospital rooms, and laboratory tests\u2014rather than the  total cost of a veteran\u2019s office visit or inpatient stay. VA\u2019s current data  system cannot group these individual services by episode of care\u2014a  combined total of all care provided to a veteran during a single office visit  or inpatient stay. For example, during an office visit to an orthopedic  surgeon for a joint replacement evaluation, an X-ray for the affected joint  may be ordered, the veteran may be given a blood test, and the veteran  may receive a physical evaluation from the orthopedic surgeon. The fee  basis provider would submit a bill to VA for the office visit and separate  bills would be submitted by the radiologist that X-rayed the affected joint  and the lab that performed the veteran\u2019s blood test. Each of these bills  would include charges under different medical billing codes. The VISN  or VAMC-based fee basis clerk processing this claim would record these  charges in VA\u2019s basis claims processing software and request payment  for these fee basis providers. However, the fee basis data system used  by VHA CBO to review these payments would not be able to link the  charges for these three treatments together as a single episode of care  for this veteran\u2019s office visit with an orthopedic surgeon.", "Not being able to group charges from fee basis providers by episode of  care has the following disadvantages in terms of monitoring fee basis  care and potentially reducing costs:", "Monitoring challenges. From a monitoring perspective, not having  data by episode of care prevents VA from efficiently identifying areas  of utilization growth or unusually high spending. For example, VA- wide episode of care monitoring would allow VHA CBO to assess  whether opportunities for strategic expansion of VAMC-based  services\u2014such as the Durham VAMC operating room expansion and  the Biloxi VAMC addition of pulmonary function test equipment  mentioned earlier\u2014would be possible in more VAMCs. Episode of  care monitoring would more effectively allow VA to make more  consistent strategic decisions about such service expansions.", "Cost analysis limitations. From a cost perspective, not having fee  basis data on an episode of care basis prevents VA from efficiently  assessing whether fee basis providers were reimbursed appropriately.  Without the ability to monitor fee basis spending by episodes of care,  VHA CBO cannot conduct retrospective reviews of VISN and VAMC  claims to determine if the appropriate rate was applied for the care  provided by fee basis providers. For example, VHA CBO staff cannot  verify that fee basis care that should be paid using Medicare  \u201cbundled\u201d reimbursement rates were in fact paid using these bundled  rates because all individual charges from a veteran\u2019s episode of care  cannot be reliably linked. Since VA uses Medicare rates to reimburse  fee basis providers for most services, VAMCs and VISNs, like  Medicare, use bundled reimbursement rates for some procedures that  provide a single payment for closely related services in some cases.  Bundled rates are designed to give providers an incentive to furnish  care more efficiently as providers retain the difference if the bundled  payment exceeds the cost of care.incentive for delivering care more efficiently by making providers  accountable if a patient\u2019s treatment costs exceeded the bundled rate.", "Bundled rates provide a financial  To effectively conduct these retrospective reviews, VHA CBO would need  to change its claims processing methods and ensure that the VISN or  VAMC fee basis clerks processing each provider\u2019s claims assign a claim  number to each payment made to a fee basis provider for an episode of  care. This claim number would serve as a linkage among the individual  service line items in VA\u2019s fee basis data system and allow VHA CBO to  group together all payments made for a single episode of care and  assess the total cost of that episode of care."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA Is Currently Implementing a Short- Term Corrective Action Plan for the Fee Basis Care Program, but Longer- Term Strategy Is Still in Development", "paragraphs": ["In September 2012, VA outlined both short- and long-term plans for  improving the fee basis care program following problems highlighted by  several OIG audits and a recent congressional hearing. The short-term  corrective action plan is made up of a series of tasks to be completed in  fiscal year 2013 across six key areas\u2014(1) foundational activities,   (2) achieving a sustainable decrease in fee basis care improper  payments, (3) recovery and recapture of fee basis care overpayments,   (4) building a culture of accountability within the fee basis care program,  (5) enhancing internal controls and data integrity, and (6) training and  educating VISNs and VAMCs.", "We found that VA has taken a number of steps to better ensure the  completion of its short-term corrective action plan in fiscal year 2013.  Specifically, VA has identified clear leadership for tasks, created teams to  accomplish tasks that include representatives from across VA operations,  sought the input of internal stakeholders\u2014such as VISN and VAMC fee  basis unit staff\u2014and external stakeholders\u2014including the VA OIG, set  clear target dates for the completion of tasks, and identified methods for  assessing whether or not tasks had the desired effect on the fee basis  care program. While it is still too early to determine if the efforts included  in the short-term corrective action plan will produce meaningful  improvements in the fee basis care program, it represents an important  first step in increasing accountability for the outcomes of the fee basis  care program. (See table 1.)", "VA is also in the process of developing a long-term strategy for improving  its fee basis care program. This long-term strategy includes efforts to  develop and implement a new organizational structure for the fee basis  care program, consolidate claims processing functions in fewer locations,  develop comprehensive guidance for the fee basis care program,  implement a new competency-based personnel model, and implement  new claims processing software efforts. To date, progress on the  development of this long-term strategy has been limited to the  development of new claims processing software and initial discussions of  the new organizational structure. In February 2013, VA officials told us  that the long-term strategy is still in development."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["VA\u2019s fee basis care program is a critical means for providing accessible  health care to veterans. VA has acknowledged that fee basis care is a  necessary tool for veterans when a VAMC does not have an available  clinical specialist or when veterans face long travel distances to obtain  care from VAMC-based providers. VA has also made concerted efforts in  recent years to improve the fee basis care program by implementing a  number of initiatives designed to improve the program\u2014including new  software packages for VISN and VAMC fee basis claims processing units,  a new care coordination program, and initiating a program to better  coordinate with fee basis providers.", "Moving forward, we believe it is critical that VA address four areas as  potential ways to more effectively manage and monitor the fee basis care  program. First, veterans\u2019 eligibility for travel reimbursement may affect  whether they are referred to fee basis care or to another VAMC. Some  veterans who qualify for travel reimbursement under VA\u2019s beneficiary  travel program might elect to seek care at another VAMC without  incurring personal travel expenses in lieu of being treated by a fee basis  provider. In some cases, this could result in VA paying less for their care  than it would if the veteran were treated through the fee basis care  program. Should the Secretary of Veterans Affairs exercise his ability to  revise the beneficiary travel eligibility requirements to allow for the use of  beneficiary travel in cases where it is both more cost-effective for VA and  in the veteran\u2019s best interest to receive care at another VAMC instead of  a fee basis provider, it could be possible to lower overall fee basis care  utilization and spending. In addition, VA does not currently require  VAMCs to assess either the cost-effectiveness of reimbursing veterans  for travel to another VAMC when determining whether to preauthorize fee  basis care in veterans\u2019 local communities.", "Second, VA should better manage fee basis care wait times and costs.  VA currently does not include fee basis care wait times in the measures it  uses to assess VISN and VAMC directors\u2019 performance and does not  track the amount of time veterans wait to see a fee basis provider. As a  result, the VAMCs we reviewed are referring veterans to fee basis  providers to ensure they meet the wait time performance goals for VAMC- based clinics. Having data on wait times for veterans referred to fee basis  providers would help VA better determine if veterans are receiving  comparable access to fee basis providers and VAMC-based providers.", "Third, VA may be missing an opportunity to reduce the cost of inpatient  fee basis care by not requiring VAMC-based utilization management  programs designed to regularly assess VAMC capacity to consider  veterans being treated by non-VA inpatient fee basis providers.  Incorporating veterans treated by non-VA inpatient fee basis providers  into ongoing VAMC utilization management programs would allow  VAMCs to identify situations when they no longer have capacity  limitations and can complete a veteran\u2019s treatment in-house at a lower  cost than the fee basis provider.", "Finally, VA can also improve its capability to more effectively monitor the  fee basis care program. VA Central Office\u2019s monitoring efforts are limited  by the inability to analyze fee basis care data by episode of care.  Because information that would allow VA to pull together all services with  a single office visit or inpatient stay is not available, VA Central Office  cannot effectively monitor the payments made by fee basis care units or  ensure that fee basis providers are billing VA appropriately for care."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To effectively manage fee basis care spending, we recommend that the  Secretary of Veterans Affairs take the following action:", "Revise the beneficiary travel eligibility regulations to allow for the  reimbursement of travel expenses for veterans to another VAMC to  receive needed medical care when it is more cost-effective and  appropriate for the veteran than seeking similar care from a fee basis  provider.", "To effectively manage fee basis care wait times and spending, we  recommend that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs direct the Under  Secretary for Health to take the following three actions:", "Require during the fee basis authorization process that VA providers  and fee basis officials determine the cost-effectiveness of reimbursing  medically stable veterans eligible for beneficiary travel for travel to  another VAMC rather than referring them to a fee basis provider for  similar care.", "Analyze the amount of time veterans wait to see fee basis providers  and apply the same wait time goals to fee basis care that are used as  VAMC-based wait time performance measures.", "Establish guidance for VAMCs that specifies how fee basis care  should be incorporated with other VAMC utilization management  efforts.", "To ensure that VA Central Office effectively monitors fee basis care, we  recommend that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs direct the Under  Secretary for Health to take the following action:", "Ensure that fee basis data include a claim number that will allow for  VA Central Office to analyze the episode of care costs for fee basis  care."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["VA provided written comments on a draft of this report, which we have  reprinted in appendix III.
