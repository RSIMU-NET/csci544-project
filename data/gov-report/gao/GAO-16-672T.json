Further, in February 2015, GAO added improving the management of IT acquisitions and operations to its high-risk list\u2014a list of agencies and program areas that are high risk due to their vulnerabilities to fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement, or are most in need of transformation. Between fiscal years 2010 and 2015, GAO made about 800 recommendations related to this high-risk area to OMB and agencies.

In an effort to reduce the growing number of data centers, OMB launched a consolidation initiative in 2010. GAO recently reported that agencies had closed 3,125 of the 10,584 total data centers and achieved $2.8 billion in cost savings and avoidances through fiscal year 2015. Agencies are planning a total of about $8.2 billion in savings and avoidances through fiscal year 2019. However, these planned savings may be higher because 10 agencies had not fully developed their planned savings goals. In addition, agencies made limited progress against OMB's fiscal year 2015 data center optimization performance targets, such as the utilization of data center facilities. GAO recommended that the agencies take action to complete their cost savings targets and improve optimization progress. Most agencies agreed with the recommendations or had no comment.", "Enhancing transparency. OMB's IT Dashboard provides detailed information on major investments at federal agencies, including ratings from Chief Information Officers (CIO) that should reflect the level of risk facing an investment. In a draft report, GAO's assessments of the risk ratings showed more risk than the associated CIO ratings. In particular, of the 95 investments reviewed, GAO's assessments matched the CIO ratings 22 times, showed more risk 60 times, and showed less risk 13 times. Several issues contributed to these differences, such as ratings not being updated frequently. In its draft report, GAO is recommending that agencies improve the quality and frequency of their CIO ratings.", "Implementing incremental development. An additional key reform initiated by OMB has emphasized the need to deliver investments in smaller parts, or increments, in order to reduce risk and deliver capabilities more quickly. Since 2012, OMB has required investments to deliver functionality every 6 months. In a draft report, GAO determined that 22 agencies reported that 64 percent of 469 active software development projects had plans to deliver usable functionality every 6 months for fiscal year 2016. Further, for seven selected agencies, GAO identified significant differences in the percentage of software projects delivering every 6 months reported to GAO compared to what was reported on the IT Dashboard. For example, the percentage of software projects reported to GAO by the Department of Commerce decreased by about 42 percentage points from what was reported on the IT Dashboard. These differences were due, in part, to agencies having different interpretations of OMB's guidance on reporting software development projects. In its draft report, GAO is recommending that OMB and agencies improve the use of incremental development."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO has previously made numerous recommendations to OMB and federal agencies to improve the oversight and execution of the data center consolidation initiative, the accuracy and reliability of the IT Dashboard, and incremental development policies.

We noted that  implementation of these initiatives has been inconsistent and more work  remains to demonstrate progress in achieving IT acquisition outcomes.", "Further, in our February 2015 high-risk report, we identified actions that  OMB and the agencies need to take to make progress in this area. These  include implementing FITARA, as well as implementing our previous  recommendations, such as developing comprehensive inventories of  federal agencies\u2019 software licenses. As noted in that report, we have  made multiple recommendations to improve agencies\u2019 management of IT  acquisitions and operations, many of which are discussed later in this  statement.

OMB established FDCCI in February 2010 to improve the  efficiency, performance, and environmental footprint of federal data  center activities. In a series of reports over the past 5 years, we  determined that while data center consolidation could potentially save the  federal government billions of dollars, weaknesses existed in several  areas including agencies\u2019 data center consolidation plans and OMB\u2019s  tracking and reporting on cost savings. In total, we have made 111  recommendations to OMB and agencies to improve the execution and  oversight of the initiative.

Further, 21 agencies collectively reported planning  an additional $5.4 billion in cost savings and avoidances, for a total of  approximately $8.2 billion, through fiscal year 2019. See figure 2 for a  summary of agencies\u2019 reported achieved and planned cost savings and  avoidances from fiscal years 2011 through 2019.", "However, we noted that planned savings may be higher because 10 of  the 21 agencies that reported planned closures from fiscal years 2016  through 2018 have not fully developed their cost savings and avoidance  goals for these fiscal years. Agencies provided varied reasons for not  having this information, including that they were in the process of re- evaluating their data center consolidation strategies, as well as facing  other challenges in determining such information. We noted that the  reporting of planned savings goals is increasingly important considering  the enactment of FITARA, which requires agencies to develop yearly  calculations of cost savings as part of their multi-year strategies to  consolidate and optimize their data centers. We concluded that, until  agencies address their challenges and complete and report such  information, the $8.2 billion in total savings and avoidances may be  understated and agencies will not be able to satisfy the data center  consolidation strategy provisions of FITARA.", "Finally, we reported that agencies made limited progress against OMB\u2019s  fiscal year 2015 core data center optimization performance metrics. In  total, 22 of the 24 agencies reported data center optimization information  to OMB. However, of the nine metrics with targets, only one\u2014full-time  equivalent ratio (a measure of data center labor efficiency)\u2014was met by  half of the 24 agencies, while the remaining eight were each met by less  than half of the agencies.

We  concluded that, until agencies take action to improve progress against  OMB\u2019s data center optimization metrics, including addressing any  challenges identified, they could be hindered in the implementation of the  data center consolidation provisions of FITARA and in making initiative- wide progress against OMB\u2019s optimization targets.", "To better ensure that federal data center consolidation and optimization  efforts improve governmental efficiency and achieve cost savings, we  recommended that 10 agencies take action to complete their planned  data center cost savings and avoidance targets for fiscal years 2016  through 2018.

This underscores the importance of frequent  rating updates, which help to ensure that the information on the  Dashboard is timely and accurately reflects recent changes to  investment status.", "Three agencies\u2019 rating processes span longer than 1 month.

CIO ratings that do no incorporate active risks increase the  chance that ratings overstate the likelihood of investment success.", "As a result, we concluded that the associated risk rating processes used  by the agencies were generally understating the level of an investment\u2019s  risk, raising the likelihood that critical federal investments in IT are not  receiving the appropriate levels of oversight.

Regarding the remaining 169 projects (or 36  percent) that were reported as not planning to deliver functionality every 6  months, agencies provided a variety of explanations for not achieving that  goal, including project complexity, the lack of an established project  release schedule, or that the project was not a software development  project.

For example, the percentage of software  projects delivering every 6 months that was reported to us by the  Department of Commerce decreased by about 42 percentage points from  what was reported on the IT Dashboard. In contrast, the Department of  Defense reported a 55 percentage point increase from what was reported  on the IT Dashboard. Figure 5 compares what the seven agencies  reported on the IT Dashboard and the numbers they reported to us.", "We determined that the significant differences in delivery rates were due,  in part, to agencies having different interpretations of OMB\u2019s guidance on  reporting software development projects and because the information  reported to us was generally more current than the information reported  on the IT Dashboard.
