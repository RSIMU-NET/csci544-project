Across the country, local community groups are protesting the choice of incineration as the treatment remedy. Many people believe that incinerators have the potential to emit hazardous substances that could lead to adverse health effects in their communities. Consequently, these community groups want EPA to use technologies other than incineration to clean up sites. However, EPA believes that the effectiveness and safety of many alternative technologies remain unproven.", "Because of the public\u2019s concerns about the use of incineration at PCB- and dioxin-contaminated sites, you asked us to identify (1) what EPA has done to encourage the development and use of alternative or \u201cinnovative\u201d technologies at all contaminated sites, including those with PCBs and dioxin; (2) whether EPA has identified innovative technologies that can be used at PCB- and dioxin-contaminated sites; and (3) what factors have limited the use of innovative technologies at PCB- and dioxin-contaminated sites. In addition, to provide an illustration of how EPA decides what cleanup technology will be used, you asked us to conduct three case studies at PCB- and dioxin-contaminated sites where EPA has proposed incineration as the remedy.

The program was extended in 1986 and in 1990 and is now being considered again for reauthorization. Under CERCLA, EPA investigates contaminated areas and then places the nation\u2019s most highly contaminated sites on a priority list, called the National Priorities List (NPL), for investigation and cleanup. As of September 1995, EPA had 1,238 sites on the NPL. Of these sites, approximately 190 had PCB contamination and about 80 had dioxin contamination.", "After EPA puts a site on the NPL, the agency goes through an extensive process to determine what remedy or remedies for cleanup would be appropriate for that site. The remedy selected depends upon the characteristics of the individual site, such as the types and levels of contamination, the complexity of the site\u2019s problem, the site\u2019s risk assessment, and the cleanup standards.", "EPA weighs each potential remedy against a number of criteria set forth in federal regulations. These criteria include the long-term protection of human health and the environment; compliance with the applicable or relevant and appropriate federal and state laws; and the community\u2019s acceptance of the remedy being considered. Using these criteria, EPA has generally selected incineration as the remedy for many large, complex Superfund sites contaminated with PCBs or dioxin\u2014two compounds that pose significant threats to human health and the environment. (See app. III for a further discussion of incineration technology.)", "Under CERCLA, incinerators at Superfund sites must comply with applicable technical requirements contained in federal regulations. In particular, the incineration of dioxins is governed by regulations issued under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA), as amended. Similarly, the incineration of PCBs is governed by regulations issued under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EPA\u2019s Efforts to Encourage the Development and Use of Innovative Technologies", "paragraphs": ["EPA has established two offices to encourage the development and use of innovative technologies. One is the Superfund Innovative Technology Evaluation (SITE) program, which evaluates cleanup or waste removal technologies. The second is the Technology Innovation Office (TIO), which acts as a clearinghouse for information on innovative cleanup technologies. In addition, EPA has issued guidance that encourages the consideration of innovative technologies for cleaning up Superfund sites.", "These efforts do not focus on specific contaminants such as PCBs and dioxin but are designed to promote the development and use of innovative technologies for all types of contaminants. Overall, in 1994, EPA selected innovative technologies in about 20 percent of its decisions on remedies for all Superfund sites.

For example, in fiscal year 1995, SITE spent about $12 million to demonstrate 11 technologies. None of these treated a PCB- or dioxin-contaminated site.", "Superfund officials involved in cleaning up sites stated that SITE\u2019s reports on demonstrations often focus on the science of the innovative technologies and provide only limited information on potential implementation problems. For example, the Superfund site manager at one site we visited told us that SITE had initially been extremely positive about the scientific potential for one of its demonstrated technologies at that site. However, after learning about the site\u2019s specific characteristics, SITE officials decided the technology was inappropriate for that site.", "These criticisms remain, although Superfund program officials stated that they had begun to work with SITE in 1993 to make its information more useful, and as a result, additional information has been added to SITE\u2019s technology demonstration reports.

In addition, TIO attempts to identify why innovative technologies are not being used more frequently. In fiscal year 1995, TIO spent about $2 million to carry out these responsibilities.", "To serve as an information clearinghouse, TIO maintains several databases containing information on innovative technologies and innovative technology vendors. However, Superfund officials told us that the cost and performance data contained in TIO\u2019s database of innovative technology vendors is vendor-supplied and TIO does not validate it. TIO officials stated that these data are supposed to be only the starting point for identifying potential innovative technologies and that TIO does not have the resources to validate the data. In addition, TIO officials believe that requiring vendors to supply independently validated data might exclude some innovative technology vendors.", "TIO officials, however, recognize that those responsible for cleaning up hazardous waste sites need reliable cost and performance data and have taken actions to address this problem. For example, working through the Federal Remediation Technologies Roundtable, composed of major federal agencies that carry out remediation research and projects, a guide to documenting remediation projects\u2019 cost and performance was developed. This guide, which all member agencies have agreed to use, provides project managers with standard procedures for collecting and reporting project information.", "TIO also attempts to encourage the use of innovative technologies by identifying why innovative technologies are not being selected more often at Superfund sites. For example, TIO published a study in April 1995 which showed that Superfund cleanup officials were often eliminating innovative technologies from the remedy selection process without fully considering them. That study, based on 205 sites, found that EPA conducted tests to assess the potential performance of innovative technologies at only 47 sites (less than 25 percent) of the 205 sites. When these tests were conducted, however, innovative technologies were used in about 45 percent of the remedies selected.

In addition, innovative technologies\u2019 performance generally depends on the physical and chemical characteristics of the contaminated material, such as moisture levels, clay and silt content, and the presence of other chemical substances. As a result, EPA has generally used innovative technologies only at PCB- and dioxin-contaminated sites with low levels of contamination and uniform conditions.

In addition, industry officials are uncertain how clean EPA will require PCB- and dioxin-contaminated sites to be in the future.

The site is contaminated with chemicals that are commonly found at wood preserving sites. The contamination occurred when wood preserving chemicals were dumped into storage ponds used for the wood treating operations. Approximately 77,000 cubic yards of soil, sludge, and sediment and 16 million gallons of groundwater are contaminated primarily with dioxin, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, and pentachlorophenol.

Although EPA analyzed other options, it believed that incineration was the only technology that would reduce the contaminants to a level below health-based standards. According to EPA regional officials, to reach the cleanup standards using other technologies would require combining two or more technologies. They added that using multiple innovative technologies would raise the uncertainty level associated with new technologies even further. These standards are based on ensuring the safety of future industrial workers on the site. In addition, EPA officials judged that incineration was the best remedy for high levels of dioxin and for wood treating chemicals in general.", "EPA considered the following alternative remedies for the Texarkana site: biological and chemical treatment, solidification, placing a protective cover over the site to reduce the spread of contaminants (capping), and off-site incineration.

EPA officials believed that chemical or biological remedies would not work successfully on all contaminants or achieve the agency\u2019s cleanup goals. They were also concerned about the possibility that biological or chemical degradation could produce a more toxic form of dioxin. EPA eliminated solidification because the technology was not expected to reduce the volume or toxicity of the waste to the same degree as the other treatments and because of the difficulty in solidifying the type of contaminants present at the site. EPA eliminated capping because it would not provide a permanent treatment, and the site\u2019s location on a flood plain increased the risk of continued release of contaminants. According to the EPA project manager, a cap at this site could be guaranteed only for about 6 years. In addition, the local community wanted the land usable for future industry, making solidification and capping inappropriate options because the contamination would still be on site.

(See fig. I.3.) On the basis of its analyses, EPA determined that incineration, considered a proven technology, would achieve the best balance among the criteria used by EPA to evaluate the alternatives. These criteria included both long- and short-term effectiveness, implementability, overall protection of human health and the environment, and compliance with federal and state applicable or relevant and appropriate requirements. On the other hand, the many uncertainties about the performance of innovative technologies at the New Bedford hot spot sediments made these technologies unlikely candidates for the site. For example, EPA was uncertain about the performance and adequacy of innovative technologies given the silt/clay composition and high water content of the New Bedford sediments. Soil composition and water content are factors that could compromise the performance of innovative technologies.", "As EPA proceeded with its plans to incinerate hot spot sediments, opposition from environmental and local community groups to EPA\u2019s plans to incinerate grew. The public\u2019s main concern was the potential health risk from dioxin emissions coming from the incinerator. In response to the community\u2019s growing opposition, in 1994 EPA canceled the incineration part of the Corps of Engineers\u2019 contract to clean the hot spot. The cancellation costs of the incineration contract were approximately $5 million dollars, and there may be additional costs.", "After the cancellation of EPA\u2019s incineration plans, the agency started new efforts to identify alternative cleanup technologies for the site. With public participation, EPA narrowed candidate cleanup options to (1) solidification/stabilization, (2) chemical destruction, and (3) a separation technology such as thermal desorption followed by chemical destruction. EPA plans to conduct detailed studies on at least two chemical destruction technologies and at least two solidification technologies. The agency expects to issue its final decision on the cleanup for the hot spot in approximately 3 years."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Dioxin and Polychlorinated Biphenyls Contamination", "paragraphs": ["Dioxin and PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) are highly toxic contaminants of particular concern because of their potentially adverse effects on human health and their degree of permanence in the environment.

Some PCBs, having a chemical makeup similar to dioxin\u2019s, have the potential for many of the same effects."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Dioxin", "paragraphs": ["Dioxin and dioxin-like substances are not purposely manufactured but are unintentional by-products of combustion and chemical processes. The four main sources of dioxin are (1) the formation during incineration of materials that contain chlorine (such as the incineration of municipal and medical waste); (2) industrial and other processes that employ chlorine (such as chlorinated bleaching of wood pulp for paper manufacturing); (3) chemical manufacturing and related processes, including the manufacture of chlorine and chlorinated substances; and (4) redistribution of existing contamination\u2014because dioxin tends to accumulate in soil and sediment, dioxin contamination may become redistributed through contaminated dust. In addition, dioxin emissions may also result from the incineration of materials already contaminated with dioxin. In this scenario, some of the dioxin-contaminated material remains intact through the incineration process and is emitted from the stack.", "Exposure to dioxin occurs daily, mainly through dietary intake of meat, dairy products, fish, and shellfish. Dioxin is present in all media, particularly in soil and sediment, which transfer the contaminant to plants and animals. Researchers believe that the presence of dioxin in the food chain is primarily the result of dioxin air emissions depositing from the atmosphere on soil, plants, and bodies of water. In addition, some individuals may be exposed to even higher dioxin levels from other sources; these include occupational exposures, exposure to a distinct local source (for example, a chemical manufacturing plant, or a municipal or medical incinerator), exposure of nursing infants from mothers\u2019 milk, or frequent consumption of dioxin-contaminated fish from a particular source.", "Health effects have been associated with exposure to dioxin. Dioxin is considered a probable human carcinogen, according to laboratory studies on animals and observation of humans beings exposed to dioxin. In addition, it has been associated with other adverse effects, including reproductive, developmental, immunological, and endocrine changes. In high doses, dioxin causes chloracne, a serious skin condition. The adverse effects of dioxin are contingent upon dose and length of exposure. Dioxin is present in humans at birth in small concentrations and accumulates, increasing as individuals age. The exact level at which health effects will occur is uncertain.", "EPA began a scientific reassessment of dioxin and dioxin-related compounds in 1991. The reassessment summarizes and evaluates available research to provide a comprehensive survey of the sources of dioxin, the levels of exposure, and the potential health effects. It also identifies gaps in dioxin research. The preliminary conclusions of the reassessment strengthen the evidence that dioxin can cause human health effects even at low levels of environmental exposure. In September 1994, EPA issued two draft reports based on this work which have been released for public comment: Estimating Exposure to Dioxin-Like Compounds and Health Assessment Document for 2,3,7,8 Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-Dioxin (TCDD) and Related Compounds.", "Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) are similar to dioxin as they are in the same class of chemicals. However, unlike dioxin, PCBs were intentionally manufactured (from the 1920s to the 1970s in the United States), mainly for use as an insulating fluid in electrical equipment. The production and use of PCBs was widespread, causing large amounts to be released into the environment. They were used primarily because of their stability and resistance to decomposition, which have caused them to persist in the environment even though they are no longer manufactured.", "Because of the stability of PCBs, many routes of exposure are possible. The primary source of human intake of PCBs is through food\u2014mainly fish, but also meat and dairy products. Other sources of exposure include inhalation and dermal contact. As with dioxin, exposure to PCBs may cause health effects. In its most toxic forms, PCBs are carcinogenic in laboratory animals and are considered a probable human carcinogen. Some forms of PCBs can have the same toxicity as dioxin (known as dioxin-like PCBs). PCBs are also associated with reproductive and immunologic changes in some people who are exposed to the contaminant. According to EPA researchers, the incomplete destruction of PCBs during incineration of the contaminant may pose the most significant of health threats because of the potential dioxin formation and emissions.", "In 1993, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) convened an expert panel to evaluate the public health implications of treating and disposing of PCB-contaminated waste. The panel concluded that although the safety of incinerating PCB-contaminated waste is not certain, information on the safety and effectiveness of alternative technologies is also limited. The panel affirmed that no single type of alternative technology can remediate all PCB-contaminated wastes. In addition, it recommended that further research is needed to study the health effects of PCBs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Incineration Technology", "paragraphs": ["Incineration is the burning of substances by controlled flame in an enclosed area or compartment.

As land disposal became increasingly expensive due to the restrictions, other disposal options, such as incineration, became increasingly attractive. In many cases, the disposal of waste through incineration has become the most economical and, in some cases, the only option for certain hazardous wastes. EPA has encouraged regulated burning as a treatment option and considers incineration to be the best demonstrated available technology for many wastes. By the late 1980s, incineration was also playing an important role in the cleanup of many Superfund sites, where it has been used for treating contaminated soils and other wastes removed from the site."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Incineration Process", "paragraphs": ["Incineration involves four basic steps: (1) wastes are prepared and fed into the incinerator; (2) wastes are burned, converting organic compounds into residual products in the form of ash and gases;(3) ash is collected, cooled, and removed from the incinerator; and, (4) gases are cooled, cleaned, and released to the atmosphere through the incinerator stack.", "During incinerator operations, wastes are fed into the incinerator in batches or in a continuous stream. This flow of wastes is generally referred to as the waste feed. The wastes are then burned in the combustion chamber, which is designed to maintain and withstand extremely high temperatures. As the wastes are heated, they are converted from solids or liquids into gases. The gases are mixed with air and passed through a hot flame. As the temperature of the gases rises, the organic compounds in the gases begin to break down and recombine with oxygen from the air to form stable inorganic compounds, such as carbon dioxide and water. Depending on the waste composition, other inorganic compounds, such as the acid gas hydrogen chloride, may form. This entire process is called combustion.", "In many incinerators, combustion occurs in two combustion chambers. The combustion of more easily burned organics is completed in the first chamber. For compounds that are difficult to burn, combustion is completed in a secondary combustion chamber, or afterburner, after the compounds have been converted to gases and partially combusted in the first chamber.", "Combustion yields two residual products: solids, in the form of ash, and gases. Ash is an inert inorganic material composed primarily of carbon, salts, and metals. During combustion, most ash collects at the bottom of the combustion chamber; some ash, however, is carried along with the gases as small particles, or particulate matter. Ash removed from the bottom of the combustion chamber is considered, by regulation, a hazardous waste. Combustion gases are composed primarily of carbon dioxide and water, plus small quantities of other gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides. Following combustion, the combustion gases move through various devices that cool and cleanse the gases before they are released to the atmosphere through the incinerator stack.", "A well-designed and operated hazardous waste incinerator will destroy all but a small fraction of the organic compounds contained in the waste. Complete combustion, however, is only a theoretical concept since the development of a 100-percent efficient incinerator is not possible. The three critical factors that determine the completeness of combustion in an incinerator are (1) the temperature in the combustion chamber; (2) the length of time wastes are maintained at high temperatures; and (3) the turbulence, or degree of mixing, of the wastes and the air.", "Because combustion is never complete, incinerator emissions gases may also contain small quantities of organic and inorganic compounds from both the original waste and compounds formed during the combustion. These \u201cnew\u201d organic compounds form from the breakdown and recombination of the original compounds and are called products of incomplete combustion or PICs. PICs are formed during the combustion of any organic material, such as when wood is burned in a wood stove or when gasoline is burned in an automobile engine. Among the types of compounds found in analyses of PICs are very small quantities of dioxins and dibenzofurans. Among the inorganic compounds not present in the original waste are carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides, both of which are always formed as a result of combustion.", "Among the most common types of hazardous waste incinerators is the rotary kiln incinerator. Rotary kiln incinerators are versatile and can accept gases, liquids, sludges, slurries, and solids either separately or simultaneously, either in bulk or in containers. Because of this versatility, rotary kilns are commonly used to treat a variety of wastes. The kiln is a cylindrical shell mounted on its side at a slight angle to the horizontal. As the kiln rotates and the wastes travel down the slope, the organic chemicals in the waste convert into gases and partially combust. The gases then pass into the afterburner or secondary combustion chamber where further combustion takes place. Ash residue is removed from the lower end of the kiln. (See fig III.1.) Mobile incineration systems are generally constructed using the rotary kiln incinerator design. These systems are hauled to a site on flat-bed trucks, then assembled and tested. Although smaller than most stationary facilities, they operate on identical principals.", "Figure III.1: Typical Incinerator Processes (Rotary Kiln)", "Quench Chamber (Cools Gases)", "Air Pollution Control Devices (Remove Acid  Gases)", "Fan (Maintains Proper Pressure and Draw Rate)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Hazardous Waste Incinerator Regulations", "paragraphs": ["EPA developed performance standards for the incineration of hazardous wastes on the basis of research on incinerator air emissions and health and environmental risk studies. All incinerators emit gases through a stack as the final step in the incineration process. The quantity of pollutants in these emissions is the major determinant of the risk of incineration. The performance standards thus address and attempt to control the various emissions from the stack. Under EPA\u2019s regulations, an incinerator must be able to burn wastes and cleanse combustion gases so that only very small quantities of pollutants are emitted through the stack. EPA\u2019s principal measure of incinerator performance is destruction and removal efficiency (DRE). Destruction refers to the combustion of waste, while removal refers to the cleansing of the pollutants from the combustion gases before they are released from the stack. For most organic wastes, a DRE of 99.99 percent is required; however, for PCBs and dioxins, a DRE of 99.9999 percent is required, which means that no more than one molecule of the compound is released to the air for every 1 million molecules entering the incinerator.", "Because it is not technically feasible to monitor DRE results for all organic compounds that may be contained in a waste feed, an incinerator must demonstrate that it can achieve the performance standards for selected hazardous compounds, called principal organic hazardous constituents (POHC), which the permitting agency designates in the permit. These POHCs generally are selected from among the wastes the applicant is seeking approval to burn on the basis of their high concentration in the waste feed and their difficulty to burn in comparison with other organic compounds in the waste feed. According to the theory of incineration followed by EPA, if the incinerator achieves the required destruction and removal efficiency for the POHCs, then the incinerator should achieve the same or better destruction and removal efficiencies for organic compounds that are easier to incinerate.", "The incinerator performance standards in EPA\u2019s RCRA regulations include emissions of the designated organic compounds, hydrogen chloride, and particulate matter. Specifically, those performance standards for the incineration of dioxin require (1) a minimum DRE of 99.9999 percent; (2) generally, removal of 99 percent of hydrogen chloride gas from the incinerator\u2019s emissions; and (3) a limit of 180 milligrams of particulate matter per dry standard cubic meter of gas emitted through the stack.", "Before a final permit to operate the incinerator is issued, a trial burn generally is required. The trial burn tests the incinerator\u2019s ability to meet all applicable performance standards when burning a waste under specific operating conditions. The operating conditions include such things as the rate and composition of the waste feed, the temperature that must be maintained in various areas of the incinerator, and the gas flow rate. To obtain a final operating permit, the trial burn results must demonstrate that the incinerator can meet the performance standards contained in its permit.", "The trial burn results are also used to establish the final operating conditions that will be included as part of the facility\u2019s permit. Because the trial burn involves the measurement of the incinerator\u2019s performance under different sets of operating conditions, the trial burn results verify the incinerator\u2019s ability to meet the performance standards under one or more of these conditions and thus can be used to determine what is an acceptable range of operating conditions for the final permit. The final operating permit specifies only those operating conditions under which the incinerator has proven it can meet the performance standards.", "These operating conditions are important because it is not technically feasible to directly and continuously measure certain aspects of performance, such as destruction and removal efficiency, and certain emissions. On the basis of the results of the trial burn, the permit may specify different operating conditions for different types of waste feeds or specify ranges or minimum or maximum levels for different parameters, such as temperature. Under EPA\u2019s regulatory approach, as long as the incinerator operates within these ranges, it is assumed to be operating under the same conditions as during the successful trial burn and thus to be in compliance with the environmental performance standards.

The following are the most recognized alternatives to incineration for PCBs and dioxin.", "Bioremediation: Bioremediation refers to the breakdown of contaminants into less harmful and usually less toxic forms by natural microorganisms. It can be performed at a higher rate in the presence of oxygen, or more slowly under near oxygen-free conditions. Historically, PCBs have been considered resistant to biodegradation. However, the results of lab studies and environmental monitoring studies indicate that PCBs biodegrade in the environment but at a very slow rate. In addition, bioremediation of highly chlorinated substances can result in highly toxic forms of dioxin. To date, EPA has not found a bioremediation process that can accelerate the biodegradation of PCBs to rates necessary to make such a process commercially viable for use in site cleanups. Similarly, limited information from field work on the biodegradation of dioxin has shown that the process can be significantly lengthy.", "Chemical Dechlorination: This process destroys or detoxifies certain contaminants, such as PCBs and dioxin, by gradually removing chlorine atoms. The conditions that most commonly determine the efficacy and cost of dechlorination methods include the size of soil particles, the soil\u2019s moisture content, the organic carbon contents of the soil, and the cleanup level required. In addition, under certain circumstances, dechlorination can generate highly toxic dioxin. A well-known dechlorination technology is base catalyzed decomposition (BCD). EPA developed BCD to detoxify chlorinated organics such as PCBs and dioxin. It uses two different technologies\u2014thermal desorption (described later in this appendix) followed by a chemical process to separate and detoxify organic contaminants. It is an efficient, relatively inexpensive treatment process for PCBs and potentially capable of treating PCBs at virtually any concentration. However, the process can be expensive for high PCB concentrations because it requires a larger dose of the chemicals necessary to neutralize the chlorine. Field data on the performance and cost of BCD for PCBs and dioxin are very limited. In addition, EPA officials responsible for administering the Toxic Substances Control Act regulations have not yet had an opportunity to assess whether BCD is acceptable as a remedy for PCBs.", "Soil Washing: Soil washing mixes, washes, and rinses the soil to separate contaminants, such as PCBs, adhering to soil particles. Because it is not a destruction technique, this technology does not present a final solution for the disposition of toxic and hazardous materials. The technology is designed for volume reduction of contaminated material. Its effectiveness depends on factors such as the size of soil particles and humic and silt or clay content of the soil. Multiple washings may be necessary to achieve acceptable contamination levels. In addition, there is need for further management of the concentrated contaminant. While limited work has been done on the effectiveness of soil washing for PCBs, no work has been done for dioxin.", "Solidification/Stabilization: Solidification and stabilization technologies focus primarily on limiting the solubility or mobility of contaminants, generally by physical means rather than by chemical reaction. Waste solidification technologies encapsulate the contaminants in a solid material\u2014such as portland cement or asphalt. Waste stabilization technologies convert the contaminants into a less soluble, mobile, or toxic form by adding a binder to the waste, such as cement kiln dust or fly ash. Historically, solidification and stabilization technologies have been used to treat metals and other inorganic compounds. With currently available technology, it is generally easier to successfully solidify or stabilize inorganic compounds than organic compounds, such as PCBs and dioxin. More recently, some work has been done on the applicability of solidification and stabilization to organics, such as PCBs. Although no solidification or stabilization treatment currently offered is considered by EPA to be an acceptable alternative incineration for PCBs and dioxin, EPA believes the technology has potential.", "Solvent Extraction: Using a solvent, such as propane, solvent extraction separates hazardous contaminants from soil and sediment. This process reduces the volume of the hazardous waste that requires treatment. The application of this technology represents only a transfer of the contaminant from one medium (soil) to another (solvent) but does not provide for the contaminant\u2019s ultimate destruction. The ultimate removal of PCBs depends on the number of stages employed and the feed concentration. Many variables, such as soil type and moisture content, influence the system\u2019s performance. For example, water and fine-grained materials inhibit some solvent extraction processes. In addition, after extraction is complete, some solvent remains in the treated sediment. This residual solvent may pose a separate problem if the solvent is toxic or highly explosive.", "Thermal Desorption: Thermal desorption treats contaminated soils by heating the soil at relatively low temperatures between 300 and 1,000 degrees fahrenheit. The heat separates the contaminants from the soil. The contaminants then require further treatment. The effectiveness and cost of this technology vary and depend on site characteristics such as the moisture content of the soil and the concentration and distribution of the contaminants. In addition, thermal desorption can generate residual that should be monitored and may require further treatment.", "Vitrification: All existing vitrification technologies use heat to melt the contaminated soil or sediment, which forms a rigid, glassy product when it cools. The volume of the end product is typically 20 to 45 percent less than the volume of the untreated soil or sediment. Organic compounds, including PCBs, are destroyed by the high temperature during vitrification.
