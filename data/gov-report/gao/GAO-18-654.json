We  assessed coordination of agency and USIP efforts for conflict prevention,  mitigation, and stabilization as a whole because, as indicated above, the  agencies did not always distinguish their coordination efforts to address  conflict using the same terms or categorization of efforts.

To make this determination, we examined agency and  USIP documents and conducted interviews about interagency  collaboration activities with officials from State, USAID, DOD, and USIP.  We reviewed agency reports; jointly developed and independently  developed strategies; interagency agreements; monitoring reports; and  public statements by senior U.S. government officials, among other  documents.

In Northeastern Syria, USIP works with Syrian partners to  strengthen civil society\u2019s engagement and coordinating role with civic, religious, and  tribal leaders in al-Qamishli/al-Qahtaniya. The effort aims to address drivers of  tensions and conflicts through an evidenced-based, outcome-oriented dialogue  process. The overall goal is to strengthen social cohesion among and between the  communities in Northern Syria, enable the return of displaced communities, and stem  potential conflict.", "USIP\u2019s MEA is responsible for three ongoing grants related to the Syria conflict in  neighboring countries: The first is a grant to War Child to work with a local network of  Jordanian organizations training young Syrian refugees in Amman and vicinity on  youth leadership, peacebuilding, and conflict resolution skills. The two other grants  fund (1) a Lebanese civic group that supported mediation and training aimed at  reducing refugee-related tensions in Lebanon\u2019s Bekaa Valley and to enable Syrian  refugees to find jobs and register their children in schools, and (2) a nongovernmental  organization that trained Syrian and Lebanese journalists on conflict-sensitive  reporting about the Syrian refugee crisis and on raising awareness of the benefits the  refugees bring to the host community. These grants are aimed at reducing tensions  that threaten peace and stability in Lebanon and Jordan because of the burdens of  their absorption of Syrian refugees.", "USIP\u2019s ACT was responsible for the Youth Leaders\u2019 Exchange with His Holiness the  Dalai Lama. In November 2017, USIP and the Dalai Lama hosted a second annual  dialogue with youth peacebuilders drawn from countries across Africa, Asia, and the  Middle East, including Syria. Many of these countries face the world\u2019s deadliest  conflicts, as well as campaigns by extremist groups to incite youth to violence. The  youth leaders are among their countries\u2019 most effective peacebuilders. The dialogue  with the Dalai Lama was intended to help them to build the practical skills and  personal resilience they need to work against the tensions or violence in their  homelands. The overarching goal was to strengthen the capacity of youth to create  positive change as leaders and peacebuilders in their communities by partnering with  more traditional leaders.", "We did not independently verify whether USIP\u2019s reported list of conflict mitigation and stabilization  efforts included all such efforts in Iraq, Nigeria, and Syria (and in neighboring countries for Syria).", "For the purposes of this list of efforts and goals, \u201cefforts\u201d includes what our sources also referred to as  \u201cprojects.\u201d", "Countries for which USIP conducts efforts are shaded in gray."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: Comments from the Department of State", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VII: Comments from the U.S. Agency for International Development", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VIII: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IX: Comments from the U.S. Institute of Peace", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix X: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Godwin Agbara (Assistant  Director), Kathleen Monahan (Analyst-in-Charge), David Dayton, Martin  de Alteriis, Mark Dowling, Emily Gupta, and Jasmine Senior made key  contributions to this report.
