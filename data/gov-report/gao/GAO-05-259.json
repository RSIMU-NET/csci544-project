Among employers who are aware of one-stop services, very few decline to use them because of concerns about the quality of services. Instead, many of these employers choose not to use one-stops because they rely on other resources to hire and train workers or do not have enough information about the services one-stops offer. Labor has initiatives to support employer awareness and use of the one-stop system but does not know the extent to which employers use the system. Labor has developed partnerships with businesses and industry to provide employers easier access to the resources of the one-stop system. To measure how the one-stop system is meeting the needs of employers, Labor requires states to collect information on employer satisfaction with the one-stop system, but not on employer use of the system.

While most of these businesses employ fewer than 50 workers, the  majority of workers are employed by larger businesses. Employers are  seeking better ways to meet their workforce needs as they compete in the  global economy. In 1998, the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) created a  comprehensive workforce system, called the one-stop system, designed to  help both job seekers and employers. WIA requires states and localities to  bring together 17 federal programs and make their services available  through about 1,900 one-stops nationwide. The total budget for these  programs is about $15 billion in federal funding. The Department of Labor  (Labor) is responsible for assessing the effectiveness of Labor-funded  programs and providing guidance to states and localities on services  delivered through the one-stops. WIA also requires that states report  information to Labor on employer satisfaction with one-stop services.  However, little is known about how well the services provided by the one- stops are helping employers find the workers they need.", "WIA increased the focus on the employer as a customer of the publicly  funded workforce system and requires that employers constitute a  majority of members on state and local workforce investment boards.  These boards develop policy and provide oversight for the one-stops. The  one-stops provide employers with services such as applicant screening,  skill assessment, and training. The publicly funded workforce system also  provides employers and job seekers with other resources, such as a  national, online job openings database\u2014called America\u2019s Job Bank\u2014and  labor market information such as current wage rates.", "Because of your interest in how well the workforce system is meeting the  workforce needs of all employers, both large and small, we examined   (1) the extent to which employers, including small businesses, are aware  of and using the one-stop system; (2) the degree to which employers who  use one-stop services report satisfaction and what factors cause  employers not to use them; and (3) what Labor has done to support  employer awareness and use of the workforce system and how Labor  measures its success in meeting the needs of employers.", "To address these issues, we surveyed a nationally representative sample of  private sector employers, surveyed state and local workforce officials, and  visited four states and a total of eight one-stops within those states. For  the employer survey, we obtained a sample of 3,232 small, medium, and  large private sector employers from a nationwide database of businesses.  We surveyed employers between June and October 2004, and report on  their use of one-stop services during the 12 months prior to the period  when we surveyed them. We achieved a 54 percent response rate after  adjusting for cases that were ineligible for our study or whose eligibility  could not be determined. We interviewed some of those that did not  respond to our survey and found that their views did not differ  substantially from the views of those that responded to our survey.  Therefore, we are generalizing our survey results to all private sector  business establishments in the United States. For this report, we  considered individual business establishments with two or more workers  as single employers. A business establishment is the physical location of a  certain economic activity, for example, a factory, mine, store, or office. We  chose to survey personnel at business establishments rather than  corporate headquarters because they are more likely to be responsible for  local hiring and training practices, such as use of one-stops. We divided  these business establishments into size categories based on their number  of employees. (See table 1.)", "Survey results that represent all private sector employers in the United  States are heavily influenced by the results for small businesses because  over 95 percent of all business establishments are small. However,  medium and large business establishments employ a majority of the  workforce, so we generally report the survey results for each employer  size category separately. To determine what information states and local  areas collect on services to employers, we surveyed all 50 states and   568 local workforce investment areas, and we received responses from all  50 states and 463 local areas (81.5 percent). We selected 4 states\u2014Florida,  Michigan, Oklahoma, and Wyoming\u2014based on their geographic dispersion  and the diversity of their employment growth rates. In each state we  visited 2 local areas\u20141 urban and 1 rural\u2014and interviewed workforce  officials and local employers. We interviewed officials from the  Department of Labor, employer associations such as the U.S. Chamber of  Commerce, and others.", "On January 27, 2005, we briefed your staff on the results of our work. This  report summarizes the information we shared with your staff and  transmits slides we used to brief your staff that day. (App. I contains these  slides.)

Moreover, large and medium employers are more likely than small  employers to learn about one-stops from a one-stop official or government  representatives. This may be because larger employers are more likely to  hire workers.", "Large and medium employers who know about one-stops are more likely  than small employers to use their services. Of all employers aware of the  one-stops, approximately three-quarters of large employers are likely to  use one-stop services, while about one-half of medium and one-quarter of  small employers are likely to do so. As shown in figure 2, employers of all  sizes generally use one-stop services to help fill job vacancies through  posting job announcements and screening job applicants, with large  employers being three to four times more likely than small employers to  use these services. (See app. III for more information.) Small employers\u2019  lower rate of usage could be associated with their lower likelihood of  hiring. Small employers are less likely than large and medium employers  to have hired an employee in the previous year. In addition, few employers  of any size are likely to access training services through one-stops.

While 56 percent of large employers are aware of  the America\u2019s Job Bank Web site, 17 percent of small employers are aware  of this resource. Likewise, large employers are about twice as likely as  small employers to be aware of labor market information funded by Labor  (74 percent versus 40 percent). In addition, large and medium employers  are significantly more likely than small employers to use both of these  resources. According to Labor, employers use the America\u2019s Job Bank  Web site to find prospective employees, and they use labor market  information to learn about employment trends and wages.

We developed a questionnaire and contracted with Opinion Research  Corporation, a national public opinion research firm, to conduct a  telephone survey of a stratified random sample of all sizes of private  sector business establishments in the United States. We divided these  business establishments into groups depending on their number of  employees (small: 2-49 employees, medium: 50-499 employees, and large:  500 or more employees). Before calling began, an independent reviewer  within GAO reviewed the questionnaire, and we pretested the survey with  two businesses.", "Opinion Research Corporation attempted to contact 3,232 business  establishments between July and October 2004 and completed   1,356 interviews. The overall response rate to the survey was 54 percent  after taking into account out-of-scope cases and cases whose eligibility  could not be determined. The response rate for each employer size  category is as follows: small and unknowns, 50 percent; medium,   53 percent; and large, 60 percent. Response rates were calculated using the  American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) response  rate three method of calculation. Although we do not know the views of all  the remaining business establishments that did not respond to our survey,  we did some limited interviewing and found that their views did not differ  substantially from the views of those that responded to our survey. We  attempted to contact 183 of these nonrespondents and completed a short  interview with 27 of them.", "We purchased the sample from infoUSA, a national provider of business  addresses and phone numbers. InfoUSA\u2019s database contained  approximately 11.3 million relevant business establishments. We  conducted routine steps, such as document review and interviews with  officials, to examine the reliability of the infoUSA data for our purposes.  To provide us with the sample, infoUSA conducted a stratified random  sample selection process that we specified. InfoUSA completed this  process in two phases. This process allowed for a sample of all sizes of  private sector business establishments in the United States. We forwarded  contact information for 3,232 of these sampled business establishments to  Opinion Research Corporation for the survey. (See table 2.)", "We chose to survey business establishments (as opposed to corporate  headquarters) because personnel at the establishments are more likely  than headquarters staff to be responsible for their business\u2019 local hiring  and training practices, such as use of one-stops. We used the Bureau of  Labor Statistics (BLS) definition of business establishment: the physical  location of a certain economic activity, for example, a factory, mine, store,  or office. To qualify for inclusion in our sample, the establishment must  have had at least two or more employees and must also have been engaged  in a commercial enterprise. Using four-digit Standard Industrial  Classification (SIC) code designations, we excluded religious,  governmental, and academic institutions from the sample because they are  not primarily engaged in commercial enterprise. We noted that religious  organizations that have a primary business as a nonprofit enterprise (such  as a social service provider) would be identified as such on the basis of the  SIC code associated with the listing. We noted that the schools and  universities were classified as public sector for some of Labor\u2019s BLS  employment reports and decided to use this approach for our employer  sample. We excluded single-employee businesses, assuming they have not  hired additional employees.", "In addition to survey nonresponse, the practical difficulties of conducting  any survey may introduce other types of errors, commonly referred to as  nonsampling errors. For example, differences in how a particular question  is interpreted, the sources of information available to respondents in  answering a question, or the types of people who do not respond can  introduce unwanted bias into the survey results. We included steps in the  development of the survey, the collection of data, and the editing and  analysis of data for the purpose of minimizing such nonsampling error. For  example, in cases where an employer gave an answer other than the  choices provided, we reviewed, verified, and then categorized each  answer.

However, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey may introduce  nonsampling errors. We took steps in the development of the  questionnaires, the data collection, and data analysis to minimize these  nonsampling errors. For example, we pretested the questionnaires to  ensure that questions were clear and understandable.
