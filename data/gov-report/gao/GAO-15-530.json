The IPO\u2019s Health  Data Interoperability Management Plan indicates that the DHMSM and  VistA Evolution programs are to develop outcome metrics related to their  respective acquisition and modernization programs. However, the  guidance does not identify outcome metrics or establish goals that the  IPO expects to use to measure progress toward improving health care  services resulting from the departments\u2019 interoperable capabilities.", "The IPO Acting Director said that he has tasked a team with working to  identify better metrics to capture both the technical and clinical progress  resulting from interoperability efforts between the departments. According  to the official, this team is working with DOD, VA, and ONC subject matter  experts to identify metrics that would be more meaningful for determining  the impact of increased interoperability, such as metrics on the quality of  a user\u2019s experience and improvements in health outcomes.", "However, as of late May 2015, the IPO had not established a time frame  for when the metrics would be completed and incorporated into their  guidance. Officials of the departments and the IPO explained that defining  appropriate outcome metrics for interoperability is not just a DOD and VA  issue; rather, it is a national challenge to identify how to measure  interoperability and what data are needed.", "Using an effective outcome-based metrics approach could provide DOD  and VA a more accurate, ongoing picture of their progress toward  achieving interoperability and the value and benefits generated. Doing so  would also better position them to assess and report on the status of  interoperability-related activities in terms of results, and to determine  areas that need improvement. Until they establish a time frame, complete  steps to define outcome metrics and goals, and incorporate these into  IPO guidance, the departments and the IPO risk not knowing the status of  program operations and areas that need improvement, and ensuring  accountability for end results."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DOD and VA, with guidance from the IPO, have taken actions to increase  interoperability between their electronic health record systems, as called  for in the fiscal year 2014 NDAA. However, the departments have  indicated that they do not intend to complete a number of key activities  related to the deployment of their modernized systems and  interoperability until after the December 31, 2016, statutory deadline for  deploying modernized electronic health record software. To address the  2016 requirement, DOD has issued plans and announced the award of a  contract for acquiring a modernized system to include interoperability  capabilities across military operations. VA, for its part, has issued plans  describing an incremental approach to modernizing its existing electronic  health records system. However, these plans\u2014if implemented as  currently described\u2014show that interoperability delivered by the new  systems is not expected to be completely deployed until after 2018, which  is beyond the statutory deadline. To date, the departments have kept  Congress informed of their efforts, and we believe it is critical that they  continue to do so.", "Further, the IPO has taken steps to develop guidance that includes  process-oriented metrics for monitoring and reporting on the increasing  exchange of health information between the departments. However, it has  yet to develop outcome-oriented metrics that are important to gauging the  impact that increased interoperability has on improving health care  services. While IPO officials have said that a team has been tasked to  identify metrics that would be more meaningful for determining the impact  of increased interoperability, no time frame has been identified for when  this team will report its results and when the IPO plans to incorporate  these metrics into its guidance. Further, the office has yet to identify goals  that can be used to indicate the status of interoperability-related activities  and the extent to which progress is being made to achieve full  interoperability of health care information by the departments. Without  defining outcome-oriented metrics and related goals and incorporating  these into the current approach, the departments and the IPO will not be  positioned to assess and report on the status of interoperability-related  activities and determine areas that need improvement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To facilitate oversight and inform decision making regarding their  respective department\u2019s interoperability-related activities, we recommend  that the Secretaries of Defense and Veterans Affairs, working with the  Interagency Program Office, take the following three actions: establish a time frame for identifying outcome-oriented metrics, ensure related goals are defined to provide a basis for assessing and  reporting on the status of interoperability-related activities and the  extent to which interoperability is being achieved by the departments\u2019  modernized electronic health record systems, and update IPO guidance to reflect the metrics and goals identified."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to VA and DOD and received written  comments, which are reprinted in appendixes II and III, respectively.

With regard to our recommendation to  establish a time frame for identifying outcome-oriented metrics, the  department described recent actions it has taken toward the development  of interoperability milestones and metrics, which are intended to serve as  a blueprint for the IPO\u2019s efforts to synchronize outcome-oriented metrics  between DOD and VA. In addition, VA noted that it has begun to develop  standardized metrics related to VistA Evolution that are tied to desired  business goals. VA also described its collaborative efforts with DOD and  the IPO to mature interoperability metrics into more meaningful, outcome- oriented metrics and to establish timelines for formal reporting through  IPO guidance and data sharing reports.", "In its comments, DOD also concurred with our recommendations and  stated that the department continues to work with the IPO and VA  stakeholders to develop baseline interoperability metrics. The department  added that it plans to meet with the IPO and VA on a regular basis to  mature these metrics into more meaningful, outcome-oriented measures.", "Nevertheless, DOD took issue with selected aspects of our discussion  related to requirements in section 713 of the fiscal year 2014 NDAA. For  example, the department contended that its limited initial deployment of  the new system, combined with the pending documentation of  interoperability, will satisfy the statutory requirement to \u201cdeploy  modernized electronic health record software supporting clinicians of the  departments by no later than December 31, 2016, while ensuring  continued support and compatibility with the interoperability platform and  full standards-based interoperability.\u201d We disagree with DOD\u2019s position  and reaffirm our finding that DOD\u2019s and VA\u2019s plans\u2014if implemented as  currently described\u2014indicate that deployment of the new systems will not  be completed across the departments until after 2016 and that much  additional work is needed to extend access to the modernized software to  all relevant users and department locations.", "The history and framework of statutory requirements has long called for  the departments to take steps to achieve interoperable health record  capabilities. In this regard, the fiscal year 2008 NDAA included a mandate  to achieve fully interoperable health record capabilities. Further, in section  713 of the fiscal year 2014 NDAA, Congress stated that the departments  \u201c\u2026have failed to implement a solution that allows for seamless electronic  sharing of medical health care data\u2026\u201d and that \u201cmost of the information  shared\u2026is not standardized or available in real time to support all clinical  decisions.\u201d We recognize that section 713 of the fiscal year 2014 NDAA  does not qualify the degree of deployment. Nevertheless, we believe it is  reasonable to expect that electronic health records interoperability  between the departments should be demonstrated by more than a limited  number of users and locations and, more importantly, should be made  available to all relevant clinicians at all relevant locations as expeditiously  as possible.", "DOD also disagreed that the fiscal year 2014 NDAA specified a date by  which certification of compliance with existing national data standards  was required and stated that the timetable for certification is distinct from  the October 1, 2014 deadline for compliance with national standards. We  assert that the October 1, 2014 deadline in section 713(g)(1) of the fiscal  year 2014 NDAA is linked to the departments\u2019 certification that is required  in section 713(g)(2). As DOD points out, the certification requirement  depends on achieving the capability described in section 713(b)(1). This  capability is to be \u201cinteroperable with an integrated display of data\u2026by  complying with the national standards\u2026\u201d. The national standards referred  to here are those national data standards described in section 713(g)\u2019s  certification provision. Section 713(g)(2) requires a certification that DOD  and VA have complied with data standards referred to in section  713(g)(1). These data standards are described in section 713(g)(1) as the  existing national data standards to which all health data in the DOD and  VA systems must comply with by October 1, 2014. DOD and VA\u2019s  required certification involves certification of compliance with existing  national data standards and that compliance was required by October 1,  2014. Thus, we stand by our statement in the report on this matter.", "Further, the department expressed concern about our use of the terms  \u201cfull\u201d deployment and \u201cenhanced\u201d interoperability, stating that these terms  are not cited in the act. We agree that section 713 of the fiscal year 2014  NDAA does not use the term \u201cfull\u201d deployment and we have revised our  report accordingly to remove references to this term. On the other hand,  \u201cinteroperability enhancements\u201d is a term that VA has used when  describing features to be delivered throughout its phased approach to the  VistA Evolution modernization. We used the term \u201cenhanced\u201d  interoperability to describe the improvements planned as the modernized  systems mature beyond October 1, 2014.
