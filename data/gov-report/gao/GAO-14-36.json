The Small Business Act was  amended in 1997 to restrict federal agencies from bundling contracts  without first taking certain steps, including conducting market research  and demonstrating specific cost savings. Congress first enacted consolidation of contract requirements in the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004, but only for DOD, which was  required to conduct market research, identify any alternative approaches  that would involve a lesser degree of consolidation of contract  requirements, and determine that the consolidation of contracts valued  over $5 million (later increased in 2010 to $6 million), was necessary and  justified.

Using this data, we  determined the specific number of contracts and orders awarded,  including the total dollars obligated, and identified the two agencies with  the greatest share of consolidated contracts. Of the 358 consolidated and  bundled contracts awarded government-wide, we identified 290 contracts  reported by DOD and GSA. DOD had the largest amount with 266  consolidated contracts and 8 contracts that were also bundled. GSA had  16 consolidated contracts with obligations, the second largest number  reported.", "From the 290 DOD and GSA consolidated contracts and orders identified,  we selected 157 for review through two different processes. For DOD, we  selected a systematic random sample of 133 of the consolidated  contracts identified in FPDS-NG. For this sample, we ensured that we  had a representative proportion of contracts for base support services  and construction\u2014the two categories specified in our mandate\u2014by  reviewing the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)  code for facilities operation support to identify base support service  contracts and the product service code to identify construction contracts.  We also selected all 8 DOD contracts identified as bundled for a total of  141 DOD contracts. For GSA, we selected all 16 contracts that FPDS-NG  identified as consolidated for our review.", "We contacted DOD and GSA contracting officials to confirm that the 157  selected contracts and orders identified as consolidated or bundled in  FPDS-NG were correctly coded. For most of the contracts that were  miscoded, contracting officials provided verification that they corrected  the miscoding, such as by providing contract action reports showing  updates to FPDS-NG. Of the 141 DOD contracts reviewed, DOD  identified 48 as being incorrectly coded as consolidated in FPDS-NG.  GSA officials reported that all 16 had been miscoded as consolidated.  Overall, we confirmed 100 consolidated contracts, including two that were  also bundled.", "In addition, to supplement our random sample of consolidated contracts,  we spot checked the accuracy of contract categorization in FPDS-NG for  a nonprobability selection of contracts that were coded as some other  category of contract. First, we selected five contracts that DOD and GSA  stated were incorrectly coded as consolidated or bundled and reviewed  contract documentation to confirm that there was no indication of potential  consolidation or bundling. For DOD, we judgmentally sampled four  contracts that were miscoded from the defense agencies that had a base  and all options value above $6 million, which is the threshold for  consolidation in defense acquisition regulations. We also judgmentally  selected and reviewed one of GSA\u2019s 16 miscoded contracts that met the  dollar threshold of $2 million, as set by the 2010 Small Business Jobs Act.  Second, we drew a population size from the FPDS\u2013NG using as criteria  all non-consolidated and non-bundled DOD contracts awarded in fiscal  years 2011 and 2012 that had the NAICS code for base support services.  To draw a reasonable judgmental sample, we selected contracts awarded  by the Air Force, Army, and Navy command units from which we had  previously obtained consolidated contract documentation. We included  contracts that met conditions that would affect whether they were  considered consolidated or bundled, including contracts with a base and  all options value of more than $6 million to meet the consolidation  threshold in DOD guidance and contracts that might be bundled because  they were performed in the United States, foreign funds were not  included, and the contract was not awarded to a small business. Of the  eight contracts we reviewed, one was a consolidated contract that had  not been identified as such in FPDS-NG.", "We also reviewed contracts identified as consolidated or bundled through  sources outside of FPDS-NG data. We examined the Federal Business  Opportunities (FedBizOpps) archives for records of bundled contracts  posted between fiscal years 2010 and 2013. Through this review we  identified one bundled contract that had not been identified as such in  FPDS-NG. Additionally, DOD officials confirmed two other contracts as  consolidated that were not identified in our initial FPDS-NG data.", "Based upon finding substantial incorrect coding in FPDS-NG, we  concluded that the systematic, random sample of 133 consolidated  contracts could not be generalized to the universe of consolidated  contracts identified via FPDS\u2013NG in fiscal years 2011 and 2012.  Therefore, we were only able to describe and attribute to those verified  consolidated contracts that we reviewed.", "To assess the extent to which federal agencies\u2019 justifications for  consolidation comply with relevant laws and regulations, we compared  contracts to the provisions of the Small Business Act, prior to the 2010  amendments, as reflected in the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation  Supplement to require agencies to demonstrate that consolidation and  bundling are necessary and justified before issuing such contracts. We  also reviewed regulations issued in the Federal Acquisition Regulation  and guidance issued by the military departments related to consolidated  and bundled contracts. In addition, we interviewed DOD and GSA  contracting officials, including senior officials at DOD\u2019s Office of Small  Business Programs and GSA\u2019s Office of Small Business Utilization, to  request documents on additional guidance or training procedures to  assist staff in processing consolidated and bundled contracts per the  stipulations outlined in acquisition regulations.", "We obtained documentation of the verified consolidated and bundled  contracts to check for compliance. For both consolidated and bundled  contracts, we reviewed the acquisition plan, market research, the SBA  small business coordination record, the justification letter with the  required signature, and subcontracting plans. For bundled contracts, we  additionally assessed benefit analysis and announcements on the  FedBizOpps website to confirm market research occurred 30 days prior to  the solicitation date. For cases in which discrepancies existed between  contract documentation from the agencies and what was required under  the provisions, we followed up by contacting contracting offices to request  either further documentation or an explanation, or both. We also spoke  with senior SBA officials and procurement center representatives (PCR)  and officials from the agencies\u2019 small business programs to confirm  whether contracts were considered consolidated or bundled.", "We assessed the extent to which DOD and SBA address small business  impacts from consolidated and bundled contracts by reviewing FPDS-NG  data for the DOD contracts to determine whether they were awarded to a  small business. We examined contract documentation, including  acquisition strategies, consolidation memos, and coordination records, to  identify consolidated contracts with requirements that were previously  performed by small businesses and steps taken to address the impacts.  We also interviewed responsible contracting officials, agency small  business specialists, and SBA officials for selected contracts to discuss  their coordination processes and actions to address small business  participation.", "We assessed the extent to which SBA collects and reports information on  bundled contracts by interviewing senior SBA officials and PCRs to  assess coordination efforts with contracting officials and agency small  business specialists. We also collected and reviewed SBA documents,  such as bundling alert forms, to track and report consolidated and  bundled contracts within the agency.", "We conducted this performance audit from December 2012 to November  2013 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the General Services Administration", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the Small Business Administration", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, W.
