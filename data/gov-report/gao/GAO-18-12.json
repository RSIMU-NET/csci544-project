GAO was asked to review federal efforts to help ensure meat and poultry worker safety and health.", "This report (1) describes the efforts OSHA has made to help ensure worker safety and assesses any challenges to these efforts, (2) examines how OSHA and FSIS have collaborated to ensure worker safety, and (3) assesses factors that may affect OSHA and FSIS efforts to protect workers from chemical hazards. GAO analyzed OSHA inspection data from 2005\u2014when GAO last reported on this issue\u2014through 2016. GAO also interviewed OSHA staff in headquarters and six field offices; officials at four other federal agencies; worker advocates; and industry representatives. GAO visited four plants and interviewed workers at six sites in five states selected based on factors such as meat or poultry production."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) increased its annual inspections of the meat and poultry industry from 177 in 2005 to 244 in 2016. OSHA officials told GAO that this increase was related to several new enforcement programs focusing on the poultry industry, as well as new reporting requirements that prompt additional inspections. However, OSHA faces challenges identifying and addressing worker safety concerns because workers may be reluctant to contact OSHA for fear of employer retaliation, although employers are prohibited from doing so by federal law. If workers are afraid to share concerns, OSHA may not be able to identify or address conditions that endanger them. In particular, OSHA may not be aware of the scope of problems workers could face gaining timely access to bathrooms. When asked by GAO, workers in five selected states cited bathroom access as a concern and said they fear speaking up at work, where OSHA inspectors typically interview them. Taking additional steps to encourage workers to disclose sensitive concerns and gathering additional information to determine the scope of bathroom access issues could enable OSHA to better identify worker safety and health concerns.", "OSHA's and the Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service's (FSIS) main vehicle for collaboration on worker safety is their 1994 memorandum of understanding (MOU), but efforts to implement and evaluate the MOU have been limited. The MOU outlines plans for collaboration, such as referrals of plant hazards to OSHA by FSIS inspectors, training of FSIS staff, and information sharing. OSHA and FSIS have taken some steps to implement the policies and procedures outlined in the MOU. However, GAO found issues with the MOU's implementation in these three areas, hampering achievement of the MOU's goals. For example, according to FSIS officials, FSIS inspectors may be reluctant to make referrals to OSHA about hazards in plants because they fear it could trigger an OSHA inspection of FSIS. Further, the agencies have not evaluated the implementation of the MOU. Evaluating the implementation of the MOU and making any needed changes would help ensure the goals of the MOU are met and further protect the safety and health of both plant workers and FSIS inspectors.", "Gaps in federal efforts create challenges to protecting workers from certain chemical hazards. For example, depending on a chemical's intended use, it may not undergo a federal review of the risks it poses to worker safety and health before it is used in a plant. FSIS collects information on how to protect its inspectors from new chemicals, but it does not have a process to share this information with OSHA or plants, among others, so that plant workers can be similarly protected. By FSIS establishing a process to regularly share the worker safety information it collects, the federal government will be better positioned to use existing resources to support the safety and health of plant workers and FSIS inspectors."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making seven recommendations, including that OSHA encourage workers to disclose sensitive concerns and gather bathroom access information; OSHA and FSIS strengthen their MOU; and FSIS share worker safety information.

We also visited four meat  and poultry plants. We also conducted group and individual interviews  with meat and poultry workers in six locations in five states: Arkansas,  Delaware, Nebraska, North Carolina, and Virginia.

OSHA officials said that all inspections decreased in  2013 partly due to the federal government shutdown that year. They  added that poultry inspections increased from 2013 to 2016, which  officials attributed to the introduction of new severe injury reporting  requirements, as well as several emphasis programs focusing inspections  on the poultry industry. OSHA consistently conducted more meat than  poultry inspections, due to the greater number of meat plants than  poultry, according to OSHA officials.", "In states with state OSH plans, inspection numbers increased from 183  inspections in 2005 to 212 in 2016, due primarily to an increase in meat  inspections (see fig. 5). State-plan states conducted almost three times  as many total meat inspections as poultry from 2005 through 2016. The  number of state poultry inspections has remained steady over the time  period, in contrast with the increase seen in federal OSHA poultry  inspections. OSHA officials said they did not believe there is an  overarching explanation for the trend in state-plan state inspections,  because each state plan is independently run, and added that publicly  available data show the increase in meat inspections from 2008 to 2010  could have been driven by a large increase in programmed inspections  conducted by state-plan states during that time, along with increases in  several types of unprogrammed inspections in 2010. in the meat and poultry industry. These programs instruct inspectors to  investigate potential hazards such as chemical exposure, noise, and  ergonomic hazards. Two of the four programs also focus on issues such  as bathroom access, temperature of the plant, and employer recording of  injuries and illnesses, to check for recordkeeping violations. OSHA  inspections incorporated three of these emphasis programs in 2016; the  remaining program did not have inspections that year.

The most frequently cited standard  for employers in the meat and poultry industry, the control of hazardous  energy (lockout/tagout), relates to safely shutting down a machine, and  ensuring it remains shut off, while the machine is being serviced. OSHA  inspects safety controls related to this standard as part of its emphasis  program for amputations.", "In cases where an applicable standard does not exist, OSHA may use the  general duty clause of the OSH Act to cite a plant for exposing its  employees to a hazard. For example, OSHA does not have a specific  standard related to ergonomic hazards, which may cause MSDs.  Workers we interviewed in all five states said they frequently experience  pain related to postures or movements, and medical experts we  interviewed said that meat and poultry workers experience high rates of  MSDs. Citing the general duty clause can be challenging and resource  intensive due to the high burden of proof necessary to establish each  element of the violation, such as the difficulty in showing that work  hazards caused an injury, according to OSHA officials.", "In 2016, OSHA proposed initial meat and poultry plant penalties with a  median of $7,000 and assessed final penalties with a median of $4,900  for inspections where violations were found (see fig. 9). Proposed  penalties may be reduced after employers contest them before an  administrative law judge, or as a result of negotiating penalty amounts  with OSHA through an informal settlement process. A representative of  one worker advocacy group we interviewed said lowering penalties  weakens OSHA\u2019s deterrence capabilities. OSHA officials and one worker  advocate said that allowing companies to negotiate lower penalties can  benefit workers because it may result in companies agreeing to create  safety programs or finding other solutions that improve worker safety.  One OSHA official said that citations may affect a company\u2019s workers\u2019  compensation insurance rate, magnifying the financial impact of the  violation. According to OSHA officials, initial and final penalties  increased in 2010 due to administrative adjustments that had the effect of  raising penalties on average.

We reported in  2016 that meat and poultry worker vulnerability may hinder reporting of  work-related illnesses and injuries, according to federal officials and  worker advocacy groups. In particular, these officials and advocates said  that some meat and poultry workers may be less likely to report or seek  treatment for injuries and illnesses because of their vulnerable status as  undocumented or foreign-born workers and because of their economic  vulnerability.", "Meat and poultry workers may also be reluctant to share information with  OSHA at their workplace, as on-site interviews often do not allow workers  to remain anonymous, even when conducted in private, according to  workers in one state, as well as worker advocates we interviewed.  According to OSHA officials, OSHA generally conducts worker interviews  on-site during inspections. Officials added that, when OSHA conducts on- site interviews, inspectors tell plant supervisors which workers they wish  to speak with, so the supervisors can find replacements for these workers  on the production line. Therefore, the supervisor knows the identities of  interviewed workers, even if the interview itself is private. Officials added  that if workers cannot be pulled from the line, they are sometimes  interviewed in front of other workers as they continue working. The OSH  Act prohibits employers from retaliating against employees for filing  complaints with OSHA. However, OSHA officials, workers from two  states, and worker advocates we spoke with noted that workers may feel  more comfortable sharing concerns about hazards if they are interviewed  off-site.", "The OSHA Field Operations Manual, which sets forth OSHA\u2019s  enforcement policies and procedures, allows inspectors to interview  workers in locations other than the workplace, and states that, \u201ca free and  open exchange of information between OSHA inspectors and employees  is essential to effective inspections.\u201d OSHA\u2019s performance goals in  DOL\u2019s Strategic Plan include preventing discrimination against workers  who report hazards. According to OSHA officials, they will try to  schedule an interview off-site if an employee expresses discomfort or if a  union arranges it. Officials stated that they do not automatically offer off- site interviews to each employee; rather, inspectors should consult with  their Area Directors before offering to conduct an interview off-site.  However, OSHA officials told us that inspectors interview meat and  poultry workers off-site infrequently, since off-site interviews can be  challenging and take additional time, as workers may be difficult to  contact or may have ceased working with the company.  OSHA also may  be challenged to find an acceptable venue when the employee is  available. They added that conducting interviews off-site is more feasible  in cases when unions or worker advocacy groups have facilitated these  meetings, and that interviewing workers on the production line may be  advantageous in some cases, as it allows workers to clarify some  uncertainties by showing the inspector how their work is done. According  to federal internal control standards, agencies should use quality  information to achieve their objectives. Although OSHA officials stated  that OSHA has taken steps to enable the collection of quality information  from workers, such as conducting a representative number of interviews  and refraining from reporting information from specific interviews to  employers, officials acknowledged that some workers may feel more  comfortable sharing concerns about hazards if they are interviewed off- site. Taking additional steps to encourage workers to disclose sensitive  concerns, such as by considering off-site interviews or exploring other  options to obtain the information anonymously, would help OSHA learn  details about hazards, injuries, and illnesses during an inspection and  provide additional information to help improve the agency\u2019s efforts to  identify or address conditions that endanger worker safety and health.", "In particular, OSHA may not be aware of the scope of bathroom access  issues, which meat and poultry workers we interviewed in all five states  said was a concern, because the agency\u2019s reliance on interviewing  workers on-site may cause it to miss concerns of workers who are afraid  to speak up. In addition, OSHA inspectors do not always ask specifically  about bathroom access, and workers who experience bathroom access  problems may not volunteer this information. OSHA\u2019s sanitation standard  provides that \u201ctoilet facilities, in toilet rooms separate for each sex, shall  be provided in all places of employment,\u201d based on the number of  employees of each sex. According to OSHA guidance, this standard requires employers to make toilet facilities available so that employees  can use them when they need to, and may not impose unreasonable  restrictions on employee use of the facilities. OSHA guidance also  states that denial or delay of bathroom access can result in various  serious health effects, such as urinary tract infections, constipation,  abdominal pain, and hemorrhoids.", "Meat and poultry workers may be denied timely bathroom breaks  because they work in an assembly line environment, which generally  requires workers to be replaced if they leave their station. Workers we  interviewed in all five states said their requests to use the bathroom are  often delayed or denied, and workers in two states said they fear  punishment if they ask to use the bathroom too frequently or complain  about lack of bathroom access to their supervisors or to OSHA. Worker  advocates we spoke with reported hearing similar concerns on a frequent  basis and four worker advocacy groups in different regions of the country  reported concerns related to the timeliness of workers\u2019 access to  bathrooms based on non-generalizable interviews of poultry workers.  For example, workers we interviewed in three states said they had  suffered negative health effects, such as kidney problems, from delayed  or denied bathroom breaks. One worker said she refrained from eating or  drinking until she had completed her shift, to avoid needing a bathroom  break. Also, workers we interviewed in all five states said that long lines  at the bathroom further limited bathroom access.", "Meat and poultry industry representatives we interviewed said that  bathroom access is not a problem because companies provide bathroom  access when needed. They said companies take different approaches to  ensuring bathroom access, such as having a supervisor fill in for a worker  who leaves the line, establishing scheduled breaks, or allowing workers to  leave the line as needed, even without a replacement. However,  according to worker advocates, supervisors may vary in implementing  plant policy and may feel pressure to fulfill production quotas. One  industry representative told us they believe some supervisors in meat and  poultry plants deny bathroom access in order to maximize production  output.", "OSHA officials said they did not believe lack of bathroom access was a  widespread problem in the meat and poultry industry. However, OSHA  officials said they have not compared bathroom access practices in the  meat and poultry industry with other industries involving moving  production lines because they vary by establishment even within a single  industry. OSHA issued a citation in March 2016 to a meat plant related to  bathroom access, although that citation is currently being contested by  the employer, and is pending as of September 15, 2017, according to  officials. From 2005 through 2016, OSHA issued three additional citations  to meat and poultry plants related to bathroom access; however, these  citations were withdrawn after the employers reached formal or informal  settlements with OSHA. OSHA guidance for inspecting poultry plants  allows inspectors to ask specifically about bathroom access when there  are complaints about it or prior problems, or in the context of specific  regional emphasis programs, such as the poultry emphasis program in  the southeast United States. In addition, OSHA\u2019s poultry processing  regional emphasis programs in regions IV and VI require the inspector to  assess the adequacy of toilet and sanitary facilities, and of worker access  to them. If there are no prior complaints or relevant emphasis programs,  OSHA officials said inspectors ask workers about any other concerns, but  do not always specifically ask about bathroom access. Officials said that  requiring inspectors to investigate bathroom access would divert  inspectors\u2019 limited resources from higher-priority hazards and could result  in companies\u2019 claiming that the line of questioning is unsubstantiated.  OSHA requires inspectors at poultry plants to consistently investigate  other specific hazards, such as ergonomics hazards. According to OSHA  officials, the agency selected these hazards based on prior inspection  and illness and injury data showing the hazards to be widespread in the  industry. Officials contrasted these with the small number of citations  issued related to bathroom access.", "However, given that workers whom we asked about bathroom access  during off-site interviews in all five states said that bathroom access is a  problem, and worker advocates we interviewed stated it was as well, it is  possible that OSHA is missing instances of this hazard, resulting in  incomplete data to guide its inspections. According to federal internal  control standards, managers should use quality information to achieve the  agency\u2019s objectives. While officials stated they believe that inspectors\u2019  open-ended questions will prompt workers to share any concerns they  have with bathroom access, workers may not volunteer this information  unless specifically asked. For example, workers may not be aware that  they have the right to access bathrooms and so may not realize that such  information would be of interest to OSHA, according to one worker  advocate we interviewed. Gathering additional information about whether  meat and poultry workers experience delayed or denied access to  bathrooms could help OSHA determine the extent of the problem and be  better positioned to protect worker safety and health."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Addressing Medical Mismanagement at Plant Health Units", "paragraphs": ["OSHA officials told us that addressing medical mismanagement at meat  and poultry plants is challenging because of the complex issues involved  and OSHA\u2019s limited oversight of plants\u2019 health unit staff.

In hazard alert letters to four meat and  poultry plants, OSHA noted its concern that plant health unit staff were or  may have been inappropriately supervised and working beyond the scope  of their medical license. Officials said OSHA contacted state authorities  who oversee health unit staff in one state about licensing concerns, and  they planned to contact additional states.", "OSHA officials we interviewed expressed concern about meat and poultry  workers\u2019 access to plant first aid stations or health units and the quality of  medical treatment workers receive. OSHA issued one general duty  clause citation and four hazard alert letters to five meat and poultry plants  in 2015-2016 related to medical mismanagement issues, which describe OSHA\u2019s findings or concerns about inappropriate medical treatment, lack  of worker access to health care, underqualified practitioners, and  challenges to reporting (see sidebar).", "In the citation, OSHA found that the plant delayed care for injured  workers, stating these actions could result in risk of further injury or  exacerbated pain, among other conditions.", "In a 2015 hazard alert letter to a poultry plant, OSHA noted that it  appeared the plant used its first aid station to prevent injuries from  appearing on the plant\u2019s OSHA log, such as by failing to refer workers  to a physician for evaluation or treatment when appropriate. In  addition, OSHA noted that a number of workers were fired after  suffering MSDs, sometimes on the same day of the MSD occurrence,  and further noted workers\u2019 fears of being fired for visiting the first aid  station. OSHA recommended voluntary improvements to the plant\u2019s  medical management practices.", "In a 2014 hazard alert letter to another poultry plant, OSHA identified  practices that it determined were contrary to good medical practice for  managing work-related MSDs, including prolonged treatment by  nursing station staff without referral to a physician. The letter included  one example in which a worker made over 90 visits to the nursing  station before referral to a physician.", "Meat and poultry workers we interviewed in all five states reported  problems with on-site medical care; for example, workers said their  supervisor or plant nurse may not take appropriate steps when a worker  is injured or ill, such as not referring the worker to a doctor or failing to  move the worker to a different work station on the line. Worker advocates  we spoke with reported hearing similar concerns. One worker we  interviewed said that she experienced severe pain in her wrist and visited  the on-site medical unit over the course of 3 months before they referred  her to a doctor affiliated with the plant, during which time she continued to  work. When the doctor did not find any problems on her X-ray, she went  to a doctor unaffiliated with the plant, who found a bone fracture. Meat  and poultry workers in three states also said that fear of being  reprimanded or losing their jobs sometimes compels them to refrain from  accessing care at a plant health unit, or from complaining about  inadequate medical care. Workers in one state said they are penalized  every time they visit their plant health unit.", "Amputation Leads to OSHA Detection of  Medical Mismanagement and Other  Hazards  Following the amputation of a worker\u2019s finger  at a poultry plant in 2016, the Occupational  Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)  conducted inspections and cited the plant for  violations related to: deficiencies with the procedures meant to  stressors as they performed tasks  requiring repetitive, forceful motion for  extended periods of time, often in  awkward positions  failure to comply with generally accepted  good engineering practices with respect  to exhaust systems, ammonia sensors,  and alarms, exposing workers to the  hazards posed by a potential ammonia  release  failure to provide free personal protective  equipment to workers  failure to repair or replace damaged  electrical equipment, exposing workers to  the risk of electrical shock.", "According to one industry representative, plants do not have enough  guidance on how to ensure their health units are properly staffed and  operated. OSHA issued guidance in 1999 about occupational health  professionals\u2019 qualifications and scope of practice, as well as a 2006 best  practices guide on the fundamentals of a workplace first aid program.  However, OSHA officials told us these guidance documents do not  address many of the medical management issues they are currently  observing in plant health units, which include lack of supervision of  medical personnel, personnel working outside their scope of practice, out- of-date health unit protocols, inappropriate response to injuries and  illness, lack of quality assurance, poor worker access to health units, and  inadequate recordkeeping. OSHA officials told us that the agency has  recently begun updating its guidance related to health units to help clarify  employers\u2019 responsibilities with regard to the personnel in these units and  the services they provide. However, these updates have not been  completed, according to officials. Federal internal control standards call  for agencies to externally communicate the information needed to achieve  their objectives. By updating and issuing its guidance, OSHA could help  plant health units be better positioned to provide appropriate care to  injured and ill workers.", "OSHA also issued hazard alert letters  recommending the plant take steps to address  the following hazards: medical management practices that  prevent appropriate standards of care,  increase the likelihood of workers  developing serious musculoskeletal  disorders, restrict referrals to physicians,  and discourage employees from reporting  symptoms and injuries.", "In some cases, plant management may deny entry to OSHA inspectors  attempting to conduct an inspection, and resolving these issues can  create delays. Although the OSH Act authorizes OSHA inspectors to  enter plants \u201cwithout delay\u201d at reasonable times to conduct inspections,  employers have the right to refuse entry, in which case OSHA may seek  an inspection warrant. If the employer denies entry after OSHA obtains  a warrant, OSHA determines its response on a case-by-case basis.  Denials of OSHA inspector entry to meat and poultry plants increased in  2016. All 15 denials in that year occurred in region IV, which includes the  Southeast United States. In contrast, from 2005-2015, there were 16  denials of entry in the meat and poultry industry. The denials in 2016 took  place in Georgia (6), Alabama (5), Florida (2) and Mississippi (2).  According to OSHA officials, the agency experienced denials in all 15  cases when it inspected a plant in response to a complaint or referral and  moved to expand the inspection to incorporate its regional emphasis  program for the poultry industry. OSHA has not been able to expand its  inspections in any of these cases, according to OSHA officials. These  denials of entry have the potential to limit OSHA\u2019s understanding of  worker safety and health in plants during the days or months prior to  gaining entry, and addressing denials is resource-intensive, according to  OSHA officials. There is currently ongoing litigation in a case in which  OSHA was inspecting a plant after an employee was burned by an  electrical fire. OSHA attempted to expand the inspection under a relevant  emphasis program, and the plant contested the expansion in court.

The two agencies have established a process  for these referrals, but according to FSIS officials its inspectors are  reluctant to make them, as discussed below. Until 2014, FSIS inspectors  were to refer these hazards to OSHA by sending a referral to OSHA via  FSIS headquarters, but, according to FSIS officials, inspectors rarely  made referrals under the former system. In 2014, FSIS established a  procedure for its inspectors to notify OSHA directly of serious workplace  hazards that may affect both FSIS inspectors and plant workers and  issued a notice that provides instructions for inspectors to use OSHA\u2019s  nationwide public toll-free number to report such hazards. Because the  agencies are not able to track all of these referrals, as callers can remain  anonymous, it is not possible to assess the extent to which FSIS  inspectors are making them, according to OSHA officials. OSHA data  show that since 2012, OSHA had received 14 complaints and 2 referrals  about FSIS, of which 5 phone calls were from FSIS current or former  employees, but these data are likely incomplete.", "According to FSIS officials, its inspectors may be reluctant to make these  referrals because they fear it could trigger an OSHA inspection of FSIS.  As a federal employer, FSIS is responsible for ensuring its own  employees are protected from plant hazards, and is subject to OSHA  inspection and notification of safety and health hazards faced by its  employees. OSHA data show that from 2005 to 2016, OSHA inspected  FSIS in meat and poultry plants 105 times, of which 14 were in response  to complaints and referrals. FSIS occupational safety and health  specialists said these inspections can be a drain on their resources  because they are time-consuming and there are very few FSIS safety and  health specialists to respond to them. FSIS employs three occupational  safety and health specialists, along with one team lead, resulting in a ratio  of one specialist for every 3,100 employees, according to FSIS officials.  FSIS inspectors we contacted did not report communicating with OSHA,  and stated that they share any worker safety concerns they might have  with their management or with plant contacts. FSIS occupational safety  and health specialists told us that FSIS requests technical assistance  from OSHA to address hazards that may affect both plant workers and  FSIS inspectors. However, they said that OSHA may inspect FSIS  instead of providing assistance, even though OSHA has other ways of  offering technical assistance to federal agencies. For example, FSIS  occupational safety and health specialists told us that when they reached  out to OSHA for assistance with hazards posed by peracetic acid, OSHA  instead inspected FSIS for what FSIS considered to be unrelated  hazards.", "According to OSHA officials, their enforcement team is obligated to  respond to complaints and referrals, including calls to their toll-free  number, and may inspect FSIS if there is a report of a hazard at a meat or  poultry plant to which FSIS employees are exposed. OSHA officials noted  that FSIS employees should not be reluctant to report hazards because  OSHA inspections can protect FSIS workers. OSHA officials told us that  they are able to provide assistance with hazards if FSIS contacts OSHA\u2019s  area offices, but if in the process, OSHA learns about a potential hazard  that is FSIS\u2019s responsibility, then OSHA may investigate the agency.

In  addition, NIOSH officials told us that the agency will consider whether  potential health hazards exist from other chemicals in the environment,  particularly if they interfere with measuring peracetic acid exposures and  assessing health effects in workers. Moreover, officials told us that their  current study could provide the basis of follow-on research into other  workplace chemical hazards, including mixtures.", "In 2004, NIOSH recognized mixed exposures as a priority area for the  occupational safety and health research community and identified  significant gaps and research needs. According to the report, workers  from agriculture, construction, mining, and other industries are commonly  exposed to combinations of chemical substances, biological or physical  agents, and other stressors, and knowledge is limited regarding the  potential health effects of mixed exposures. Identifying these effects can  help characterize worker exposure and develop hazard controls that take  into account the components of the mixtures. According to NIOSH  officials, mixed exposures continue to be important to study because they  may represent a health hazard to workers, and employers should prevent or control workplace exposures to such mixtures. By considering the  addition to the agency\u2019s research agenda of a proposal to examine  peracetic acid\u2019s use in combination with other chemicals, NIOSH will be  better able to characterize worker exposure to such scenarios and  develop controls to reduce this hazard for workers."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["While OSHA\u2019s enforcement efforts in the meat and poultry industry have  increased since we reported in 2005, worker safety and health problems  persist and improvements are needed in identifying worker concerns,  strengthening federal collaboration, and protecting workers from certain  chemicals. Workers we spoke with reported they are reluctant to report  injuries, illnesses, and hazards because they fear losing their jobs. There  is a mismatch between concerns we heard from workers and the  problems reported by OSHA, particularly in the area of bathroom access.  Taking additional steps to encourage workers to disclose sensitive  concerns and gathering additional information to determine the scope of  bathroom access issues could enable OSHA to better identify worker  safety and health concerns. OSHA\u2019s efforts to address medical  mismanagement at plants\u2014which has resulted in poor medical care for  workers\u2014could be improved by issuing updated guidance for employers  on how to manage their health units. Collaboration between OSHA and  FSIS is limited and has improved little since we recommended in 2005  that the two agencies strengthen their 1994 MOU on worker safety. Since  FSIS is already present in many plants, the federal government is missing  out on a cost-effective opportunity to further protect the safety and health  of both plant workers and FSIS inspectors by leveraging resources in this  fiscally constrained environment. Evaluating the implementation of the  MOU and making any needed changes would help ensure the agencies  improve their collaboration. With regard to chemicals, there are gaps in  information sharing and research that have heightened the risk of  chemical hazards for plant workers and FSIS inspectors. In particular,  FSIS collects information on how to protect its inspectors from new  chemicals, but it does not have a process to share this information with its  own inspectors, plant management, OSHA, or NIOSH. By FSIS  establishing a process to regularly share the worker safety information it  collects during reviews of new chemicals, the federal government will be  better positioned to use existing resources to support the safety and  health of plant workers and FSIS inspectors. Finally, NIOSH\u2019s plan to  conduct a study on peracetic acid will likely yield useful information for  meat and poultry worker safety, but it is not intended to address the  potential consequences of mixing peracetic acid with other substances,  which can occur in several ways in meat and poultry plants. By  considering the addition to the agency\u2019s research agenda of a proposal to  examine peracetic acid\u2019s use in combination with other chemicals in meat  and poultry plants, NIOSH will be better able to characterize worker  exposure to such scenarios and develop controls to reduce this hazard  for workers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making seven recommendations, including four to OSHA, two to  FSIS, and one to NIOSH. Specifically:  The Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health  should take additional steps to encourage workers to disclose sensitive  concerns during OSHA inspections of meat and poultry plants; for  example, by considering additional off-site interviews or exploring other  options to obtain information anonymously. (Recommendation 1)", "The Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health  should gather more information, such as by asking workers during meat  and poultry plant inspections, to determine the extent to which bathroom  access is a problem and how to address any identified issues.  (Recommendation 2)", "The Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health  should update its guidance for employers on how to manage their health  units to address the challenges of managing these units.  (Recommendation 3)", "The Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health  should work with FSIS to assess the implementation of the MOU and  make any needed changes to ensure improved collaboration; and set  specific timeframes for periodic evaluations of the MOU.  (Recommendation 4)", "The FSIS Administrator should work with OSHA to assess the  implementation of the MOU and make any needed changes to ensure  improved collaboration; and set specific timeframes for periodic  evaluations of the MOU. (Recommendation 5)", "The FSIS Administrator should develop a process to regularly share the  worker safety information it collects during its review of new chemicals  with FSIS inspectors, plant management, OSHA, and NIOSH.  (Recommendation 6)", "The Director of NIOSH should consider including in the agency\u2019s research  agenda a proposal for examining the extent of peracetic acid\u2019s use in  combination with other chemicals in meat and poultry plants, and any  safety and health hazards these combinations may pose to workers.  (Recommendation 7)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL),  the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the U.S. Department of  Health and Human Services (HHS), and the Environmental Protection  Agency (EPA) for their review. DOL\u2019s Occupational Safety and Health  Administration (OSHA), USDA\u2019s Food Safety and Inspection Service  (FSIS), and HHS provided written comments that are reprinted in  appendixes II, III, and IV, respectively. In an e-mail dated October 5,  2017, an EPA audit liaison indicated that EPA had no comments. OSHA  did not state whether it concurred or not with the four recommendations  made to it. USDA expressed concern with the draft report\u2019s  characterization of FSIS\u2019s collaborative efforts and also described  planned actions to address the two recommendations we made to it. HHS  agreed with the one recommendation we made to it. DOL and HHS  provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate.", "With respect to our first recommendation that OSHA take additional steps  to encourage workers to share information during meat and poultry  inspections, OSHA stated that it fully supports the idea of continuous  improvement of its processes that would expand its ability to identify and  address hazards before an injury, illness, or fatality occurs. However,  OSHA noted that it would be challenging to conduct offsite interviews in  terms of witness cooperation, resources, and inspector safety. We  continue to believe that OSHA should take steps to enhance reporting by  meat and poultry workers. Our report describes meat and poultry workers\u2019  reluctance to report injuries, illnesses, and hazards to OSHA because of  their fear of employer retaliation. OSHA\u2019s Field Operations Manual  highlights the importance of a free and open exchange of information  between OSHA inspectors and employees for conducting effective  inspections. Conducting additional offsite interviews is one way to  encourage employee reporting. However, there may be alternative  additional steps OSHA could take to better position it to encourage  workers to disclose sensitive concerns, consistent with our  recommendation.", "With respect to our second recommendation that OSHA gather additional  information to determine the extent to which bathroom access is a  problem in meat and poultry plants, OSHA stated it could not commit to  routinely asking about bathroom access at each meat and poultry  inspection. OSHA stated that each inspection requires a flexible approach  to address unique worksite hazards. It further stated that OSHA does not  routinely ask questions about any potential hazards that go beyond the  scope of a complaint inspection, unless those hazards are in plain sight.  However, as noted in the report, OSHA does require inspectors at poultry  plants to consistently investigate other specific hazards, such as  ergonomics hazards. Our report highlights the challenges meat and  poultry workers may face gaining timely access to bathrooms. However,  workers might not volunteer access information to OSHA. Our work  identified a mismatch between the concerns we heard from workers and  the problems reported by OSHA. Better understanding the scope of  bathroom access problems would better position OSHA to respond  appropriately. Further, OSHA may choose to address this issue without  routinely asking workers about bathroom access, such as by selectively  querying workers based on criteria determined by the agency.", "With respect to our third recommendation to update its guidance for  employers on management of plant health units, OSHA stated that it  intends to revisit its guidance.", "With respect to our fourth and fifth recommendations for OSHA and FSIS  to work together to assess the MOU\u2019s implementation, make changes to  improve collaboration, and set timeframes for periodic evaluations of the  MOU, neither agency stated whether it agreed or not. OSHA stated that  meat and poultry plants provide an opportunity for the two agencies to  work collaboratively to identify employee hazards and promote safety and  health, but OSHA did not comment specifically on the recommendation.  FSIS stated that it already has directives in place to recognize and report  hazards affecting FSIS employees, and acknowledged that the MOU was  designed to additionally have FSIS employees report hazards affecting  plant employees due to the regular presence of its inspectors in plants.  FSIS noted that in collaborating with OSHA, FSIS will need to ensure its  primary mission is not compromised by undertaking activities that take  time and resources away from its food safety inspection responsibilities.  We continue to believe that strengthening the MOU and developing a  mechanism to regularly evaluate it would help ensure that the goals of the  MOU are met, and that leveraging FSIS\u2019s presence in plants provides the  federal government with a cost-effective opportunity to protect worker  safety and health.", "With respect to our sixth recommendation that FSIS regularly share the  worker safety information it collects during its review of new chemicals  with FSIS inspectors, plant managers, OSHA, and National Institute for  Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), FSIS stated that the agency  already has a process for sharing chemical safety information with its  inspectors. However, FSIS has not provided us with evidence that it has  shared the worker safety information it collects related to new chemicals,  such as safety information that is specific for dilution levels and conditions  of use at plants, as noted in the report. FSIS also stated that it would take  certain steps to share information about approval of chemicals with other  agencies such as OSHA and NIOSH, but the steps identified did not  include sharing worker safety information. Incorporating worker safety  information would further help enhance this information sharing. FSIS  further stated that some of the information collected during its review of  new chemicals may be proprietary.", "In addition, FSIS also expressed concern with how we characterized its  collaboration with OSHA and NIOSH on worker safety. Specifically, in  reference to the report\u2019s discussion of the development of the poultry  inspection modernization rule, FSIS stated that it consulted with and  included OSHA and NIOSH during the appropriate step of the rulemaking  process, and that the agency followed the Administrative Procedure Act in  proposing the rule. We do not intend to suggest any deficiencies with  FSIS\u2019s rulemaking procedures. Rather, our report points out possible  opportunities for earlier and enhanced collaboration with OSHA on  standards development. FSIS also requested that GAO include  information in the report about the directive FSIS issued to implement the  annual attestation on work-related conditions required by the poultry  modernization final rule, and that the agency is sharing the information it  receives as part of this process with OSHA. We have incorporated this  information into the report.", "In its written comments, HHS agreed with our seventh recommendation  that it consider including in NIOSH\u2019s research agenda a proposal for  examining the extent of peracetic acid\u2019s use in combination with other  chemicals in meat and poultry plants, and any safety and health hazards  these combinations may pose to workers.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the comments  of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

This is the interval that would contain the actual population value  for 95 percent of the CPS samples that the U.S. Census Bureau could  have drawn.", "To describe injury and illness rates in the meat and poultry industry, we  analyzed and reported survey data from the BLS Survey of Occupational  Injuries and Illnesses (SOII) for calendar years 2004 through 2015 (the  most recent year for which data were available). The SOII provides  estimates of the number and frequency (incidence rates) of workplace  injuries and illnesses by industry and also by detailed case  circumstances, such as injury type and event, and worker characteristics  for cases that result in days away from work, based on data from logs  kept by employers (survey respondents)\u2014private industry and state and  local governments. Survey respondents provide counts for all recordable  injuries and illnesses under OSHA recordkeeping regulations.", "To report SOII data from the meat and poultry industry (using North  American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 31161 for the  animal slaughtering and processing industry), BLS provided estimates of  each industry\u2019s injury and illness incidence rates and their associated  relative standard errors. All estimates produced from the analysis of the  SOII data are subject to sampling errors. We express our confidence in  the precision of the results as a 95 percent confidence interval. This is the  interval that would contain the actual population value for 95 percent of  the samples the respective agency could have drawn. For estimates  derived from BLS\u2019s SOII data, we used the agency-provided relative  standard errors to estimate the associated confidence intervals. All  estimates we report have the associated 95 percent confidence interval  provided.", "To assess the reliability of BLS SOII data, we reviewed documents  related to the data sources, such as BLS\u2019s Handbook of Methods, and we  interviewed agency officials knowledgeable about these data. We found  that SOII data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes in generally  reporting estimated incidence rates of injuries and illnesses in the meat  and poultry industry.", "To address all three objectives, we reviewed relevant federal laws and  regulations and interviewed officials from OSHA and FSIS. We also  visited four states\u2014Arkansas, Georgia, Minnesota, and Texas\u2014selected  based on factors such as high production of meat or poultry; regional  emphasis programs focusing on meat or poultry; presence of an OSHA  regional or area office; presence of industry and worker advocate  contacts; and access to meat or poultry plants participating in the  Voluntary Protection Program or the Safety and Health Achievement  Recognition Program. We used USDA statistics on the numbers of  cattle, hogs, chicken, and turkeys slaughtered annually in the United  States as a proxy for meat and poultry production for each state. As  appropriate for each site visit, we met with either local OSHA or state  Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) agency officials, as well as FSIS  officials (including inspectors, supervisors, and an occupational safety  and health official), industry representatives, experts in issues related to  worker safety, and representatives of worker advocacy groups; and we  visited four meat and poultry plants. At each plant, we met with plant  management, FSIS management and inspectors, and plant safety and  health staff, as available. The information gathered from these interviews  is not generalizable to all plants or meat or poultry workers.", "We also interviewed and reviewed information from additional  stakeholders, including experts in issues related to worker safety, as well  as representatives of worker advocacy groups. We identified and  interviewed these stakeholders based on previous work and on referrals  from other stakeholders. We also attended worker safety conferences  hosted by the meat industry, the poultry industry, and worker advocates.", "We also conducted group and individual interviews with meat and poultry  workers in six locations in five states: Arkansas, Delaware, Nebraska,  North Carolina, and Virginia. We interviewed between six and  approximately 30 workers per state, totaling approximately 72 workers  across all 5 interviews. We selected sites based on a variety of factors,  such as states with a relatively high level of meat or poultry slaughter,  according to USDA data; type of plant (meat or poultry); and geographic  diversity. We also considered resource availability and the ability of  supporting organizations to coordinate worker interviews. We coordinated  with worker advocacy groups or worker centers to identify meat and  poultry workers who were available and willing to meet with us. Interviews  were conducted in English or Spanish. The information gathered from  these interviews is not generalizable to all meat or poultry workers.", "To describe the efforts OSHA has made to help ensure meat and poultry  workers\u2019 safety and health and assess any challenges, we reviewed  relevant documentation, such as agency guidance and information about  enforcement and compliance assistance activities. We interviewed  officials from OSHA and FSIS, as well as representatives of the meat and  poultry industry. We also analyzed enforcement data from calendar years  2005-2016 from two OSHA databases: the OSHA Information System  and OSHA Legacy Data. We examined data starting in 2005 because our  previous report on OSHA inspections in the meat and poultry industry  examined inspections data through 2004. We analyzed enforcement  data on federal and state inspections of meat and poultry plants, including  data on the type of inspection, violations found, standards cited, penalties  assessed, and whether inspectors were denied entry into the plant. To  analyze the number of inspections and the results of OSHA inspections of  meat and poultry plants, we analyzed inspections of plants with NAICS  codes 311611, 311612, and 311613 for meat plants, and NAICS code  311615 for poultry plants. To assess the reliability of the data, we  reviewed relevant agency documentation, conducted electronic data  testing, and interviewed agency officials knowledgeable about these data.  Based on these reviews, we determined that the data were sufficiently  reliable for our purposes.

To analyze information on OSHA inspections of FSIS in meat and poultry  plants, we used the most recent data available for calendar years 2005- 2016 from the OSHA Information System and OSHA Legacy Data. We  also requested FSIS confirm which establishments pertained to the meat  and poultry industry. In assessing agency efforts, we reviewed the 1994  memorandum of understanding (MOU) agreed to by OSHA and FSIS,  and prior GAO reports that highlight interagency collaboration.
