RRAP projects are to analyze a region's ability to adapt to changing conditions, and prepare for, withstand, and rapidly recover from disruptions.", "GAO was asked to examine DHS's efforts to manage the program. GAO assessed the extent to which DHS (1) developed criteria for identifying RRAP project locations, (2) worked with states to conduct RRAP projects and share information with CI partners to promote resilience, and (3) is positioned to measure results associated with RRAP projects.", "GAO reviewed applicable laws, DHS policies and procedures, and all 17 RRAP reports completed since the program inception in 2009. GAO also interviewed officials from 10 states with issued RRAP reports, DHS officials who conducted 20 RRAP projects from 2009 through 2012, and other federal officials representing nine departments and agencies involved in RRAP projects.

According to DHS officials, final project selections are then made from a list of possible locations based on factors including geographic distribution and DHS priorities, among other considerations. However, it is unclear why some RRAP projects are recommended over others because DHS does not fully document why these decision are made. Federal internal control standards call for agencies to promptly record and clearly document transactions and significant events. Because DHS's selection process identifies a greater number of potential projects than DHS has the resources to perform, documenting why final selections are made would help ensure accountability, enabling DHS to provide evidence of its decision making.", "DHS has worked with states to improve the process for conducting RRAP projects and is considering an approach for sharing resilience information with its critical infrastructure (CI) partners, including federal, state, local, and tribal officials. Since 2011, DHS has worked with states to improve the process for conducting RRAP projects, including more clearly defining the scope of projects. According to DHS officials, these efforts have been viewed favorably by states. DHS is currently considering an approach to more widely share resilience lessons learned with its CI partners, including a possible resiliency product or products that draw from completed RRAP projects. DHS officials stated that they engage CI partners in meetings and conferences where partners' resilience information needs are discussed and have been incorporating this input into their efforts to develop a resilience information sharing approach.", "DHS has taken action to measure efforts to enhance security and resilience among facilities that participate in the RRAP, but faces challenges measuring results associated with RRAP projects. DHS performs security and vulnerability assessments at individual CI assets that participate in RRAPs projects as well as those that do not participate. Consistent with the National Infrastructure Protection Plan, DHS also performs periodic follow-ups among asset owners and operators that participate in these assessments with the intent of measuring their efforts to make enhancements arising out of these surveys and assessments. However, DHS does not measure how enhancements made at individual assets that participate in a RRAP project contribute to the overall results of the project. DHS officials stated that they face challenges measuring performance within and across RRAP projects because of the unique characteristics of each, including geographic diversity and differences among assets within projects. GAO recognizes that measuring performance within and among RRAP projects could be challenging, but DHS could better position itself to gain insights into projects' effects if it were to develop a mechanism to compare facilities that have participated in a RRAP project with those that have not, thus establishing building blocks for measuring its efforts to conduct RRAP projects. One approach could entail using DHS's assessment follow-up process to gather and analyze data to assess whether participation in a RRAP project influenced owners and operators to make related resilience enhancements."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DHS document final RRAP selections and develop a mechanism to measure whether RRAP participation influences facilities to make RRAP-related enhancements.

Damage included flooding in the nation\u2019s financial center that  affected major transportation systems and caused widespread and  prolonged power outages. In March 2007, we reported that our nation\u2019s  critical infrastructure (CI) continues to be vulnerable to a wide variety of  threats. Critical infrastructure is assets and systems, whether physical or  virtual, so vital to the United States that their incapacity or destruction  would have a negative or debilitating impact on national security, national  economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination of  those matters. Because the private sector owns the vast majority of the  nation\u2019s critical infrastructure\u2014banking and financial institutions,  commercial facilities, and energy production and transmission facilities,  among others\u2014it is vital that the public and private sectors work together  to protect these assets and systems. Furthermore, the extensive damage  and long recovery required from natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy  highlights the importance of critical infrastructure resilience. According to  the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), resilience is the ability to  adapt to changing conditions, and prepare for, withstand, and rapidly  recover from disruptions.", "In 2006, in accordance with section 201 of the Homeland Security Act of  2002, as amended, and other authorities and directives, DHS issued the  National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP), which provides the  overarching approach for integrating the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure  protection and resilience activities into a single national effort. The NIPP  also outlines the roles and responsibilities of DHS with regard to CI  protection and resilience and sector-specific agencies (SSA)\u2014federal  departments and agencies responsible for CI protection and resilience  activities in each sector, such as the dams, energy, and transportation  sectors. The NIPP emphasizes the importance of collaboration,  partnering, and voluntary information sharing between DHS and private  sector asset owners and operators, and state, local, and tribal  governments. Among other things, the NIPP calls for DHS to analyze  sector, cross-sector, and regional dependencies and interdependencies,  to include cyber security, and share the results with CI partners, as  appropriate. In addition, the NIPP calls for DHS to conduct and support  comprehensive risk assessment programs for high-risk CI, identifying  priorities across sectors and jurisdictions, and integrating CI protection  and resilience programs with an all-hazards approach to domestic  incident management.", "Over the last several years, DHS has taken actions to develop or update  programs to assess vulnerability and risk at CI facilities and within groups  of related infrastructure, regions, and systems to place greater emphasis  on resilience. One of these programs is the Regional Resiliency  Assessment Program (RRAP), which was developed in 2009 by DHS\u2019s  National Protectorate Program Directorate\u2019s (NPPD) Office of  Infrastructure Protection (IP). The RRAP is an analysis of infrastructure  clusters and systems in specific geographic areas or regions. Using the  RRAP, DHS examines vulnerabilities, threats, and potential  consequences to identify (1) dependencies and interdependencies  among the assets that participate in the RRAP, (2) cascading effects  resulting from an all-hazards disruption of those assets or the region, (3)  characteristics that make the assets and the region resilient, and (4) any  resilience gaps that may hinder rapid recovery from disruptions.", "RRAP projects are conducted by DHS officials; including DHS field  representatives, called protective security advisors (PSA), in collaboration  with SSAs; other federal officials; state, local, territorial, and tribal officials;  and the private sector depending upon the sectors and assets selected.  PSAs are to work with a primary stakeholder\u2014generally officials  representing the sponsoring state government\u2014to develop project  proposals and, among other things, perform outreach with various other  stakeholders involved with the project. They are to also schedule and  conduct security surveys and vulnerability assessments at the assets  included in the project and deliver the final RRAP product to the primary  stakeholder. The final product is a report that is to discuss various  factors including any resilience gaps identified, and DHS suggestions,  called resilience enhancement options, for addressing them. From fiscal  year 2009 through fiscal year 2012, DHS conducted 27 RRAP projects in  various locations throughout the country. These projects covered assets  in various CI sectors, including what DHS calls lifeline sectors, a term  used to refer to geographically distributed sectors\u2014such as the energy,  water, waste-water, and communications sectors\u2014that provide essential  support systems for the well-being and security of the communities they  serve.", "Given DHS\u2019s efforts to develop and implement the RRAP and its efforts to  work with stakeholders to conduct RRAP projects, you asked that we  examine DHS\u2019s overall management of the program. This report  assesses the extent to which DHS developed criteria for identifying RRAP project locations, worked with states to conduct RRAP projects and shared information  with critical infrastructure partners to promote resilience, and is positioned to measure results associated with RRAP projects.", "To address all of our objectives, we reviewed applicable laws,  regulations, and directives as well as IP policies and procedures for  conducting RRAP projects, providing their results, and assessing the  effectiveness of this program. We also interviewed a sample of 10 state  officials and 20 PSAs that have conducted RRAP projects for their  perspectives on the RRAP process. Our sampling methodology for PSAs  included all PSAs that conducted RRAP projects in 2011 (6) and 2012  (10) and 2 PSAs each from RRAP projects conducted in 2009 and 2010  (4 of the 11 RRAP projects conducted in those years), for a total of 20  PSAs. We used a sample of PSAs for the 2009 and 2010 program years  because the RRAP was considered a pilot program in those years, and  DHS officials told us the process had changed a great deal by 2011. For  our sample of state officials, we included four officials representing states  where RRAP projects were performed in 2009 and 2010 where we spoke  to PSAs, respectively, and officials representing all six RRAP projects  completed during 2011 to obtain their perspectives on the RRAP process  and the resulting RRAP report. We did not include state officials for the  2012 RRAP projects because these reports had not been issued at the  time of our review, so these state officials would be unable to offer their  perspectives on the value of the reports and the use of the results.

We also interviewed IP officials as well as state  officials to understand the process DHS uses to identify and select RRAP  locations and sectors. We then compared the results of these steps  against the criteria in the NIPP\u2019s risk management framework and federal  internal control standards. In addition to the DHS and state officials  mentioned above, we also interviewed members of the State, Local,  Tribal and Territorial Government Coordinating Council (SLTTGCC)\u2014a  cross-sector council that serves as a forum to ensure that state, local, and  tribal homeland security partners are fully integrated as active participants  in national CI protection efforts\u2014to obtain their perspectives on the RRAP  selection process.

We  analyzed all issued RRAP reports for RRAP projects conducted from  2009 through 2011 to help identify the roles of federal partners and  states. We interviewed officials at DHS and officials representing Argonne  National Laboratory (ANL), the contractor that works with DHS to conduct  RRAP projects. We interviewed officials representing nine SSAs that DHS  listed as having participated in RRAP projects or whose sectors were  either the focus sector of a RRAP project or a key supporting sector  based on our review of the issued RRAP reports. We spoke with the chair of SLTTGCC and members of its RRAP Working Group to obtain  the council\u2019s perspective regarding state and local concerns about the  RRAP and DHS\u2019s actions taken to address these concerns. We  interviewed officials from the states and PSAs to obtain their perspectives  on the participation of federal and state stakeholders in RRAP projects  and DHS\u2019s efforts to share information obtained from the RRAP projects  with federal and state partners. We compared the results of our analysis  with the partnering and information-sharing criteria in the NIPP and  federal internal control standards and met with DHS officials to discuss  any differences between stakeholder experiences and NIPP criteria, as  well as to identify any opportunities to improve partnering and information  sharing.", "To address our third objective, we reviewed DHS documentation on  performance measures, including its Project Management Plan for  vulnerability assessments and the RRAP Findings Tracker used by IP to  gather RRAP data on activities related to, among other things, partnering  and information sharing, and actions taken to address the findings of the  RRAP report. We also interviewed DHS program officials to understand  and describe the process through which DHS gathers data on actions  taken to measure the impact of resilience changes resulting from the  RRAP reports and obtain examples of efforts to measure performance,  including guidelines and tools. In addition, we interviewed staff from  ANL\u2014the DHS contractor that compiles facility security survey and  vulnerability assessment data\u2014to discuss how resilience findings are  developed. We also reviewed the NIPP and federal internal control  standards and compared DHS\u2019s efforts to measure its performance with  these standards. We identified any gaps in DHS\u2019s performance  measurement approach, and met with DHS officials to determine why  these gaps, if any, may have occurred and to discuss barriers, if any, to  gathering and sharing performance measure information.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2012 to July 2013 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

While  other entities may possess and exercise regulatory authority over CI to  address security, such as for the chemical, transportation, and nuclear  sectors, IP generally relies on voluntary efforts to secure CI because, in  general, DHS has limited authority to directly regulate CI. In carrying out  its responsibilities, IP leads and coordinates national programs and  policies on critical infrastructure issues and, among other things, conducts  and facilitates security surveys and vulnerability assessments to help CI  owners and operators and state, local, tribal, and territorial partners  understand and address risks.

RRAP reports  can provide insights into the resilience of a region and the sector(s) under  review and the gaps that could prompt regional disruptions.", "Another aspect of the program centers on DHS\u2019s efforts to use RRAP  projects to build stakeholder relationships and enhance information  sharing and coordination among stakeholders in a particular region. For  example, one RRAP report stated that fostering relationships between  key facilities and supporting infrastructure providers was necessary to  improve response to a hazard or incident. Another RRAP project sought  to coordinate a partnership of key players and stakeholders (including  both public and private sector stakeholders in the sector of focus and  local law enforcement) to improve information sharing necessary for  responding to a contamination in the food supply system. According to  DHS officials, the creation and continuation of these stakeholder  relationships is a major benefit of RRAP projects and the RRAP process.

For  fiscal years 2011 and 2012, IP officials stated that they refined their  process for identifying and selecting RRAP projects to incorporate more  input from primary stakeholders. For example, IP officials developed a  RRAP project template for PSAs and states to use when jointly  developing RRAP project proposals. The template included information  on regional characteristics and risk, the willingness of state and facility  stakeholders to participate, potential outcomes of the RRAP analysis, and  planning and logistical considerations. While considering project  proposals states and PSAs jointly developed using the template, IP  headquarters officials also developed their own RRAP project proposals  (using open source documents for major metropolitan areas) to ensure IP  leadership could consider a range of projects across a variety of sectors  and locations.

First, IP revised its process from that used in previous years by  considering only RRAP project proposals submitted jointly by PSAs and  states. According to IP officials, they made this change to help ensure  that RRAP locations and sectors reflected state priorities, particularly in  light of lessons learned from past RRAP projects and feedback from  SLTTGCC. In a 2011 report on state and local government CI resilience  activities, SLTTGCC expressed, among other things, concern about the  scope of RRAP projects\u2014particularly when states did not request the  RRAP project\u2014and the cost and resources required to be involved in a  RRAP project.", "Second, IP officials developed nine point selection criteria to identify lists  of potential RRAP project candidates.

These criteria were used to evaluate the RRAP project proposals  used to make the fiscal year 2013 and 2014 RRAP project  recommendations.

Additionally, PSCD officials provided  examples of why some projects were recommended over others. For  example, PSCD officials told us that one PSA had submitted three  separate proposals, all of which received scores of seven or above, but  PSCD recommended only one of the three for selection by the Assistant  Secretary because a PSA can participate in only one RRAP at a time. In  another case, PSCD officials told us that an international partner for a  cross-border transportation project could not participate because of  resource constraints.

PSAs perform these surveys and assessments at individual  assets and facilities, including those that participate in RRAP projects,  across the 16 sectors. In January 2011, IP directed PSAs to follow up  with security survey and vulnerability assessment participants to gather  feedback on security and resilience enhancements at their facilities using  standardized data collection tools. These follow-up tools were to be used  by PSAs to ask asset representatives about enhancements in six general  categories\u2014information sharing, security management, security force,  protective measures, physical security, and dependencies\u2014and focused  on changes made directly as a result of IP security surveys and  vulnerability assessments.", "According to IP officials, PSCD revised its security survey and  vulnerability assessment in January 2013 to include additional resilience- related questions intended to focus on facility preparedness, mitigation  measures, response capabilities, and recovery mechanisms among  facilities that participated in a security survey or vulnerability assessment.

IP officials said that revisions to the follow-up tools will also reflect  changes associated with security and resilience enhancements at the  facility, distinguishing them as either security or resilience changes.  Officials said security surveys and vulnerability assessments that were  conducted on facilities in support of a RRAP project are noted as such in  the IP Gateway, but there is no other additional or separate tracking for  the purposes of performance metrics. Furthermore, officials said they  continue to gather data on changes initiated at facilities that participated  in the RRAP, but they believe it may not be possible to link any changes  made at facilities to participation in the RRAP.

In January 2012, IP developed a project management plan  (PMP) intended to clarify planned performance metrics for IP\u2019s  vulnerability assessment programs, including the voluntary security  surveys and vulnerability assessments performed during RRAP projects.  The PMP stated that DHS planned to measure the impact of RRAP  projects by conducting follow-up checks at RRAP facilities to see if these  facilities or systems implemented changes that increased the resilience of  the facility. The PMP set a goal of 20 percent of facilities making  resilience improvements following a security survey or vulnerability  assessment performed for RRAP projects for fiscal year 2013, rising to 50  percent of facilities by fiscal year 2017. The PMP stated that this facility  information is to be used to compile resilience information for the region,  but it did not explain how this information would be combined to measure  regional resilience. In April 2013, IP officials told us that they no longer  intended to use the performance targets contained in the PMP. IP officials  explained that they believe that individual facility assessment follow-ups  are not an effective means to measure the impact of a RRAP project.  They said that RRAP findings are written for the primary stakeholder\u2014the  state and not the assessed facilities\u2014and RRAP projects most often  provide the analyses of larger regional issues rather than specific facility  gaps.", "Alternatively, PSCD officials stated that they have since developed the  RRAP Findings Tracker to engage primary stakeholders about their  efforts to address key findings resulting from individual RRAP projects.  According to PSCD officials, in March 2013, the RRAP Findings Tracker  was distributed to all PSAs who had conducted a RRAP project over the  previous 3 years. PSAs were directed by IP to use the RRAP Findings  Tracker to follow up with the state and other stakeholders on specific  RRAP issues identified in those states. IP updates the tracker on a  monthly basis and headquarters officials are to review the results every 6  months. The RRAP Findings Tracker is intended to cover, among other  things: developments that demonstrate project relevance since the RRAP  project was initiated, for instance, news reports, speeches, or studies  that demonstrate the ongoing relevance of the project\u2019s focus; partnership building and information sharing, to include developments  that relate to how project stakeholders\u2014whether state, regional,  federal, or private sector\u2014have enhanced interaction, awareness,  communication, and information sharing; any action taken concerning the RRAP report\u2019s key findings,  particularly with regard to enhancement options specified in the RRAP  report; and activities at specific individual assets assessed during the RRAP and  their efforts to enhance resilience, including the percentage of  assessed assets that have made an improvement or planned to make  an improvement after 6 and 12 months.", "PSCD officials said that they believe that by utilizing the information in its  Findings Tracker, they would likely have greater insights into the extent  that stakeholders take action following a RRAP project, such as the  extent to which the project has improved communication among RRAP  stakeholders. According to officials, in May 2013, they began having  preliminary discussions about using the RRAP Findings Tracker as one  input for developing possible metrics. They added that it would be would  be premature for them to provide us with any of the preliminary draft  ideas for metrics associated with this effort.", "Nonetheless, IP officials also stated they face challenges measuring  performance across facilities within a RRAP project, and from project to  project. For example, IP officials told us that each RRAP project is difficult  to measure because each focuses on unique assets within a unique  geographic area or region. For example, our reviews of RRAP reports  showed one RRAP project might focus on commercial facilities, such as  stadiums and arenas in one urban area, while another project might focus  on a shopping district or an urban mall in another. Similarly, a  transportation RRAP project in one region may focus on roadways and  bridges, while a project in a different region might focus on waterways. IP  officials added that participation in a RRAP project is voluntary, as is  participation in the completion of the RRAP Findings Tracker. Therefore,  the ability to develop measures that represent assets in a region could  hinge on the willingness of CI stakeholders, including facility owners and  operators, to participate.", "IP officials further explained that, given the diversity of assets and regions  covered by individual RRAP projects, it could also be challenging to link  key RRAP findings and subsequent actions within projects. For example,  one RRAP project may identify a planning shortfall, leading to a  resilience-enhancing option calling for the creation of a plan. If the  affected stakeholder or stakeholders subsequently create such a plan, IP  could note that an action or actions were taken toward addressing a key  finding, but it would be unable to assess whether the plan addresses the  key finding adequately until it was implemented and tested through an  exercise or real-world emergency. Reaching that next step may take  years, according to officials. Officials also stated that it might be difficult to  develop measures of key findings across RRAP projects. Whereas a key  finding of one RRAP project might focus on the development of a regional  plan as discussed above, a key finding of another might focus on  prioritizing the distribution on resources, such as fuel, to ensure that  emergency services can remain viable during a hurricane or earthquake.  A separate RRAP project might have a key finding that electrical power is  provided by single supplier, leaving a region vulnerable to a single point  of failure.", "We recognize that developing performance measures among and across  RRAP projects could be challenging moving forward. We further  recognize that the information generated through the administration of the  RRAP Findings Tracker with RRAP project primary stakeholders (e.g.,  states) may provide a foundation for DHS\u2019s development of RRAP  performance measures. However, DHS could better position itself to gain  insights into a project\u2019s effects if it were to develop a mechanism to  assess whether changes made at individual facilities are linked to or  influenced by participation in a RRAP project. One approach for doing so  could entail IP revising its security survey and vulnerability assessment  follow-up process at individual facilities, including follow-ups at facilities  that participated in RRAP projects to gather and analyze data on the  extent to which participation in a RRAP project influenced owners and  operators to make related resilience enhancements. More specifically, IP  officials stated earlier that they did believe it was possible to link security  and resilience enhancements made at facilities that participated in RRAP  projects to RRAP project participation. However, currently the PSA does  not specifically ask facility owners and operators whether participation in  the RRAP project influenced their enhancement decisions. Developing a  mechanism\u2014such as revising the security survey and vulnerability  assessment follow-up tool\u2014to ascertain whether changes made at  individual facilities are linked to or influenced by findings in RRAP projects  could provide IP valuable information on individual facility efforts to  address key RRAP project findings and how any enhancements are  linked to the RRAP project. Doing so would also enable IP to compare  facilities that participated in a RRAP project with those that did not and  provide a basis for assessing why RRAP participation may or may not  have prompted changes at a facility, thereby providing a building block for  measuring IP\u2019s performance and insights into the effect a RRAP project  may have on facility resilience. This would also be consistent with the  NIPP, which states that the use of performance metrics provides a basis  for DHS to establish accountability, document actual performance,  promote effective management, and provide feedback to decision  makers.", "Gathering data on the extent to which participation in a RRAP project  influenced facility enhancements might also provide DHS valuable  information about the results of its efforts, consistent with the views of  PSAs who coordinate RRAP projects among stakeholders in particular  regions. For example, 6 of the 10 PSAs we interviewed who had  participated in RRAP projects where RRAP reports were issued  expressed the belief that facilities that participated in the RRAP are more  likely to have made improvements that increased security or resilience  than other facilities that were not part of a RRAP project, but had  undergone a security survey or assessment. These PSAs said that they  believed this would occur because facilities participating in RRAP projects  are able to see how their own operations affect the security and resilience  of other facilities within the region. IP officials stated that they agreed that  understanding whether RRAP participation had an effect on whether  enhancements were made at an individual facility could provide useful  information to the program. By assessing the linkage between the actions  of individual facilities and the results of a RRAP project, DHS would also  have a basis to begin to explore the effect of a RRAP project on facility  management and operations, especially since RRAP projects are  intended to focus on dependencies and interdependencies among  facilities in a particular region."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["IP has taken important actions to standardize the selection process for  RRAP project locations.

However, further actions could strengthen these endeavors.  First, with regard to the process for selecting RRAP project locations, IP  has developed criteria and a process for selecting project candidates, but  it has not fully documented why some projects are recommended over  others. Documenting why specific RRAP selections were or were not  recommended would be consistent with Standards for Internal Control in  the Federal Government, and would provide IP managers and others  responsible for overseeing the program valuable insights into why one  RRAP project was selected over another, particularly among proposals  with the same score that appear equally feasible and worthy.  Furthermore, maintaining documentation about reasons why projects  were or were not recommended would also provide IP a basis for  defending its selections or responding to queries about them, particularly  given the desirability of the program among the states and budgetary  constraints facing states and other potential RRAP stakeholders. With  documentation on why projects were or were not recommended and  selected, DHS would be better positioned to respond to queries about  project selections from potential RRAP stakeholders, particularly if senior  managers or staff currently involved in the program move to other  positions and new managers or staff do not have records about key  decisions.", "Second, consistent with the NIPP, IP has taken action to establish an  approach for conducting follow-up surveys at facilities that have  undergone security surveys and vulnerability assessments\u2014both those  that participated in RRAP projects and those that did not\u2014to document  changes the facilities make that affect their resilience.

We recognize that IP faces  challenges developing performance measures to gauge results among  and across RRAP projects; nevertheless, IP could benefit from assessing  how participation in a RRAP project may or may not influence change.  Specifically, although the RRAP Findings Tracker may provide a  foundation for IP\u2019s overall development of RRAP performance measures,  IP could develop a mechanism to assess whether changes made at  individual facilities are linked to or influenced by participation in a RRAP  project. One such mechanism could entail IP revising its security survey  and vulnerability assessment follow-up tool, which is used to query all  facilities that have participated in these surveys and assessments\u2014 regardless of whether they participated in a RRAP project. Doing so  would enable IP to compare the extent to which facilities that participated  in a RRAP project made enhancements related to DHS security surveys  and assessments with those that did not participate in a RRAP project.  This comparison could serve as a building block for measuring IP\u2019s efforts  to conduct RRAP projects, thereby providing an avenue to use  performance metrics to establish accountability, document actual  performance, promote effective management, and provide feedback to  decision makers as stated in the NIPP. It would also provide valuable  insights on individual facility efforts to address key RRAP findings, and  give IP a basis for determining how those finding may have affected  facility resilience, particularly as it relates to facility dependence and  interdependence."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help ensure that DHS is taking steps to strengthen the management of  RRAP projects and the program in general, we recommend that the  Assistant Secretary for Infrastructure Protection, Department of  Homeland Security, take the following two actions: document decisions made with regard to recommendations about  individual RRAP projects to provide insights into why one project was  recommended over another and assurance that recommendations  among equally feasible proposals are defensible, and develop a mechanism to assess the extent to which individual projects  influenced participants to make RRAP related enhancements, such as  revising the security and vulnerability assessment follow-up tool to  query facilities that participated in RRAP projects on the extent to  which any resilience improvements made are due to participation in  the RRAP."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Secretary of Homeland Security  for review and comment.

DHS stated that it estimates that it will complete this action as of  September 30, 2014, for projects in the next RRAP cycle\u2014that is,  projects to be conducted in fiscal year 2015.", "With regard to the second recommendation, that DHS develop a  mechanism, such as revising the security survey and vulnerability  assessment follow-up tool, to assess the extent to which individual  projects influenced participants to make RRAP related enhancements,  DHS also concurred. In its written comments, DHS agreed that it would  be insightful to understand whether the implementation rate of security  and resilience enhancements at facilities differs between those receiving  an assessment as part of a RRAP, and those receiving an assessment  unrelated to this program. After we provided a draft of this report to DHS  for review and comment, IP officials raised concerns that the  recommendation as originally worded did not provide them the flexibility  they needed to consider multiple alternatives to gain insights about  RRAP-related enhancements. For example, and as noted in the written  comments, facilities participate in the RRAP in many ways and surveys  and assessments are but one option offered to facilities in a focus area.  While we continue to see benefits to revising the security survey and  vulnerability assessment follow-up tool, as discussed in the report, we  modified the recommendation to acknowledge IP\u2019s concerns about  considering other possible mechanisms.

First, while concurring with  our second recommendation, DHS stated that it is disappointed that the  draft report did not have a more extensive discussion on the overall  success and effectiveness of the RRAP to identify and address regional  security and resilience gaps. DHS noted that since the RRAP\u2019s inception,  projects have been conducted in regions throughout the nation and have  focused on sectors such as energy, transportation, commercial facilities,  water, and food and agriculture. DHS stated that through the RRAP, DHS  has provided unique technical expertise to its stakeholders that helps  guide their strategic investments in equipment, planning, training, and  resources to enhance the resilience and protection of facilities,  surrounding communities, and entire regions. We believe that the report  did address these issues sufficiently. As noted in the report, IP has taken  important actions to (1) standardize the selection process for RRAP  project locations, (2) work with state stakeholders to better communicate  the scope of projects and consider how it can share resilience information  with CI partners, and (3) gather information on CI partner actions to  enhance resilience after the RRAP project is completed. Nonetheless, the  NIPP states that the use of performance measures is a critical step in the  risk management process to enable DHS to objectively and quantitatively  assess improvements in CI protection and provides a basis for DHS to  document actual performance, promote effective management, and  provide a feedback mechanism to decision makers. As discussed in the  report, developing performance measures among and across RRAP  projects could be challenging moving forward, but, absent these  measures, neither we nor DHS is positioned to report on the overall  success and effectiveness of the program. Hence, we recommended the  development of such a mechanism to assess RRAP-related  enhancements.", "Second, DHS stated that the draft report did not substantially discuss the  significant evolution of the program from a 2009 pilot to a more mature  program that is at the forefront of the evolving critical infrastructure  security and resilience mission that is responsive to the needs of the  federal government and its partners. We disagree and believe that the  report sufficiently discusses the evolution of the program, particularly the  evolution of DHS\u2019s process for selecting project locations as well as  changes DHS has made to address the concerns of stakeholders based  on their early experiences with RRAP.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Homeland  Security, the Under Secretary for the National Protection Programs  Directorate, and interested congressional committees.
