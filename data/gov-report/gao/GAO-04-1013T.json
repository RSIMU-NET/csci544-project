From the $125 million portion available for processing of claims, the Board had used about $44 million to reimburse two state entities--the New York State Crime Victims Board and the New York State Insurance Fund--for benefits those entities had paid to September 11 victims (or survivors). In addition, the Board had used about $4.4 million of the $125 million to prepare for responding to any future terrorist attacks. For example, the Board paid for new computer backup systems and new off-site storage contracts to ensure access to claims data in case of a disaster. At the time of our review, the Board had not yet used any of the $25 million that is available to reimburse the UEF for benefits the UEF paid to workers associated with uninsured employers (or survivors). However, the Board had used funds from the UEF to pay these benefits and was first trying to recoup these funds from the uninsured employers before drawing upon federal funds to reimburse for any unrecovered expense. Finally, the Board had used about $456,000 of the $25 million that is available to reimburse the UEF for benefits the UEF paid to volunteers (or survivors). The Board indicated that, as of mid-2004, it had received 10,182 claims for workers' compensation and 588 volunteer claims related to the September 11 attacks and recovery. Ninety percent of the workers' compensation claims had been resolved, that is, the Board had resolved all the issues that it could with the information available at that point. The remaining 10 percent of claims were pending, as the Board was waiting for additional information from claimants (such as medical evidence), hearings were yet to be held, or claimants had not pursued their case after initial filing. The Board officials noted that the status of claims was fluid: a resolved claim could change to pending if more information becomes available and the Board reopens the case. In addition, we were unable to report approval and denial rates of claims because, according to Board officials, the Board's core mission is to process individual claims and not track outcomes of claims decisions. For 52 percent of workers' compensation claims received, (1) a link had been established between the September 11 disaster and the resulting death, injury, or illness and benefits had been paid or were in the process of being paid, or (2) this link had been established but the Board had not authorized paying benefits. Of the 10,182 workers' compensation claims, 133 were associated with workers whose employers were uninsured. The Board had resolved 89 percent of these 133 claims. Of the 588 volunteer claims received, the Board had resolved 31 percent and 69 percent were pending.

Because some employers do not comply with  this requirement, the state maintains a UEF to provide workers\u2019  compensation benefits for workers associated with uninsured employers.  To administer the state workers\u2019 compensation program, the Board  reviews claims to determine whether a worker is eligible to receive  workers\u2019 compensation benefits.

The state determined that the September 11 attacks  were a crime that qualified for benefits under the state Crime Victim  Compensation Act. According to Board officials, New York State  temporarily designated the CVB as the first source of benefit payments for  September 11 victims because state officials believed that this would be  the most efficient way to deliver benefits. Within a month of the attacks,  the Governor issued two formal decisions suspending limits on the benefit  amounts payable by the CVB and identifying individuals who would be  eligible for benefit payments from the CVB. According to the Board, the  reimbursement agreement between the Board and the CVB was  established and approved by the New York State Assembly, the New York  State Senate, and the Governor. Based on this agreement, the Board  reimbursed the CVB after receiving documentation describing the nature  and amounts of payments that the CVB had previously made to victims.  The CVB requested reimbursement from the Board for payments to  victims related to loss of earnings and support, loss of essential personal  property, funeral and burial expenses, and medical expenses. According to  the Board, the New York State Comptroller authorized the payments, and  the New York State Division of the Budget reviewed and approved these  payments. The Board said it did not anticipate the need to provide  additional reimbursements beyond the $28 million already provided to the  CVB because individual claimants are now going directly to the Board and  not to the CVB.", "The Board paid about $16 million of the $125 million to reimburse the SIF  for workers\u2019 compensation benefits the SIF paid to September 11 victims  employed by the state (or their survivors).

Specifically, the Board reimbursed the SIF for  workers\u2019 compensation benefits paid to state employees (or their  survivors) who were injured or killed during the September 11 disaster.  After the SIF provided documentation to the Board on benefits paid, the  Board reimbursed the SIF to cover both payments already made to state  employees (or their survivors) and projections of future benefit payments  for these employees. These reimbursement payments were reviewed and  approved by the New York State Division of the Budget. The Board did not  expect to reimburse the SIF for many more September 11 claims because  the deadline for filing had passed for injury and death claims. However,  the Board indicated that the SIF might ask for reimbursement for a few  new claims from state workers who become ill in the future, because such  workers may file a claim when symptoms of a disease appear.", "The Board used a significant part of the $125 million available for  processing claims to reimburse the CVB and the SIF for benefit payments  those entities made to victims. We are continuing to gather information  about whether these reimbursements were authorized in the grant  agreement\u2019s statement of work and whether the $125 million appropriation  earmarked for \u201cthe processing of claims\u201d was available for  reimbursements of benefits paid.

These funds were used for a multiyear project to ensure the  Board has the ability to maintain operations, including access to all claims  data, in case the Board\u2019s main data system fails. The Board used the funds  to upgrade, purchase, and/or install computer systems; pay salaries and  fringe benefits of staff working on the project; and cover travel expenses.  For example, the Board paid for new tape and disk backup systems, new  off-site storage contracts, and new image storage systems to ensure  viability of Board data and operations. Finally, to enhance information  security, the Board developed a security awareness program for all Board  staff, and planned to test vulnerability of its systems.
