WHO provides recommendations for disease eradication and elimination to its governing body, the World Health Assembly, based on two general criteria\u2014scientific feasibility and the level of political support by endemic and donor countries. Formal campaigns were initiated against dracunculiasis and leprosy in 1991, and against polio and lymphatic filariasis in 1988 and 1997, respectively. Regional or subregional campaigns are also underway against measles, onchocerciasis, and Chagas\u2019 disease. Disease eradication and elimination efforts are normally implemented by national governments of the affected countries. Developing countries typically receive assistance for these efforts from bilateral and multilateral donors, nongovernmental organizations, and the private sector.", "In April 1997, WHO provided the House International Relations Committee with estimated costs and target dates for eradicating or eliminating the seven diseases. Subsequently, WHO revised some of the costs and time frames based on more recent information. We also made some adjustments for consistency among the figures. Our review focuses on the estimates that WHO provided to us as of December 1997. WHO officials estimated that about $7.5 billion would be needed to eradicate or eliminate the seven targeted diseases. Developing costs and time frames for these efforts is difficult due to challenges in gathering and verifying data from countries with minimal health infrastructure. Unpredictable and unstable country conditions, such as civil unrest, further complicate efforts to project how much these efforts will cost and how much time is needed. Table 1 provides a breakdown of costs and time frames for eradicating or eliminating each disease.", "To assess the soundness of WHO\u2019s estimated costs and time frames, we met with the WHO officials responsible for preparing them and with other international health experts who discussed the factors that should be considered when estimating how much disease eradication or elimination will cost and how time frames are established. Following consultation with WHO and other experts, we determined five overall factors to be considered for estimating costs. These experts also provided information on how targets are developed and the variable circumstances that may affect time frames. We used this information to assess whether the data underlying WHO\u2019s estimates were sound. In addition to WHO, the experts we consulted included officials from the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Carter Center\u2019s Global 2000 health program, the Johns Hopkins University, and Emory University to obtain their views on WHO\u2019s estimates.

We focused our assessment primarily on these five factors.", "WHO addressed all five factors in developing its cost estimates, except for the measles estimate, which did not include certification costs. The completeness of the data underlying the estimates varies by disease. Estimates for those diseases with long-standing campaigns that are closest to eradication or elimination\u2014dracunculiasis, polio, and leprosy\u2014are more complete, and costs are based on actual experience in endemic countries. For the other diseases, WHO is still gathering data and refining its assumptions. For several diseases, products are donated and are not included in projected costs. Examples include nylon filters donated by Dupont Corporation and Precision Fabrics Group for controlling dracunculiasis, donations of ivermectin by the Merck Company for the onchocerciasis program, and donations of albendazole by SmithKline Beecham for treating lymphatic filariasis. The Nippon Foundation of Japan also funds the drugs used for leprosy treatment.", "WHO establishes time frames primarily to gain commitment and mobilize resources from endemic and donor countries. WHO bases time frame estimates on the technical feasibility of reaching target populations over a period of time and an assessment of the commitment of endemic and donor countries. As part of that assessment WHO considers the economic and political conditions in endemic countries that could affect their ability to carry out disease campaigns. As with costs, time frames for diseases expected to be eradicated or eliminated within 5 to 10 years are considered more accurate than for those with later target dates because of the unavailability of data and the difficulty of predicting commitment levels and country conditions over time.", "The following sections describe in more detail WHO\u2019s cost and time frame estimates for eradicating or eliminating each of the seven diseases."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Dracunculiasis (Guinea Worm Disease)", "paragraphs": ["WHO\u2019s cost estimate for eradicating dracunculiasis included data on each of the five key factors and appears to be sound.

WHO now expects that all countries except Nigeria and Sudan will be free of dracunculiasis by 2005 at the latest; assuming safe access to endemic areas and appropriate funding, WHO officials said this goal could be reached by 2002. WHO expects that transmission of the disease will be interrupted in Nigeria and Sudan by 2010, provided that safe access and funding conditions can be met.

The global effort to eradicate polio was formally launched in 1988, although many countries began polio vaccinations as part of the Expanded Programme on Immunization during the 1970s and 1980s. WHO relies on UNICEF for estimates of vaccine costs and uses its own estimates for the cost of vaccine delivery based on actual experience in countries around the world.", "While the World Health Assembly originally targeted polio for eradication by the year 2000, most experts we consulted said that polio is on track for eradication by 2002 and certification by 2005. However, some experts raised concern about whether less developed countries will maintain the required level of commitment to polio vaccinations and surveillance until eradication is achieved. In addition, a 1997 WHO report raised concerns about some countries\u2019 progress in meeting performance indicators for detecting and reporting acute flaccid paralysis, a key component of polio surveillance.

Endemic countries have made significant progress toward eliminating leprosy since the 1980s. However, WHO officials noted that it is possible that some countries with concentrated pockets of leprosy might need to continue campaigns beyond the target date of the year 2000 to reach the global leprosy elimination target of less than 1 case per 10,000 people.

While vaccine costs are well known and based on UNICEF data, WHO officials told us that their estimates did not include the costs of certifying measles eradication and that cost estimates for other factors were low or incomplete. Specifically, WHO officials noted that information on the number of children to be vaccinated is incomplete; administrative costs may be underestimated and are in need of further refinement, and assumptions regarding the efficacy of mass campaigns may be overstated; and assumptions regarding the costs of surveillance and monitoring are low because WHO did not account for inadequate health systems in some countries.", "Despite these limitations, WHO noted that the measles eradication estimates benefit from the experience of previous eradication efforts. The vaccine administration, surveillance, and certification costs utilize estimates from the polio eradication experience and are adjusted upward to account for difficulties in administering an injectable rather than an oral vaccine.", "Experts we consulted, including WHO officials, noted that there are unique challenges to eradicating measles within the estimated time frames. Measles is highly contagious, requiring even higher routine vaccination coverage than smallpox and polio. Special campaigns in varying age groups are also necessary to catch those still susceptible after vaccination because the vaccine is not 100 percent effective. Outbreaks can occur even in areas with high routine vaccination coverage. Injection safety is also a concern in the large-scale campaigns required for eradication, particularly in areas where the risk of infection with human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis is high. In addition, diagnosis is difficult because the symptoms can mimic other, less severe infections, and surveillance is difficult because the disease can spread rapidly while laboratory analysis and confirmation are undertaken. Finally, while measles is a major cause of mortality and morbidity for children in poorer countries, according to some experts we consulted, it is not perceived to be a major public health problem by some industrialized countries. As a result, unlike polio, some developed countries have not initiated the measles elimination efforts necessary to prepare for global eradication. More than half of the estimated cost of measles eradication is expected to be incurred by developed countries. WHO estimates that the lowest income countries will require up to $1.8 billion in external funding for measles eradication.", "At a February 1998 meeting in Atlanta, Georgia, over 200 disease eradication experts concluded that it is biologically plausible to eradicate measles with the current vaccine, noting that measles transmission appears to have been interrupted for variable time intervals in the Americas. According to a CDC summary of the meeting, participants recommended, among other things, that (1) developed countries proceed with measles elimination efforts as a step toward eradication; (2) less developed countries accelerate control efforts, particularly in areas with high mortality; and (3) experience from regional and country level interventions be used to refine the strategies for eventual eradication. Participants ranked measles as the disease most likely to be the next candidate for a global eradication effort. USAID officials told us that many participants, while agreeing on the technical feasibility of eradicating measles, also cautioned that further study should be undertaken to fully understand the magnitude of the effort and resources required for eradication.", "According to WHO and CDC, some areas are beginning to set regional elimination goals. In addition to the PAHO elimination goal for the year 2000, over 50 countries encompassing Europe and the Newly Independent States are in the final stages of adopting a goal of regional elimination by 2007, and the Eastern Mediterranean region has adopted an elimination goal of 2010."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Onchocerciasis (River Blindness)", "paragraphs": ["WHO\u2019s estimate for eliminating onchocerciasis is somewhat speculative. It incorporates data on all key cost elements\u2014including the costs for larvicides and drug treatment, delivery, and surveillance\u2014but data on the size of the target population are incomplete, which could affect the cost and time frame estimates. A control program covering 11 countries in West Africa has been in place for 24 years and has almost reached its elimination goal, and a program covering 6 countries in Latin America has been ongoing since 1991. Thus, the costs for these countries are well defined. However, WHO officials told us that the amount estimated for the other 19 endemic African countries of the African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC) is more speculative because WHO is still mapping the prevalence of the disease in this area. WHO\u2019s early estimates of the population eligible for treatment, upon which the APOC cost estimate was based, are low for some areas. The latest estimate for the population eligible for treatment in the APOC program is 42 million compared to the original estimate of 35 million. Due to the political unrest in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire), WHO does not have a reliable estimate of the number of people to be treated. However, according to WHO officials, this region is probably the first or second most infected area in the world. Experts generally agreed that the ongoing West Africa and Latin America programs are on schedule and onchocerciasis is likely to be eliminated as a public health problem within the cost and time frames estimated by WHO.

Like onchocerciasis, the cost and time frame estimates vary among several regional efforts. The program for the southern portion of South America has been underway since 1991, so data from this region are more complete and based on actual experience. However, the efforts in the Central American and Andean countries only began in 1997. Costs and time frames in these countries are less certain because three countries have not submitted cost estimates, and three countries have not submitted prevalence and incidence data.

WHO extrapolated actual program costs from the first four country programs to other countries and is continuing to develop more accurate estimates of costs based on further experience. In addition, WHO officials said that they have not completed country assessments to establish the number of people who must be treated in identified countries and to determine whether there are other endemic countries. Quantitative targets for defining elimination have not yet been established, but WHO plans to prepare a draft document with elimination definitions to be reviewed by an expert working group by the end of 1998. According to WHO, initial control programs show such dramatic results in reducing disease transmission that WHO believes that elimination may occur in a number of endemic areas (particularly island populations) after 5 to 6 years of effective control efforts.

As a donor, the United States currently funds the global polio eradication effort through CDC and USAID and indirectly through support of the Expanded Programme on Immunization.", "According to CDC, about 48 percent of domestic expenditures is for the cost of the oral polio vaccine and about 52 percent is for administrative costs. The U.S. polio schedule is four vaccine doses; until recently, most children received only the oral vaccine. For purposes of estimating savings to the United States with eradication, CDC estimates an additional $20 million a year may be incurred due to a 1996 CDC recommendation to administer two doses of the more expensive injectable vaccine before administering two doses of oral vaccine. Unlike the injectable polio vaccine, the oral vaccine is a live, attenuated vaccine that causes disease in several people each year in the United States. Providing the injectable vaccine first in the vaccine schedule will lessen the possibility of provoking disease from the oral vaccine. However, the oral vaccine is the vaccine of choice for eradication because, unlike the injectable vaccine, it prevents the wild poliovirus from readily multiplying in the gut and thus stops person-to-person transmission."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Measles", "paragraphs": ["The overall savings to the United States as a result of eradicating measles are estimated at a minimum of $61.7 million a year, including about $50 million for domestic vaccine costs and about $11.7 million for global measles control efforts. CDC estimates that it spent an additional $1.3 million on domestic measles research in 1997. The $50 million spent in the United States only includes the cost of the vaccine and not administration costs because immunization against measles is included in the vaccine for mumps and rubella, and the United States would continue administering mumps and rubella vaccines even if measles were eradicated. Therefore, projected savings are not as large as for the eradication of polio. Additional savings would be realized from preventing periodic measles epidemics in the United States; the last measles epidemic of 1989-91 cost $150 million, not including costs associated with lost productivity."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "U.S. Savings Associated With Achieving WHO\u2019s Goals on Other Diseases Are Limited", "paragraphs": ["For the other tropical diseases we reviewed, U.S. savings from eradication or elimination are estimated at about $25 million.

However, without eradication of the disease, it is likely that the United States would continue to have a small number of cases. USAID funds the dracunculiasis eradication effort at $500,000 a year and the onchocerciasis effort at $3.5 million a year. CDC spends about $1 million for overseas efforts against dracunculiasis, Chagas\u2019 disease, and onchocerciasis. Eradicating dracunculiasis and eliminating onchocerciasis, Chagas\u2019 disease, and lymphatic filariasis will remove or reduce the need for U.S. assistance. In addition, as previously discussed, U.S. blood banks may begin screening donated blood for Chagas\u2019 disease due to a significant number of infected Latin American immigrants in certain areas of the United States.

Diseases commonly mentioned include rubella, mumps, hepatitis B, and Hib. The ITFDE concluded that mumps and rubella could probably be eradicated and that the transmission of hepatitis B could be eliminated by universal vaccination. While these diseases generally meet the technical criteria for eradication, we discuss in the following paragraphs some of the challenges to initiating campaigns at this time and WHO\u2019s position on eradicating these diseases.", "CDC officials suggested that rubella and mumps could be considered candidates for eradication as part of a measles eradication effort, since they are often included as part of a trivalent vaccine against measles, mumps, and rubella. Their inclusion would result in significant increased savings to the United States because, without the eradication of rubella and mumps, most of the cost of the measles vaccination\u2014vaccine administration\u2014would continue to be incurred after measles eradication. CDC estimated U.S. savings from eradicating measles, mumps, and rubella at about $255.5 million a year. According to WHO and CDC officials, rubella constitutes a significant health burden in the form of birth defects and is being discussed as an elimination initiative for the Americas. As with polio and measles, a successful strategy in the Western Hemisphere would likely be a model for global eradication. Challenges to eradication are difficulties in diagnosis and the additional costs, particularly for developing countries. WHO said that, because the global burden of mumps is relatively low or unknown in some areas, the costs of an eradication effort would be difficult to justify.", "According to WHO and CDC officials, the viral disease hepatitis B may be a candidate for eventual eradication because the vaccine is effective and relatively inexpensive\u2014about 50 to 75 cents per dose. In addition, a good diagnostic tool is available and it appears that humans are the only reservoir for the disease. Hepatitis B is considered a major public health threat because it often progresses to cancer. Almost 1.2 million deaths result each year from hepatitis B, usually from liver cancer or chronic liver disease. The National Science and Technology Council and the National Institutes of Health estimate that the United States spends about $720 million each year in direct and indirect costs related to hepatitis B. CDC estimates that U.S. public and private sectors spend from $308 million to $383 million a year for hepatitis B vaccines alone. According to CDC officials and the ITFDE report, the major barrier to eradication is that it would take decades to achieve because some people are chronic carriers and would have to die before the disease could be considered eradicated.", "Hib is a bacterial infection that is the most common cause of childhood meningitis and, like hepatitis B, poses a serious global disease burden, including 400,000 to 700,000 deaths each year among children in developing countries. The U.S. public and private sectors spend about $162 million a year on Hib vaccines. According to CDC officials, this disease has potential for eradication but more needs to be known about the vaccine before it could be an eradication candidate. WHO has made Hib a priority for introduction to routine childhood immunization, but cost is a barrier. The vaccine costs $1 to $2 per dose, which would substantially increase the vaccine costs of the Expanded Programme on Immunization.", "According to WHO officials, due to the public health burden associated with rubella, hepatitis B, and Hib and the success in controlling the diseases in some parts of the world, these three diseases could be eventual candidates for eradication. However, WHO officials noted that, due to the high costs associated with eradication efforts, political will and popular support are as critical to any eradication effort as the technical ability to achieve success. As a result, they said that it is important to limit the number of ongoing efforts and that they do not support adding campaigns at this time. They noted that other diseases could be considered as eradication candidates after success with the currently targeted diseases is achieved.", "Other infectious diseases pose a growing threat to the United States but do not have characteristics that make them amenable to eradication. During congressional testimony last year, a WHO official noted several other diseases\u2014in addition to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)\u2014that continue to be major public health problems, globally and in the United States. For example, malaria, which results in about 500 million infections and 2 million to 3 million deaths outside the United States each year, is being imported into the United States about 1,000 times each year. In some instances, malaria is then transmitted locally by mosquitoes present in the United States. During 1996, a tourist to Latin America returned to Tennessee with yellow fever. According to the WHO witness, if mosquitoes in Tennessee had become infected with yellow fever from this patient, they could have caused an epidemic in the United States similar to the one that caused high mortality in the southern United States at the beginning of the 20th century. Outbreaks of dengue fever, another mosquito-borne disease, have occurred in more than 100 tropical and subtropical countries, including recent epidemics in Central America. WHO reported 138,000 deaths from dengue in 1996. There are about 8 million new cases worldwide of tuberculosis each year, a new infection every second, and 3 million deaths in 1996. Finally, influenza, a viral disease, causes between 10,000 and 40,000 deaths each year in the United States alone.", "These diseases are not likely candidates for eradication over the next generation for a variety of reasons, although it is possible to control disease transmission in some instances. According to the ITFDE, eradicating malaria has proven difficult due to the lack of an effective vaccine, resistance of some mosquitoes to insecticides, and resistance of some malaria parasites to treatment. Although an effective vaccine for yellow fever has been available for more than 50 years, it has only recently been standardized in freeze-dried form so that its stability, both in the freeze-dried and reconstituted form, resembles measles vaccine. According to WHO officials, the additional cost is proving a major constraint to having endemic countries include it in their routine childhood immunization programs. Yellow fever cannot be eradicated because humans are not the only reservoir for infection\u2014an animal reservoir also exists. No effective treatment is available for dengue fever; the primary intervention is mosquito control\u2014and a possible monkey reservoir for dengue infection is suspected. The need for improved diagnostic tests, chemotherapy, and vaccines is cited as obstacles to eradicating tuberculosis; emerging drug-resistant strains of the bacterium causing tuberculosis have complicated control programs. Finally, influenza reemerges worldwide each year in a new form and is highly infectious; the yearly vaccines are only partially effective. The ITFDE reported that an animal reservoir is also suspected for influenza."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Smallpox Eradication Showed That Success Was Possible", "paragraphs": ["According to the literature and experts with whom we met, the primary lesson learned from the smallpox initiative was that disease eradication can be technically feasible. The smallpox campaign provided valuable institutional knowledge on the role of community, national, and international mobilization. Eradicating smallpox also meant that costly programs for immunizations and treatment of infected cases were no longer needed. However, unlike most of the diseases that are currently candidates for eradication, smallpox had unique characteristics that made it particularly vulnerable to eradication and therefore has limitations as a model for current efforts.", "As the first and only disease to be eradicated through human intervention, smallpox is used as evidence that disease eradication is technically feasible. According to some experts, the smallpox effort yielded lessons that have since been applied to other disease control and health care efforts, such as the role of surveillance and the ability to garner resources for massive campaigns.", "The considerable amounts spent on smallpox prevention and treatment ceased after eradication, resulting in considerable savings. Using 1967 estimated smallpox costs as a baseline measure for savings from smallpox eradication and adjusting for annual birth rates, we estimated the cumulative present value global savings in 1997 dollars for the post-eradication period 1978-97 at $168 billion. This amount included vaccinations, treatment, and loss of economic productivity for developing countries. For the United States, cumulative savings from smallpox eradication are estimated at $17 billion. The United States spent about $610 million in 1997 dollars for domestic smallpox control in 1968 and about $130 million in 1997 dollars during 1968-77 on the overseas eradication effort. We estimated the annual real rate of return for the United States at about 46 percent per year since smallpox was eradicated.", "Smallpox had the characteristics that experts consider desirable for eradication. The disease was easily diagnosed, and all infections resulted in visible symptoms. The smallpox vaccine was effective with only one dose, stable in heat, and inexpensive. Polio and measles share many of the desirable eradication characteristics of smallpox, including being viral agents with human-only reservoirs, having effective interventions available to interrupt transmission, and providing long-lasting immunity after vaccination. However, certain differences exist. For example, smallpox was less infectious than either polio or measles. Polio is difficult to diagnose without laboratory confirmation because the vast majority of infections show no symptoms, and the paralytic manifestations of polio can be due to other causes. In addition, while the oral vaccine is easy to administer and does not always require trained health workers, up to four doses are recommended, and the vaccine is sensitive to heat, requiring refrigeration until administered.", "Similarly, measles is not as easily diagnosed as smallpox and is much more infectious.

Simply using a water filter and keeping infected persons out of the water supply can stop transmission of the disease.

For effective surveillance, cases should be identified prior to worm emergence or within 24 hours after the worm appears. Due to the intense pain as the worm emerges, victims often put their foot in the nearest water source, thereby releasing the larvae back into the water to reproduce and continue the contamination. Once a case is identified, containment measures are initiated, the wound is bandaged to help prevent further transmission, and the patient is advised to avoid contact with stagnant water. The community is educated regarding prevention and containment and encouraged to filter or boil drinking water. According to WHO, this strategy has proven very effective and has been implemented in almost all endemic villages, except in Sudan.

As it multiplies, the virus destroys the motor neurons that activate muscles. These nerve cells cannot be regenerated, and the affected muscles no longer function. Muscle pain, spasms, and fever are associated with the rapid onset of acute flaccid paralysis. In the most severe cases, poliovirus attacks the motor neurons of the brain stem, reducing breathing capacity and causing difficulty in swallowing and speaking. Without adequate respiratory support, this type of polio can result in death by asphyxiation.", "Although paralysis is the most visible sign of polio infection, less than 1 percent of polio infections result in paralysis. About 90 percent of cases produce either no or mild symptoms and usually go unrecognized. The remaining cases involve mild, flu-like symptoms common to other viral infections but do not result in paralysis. About 5 to 10 percent of all polio infections result in aseptic meningitis, a viral inflammation of the outer covering of the brain. There are no animal or insect reservoirs or long-term human carriers.

Because it is often difficult to tell whether a case of acute flaccid paralysis is caused by polio, WHO recommends laboratory-based surveillance in addition to collecting clinical and epidemiological information. Early detection and testing are essential because the highest concentrations of the virus are found during the first 2 weeks after the onset of paralysis. Precise information on the patterns of poliovirus spread is considered essential in developing strategies for global eradication.

It is highly contagious and requires high immunization coverage rates that are difficult to achieve, even in the most developed countries.

However, experts at WHO, PAHO, and CDC believe that strategies that provide at least two doses of vaccine to each child can overcome this challenge.", "The timing of immunization also presents special difficulties. Vaccinating infants under 12 months is less effective due to the presence of maternal antibodies and hastens the accumulation of susceptible preschool aged children. The PAHO strategy and experience in the United States demonstrate that vaccinating at 12 to 15 months or switching to a two-dose schedule provides immunity more effectively. However, vaccinating those under 12 months has substantially reduced measles incidence in this group, in which mortality from this disease is the highest.", "Some experts express concern that use of the PAHO strategy as a model may not work globally or will require modifications to allow for less favorable country conditions. They point out that high immunization coverage and surveillance have been successful in the Americas due to the relatively advanced state of the health, transportation, and communications infrastructure in these countries compared with the infrastructure of the least developed countries. Good surveillance systems allow PAHO countries to calculate the number of susceptible children and target campaigns accordingly. Some experts remain doubtful that such high coverage and good surveillance can be achieved in the least developed countries with much weaker infrastructure. WHO officials agreed that sustaining a measles eradication campaign in the poorest countries will be a challenge.", "In addition to technical challenges, political commitment in selected industrialized countries and adequate donor support for low-income countries remain uncertain. While measles is a major childhood killer among the poor, it is often perceived as a mild illness, and many industrialized countries do not consider the disease a major public health threat. This perception can inhibit the public and political support for allocating the resources needed for a successful eradication effort. Accordingly, immunization coverage and surveillance systems in many areas, including industrialized countries, are inadequate to interrupt transmission. The measles strains that enter the United States, for example, largely do not originate in less developed countries. Most measles strains imported into the United States come from France, Germany, Japan, and Italy, according to CDC. However, according to WHO and CDC officials, support for measles eradication is increasing. For example, the more than 50 countries encompassing WHO\u2019s region for Europe and the former Soviet Union are in the final stages of adopting a goal of regional elimination by 2007, and WHO\u2019s Eastern Mediterranean region has adopted an elimination goal by 2010.", "Despite the challenges to measles eradication, WHO and CDC officials believe that a global measles eradication strategy should be pursued based on the burden of the disease and the technical feasibility of eradication. They point out that similar skepticism existed before and during the early years of the smallpox and polio eradication initiatives. Several global meetings on measles, sponsored primarily by WHO, PAHO, UNICEF, and CDC, have been held in recent years to discuss challenges and build consensus on eradication. At the most recent meeting of about 200 public health experts in February 1998, measles was identified as the leading candidate for the next global eradication initiative due to its biological feasibility, high mortality and complications among children, effective interventions, demonstrated feasibility in the Americas, increasing global support, and potential cost benefits.

The clinical manifestations of the disease include formation of nodules under the skin, changes in skin pigmentation, loss of skin elasticity, debilitation, severe itching, visual loss, and blindness. A World Bank study for calculating the net benefits of the Onchocerciasis Control Programme in West Africa assumed that people who become blind due to the disease live another  8 years with blindness and die 12 years prematurely, thus indicating that preventing one case of blindness can add 20 years of productive life.", "Humans are the only known host for the disease. The parasite is transmitted between humans by the bite of blackflies, which breed in streams and rivers. When a fly bites an infected human host, the fly becomes infected with the larvae of Onchocerca volvulus. When the infected fly bites another human, the larvae may develop into adult worms (macrofilariae) in the human, producing offspring, or microfilariae. These microfilariae may in turn be ingested by other blackflies, thus continuing the transmission. A human is infectious to the blackfly only when microfilariae are present; the adult worm is not transmitted. However, the adult worms usually live about 12 to 15 years inside the body and generally keep reproducing microfilariae for much of that time if not treated.", "Although onchocerciasis is considered nonfatal, it is the second leading cause of infectious blindness and the source of enormously debilitating skin disease. WHO estimates that 120 million people are at risk and that 18 million are infected. Blindness afflicts about 270,000 persons, and about 500,000 suffer visual impairment. Severe itching and dermatitis affect about 6 million. Onchocerciasis is suspected to be endemic in 30 countries of sub-Saharan Africa, in Yemen, and in 6 countries in Latin America. Because the disease is endemic in fertile river valleys, it has had significant socioeconomic impact over the years as residents have abandoned villages with arable land and moved to more arid areas. The first onchocerciasis control program in West Africa has resulted in people beginning to resettle in lands that have been deserted for as long as 50 to 100 years, resulting in increased income levels. Twenty-five million hectares have been opened for resettlement and cultivation, an area that can feed a population of about 17 million people."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Strategy for Elimination", "paragraphs": ["Two specific elimination strategies have been implemented: controlling the vector (blackfly) in endemic areas and treating infected persons with ivermectin. Vector control is accomplished through the use of larvicide in rivers and streams, mostly by helicopter spraying, and aims at interrupting disease transmission. The drug ivermectin kills the microfilariae, thus arresting further development of the disease. It has a very limited effect, if any, on killing the adult worms. Treatment with ivermectin once a year is considered sufficient to prevent blindness. Ivermectin treatment reduces transmission of the parasite but does not appear to halt it. Annual, large-scale treatment will therefore have to continue for a long time. Current predictions based on a simulation model indicate that annual treatment at the current level of coverage may have to continue for about 1-1/2 to 2 decades, although elimination of the disease as a public health problem is likely to occur before the full treatment regimen is complete.

Another unknown is whether people will continue to come for treatment after their condition improves, but WHO officials do not see this as a problem at this time. It is also uncertain whether the parasite will develop resistance to ivermectin.

Normally, humans become infected following the insect\u2019s bite, but the contaminated feces may also enter through the mucous membrane when a child rubs or scratches a bite then touches his or her eyes or mouth. The parasite may also be transmitted from human to human through transfusions of contaminated blood or through congenital transmission from an infected mother to the fetus. The insect favors poverty conditions, normally living in the cracks of poorly built or decaying housing.", "The acute phase of Chagas\u2019 disease appears shortly after infection and often has no distinctive symptoms. It can be characterized by inflammation at the site of the infection and flu-like symptoms. If the parasite is introduced into the eye, conjunctivitis and swelling of the eye area develops. A characteristic lesion may also develop, but often the disease goes unnoticed and undiagnosed during this period. However, it is during the early phase of the infection\u2014lasting only a few weeks\u2014that the parasite can be seen in the blood and that the disease may be curable with the drugs nifurtimox or benznidazole. Once the acute phase has passed, the parasite moves into tissue and cannot be treated. About one-third of those infected will develop chronic conditions, especially heart disease. Chronic cardiopathy occurs in 27 percent of those infected, chronic digestive lesions in 6 percent, and neurological disorders in 3 percent. Patients with severe chronic disease become progressively sick and ultimately die, usually from heart failure.", "Prevalence of Chagas\u2019 disease is limited to the Americas.

In the Southern Cone countries, the insect mainly lives in the cracks of poorly constructed housing and not outside the home. In these countries, the use of insecticides and other vector control measures are reducing infection significantly. In northern South America and in Central America, the insect can live in housing and outside in other diverse habitats.

The adult worms, or macrofilariae, settle into the lymphatic system and mature over a period of 3 to 15 months. When fertilized, female adults produce large numbers of larvae known as microfilariae, which invade the blood stream. Mosquitoes can then ingest them when they bite an infected human and transmit the microfilariae to other people, in whom they pass through a larval sequence to become new adults. The vast majority of microfilariae remain in the body as immature forms for 6 months to 2 years, growing up to a third of a millimeter in length and doing immense damage. The adult macrofilariae can grow to several centimeters long, damaging the lymphatic ducts. Humans are the only hosts of the most common forms of filariasis.", "The infection causes a very severe pathology of the lymph system. This can result in elephantiasis, a condition in which one or more limbs becomes grossly swollen and covered with sores; in hydrocele, a grotesque enlargement of the male scrotum; or in lymphoedema in women, in which their breasts or genitals are grossly swollen.

The optimal treatment regimens that result in almost complete elimination of microfilaria-stage parasites from the blood (thus blocking transmission by vector mosquitoes) involve two drugs administered concurrently (either albendazole or DEC plus ivermectin) given once yearly over a period of 4 to 6 years. According to WHO, experimental observations in the field indicate that such yearly regimens are effective in interrupting transmission. An alternative treatment is the substitution of regular table salt with DEC-fortified salt for 1 to 2 years. This strategy also decreases blood microfilaria numbers to very low levels and has been shown in large-scale control programs to be effective in interrupting transmission.", "The treatment programs are largely community based.
