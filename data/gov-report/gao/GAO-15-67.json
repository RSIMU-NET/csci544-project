In 2013, federal banking regulators adopted regulations to implement the Basel III-based capital standards in the United States, which generally apply to U.S. bank holding companies and banks and are being phased in through 2019.

GAO's analyses of financial data for the first quarter of 2014 indicate the vast majority of bank holding companies and banks currently meet the new minimum capital ratios and capital conservation buffer (an additional capital requirement) at the fully phased-in levels required by 2019. GAO estimated that less than 10 percent of the bank holding companies collectively would need to raise less than $5 billion in total additional capital to cover the capital shortfall. Banks with a shortfall tended to be small, with less than $1 billion in assets. The empirical research GAO reviewed suggests that higher regulatory capital requirements will have a modest effect on the cost and availability of credit. Similarly, GAO's economic analysis indicates that raising the additional capital would lead to a modest decline in lending and a modest increase in loan rates. According to officials from the eight community banks GAO interviewed, they do not anticipate any difficulties meeting the capital requirements but expect to incur additional compliance costs. Officials from the 10 global systemically important banks that GAO interviewed said they have been incurring significant costs to comply with the new requirements, but three said that U.S. minimum capital ratios for Basel III tend not to be the binding capital constraint. Most of these bank officials said they expect the requirements to improve the resilience of the banking system.", "Jurisdictional differences in the implementation of the Basel III capital standards have arisen, but their competitive effect on internationally active banks is unclear. Basel III serves, in part, to limit competitive disparities due to differences in capital standards, but there are limitations to full harmonization. For example, the Basel capital standards have no legal force; rather, members of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) developed and agreed to the standards, with the expectation that each member will implement them. Thus, jurisdictions may adopt requirements more or less stringent than the minimum standards. Almost all Basel Committee members report having adopted rules to implement the Basel III capital requirements. To help promote a level regulatory playing field, the Basel Committee began conducting reviews in 2012 to assess whether each member's implementation meets the Basel III minimum standards and whether implementation produced consistent outcomes across jurisdictions. These reviews found the rules of the seven members it assessed to date to be generally compliant. However, the Basel Committee's other reviews identified some inconsistencies in how banks across different jurisdictions calculated their risk-weighted assets. As was the case with Basel II implementation, some banks and others are concerned about jurisdictional differences in the implementation of Basel III and their effect on competition. For example, some jurisdictions are subjecting certain of their banks to capital or leverage requirements above the Basel III minimums or exempting banks from certain capital requirements. Because Basel III's implementation is ongoing, the extent to which the differences collectively will affect competition among internationally active banks is unclear. In addition, other factors can affect the competitive position of internationally active banks, such as differences in accounting treatment, cost of capital, and tax rules across jurisdictions."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The 2007-2009 financial crisis revealed that many banking organizations  lacked capital of sufficient quality and quantity to absorb substantial   Capital reassures an institution\u2019s depositors, creditors, and  losses.counterparties that unanticipated losses or decreased earnings will not  impair the institution\u2019s ability to protect the savings of depositors, repay  creditors, or fulfill their obligations to counterparties.

Adopted in 1988, the Basel Capital Accord (Basel I) aimed to  measure capital adequacy (that is, whether a bank\u2019s capital is sufficient to  support its activities) and establishes minimum capital standards for  internationally active banks. It consists of three basic elements: a target minimum total risk-based capital ratio (the ratio of regulatory  capital, the numerator, to risk-weighted assets, the denominator) of 8  percent and tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4 percent, a definition of capital instruments to constitute the numerator of the  capital-to-risk weighted assets ratio, and a system of risk weights for calculating the denominator of the ratio.", "A bank\u2019s risk-based capital ratio is the ratio of its regulatory capital to risk- weighted assets. Regulatory capital is the numerator of the ratio and risk-  weighted assets constitute the denominator. In calculating a total risk- weighted asset figure, a bank\u2019s total value of each asset is multiplied by a  percentage reflecting its risk level and this adjusted amount is added  across all assets. At a high level, the standardized approach to  calculating risk-weighted assets involves multiplying the amount of the  asset or exposure by the standardized risk weight (percent) associated  with that type of asset or exposure. For example, a $1 million mortgage  with a 50 percent risk-weighting would generate a risk-weighted asset of  $500,000. If a bank were trying to hold capital equal to 10 percent of its  risk-weighted asset, then it would need $50,000 of capital to hold against  this mortgage. Bank capital rules prescribe the standardized risk weights  and reflect regulatory judgment about the riskiness of an asset type or  exposure. Holding equity (or the numerator) constant, a higher  standardized risk weight results in a higher risk-weighted asset amount,  which gives rise to a lower risk-based capital ratio. Over time, bank  regulators realized that Basel I was not providing a sufficiently accurate  measure of capital adequacy because of the lack of risk sensitivity in its  credit risk weightings, financial market innovations such as securitization  and credit derivatives, and advancements in banks\u2019 risk measurement  and risk management techniques. The accord was revised and enhanced  multiple times after 1988 because of its shortcomings. For example,  Basel I was amended in 1996 to take explicit account of market risk in  trading accounts.", "Basel II.

Basel II includes a standardized approach (which  does not rely on banks\u2019 internal models) and advanced approaches for  measuring credit and operational risks. The advanced approaches  generally are applied by large internationally active banks. The advanced  approaches for credit risk and operational risk use parameters from a  bank\u2019s internal systems as inputs into a formula that supervisors  developed for calculating risk-based capital ratios. In addition, banks with  significant trading assets (which banks use to hedge risks or speculate on  price changes in markets for themselves or their customers) must  calculate capital for market risk using internal models. The advanced  approaches allow some bank holding companies to reduce capital from  Basel I. Large internationally active U.S. bank holding companies have  been implementing the first phase\u2014known as the parallel run\u2014of the  Basel II advanced approaches. As of February 21, 2014, eight  advanced approaches bank holding companies had exited their parallel  run, and the Federal Reserve and OCC jointly permitted them to use the  advanced approaches to determine their risk-based capital requirements  subject to the Collins Amendment floor. Banking organizations in most  other industrialized countries are subject to the Basel II capital standards.

Adopted in 2010 and revised in 2011 and 2013, Basel III aims  to improve the banking sector\u2019s ability to absorb shocks arising from  financial and economic stress, whatever the source; improve risk  management and governance; and strengthen banks\u2019 transparency and  disclosures. The reforms address bank-level, or micro-prudential,  regulation to enhance the resilience of individual banking institutions in  periods of stress and systemwide risks that can build up across the  banking sector and the amplification of these risks over time. Basel III  significantly changes the risk-based capital standards for banks and bank  holding companies and introduces new leverage and liquidity standards.  Liquidity is a measure of the ability and ease with which assets can be  converted to cash.", "More specifically, the new standards include a new minimum common equity tier 1 capital requirement of 4.5  percent of risk-weighted assets (the capital needed to be regarded as  a viable concern); a new capital conservation buffer of more than 2.5 percent of common  equity tier 1 capital to provide a cushion to help companies remain  above the 4.5 percent minimum during financial shocks and to avoid  restrictions on distributions and discretionary bonus payments; and more stringent risk-weights on certain types of risky assets,  particularly securitizations and derivatives.", "Basel III defines capital more narrowly than the previous accords.

However,  equity returns, debt interest rates, and tax rates may change, altering the  relative prices of debt and equity and thus altering the change in funding  costs associated with substituting equity for debt. Finally, our estimates  assume that the return on equity will not change when a bank holding  company or depository institution increases its capital ratio. However,  increasing reliance on equity funding reduces the risks to investors, all  else being equal. If a bank holding company or depository institution  increased its ratio of capital to assets, then the return on its equity could  fall as investors demanded less of a risk premium.", "Although the U.S. Basel III capital requirements may have little impact on  the capital level and structure of most banking organizations, their full  impact remains uncertain. The capital regulations will be phased in over  multiple years and Basel III is but one of a multitude of regulatory reforms  affecting banking organizations. The higher regulatory capital ratios may  increase the amount of capital banks hold (if they have to hold more  capital than they otherwise would have held based on their assessment of  economic risk), which could increase their funding costs. The increase in  funding costs may result if holding higher capital meant that bank  investors, were not willing to accept a lower return on equity. In addition,  banking organizations will incur compliance costs, such as for additional  staff training and expenses related to new systems or modification of  existing systems for calculating regulatory capital ratios and for  recordkeeping and reporting. For example, in the interim final rule, FDIC  estimated that each bank with $175 million or less in total assets will incur  $43,000 in direct compliance costs, which it concluded would represent a  significant burden for about 37 percent of these banks.approaches banks, only one included any compliance cost information in  its annual report, indicating it devoted thousands of staff hours to comply  with Basel requirements."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Empirical Research Indicates U.S. Basel III Capital Requirements Are Expected to Have a Modest Effect on the Cost and Availability of Credit", "paragraphs": ["We discuss below our review of empirical studies and our quantitative  analysis the effects of Basel III requirements on the cost and availability  of credit."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Empirical Studies We Reviewed Indicate Higher Regulatory Capital Requirements Negatively Affect the Cost and Availability of Credit", "paragraphs": ["Some banks and others generally maintain that equity is more expensive  than debt; thus, higher capital requirements will raise their funding costs.

In contrast, two non-empirical studies maintain  that higher capital costs will not increase bank funding costs, because the  increase in capital will make banks safer and cause investors to accept a  lower return.", "We reviewed 11 studies\u2014published from 2011 through 2014\u2014that  empirically examine the effects of higher capital requirements on banks  (or lenders), including on cost of capital and the cost and availability of  credit. To identify relevant empirical studies, we conducted searches of two databases, (ProQuest and EconLit) and identified and selected  economic studies from peer-reviewed journals and working papers from  governmental institutions that were published from 2011 through 2014.  We used search terms for selecting the studies, such as interest rate  spread, credit availability, cost of capital, and partial equilibrium. The  results of the studies generally indicate that higher capital ratios\u2014both  tier 1 capital and common equity tier 1 capital ratios\u2014in the United States  will result in a modest increase in the cost of capital for banks and loan  rates for borrowers and a modest decrease in the quantity of loans for  banks. However, the studies also noted that capital requirements are one  of several policies that can affect the cost and availability of credit. Some  of the studies analyze the effect of capital requirements in other countries,  which helps put the estimated effect of Basel III in the United States into a  broader perspective.", "Bank funding cost. Two studies examining the effect of higher capital  requirements on the capital costs of banks generally found that raising  capital requirements will increase the capital costs of banks. One of the  studies estimated that increasing the common equity tier 1 capital ratio by  1.3 percentage point would increase the cost of capital for large banks in  the United States by 0.13 percentage point. The study covered eight  countries, and the estimates ranged from 0.00 percentage points  (Canada) to 0.26 percentage points (Japan). The other study estimated  that a 10 percentage point increase in the tier 1 ratio would increase the  cost of capital in the United States between 0.60 and 0.90 percentage  points. These results generally are consistent with our analysis, in which  we estimated that the increase in funding cost associated with a 1  percentage point increase in the ratio of capital to assets was from about  0.07 to 0.09 percentage points as of the first quarter of 2014 (see app. II).", "Cost of borrowing. Nine studies examining the effect of higher capital  requirements on loan rates had results ranging from no effect to an  increase in loan rates. The studies generated estimates of the effect of  higher capital requirements on borrower costs, with some covering  multiple countries in North and South America, Europe, or Asia.  Two  studies covering the United States estimated that a 1 percentage point  increase in capital requirements would increase bank lending rates by a  0.12 percentage point and 0.21 percentage point, respectively. The  other two studies that covered the United States estimated that a 1.3 and  2.0 percentage point increase in capital requirements would increase  bank lending rates by a 0.17 percentage point and 0.51 percentage point,  respectively. In comparison, the studies covering other countries  estimated that a 1 percentage point increase in capital requirements  would increase bank lending rates around 0.04 to 0.25 percentage points  (and a 1.3 percentage point increase would increase bank lending rates  from 0.0 to 0.34 percentage points).", "Quantity of loans. Four of the studies examining the effect of higher  regulatory capital requirements on the availability of credit found that  higher requirements would reduce the quantity of loans supplied, but the  estimated effect varied across the studies.

Two of the  studies covered the United States and estimated that a 1.3 percentage  point increase in common equity tier 1 capital or 2.0 percentage point  increase in tier 1 capital ratio\u2014will decrease the quantity of loans by 2.97  percent and 8.71 percent, respectively. In comparison, one of the  studies also covered countries in Asia, Europe, and North America and  estimated that a 1.3 percentage point increase in regulatory capital  requirements will decrease the quantity of loans in these countries, but  the estimates vary across countries\u2014ranging from a 0.16 percent decline  to a 32.61 percent decline."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Raising the Amount of the Capital Shortfall under U.S. Basel III Regulations Likely Would Have a Modest Effect on the Cost and Availability of Credit", "paragraphs": ["Like the studies we reviewed, our analysis suggests that raising capital to  cover the capital shortfall would have a modest effect on the cost and  availability of credit in both the short and the long run. As discussed  previously, the total amount of capital that bank holding companies and  depository institutions would need to raise to cover the capital shortfall  and meet the new minimum capital ratios would be small relative to total  assets, likely less than 1 percent. In addition, most bank holding  companies and depository institutions do not appear to need to raise  capital to meet minimum requirements. For those that do, the amount of  capital they need to raise appears to be small relative to total assets in  some cases but could be large in others. To assess the short-run impact  on the cost and availability of credit for bank holding companies or  depository institutions raising capital to meet minimum requirements, we  used (1) estimates of changes in loan volumes and loan spreads  associated with changes in capital from our prior work and (2) our  estimates of the capital shortfall described above. To assess the long- run impact, we used an existing loan pricing model.", "The short-run impact of meeting the new capital requirements on the cost  and availability of credit likely would be small. In prior work, we estimated  that a 1 percentage point increase in the ratio of capital to assets is  associated with a short-run increase in loan spreads of about 0.16  percentage points and a short-run decline in loan volume growth of about  1.2 percentage points. Our analysis of the capital shortfall suggests that  bank holding companies would need to increase total capital by about  0.03 percent of total assets to meet the new minimum total capital ratio  plus the capital conservation buffer. If bank holding companies raised the  capital to cover the shortfall in a single quarter, these estimates suggest  that covering the capital shortfall would lead to an increase in loan  spreads of less than 0.01 percentage points and a decline in loan volume  growth of less than 1 percentage point.", "Our estimates also suggest that the long-run impact of meeting the new  capital requirements on the cost and availability of credit also likely would  be small. To assess the potential impact on loan rates, we used an  existing loan pricing model that captures key determinants of loan rates in  the long run, including funding costs, credit spreads, and administrative  costs. As discussed above, funding costs for bank holding companies and  depository institutions that increase equity capital to meet Basel III  minimum capital ratios could increase. Bank holding companies and  depository institutions can respond to changes in their funding costs in  several ways, including raising loan rates, shifting lending activity to  lower-risk borrowers, and increasing efficiency. If bank holding companies  and depository institutions that have to raise capital covered their  increased funding costs solely by increasing their lending rates, our  estimates of the funding cost changes are indicative of the amounts by  which lending rates at these institutions would increase\u2014generally less  than 0.3 percentage points. However, some factors may cause lending  rates to increase by less than this amount. The extent to which bank  holding companies and depository institutions can raise lending rates is  limited by the amount of competition they face from other lenders\u2014 including lenders that already hold sufficient capital\u2014as well as other  factors. Thus, bank holding companies and depository institutions that  need to raise capital may cover their increased funding costs by other  means in addition to, or instead of, raising lending rates. For example,  they could increase lending to lower risk borrowers and reduce lending to  higher risk borrowers in order to reduce credit spreads, or they could  reduce salaries or employ fewer people to lower administrative costs. In  this case, lending rates would increase by less than the amount that  funding costs increase.", "Our estimates of the impact of meeting the new capital requirements on  the cost and availability of credit are subject to limitations and should be  interpreted with caution. As discussed, our estimates of capital shortfall  and the increase in funding costs associated with raising capital to  eliminate the shortfall are subject to important limitations that could lead  us to overstate or understate them. Because the change in lending rates  is related to both the capital shortfall and the associated increase in  funding costs, it too may be overstated or understated. For example, if  bank holding companies or depository institutions maintain a capital  buffer in excess of the minimum amount of capital required, then the  increase in lending rates likely will be greater than our estimates of the  increase. In addition, past macroeconomic and credit market conditions  heavily influence the methodology we used to estimate the short-run  response of loan spreads and loan volume growth to changes in the ratio  of capital to assets, so the estimates may not apply to future periods if  macroeconomic and credit market conditions were significantly different.  Furthermore, the model we used to estimate the long-run response of  loan rates to changes in the ratio of capital to assets may not reflect all of  the determinants of loan rates."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Some Market Participants Generally Expect U.S. Capital Requirements to Increase Compliance Costs but Have a Limited Effect on the Cost and Availability of Credit", "paragraphs": ["Although their views are not indicative of the banking industry as a whole,  bank officials we interviewed generally expected that they would be able  to meet new capital requirements, their compliance costs would increase,  and effects of the requirements on credit would not be large.

To be able to pay dividends to shareholders, the G-SIBs  must meet the capital requirements set under CCAR.

But none  of the U.S. G-SIBs could provide us with a precise estimate of their  compliance costs, in part because Basel III implementation has been  done in conjunction with other regulatory reforms, such as the Dodd- Frank Act, and in part because staffs from many departments were  involved in implementation.

The  Basel capital standards have no legal force; rather, the Basel Committee  members developed and agreed to the standards, with the expectation  that each member will implement them. According to the Basel  Committee, it encourages convergence towards common standards and  monitors their implementation, but does not attempt detailed  harmonization of members\u2019 supervisory approaches. The standards are  minimum requirements, and members may adopt more stringent  standards. Moreover, as jurisdictions amend their laws or regulations (or  both) to implement the Basel III standards, they will need to fit the  standards within their existing legal framework, regulatory system, or  industry structure. As the Basel capital standards periodically have been  revised and implemented, regulators, banks, and others have raised  concerns about regulatory differences between jurisdictions and their  possible competitive effects. For example, in 2007 and 2008, we reported  on such concerns arising from the U.S. implementation of Basel II.", "Importantly, internationally active banks can be subject not only to their  home-country Basel III regulations but also their host-country Basel III  regulations, such as through their foreign subsidiaries. As a result, such  banks may need to create systems that take into account different  regulatory regimes and approaches. However, according to four G-SIBs  we spoke with, all transactions completed by an internationally active  bank are consolidated ultimately at the parent company for capital  purposes. In turn, the parent company must calculate its capital ratios  based on its home-country\u2019s capital regulations. If Basel III regulations  are more stringent in the United States than in other countries,  internationally active U.S. banks could be required to hold higher levels of  regulatory capital than their foreign counterparts, and banks and some  law firms have noted that this could potentially put internationally active  U.S. banks at a competitive disadvantage. However, regulators and some  academics have noted that enhanced capital requirements could  decrease systemic risk in the banking system or increase investor  confidence, potentially providing banks holding relatively more capital with  a competitive advantage.", "Although Basel III implementation is ongoing and will not be completed  for years, some banks, regulators, and law firms (in publications we  reviewed) have identified a number of implementation differences  between jurisdictions that may create competitive disparities. Many of  these differences have resulted from jurisdictions imposing more stringent  requirements than the Basel III minimum standards, which could put their  banking organizations at a competitive disadvantage. Basel III\u2019s  implementation is a multistep process that includes the adoption of the  standards by jurisdictions through changes in law or regulations,  compliance with the law or regulations by market participants, and the  oversight and supervision of the laws or regulations by national  regulators. To date, differences initially identified by market participants  and observers have focused on the different ways that jurisdictions have  adopted the standards in their regulations, including the following:", "Additional capital buffers: The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory  Authority designed its capital regulations to impose a variable  progressive capital buffer of up to 6 percent of risk-weighted assets on  two Swiss G-SIBs. The overall higher capital requirements reflect the  regulator\u2019s prudential philosophy that Switzerland\u2019s capital adequacy  regulations should go beyond the international minimum standards.  As UBS reported in its 2013 annual report, this requirement could  harm Swiss banks when they compete against peer financial  institutions subject to more lenient regulation. Similarly, the Bank of  England\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority plans to implement a firm- specific buffer that could require certain banks to hold regulatory  capital above the Basel III framework\u2019s minimum standards.", "Credit valuation adjustment: Basel III included a new capital charge  (the credit valuation adjustment) under which a bank must hold  additional capital when entering into an over-the-counter derivatives  transaction not cleared through a central counterparty. According to  market participants we interviewed and law firm documents, the EU  has diverged from Basel III (and the U.S. adoption of Basel III) by  exempting transactions from the capital charge where such  transactions are between EU-based banks and a nonfinancial  corporate, sovereign, or for a limited period, pension fund. According  to officials from three G-SIBs we interviewed, the exemption enables  European banks to price derivative transactions to such  counterparties more favorably than their non-EU competitors. Officials  from one of the banks told us that the price difference could be a key  factor in determining if customers transacted with U.S. versus  European banks, but price was not necessarily the only factor that  customers considered.", "Enhanced supplementary leverage ratio: U.S. banking regulators  established a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 3 percent for  advanced approaches banks, consistent with Basel III. However, the  regulators established an enhanced supplementary leverage ratio for  top-tier bank holding companies with more than $700 billion in total  consolidated assets or more than $10 trillion in assets under custody  and in their subsidiary depository institutions. This enhanced ratio  raised the standards above the Basel III minimum standards. Under  the final rule, such subsidiary insured depository institutions must  maintain an enhanced supplementary ratio of at least 6 percent to be  well capitalized under the prompt corrective action framework, and the  bank holding companies must maintain a buffer of more than 2  percent above the minimum supplementary leverage ratio  requirement of 3 percent to avoid restrictions on capital distributions  and discretionary bonus payments. According to an industry  association and bank we interviewed, the leverage requirement will  disadvantage such U.S. banking organizations by requiring them to  maintain higher capital than their competitors in other jurisdictions.  However, U.S. banking regulators view a strong regulatory capital  base as a competitive strength for banking organizations, rather than  a competitive weakness.", "Collins Amendment: In the U.S. Basel III capital regulations, federal  banking regulators implemented section 171 of the Dodd-Frank Act  (the Collins Amendment) which requires advanced approaches  banking organizations to calculate their risk-based capital ratios under  both the advanced approaches and the standardized approach  (minimum risk-based capital requirements), among other capital  requirements. The banks then must use the lower of each capital ratio  to determine compliance with minimum capital requirements.  According to a law firm\u2019s analysis, the rule eliminates capital relief that  large U.S. banks might otherwise obtain using their internal models  under the advanced approaches and may provide certain  internationally active foreign banks with a competitive advantage.  Additionally, officials from three U.S. G-SIBs generally told us that the  Collins Amendment could require them to hold more regulatory capital  than their foreign competitors and put them at a competitive  disadvantage.", "Liquidity coverage ratio: Basel III includes the liquidity coverage  ratio as an internationally harmonized quantitative liquidity standard,  with the goal of promoting the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk  profile of internationally active banking organizations. Although at the  time we spoke with the G-SIBs, U.S. banking regulators had not  finalized their proposed rule implementing Basel III\u2019s liquidity  coverage ratio, officials from four G-SIBs said the proposed rule  included requirements more stringent than the Basel III liquidity  standards, including a narrower range of assets that qualified as high- quality liquid assets and a faster assumed rate of outflows for  wholesale funding. They said the rule, as proposed, would require  them to hold more liquid assets than their foreign competitors, which  would be more costly for them. The U.S. banking regulators noted in  the proposed rule and final rule that there were modifications to Basel  III\u2019s liquidity coverage ratio to reflect characteristics and risks of  specific aspects of the U.S. market. For instance, the proposed and  final rules both recognized the strong liquidity positions U.S. banking  organizations already achieved and discussed the need to maintain  that improved liquidity through the use of shorter transition periods  than mandated in Basel III. The proposed and final rule also differed  from Basel III in the method for calculating total net cash outflows;  regulators described the difference as necessary because the change  would allow companies to better capture their own liquidity risk.", "In addition to differences in Basel III regulations between jurisdictions,  officials from two G-SIBs noted potential inconsistencies in the oversight  and supervision of Basel III regulations. For example, such officials said  that U.S. regulators have been more rigorous in their review and approval  of internal models used by advanced approaches banks for calculating  their risk weights under Basel II, as demonstrated by the long time it has  taken these banks to pass their parallel run under the Basel II regulations.", "In contrast, banks in the EU, Canada, and Japan had begun  implementing Basel II in 2008. At that time, the EU implementation of  Basel II ahead of the United States raised competitive concerns because  of the potential for EU banks to be required to hold less regulatory capital  to support the same level of assets. Basel Committee and other studies  indicated that U.S. banks tended to be subject to higher risk weights than  EU banks, in part due to their use of the Basel I and Basel II frameworks,  respectively. At the same time, comparing risk weights across banks is  difficult, in part because of differences in business mix, accounting rules,  off-balance sheet assets, and approaches for calculating risk-weighted  assets.", "While differences exist in the implementation of Basel III between  jurisdictions, the extent to which these differences collectively will affect  competition among internationally active banks is unclear. As shown in  table 7 above, Basel Committee member jurisdictions have not finished  adopting regulations to implement Basel III capital, leverage, and liquidity  standards. Moreover, the identified implementation differences cover  multiple jurisdictions and apply to different aspects of Basel III,  confounding their potential effect on competition. According to officials  from two G-SIBs, it is very difficult or impossible to measure quantitatively  the effect of such differences on competition. In addition to regulatory  capital requirements, other factors can affect the competitive position of  internationally active banks, such as differences in accounting treatment,  cost of capital, tax rules, and other regulations from one country to  another. For example, the spread or fee that banks charge for a financial  product is a function not only of their regulatory capital requirements but  also their cost of capital, which is driven by a variety of factors, and tax  rates. Additionally, officials from three G-SIBs told us the Dodd-Frank Act  and other reforms could affect the extent to which Basel III can help  provide a level playing field. For example, they said that their minimum  regulatory capital ratios effectively are set under the annual CCAR, which  has resulted in regulatory capital ratios higher than the Basel III minimum  ratios. They also said that the EU has been adopting similar stress tests  for EU banks."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to FDIC, Federal Reserve, and OCC for  their review and comment.

To identify relevant empirical studies, we conducted searches  of two databases, (ProQuest and EconLit) and identified and selected  economic studies from peer-reviewed journals and working papers from  governmental institutions that were published from 2011 through 2014.  We used search terms for selecting the studies, such as interest rate  spread, credit availability, cost of capital, and partial equilibrium. For  articles with abstracts, two team members independently reviewed each  abstract to determine if the article addressed the previously identified  topics and appeared to contain empirical data. If both reviewers agreed  that the article was relevant, it was saved for further review. When  reviewers disagreed, a third team member reviewed the abstract and  made the final decision. The selected studies then were evaluated to  determine if the methods were appropriate or sufficiently rigorous.

We defined a community bank as  a subsidiary bank with $10 billion or less in assets as of December 31,  2013. Although no commonly accepted definition of a community bank  exists, this size-based definition has been used by the Board of  Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve). Using the  SNL database, we developed a list of 5,849 subsidiary banks with assets  of less than $10 billon. We then placed the community banks into one of  the following four asset categories: (1) $1 to less than $500 million, (2)  $500 million to less than $1billion, (3) $1 billion to less than $5 billion, and  (4) $5 billion to less than $10 billion. Based on the U.S. Census  classification, we further placed the community banks into one of the  following four regions (1) East, (2) Midwest, (3) South, and (4) West.  Within the categories of region and asset size, we randomly selected 10  banks. We assumed that a sample with a mix of different bank sizes and  geographic areas would provide a wide range of views and experiences.  Nonetheless, the information collected from this sample of banks cannot  be generalized to the larger population of all community banks. To ensure  that we captured the views of banks that are most prevalent in this  population (banks with smaller asset sizes) as well those from asset  categories that have a larger share of total assets (banks with larger  asset sizes), we attempted to select at least four banks from the lower  two asset categories and four banks from the upper two asset categories.  We also attempted to include in our sample at least two from each region  while allowing for an additional bank in two regions with a larger number  of community banks. In three cases, we were unable to make contact with  the sampled bank, so we randomly selected a substitute from the same  region and asset category. One bank merged with another, but we  retained the merged bank for our sample since it was in the same region  and asset category as the bank we originally selected. In two cases, we  were unable to make contact with or gain the participation from the  originally selected banks or with multiple numbers of randomly selected  substitute banks.

First, as we discuss above,  our estimates of the capital shortfall are subject to limitations and may  overstate or understate the amount of capital that bank holding  companies and depository institutions raise in response to the new Basel  III standards. Because the increase in funding costs is related to the size  of the capital shortfall, our estimates of the increase may be overstated or  understated. In particular, some bank holding companies or depository  institutions may maintain capital in excess of the minimum requirements  (a capital buffer). The larger the capital buffer, the more funding costs will  increase and the more our estimates will understate them.

Furthermore, our estimates reflect the  median return on equity and interest rate on debt that prevailed in the first  quarter of 2014, as well as our assumption of a corporate income tax rate  of 35 percent. However, equity returns, debt interest rates, and tax rates  may change, altering the relative prices of debt and equity and thus  altering the change in funding costs associated with substituting equity for  debt. Finally, our estimates assume that the return on equity will not  change when a bank holding company or depository institution increases  its capital ratio.
