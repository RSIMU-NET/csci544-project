China's 2001 WTO commitments include specific pledges to increase market access, liberalize foreign investment, continue fundamental market reforms, and improve the rule of law. In 2002, GAO reported on selected U.S. companies' views, finding that many commitment areas, particularly those related to rule of law, were important to U.S. companies. GAO also found that company representatives expected China's reforms would have a positive impact on their business operations but expected some difficulties during implementation. In 2003, GAO continued to analyze companies' views about (1) the extent to which China has implemented its WTO commitments and (2) the impact of China's implementation of its WTO commitments on U.S. companies' business operations. GAO collected the views of representatives from 82 U.S. companies with a presence in China. GAO focused on companies in the agriculture, banking, machinery, and pharmaceutical industries.

Our analysis showed that the importance placed on specific areas differed among the agriculture, banking, machinery, and pharmaceutical industries. For example, agricultural respondents identified tariffs as important while banking respondents identified scope of business restrictions for services as important. Few respondents were able to assess all of China's commitment areas for reasons that varied depending on each company's experience and operations in China. More than two thirds of respondents reported that China's implementation of its WTO commitments had a positive impact on their companies' ability to do business in China. However, some respondents indicated that China's reform efforts had created difficulties for their company operations in China.

Many  respondents had no basis to judge the extent of China\u2019s WTO reforms in  certain commitment areas. This indicates that few companies have an in- depth knowledge of Chinese reforms across all 26 areas, as discussed in  further detail later. Consequently, the number of company representatives  evaluating each individual commitment area varied from 14 to 67.", "On average, respondents assigned lower marks when assessing the  implementation of 19 of the 26 listed commitment areas. For example,  company representatives thought that China had made reforms to only  some or little extent when assessing China\u2019s trading rights reforms (right  to import or export products) and price controls. Company  representatives said they eagerly awaited the implementation of China\u2019s  trading rights commitments in late 2004. Several company representatives  noted that implementation of these commitments would provide more  control over their business relationships in China and reduce or eliminate  the need to rely on third parties such as distributors and trading  companies. Although China had agreed to stop using price controls to  restrict the level of imports, one company representative derided China\u2019s  price control reforms and others noted their concern regarding the Chinese  government\u2019s continuing control of prices on specific products.", "Respondents on average assigned higher marks to the remaining 7  commitment areas. For example, respondents thought that China had  made reforms to a moderate extent when assessing China\u2019s reforms to  tariffs, fees, and charges; requirements stipulating a minimum amount of  production that must be exported; and restrictions on partnerships and  joint ventures. Several respondents described China\u2019s efforts in lowering  tariffs, fees, and charges including one respondent who noted that China  had reduced tariffs for an agricultural product from 35 to 15 percent since  joining the WTO. Company representatives also discussed China\u2019s  allowance for greater market access for services, stated that WTO has  allowed companies to provide after-sales service, and one said that \u201cChina  is doing a good job\u201d in addressing this area."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Respondents Had Mixed Views on Important Commitment Areas", "paragraphs": ["Respondents\u2019 assessments of the most important commitment areas  provide further detail regarding companies\u2019 views on China\u2019s progress.

More than  half of respondents reported that China had made reforms to a moderate or  great extent when asked to assess China\u2019s overall progress in implementing  reforms that were important to their companies. However, when asked to  assess China\u2019s implementation of specific commitment areas, responses for  four of the five most important areas fell in the \u201csome or little extent\u201d  category. Company representatives from the four industries assigned  varied levels of importance to specific commitment areas.", "The five specific commitment areas ranked as most important to  respondents overall were (1) standards, certifications, registration, and  testing requirements; (2) customs procedures and inspection practices; (3)  intellectual property rights; (4) tariffs, fees, and charges; and (5) consistent  application of laws, regulations, and practices. Among these five areas,  tariffs, fees and charges received higher marks, with respondents reporting  on average that China had made reforms to a moderate extent.  Respondents noted that it was relatively easy to assess China\u2019s  implementation of tariffs, fees, and charges because China had set time  schedules for tariff reductions on various products. Many respondents told  us that China\u2019s efforts to achieve tariff reductions were on schedule,  allowing companies to pay lower tariffs on imported products.", "Respondents provided lower ratings on average for the four other  important commitment areas and indicated that China had only  implemented these reforms to some or little extent. In the area of  standards, certifications, registration, and testing requirements, for  example, some respondents discussed continuing requirements such as  product registrations that require approval from multiple Chinese  government agencies, delays and bureaucratic bottlenecks in processing  product registration, and the use of product standards to protect Chinese  agricultural producers. When evaluating China\u2019s reforms made in customs  procedures and inspection practices, company representatives discussed  the \u201chassles\u201d and inefficiencies created by an unpredictable and slow  customs system characterized by inconsistent application of standards and  duties. In addition, numerous company representatives discussed the  limitations of China\u2019s efforts to address intellectual property rights.  Respondents cited specific experiences with generic copies of  pharmaceutical products, products illegally copied to look like those of  U.S. companies, and false labeling of Chinese products. Some respondents  even commented on the Chinese government\u2019s inadequate enforcement of  intellectual property rights. Furthermore, some respondents noted  inconsistency in China\u2019s application of laws, regulations, and practices  within and among national, provincial, and local levels of government. For  example, one banking representative said that different local governments  each have different explanations of China\u2019s laws and regulations. This issue  illustrates a larger rule of law-related problem discussed by company  representatives: the Chinese national government\u2019s commitment to WTO  implementation did not always coincide with local governments\u2019  interpretation and implementation of China\u2019s commitments."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Industries Placed Importance on Different Commitment Areas", "paragraphs": ["Respondents among the four selected industries (agriculture, banking,  machinery, and pharmaceuticals) had different views on the commitment  areas most important to their companies. For example, representatives of  agricultural companies and organizations noted the significance of quota  reductions while representatives of banking firms emphasized  commitments related to market access for services and foreign exchange  restrictions. Moreover, machinery company representatives identified  customs procedures and inspection practices as an important area for their  transport of goods. For pharmaceutical companies, intellectual property  and trading rights stood out as among the most important commitments.  Table 3 shows respondents\u2019 views on the most important commitment  areas by industry.", "The relative importance that respondents from the four industries assigned  to each of the 26 commitment areas reflected the nature of their  businesses. Company representatives also described the importance of  these commitment areas in terms of their experiences with China\u2019s reform  efforts. First, for example, agricultural companies identified the tariff-rate  quota system as well as China\u2019s application of sanitary and phytosanitary  measures and inspection requirements as important. Similarly, other  agriculture respondents emphasized the importance of tariffs and one  company representative noted that some agricultural tariffs applicable to  his company had declined as much as 40 percent. A representative of an  agricultural organization also noted that although China had increased  trading rights, continued quota restrictions undermined this effort. Second,  key issues for banking firms (a service industry) included China\u2019s market  access commitments to fully open the industry to foreign banks 5 years  after China\u2019s accession to the WTO. Banking industry representatives also  identified scope of business restrictions, which can limit the types of  services offered to clients, as important. However, company  representatives also told us that market access obstacles, such as branch  licensing that limits the ability of foreign banks to offer additional products  and to expand geographically, continue to exist. Next, machinery  companies identified the importance of China\u2019s tariff rates and product  certification system that sometimes involves on-site inspection of  manufacturing facilities outside of China. Some machinery company  representatives discussed the importance of timely product certification at  the ports, the importance of an efficient product registration process for  new products imported into China, and the need for testing procedures at  customs that allow products to enter the country without damage caused  by product testing. Finally, representatives from pharmaceutical  companies identified protection of intellectual property rights as important  and said that they continue to face challenges in this area. Specifically,  several pharmaceutical company representatives discussed the continued  need for patent protection to prevent counterfeiting of drugs sold at a  fraction of the price charged for the genuine product. A few representatives  of pharmaceutical firms noted that the Chinese government had allowed  counterfeit generic drugs to be sold and believed that China displayed  discrimination favoring Chinese products rather than complying with the  principle of national treatment, under which imported foreign products and  services are treated no less favorably than domestic products or services.  As described by one company representative, although protection of  intellectual property rights is getting better, the situation is still bad.

Most notably, for four  commitment areas, at least three quarters of the respondents selected \u201cno  basis to judge\u201d when asked to assess the extent to which China had actually  made reforms in these commitment areas. These areas included export  restrictions, such as eliminating taxes and charges on exports; China\u2019s  application of safeguards against U.S. exports, which includes  antidumping measures and other legal actions against import surges; local  content requirements; and government requirements stipulating a  minimum amount of production that must be exported.

Some company  representatives told us that they could not assess commitment areas that  simply did not apply to their companies. For example, representatives of  machinery companies had no basis to judge \u201cscope of business restrictions  for services\u201d because they did not provide services. Other respondents  stated that their companies did not have experience with particular  commitment areas, such as one respondent\u2019s inability to comment on  \u201cindependence of judicial bodies\u201d because the respondent\u2019s company had  not accessed the Chinese judicial system. Moreover, some respondents  noted that they did not have sufficient awareness and understanding of the  exact terms of China\u2019s WTO commitments and/or did not actively track  specific Chinese implementation efforts. Several respondents told us that  they often could not distinguish between China\u2019s broad economic reforms  and its actions taken to implement specific WTO commitments.

First, because company experiences and assessments varied, both overall  and among companies in the same industry, policymakers are well advised  to seek input from a number of companies with interests in an area of  concern and not just a few companies. Doing so increases the  representativeness of the information gathered for monitoring purposes,  because views are often company-specific and one company in an industry  cannot be assumed to speak for all.", "Second, we found that the number of company representatives who report  they have a basis to judge China\u2019s implementation of specific WTO  commitment areas varies greatly. Broad input from a wide range of  companies assures policymakers that monitoring is authoritative and  complete because relatively few individual companies believed they had a  basis to judge all 26 commitment areas. Furthermore, in some cases, like  Chinese export restrictions, application of safeguards, and/or subsidies,  very few U.S. companies reported they had a basis to judge  implementation. This observation raises the question of whether U.S.  government officials can rely on private sector input to identify the full  range of China\u2019s compliance problems. Instead, for some commitment  areas, alternative strategies that reach out to specific companies or that  rely on economic or legal information to identify problems, for example,  may be needed to monitor China\u2019s implementation.", "Finally, we report that respondents cited a number of factors that influence  company activities in addition to China\u2019s efforts to implement specific WTO  commitments. These results reaffirm the importance of ongoing private  sector education about China\u2019s WTO obligations and the market access  opportunities that the private sector should expect. Furthermore, it  indicates that any monitoring strategy benefits from collecting and  reviewing information about what companies may consider solely  \u201ccommercial problems\u201d but that may actually involve WTO-related issues,  where the U.S. government can clearly take action.", "Nevertheless, knowledge of U.S. company views remains fundamental for  policymakers to judge the degree to which the benefits of China\u2019s WTO  membership are being realized.

This work began in 2001 and includes examining,  through annual surveys, the experience of U.S. firms doing business in  China. Our objectives for this report were to assess the views and  experiences of selected U.S. companies with a presence in China regarding  (1) the extent to which China has implemented its WTO commitments in  key industries and (2) the impact of China\u2019s implementation of its WTO  commitments on these U.S. companies\u2019 business operations.

We selected the  participants from a commercial database listing U.S. companies that were  identified as being in China as of 2003. We purchased the database, Foreign  Companies in China 2003, from Commercial Intelligence Service, a  division of Business Monitor International. Our research indicated that this  database best met our need for identifying U.S.-nationality companies and  their respective contact information in China by industry.

In addition to interviewing the agricultural  firms listed in the purchased database, we also conducted structured  interviews with a judgmental selection of 11 representatives of nonprofit  agricultural associations in China.

We interviewed them to gain a more complete understanding  of U.S. agricultural interests in China and do not generalize their responses  to the full universe of nonprofit agricultural associations.

Figure 8 shows  the distribution of the stock of U.S. direct investment in China as of 2002.", "The pattern of U.S. investment in China, however, differs from the  worldwide pattern of U.S. investment. Figure 9 shows that manufacturing  accounts for about 26 percent of U.S. investments worldwide compared  with about 60 percent of investments in China (fig. 8). Similarly, globally  the United States has about one third (33 percent) of the stock of its  investments in other industries (e.g., agriculture, construction, retail trade,  and transportation and warehousing) compared with about 10 percent of  its investments in China in the other industries category. Finance and  depository institutions (except insurance) is the third largest area of U.S.  global investments, accounting for about 20 percent in 2002, while in China,  only about 3 percent of U.S. investments are in this area. This difference in  the pattern of U.S. investment in China compared to global patterns is not  surprising, because China is a developing country, has an abundant supply  of relatively low-cost labor, and is a growing producer of manufactured  goods worldwide. In contrast, the European Union, Canada, and Japan,  which accounted for well over half of the stock of U.S. direct investment  abroad, are developed countries with economies similar to the United  States."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "U.S. Trade with China", "paragraphs": ["U.S. trade in goods and services with China has also grown significantly  during the past decade. From 1993 to 2002, U.S. exports to China grew at an  average annual rate of 12 percent, compared with 5 percent for U.S.  exports worldwide during the same time period. Similarly, U.S. imports  from China grew at an average annual rate of 17 percent, while overall U.S.  imports grew at 8 percent annually. Consequently, China was the U.S.\u2019s  fourth largest trading partner in 2002 (after Canada, Mexico, and Japan),  with about $27 billion in U.S. exports (goods and services) and about $129  billion in U.S. imports from China (goods and services). In 2003, goods  trade data show that this rapid growth continued, with U.S. exports to  China at about $27 billion, an increase of 30 percent from 2002. Similarly,  U.S. imports from China in 2003 were about $152 billion, an increase of 21  percent from 2002. Services trade data for 2003 were not available as of the  date of this report.", "As a result of the difference between U.S. exports and imports, the United  States has had a growing bilateral trade deficit with China. In 2002, the U.S.  bilateral trade deficit with China reached $102 billion, the largest with any  country. The deficit resulted from the $104 billion difference in goods trade  (as opposed to services trade). The United States maintained about a $2  billion surplus in services trade with China in 2002.", "In 2003, the U.S. bilateral goods trade deficit with China expanded further,  to about $125 billion, an increase of about $21 billion. The increase was  primarily due to an increase in the trade deficit in computers, electrical  equipment, and appliances, as well as smaller increases in textiles, apparel,  and leather; metal and machinery (except electric) products; and  miscellaneous manufactured components, including furniture. However,  the U.S. bilateral trade surplus with China in agriculture, food and tobacco  products, and minerals rose from about $260 million in 2002 to about $2.8  billion in 2003. Figure 10 shows U.S. exports and imports of goods by broad  industry category in 2003.", "In terms of U.S. goods exports, China ranks sixth after Canada, Mexico,  Japan, the United Kingdom, and Germany. Top U.S. goods exports to China  in 2003 included: computers, electrical equipment, and appliances (23  percent); agriculture, food and tobacco products, and minerals (20  percent); metal and machinery (except electrical) products (16 percent);  petroleum and chemical products (16 percent); and transportation  equipment (12 percent). U.S. goods exports to China increased by 30  percent from 2002 to 2003, compared to an increase of 3 percent for U.S.  goods exports worldwide during the same period. Figure 11 shows the  relative share of broad industry groups in U.S. exports to China in 2003.", "In terms of U.S. imports of goods, China is the second largest foreign  supplier to the U.S. market after Canada and ahead of Mexico. Top U.S.  goods imports from China in 2003 also included computers, electrical  equipment, and appliances (36 percent). As previously noted, U.S. direct  investment in China was relatively large in the computer and electronic  products area. A share of trade in this area between the United States and  China is likely to be intracompany trade, in which components are  produced in one country and exported to the other country. The  components are then used to produce final goods that are ultimately sold in  each market, as well as other countries. Other important imports included  miscellaneous manufactured components, including furniture (21 percent)  and textiles, apparel, and leather (19 percent). Figure 12 shows the relative  share of broad industry groups in U.S. imports from China in 2003.", "Services trade with China is less significant to the United States relative to  services trade with other partners. Unlike goods trade, China is not in the  top 10 importers or exporters of services trade with the United States. In  2002, the United States exported about $6 billion worth of services to  China, compared with about $280 billion in exports worldwide. Other  private services (such as education, insurance, telecommunications, and  business, professional, and technical services) generated $2.6 billion in  sales, followed by other transportation such as freight charges from  transportation of goods by ocean, air, or land, and port charges ($1.4  billion). The United States imported about $4 billion in services from China  in 2002, compared with about $205 billion worldwide. Top U.S. imports of  services from China included other transportation ($2.3 billion) and travel  services ($1.1 billion).

In addition, the industry categories used by BEA and Census have  changed since our 2002 report. Therefore, the figures in this report and our  prior GAO report are not comparable.
