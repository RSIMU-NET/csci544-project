GAO also consulted with experts in genetics and nutrition."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The results from all the tests GAO purchased mislead consumers by making predictions that are medically unproven and so ambiguous that they do not provide meaningful information to consumers. Although there are numerous disclaimers indicating that the tests are not intended to diagnose disease, all 14 results predict that the fictitious consumers are at risk for developing a range of conditions, as shown in the figure below. However, although some types of diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, can be definitively diagnosed by looking at certain genes, the experts GAO spoke with said that the medical predictions in the tests results can not be medically proven at this time. Even if the predictions could be medically proven, the way the results are presented renders them meaningless. For example, many people \"may\" be \"at increased risk\" for developing heart disease, so such an ambiguous statement could relate to any human that submitted DNA. Results from the tests that GAO purchased from Web sites 1 and 4 further mislead the consumer by recommending costly dietary supplements. The results from the tests from Web site 1 suggested \"personalized\" supplements costing approximately $1,200 per year. However, after examining the list of ingredients, GAO found that they were substantially the same as typical vitamins and antioxidants that can be found in any grocery store for about $35 per year. Results from the tests from Web site 4 suggested expensive products that claimed to repair damaged DNA. However, the experts GAO spoke with stated that there is no \"pill\" currently available that has been proven to do so. The experts also told us that, in some circumstances, taking supplements such as those recommended may be harmful. In addition, results from the tests that GAO purchased from Web sites 1, 2, and 3 do not provide recommendations based on a unique genetic profile as promised, but instead provide a number of common sense health recommendations. If the recommendations were truly based on genetic analysis, then the 9 fictitious consumers that GAO created for these sites using the female DNA should have received the same recommendations because their DNA came from the same source. Instead, they received a variety of different recommendations, depending on their fictitious lifestyles. For example, when GAO created lifestyle descriptions stating that the consumers smoked, they received recommendations to stop smoking. In contrast, if GAO said the consumers never smoked, they received recommendations to continue to avoid smoking."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to discuss our investigation of genetic tests  that are sold directly to the consumer via the Internet, retail stores, or  pharmacies. Recent advances in science have shown that the human  genome is made up of about 20,000 to 25,000 genes, which are in turn  made up of DNA. These genes play a critical role in normal biological  function, and scientists increasingly believe that most, if not all, diseases  have a genetic component. Variants in these genes may increase an  individual\u2019s risk for various common, complex medical disorders.  Consequently, genetic testing is becoming an integral part of health care.  There are now genetic tests available for close to 1,000 diseases or  conditions, including hereditary breast cancer and cystic fibrosis, and  there is great potential for future test development and use.", "However, only about a dozen genetic tests have been reviewed and  approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to ensure their  safety and effectiveness. A major reason is that the FDA regulates the  safety and effectiveness of medical devices, meaning products intended to  diagnose, treat, mitigate, or prevent disease. A genetic test is considered  by the FDA to be a medical device only if it is manufactured as a  freestanding \u201ckit\u201d and sold to a laboratory. Presently, though, most  genetic tests are not sold as kits but are manufactured in-house by clinical  laboratories. In these cases, the laboratory itself decides whether a test  has sufficient \u201cclinical validity\u201d (i.e., is sufficiently effective at measuring  what it purports to measure). Although all clinical laboratories must be  approved under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of  1988 (CLIA) and meet general standards applicable to all laboratories,  there is no genetic testing specialty under CLIA. This means that there are  no specific requirements or unique standards for laboratories that perform  genetic tests.", "This minimal oversight makes it difficult for consumers to determine  whether a genetic test provides meaningful, scientifically based  information. In fact, some companies are directly marketing to consumers  DNA tests that provide health-related information without the advice of a  physician, including so-called \u201cnutrigenetic\u201d tests. Nutrigenetic tests  purport to analyze a limited number of genes to provide personalized  nutritional and lifestyle recommendations. These tests, which have not  been approved by the FDA and are sometimes performed in laboratories  that have not been approved under CLIA, range in cost from under $100 to  over $1,000. The tests require consumers to self-collect a sample of genetic  material, usually from a cheek swab, and then forward the sample to a  laboratory for analysis. Demand for this type of service appears to be on  the rise; one company estimates that it has sold over 35,000 nutrigenetic  tests to consumers since it began selling the tests in the United States in  2003.", "Although the companies that market nutrigenetic tests typically stress that  the results and information they provide are not intended to diagnose or  treat any disease or disorder, they do claim that their tests will provide  consumers with the information needed to tailor their diet and exercise  programs to address their genetically determined health risks. Because of  your concerns that the companies marketing this type of test may be  misleading consumers by providing inaccurate information, you requested  that we investigate the \u201clegitimacy\u201d of these claims.", "To complete our work, we investigated a nonrepresentative selection of  four Web sites selling nutrigenetic tests. We chose these Web sites because  they all claimed that their tests would analyze a limited number of genes,  between 4 and 19, to create personalized dietary and other lifestyle-related  recommendations; they also stated that their products would not test for  disease or predisposition to disease. These tests ranged in price from $89  to $395. We purchased several similar types of tests from each site\u201414 in  total\u2014so that we could compare a variety of results. To create a testing  scenario, we developed a series of \u201cfictitious consumers.\u201d To do this, we  ultimately submitted 12 DNA samples taken by cheek swab from a 9-  month-old female, with consent from her parents. For comparison  purposes, we also submitted 2 DNA samples taken from an unrelated 48- year-old male.  We had originally submitted DNA samples taken from a  dog, a cat, and \u201cblank\u201d samples containing no DNA information, but these  submissions were returned to us because they could not be processed by  the laboratories.", "On questionnaires that were included with each of the tests, we described  the DNA from the female and the DNA from the male as coming from adult  men and women of various ages, weights, and lifestyle descriptions. Each  questionnaire asked for the same type of information about exercise,  smoking, vitamin consumption, and intake of a variety of foods, but did  not ask for information about current medical conditions or prescribed  medications being taken. Figure 1 provides the basis for the 14 fictitious  consumers we created.", "To assess whether the 14 results and related recommendations we  eventually received provided any scientifically-based information, we  consulted with outside experts in the fields of genetics and nutrition.", "These experts have background in a variety of areas related to both fields,  including genetic technology, genetic discrimination, legal and public  policy issues pertaining to genetics and human research, pediatrics,  prevention of communicable diseases and diseases associated with poor  nutrition, and defining global nutrient requirements. We also reviewed  recent studies on genetic links to specific diseases and on the efficacy of  nutritional supplements. In addition, we interviewed representatives from  the Web sites marketing the tests and the laboratories processing the  results.

According to the experts,  cystic fibrosis and Huntington\u2019s disease are examples of illnesses that can  be diagnosed based on an analysis of only one gene. In contrast, the  diseases and conditions identified in the test results we received involve  complex bodily processes.

Furthermore,  although there is some research indicating that taking antioxidants may  help with DNA repair, no pill has yet been proven to repair damaged DNA.
