To help students finance their education, Congress passed a law that raised the ceiling on the amount students can borrow under the federal Stafford Loan Program (referred to in the law as \"loan limits\"). The Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act of 2008 mandated a series of GAO reports over a 5 year period assessing the impact of these increases in the loan limits on tuition and other expenses and on private student loan borrowing.", "For this final report, GAO examined: (1) the extent to which, if any, the Stafford loan limit increases affected tuition, fees and room and board prices at institutions of higher education; and (2) the trends in private student loan borrowing since the loan limits took effect. GAO developed a statistical model to explore whether the loan limit increases in academic years 2007-08 and 2008-09 had an impact on college prices in subsequent years. GAO analyzed data from the Department of Education (Education) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), and interviewed officials from eight higher education institutions that represented a mix of college sectors in different regions of the country, three of the largest private student lenders, federal officials, and subject matter specialists."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["For more than a decade, college prices have been rising consistently and have continued to rise at a gradual pace after the Stafford loan limit increases were enacted in 2008 and 2009. However, it is difficult to determine if a direct relationship exists between increases in college prices and the Stafford loan limit increases because of the confluence of many other factors that occurred around the time the loan limit increases took effect. Specifically, when the loan limit increases took effect, the nation was in a recession, which created one of the most tumultuous and complex economic environments in recent history. GAO's analysis found that the economic effects of the recession, which affected families' employment, income, and net worth make it difficult to isolate the impact the recession had on students' decisions to borrow money to finance college expenses versus the impact of the loan limit increases. Further, federal, state, and institutional aid available to students also increased significantly around the same time the loan limit increases went into effect. It is difficult to determine the extent to which the increased availability of this financial aid influenced the decisions of students on whether and how much money they should borrow versus the availability of increased loan limits. Conversely, GAO's analysis shows that even though college prices continued to increase at a gradual pace over the last decade as well as after the loan limits increased, enrollment, which can be sensitive to price increases, also generally continued to grow across both public and private institutions and in all regions of the country.", "Around the time that the loan limit increases took effect, the number of students taking out private education loans decreased across all types of institutions; lenders were making fewer loans and students borrowed less. Specifically, before the loan limit increases, the number of students borrowing private loans for academic year 2007-08 was about 2.8 million; after the limits went into effect the number dropped by over 50 percent to about 1.3 million for academic year 2011-12. Similarly, the average amount of money that students borrowed from private student loans decreased by about 17 percent after the loan limits went into effect. For example, for academic year 2007-08 students' private student loans averaged about $7,048 and for academic year 2011-12 this had dropped to about $5,870. According to the federal and institutional officials as well as financial lending experts that GAO spoke with, many factors may explain the changed private loan landscape. For example, these officials and experts noted that:", "lenders tightened lending criteria\u2014such as requiring higher credit scores and co-signers\u2014making it more difficult to obtain these loans;", "Congress enacted new protections to raise students' awareness about private loans, including disclosures of loan rates and terms; and", "colleges took steps to help students find alternatives to private borrowing and reduce reliance on private loans, such as increasing institutional aid and providing financial literacy counseling to help inform students about their federal assistance options."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO makes no recommendations in this report. Education and CFPB had no comments."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["A college education can increase the choices and opportunities available  to individuals, but rising costs have prompted concerns that a college  education may be an unattainable goal for some. To help students afford  the rising cost of college, Congress passed a law that raised the ceiling  on the amount individual students can borrow (referred to in the law as  \u201cloan limits\u201d) under the federal Stafford Loan Program. Although  increasing federal loan limits would give students more resources to pay  for college, there is also concern that the availability of this additional  resource might present an incentive for colleges to charge students more.  At the same time, this opportunity to borrow more federal loan money  might affect students\u2019 private loan borrowing, which sometimes may have  significantly higher interest rates and default rates than federal student  loans. The Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act of 2008  mandated GAO to conduct a series of reports over 5 years assessing the  impact of loan limit increases on tuition and other expenses and on  private loan borrowing. This is our final study in response to this  mandate. For this study, we addressed (1) to what extent, if any, did the  Stafford loan limit increases affect tuition, fees and room and board prices  at institutions of higher education; and (2) what have been the trends in  private student loan borrowing since the loan limits took effect?", "To determine the extent, if any, to which Stafford loan limit increases  affected college prices, we developed a panel regression model\u2014a  statistical method where we collected data over time for the same  colleges to estimate possible relationships among certain variables,  controlling for the effects of other variables\u2014to examine the impact of  Stafford loan limit increases on tuition, fees, and room and board prices at  institutions of higher education. In order to isolate the effect of loan limits  from other factors that may influence tuition and other college prices, we  controlled for factors such as college revenue from state appropriations or  endowments, and economic variables such as the state-level  unemployment rate. To determine if there were actual changes in the  amounts students borrowed in federal Stafford loans before and after the  loan limits took effect, we supplemented the findings of our panel  regression model with the most recent data available from the National  Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS) database (academic years  2003-04, 2007-08 and 2011-12), and trend data (academic years 1999- 2000 through 2011-12) for all Title IV-eligible, degree-granting institutions  of higher education from the Department of Education\u2019s (Education)  Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS). Using these  data, we examined differences in tuition trends among four education  institutional sectors\u2014nonprofit, for-profit, public 2-year, and public 4-year  colleges\u2014and geographic regions. For public 2-year and public 4-year  colleges, we also reviewed the annual tuition for both in-state and out-of- state students. For both the IPEDS trend data and panel regression  model data, we analyzed data for undergraduate students\u2014the majority  of college students\u2014to measure the effect of the two separate loan limit  increases. To provide examples of the role, if any, the loan limit  increases played in how colleges set prices, we supplemented these data  with interviews from college officials at eight institutions. We selected a  nonprobability sample of institutions to obtain a mix of each major sector  of higher education, regions, amount of federal aid received, enrollment  sizes, admission selectivity levels, and prices of tuition and related fees.  Although we cannot generalize information from these interviews to the  broader higher education landscape, we believe that the information from  these eight institutions provides insight into colleges\u2019 perspectives about  the role of loan limit increases on college prices and federal and private  student loan borrowing trends. In addition, we interviewed federal officials  and subject matter specialists, including academic researchers.", "With respect to our second objective, we analyzed the trends in private  student borrowing because comprehensive data from private lenders  were not available to assess the impact of loan limit increases on private  student borrowing, and data from individual lenders are proprietary. To  determine trends in private student loan borrowing since the loan limit  increases took effect, we reviewed aggregate trend data from calendar  years 2005 through 2011 for nine major private student lenders reported  in a 2012 study by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)  and Education. To obtain additional information about trends after the  loan limit increases, we supplemented the CFPB study data with analyses  of Education\u2019s IPEDS data (academic years 1999-2000 through 2011-12)  and NPSAS data (academic years 2003-04, 2007-08, and 2011-12) about  private student loan usage and undergraduate borrowing. We also  reviewed federal laws and regulations that have affected the private  lending market. We interviewed officials from the same eight institutions  we selected for research objective 1 and asked about private student loan  borrowing. We also interviewed three of the largest private student  lenders who participated in the CFPB study about the private student loan  industry, borrowing trends, and the extent to which the increased Stafford  loan limits affected private student loan borrowing. Finally, we interviewed  representatives from relevant professional associations, federal officials,  and subject matter specialists, including academic researchers. See  appendix I for our detailed scope and methodology and appendix II for  details on our panel regression model.", "We determined that the IPEDS and NPSAS data are sufficiently reliable  for the purposes of this report by testing them for accuracy and  completeness, and by reviewing documentation about the systems used  to produce the data. Unless otherwise noted, all percentage estimates  from NPSAS have 95 percent confidence intervals that are within 8  percent of the estimate itself. Further, all NPSAS dollar estimates have 95  percent confidence intervals that are within 8 percentage points of the  estimate itself. We conducted this performance audit from December  2012 to February 2014 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan  and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide  a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit  objectives.

Before 2010, federal Stafford Loans and PLUS Loans were part  of the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program as well as the  William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan (Direct Loan) Program. Under the  FFEL Program, private lenders made federally-guaranteed student loans  to parents and students. The Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act of  2009, enacted as a part of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation  Act of 2010, terminated the authority to make or insure new FFEL loans  after June 30, 2010. At the time, there was concern that paying banks to  act as middlemen for student lending was adding to the cost of student  borrowing. A Congressional Budget Office study estimated that the  government would save over $85 billion over 10 years if it did the direct  lending itself. Starting July 1, 2010 all Stafford and PLUS loans are  originated and disbursed directly from the Department of Education under  the Federal Direct Loan Program. FFEL Program loans disbursed before  July 1, 2010 continue to be serviced according to the terms and  conditions of the FFEL Program master promissory note the borrowers  signed when they obtained the loan.", "The Stafford Loan program is the largest source of federal financial aid  available to postsecondary students. In academic year 2011-12, 35  percent of undergraduate students participated in the program, which  provided an estimated $89.6 billion to eligible students through subsidized  and unsubsidized loans. The federal government pays the interest on  subsidized loans while students are in school, and students must have a  financial need as determined under federal law to qualify for this type of  loan. Each student\u2019s financial aid need is determined by subtracting the  student\u2019s expected family contribution (EFC) and certain other estimated  financial assistance from the total price of attendance. Regardless of  their financial need, students can borrow unsubsidized loans to pay for  educational expenses and are responsible for paying back any interest  that accrues on the loan. A student may be eligible to receive both  subsidized and unsubsidized loans, which are generally referred to as a  combined loan.", "To help students and their families pay for the rising cost of college,  Congress first passed a law that raised Stafford loan limits for first-and  second-year undergraduate students as well as for graduate and  professional students in academic year 2007-08, and subsequently for  all qualified undergraduate students receiving unsubsidized or combined  Stafford loans in academic year 2008-09 (see table 2).", "Students whose financial need is not fully met by federal assistance and  the school\u2019s own resources (school grants and loans, called institutional  aid) may turn to private lenders for college funding. While the private  student loan market is dominated by traditional financial institutions such  as banks, a variety of other private student lenders exist. Specifically, in  addition to the traditional banks, nonprofit lenders, many of which are  affiliated with states and certain schools, have elected to fund or  effectively guarantee loans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Any Impact of Increases in Loan Limits on Rising College Prices Is Difficult to Discern", "paragraphs": ["For more than a decade, college prices have been rising consistently  across most types of institutions of higher education and continued to rise  after the Stafford loan limits increased, but it is difficult to establish if a  direct relationship exists. Numerous events that affected the economy  likely influenced rising prices, which generally followed a consistent  upward pattern across three commonly-used measures of college prices  (see fig. 1).", "As figure 2 shows, the tuition and required fees that a typical student  would incur rose at an average annual rate of about 2 to 5 percent from  academic years 2007-08 through 2011-12, following a decade-long trend  of steady, consistent increases. The one exception to this pattern was at  for-profit 2-and 4-year institutions, where prices decreased across all  three measures during that time (see fig. 1). That is, for academic years  2007-08 through 2011-12, the tuition and required fees decreased at an  annual average rate of 3 percent (see fig. 2).", "This pattern of gradual increases in tuition and fees has generally  persisted across different regions of the United States, with higher overall  annual rate increases from academic years 2007-08 through 2011-12 in  the Far West region (average annual rate increase of 14 percent), and  lower increases in the Great Lakes and Plains regions at 1 and 2 percent,  respectively. Enrollment, which can be sensitive to college prices, was  unaffected by increases in college prices, and continued an upward trend  as shown in figure 3, rising to about 18 million students in academic year  2011-12, with variations by region, student characteristics, and higher  education sector. Further, over the last decade, the cohort of college  students who are 18-24 has grown substantially, with this population  comprising about 42 percent of all college students in 2011. See  Appendix III for additional data on college prices and enrollment.", "Although college prices went up, we were unable to determine whether or  not these increases resulted from the loan limit increases because of the  interference of various economic factors occurring around the same time  these loan limit increases went into effect. Specifically, when the loan limit  increases went into effect, the nation was in a recession which created  one of the most tumultuous and complex economic environments in  recent history, affecting families\u2019 employment, income, and net worth (see  fig. 4). As shown earlier, the availability and types of federal and  institutional financial aid available to students increased around the time  the new loan limits went into effect (see table 1), also making it difficult to  discern any effect those loan limits may have had. For example, the dollar  amounts of Federal PLUS loans, federal tax benefits, Pell grants, and  federal veterans grants all increased. Further, the amounts of state and  institutional grants and loans also increased, while the amounts of state  appropriations for colleges and college endowments decreased.", "Further, colleges appear to have responded to the economic crisis in  ways that are difficult to capture in a model. We found some evidence of  this in our discussion with selected college officials, who responded to the  economic crisis in different ways. For example, officials at a private  nonprofit 4-year institution said that despite declines in their endowments,  they used their general operating and annual giving funds to provide more  aid to students. In contrast, officials at one public 4-year college said that  they set their tuition so that their students, the majority of whom qualified  for federal Pell grants, could cover the price of tuition with their grant aid.  In addition, officials at one public 2-year college described how their state  board of education would not allow them to increase their tuition more  than 5 percent each year, while officials at a public 4-year college said  that any public school in their state that increased their designated tuition  by a certain percentage had to set aside more money for financial aid to  their students. Finally, Stafford student loan borrowing that occurred after  the loan limit increases presented a mixed picture. The proportion of  students taking out the maximum in Stafford student loans continued to  decline between academic years 2007-08 and 2011-12 for unsubsidized  (24 to 20 percent) and combined loans (61 to 58 percent) but not for  subsidized loans, which increased from 54 to 57 percent in the number of  students borrowing the maximum loan amount (see figure 5)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Private Student Loan Borrowing Declined After the Loan Limits Increased", "paragraphs": ["The landscape of private education borrowing has changed since the loan  limit increases took effect. Before the loan limit increases, the total  number of students borrowing private student loans had been increasing,  rising by 188 percent from 961,356 to 2,764,469 students between  academic years 2003-04 and 2007-08 (see fig. 6). After the loan limit  increases went into effect, the number of students taking out private  student loans dropped overall by 52 percent, down to 1,325,997 students  between academic years 2007-08 and 2011-12. This pattern persisted  across all types of institutions of higher education, with the steepest  declines at public 2-year (61 percent) and for-profit 2-and 4-year  institutions (58 percent) over this time period, according to Education  data. While it is unclear why there were steeper declines among these  types of institutions, increases in the availability of other types of aid may  have been a contributing factor. For example, officials at one for-profit 4- year institution participating in our study told us they increased the  amount of scholarship assistance available to students. Similarly, the  financial aid administrator at a public 2-year school told us the school was  able to increase institutional aid to students because its foundation  aggressively sought grants to fund scholarships.", "Students also borrowed less private student loan money after the loan  limit increases, on average about $1,179 less in academic year 2011-12  than in academic year 2007-08\u2013 approximately a 17 percent decrease  (see table 3). While the decline in the amount students borrowed  occurred across all higher education institution types, amounts borrowed  by students attending public 2-year schools (28 percent) and private  nonprofit 4-year schools (22 percent) dropped the most. In terms of  average amounts borrowed in dollars, student borrowing at private  nonprofit 4-year schools showed the largest dollar decline: about $2,178.  The decrease in the average private loan amount borrowed by students  at public 2-year schools may have resulted in part from the effort by  school officials to rein in student borrowing and the increased availability  of other aid. For example, the financial aid administrator at a public 2-year  school said they encourage students to pursue federal loans first and  private loans as a last resort. Officials at a private nonprofit 4-year  institution said they adopted an \u201cinterventionist\u201d approach toward students  who were considering private student loans. These officials said they  reached out to students who were considering private student loans and,  in some instances, increased the amount of institutional aid to students so  that they would not need to take out private loans. Private lenders we  interviewed also said that they had to rein in student borrowing to reduce  the risk of loan defaults. One lender said that some lenders decreased  loans to students at for-profit schools because of low graduation rates  and high default rates.", "The decline in the number of students borrowing private student loans  paralleled other declines in the private education market. According to a  study by the CFPB\u2014the agency that supervises large banks and  nonbanks that make private student loans\u2014new loans for nine major  lenders steadily increased from 2005, peaking in 2008 at $10.1 billion.  However, in 2009, the calendar year the second loan limit increase took  effect, new loans decreased 31 percent (dropping from $10.1 billion in  2008 to $7 billion in 2009). From 2009 to 2010, new loans dropped  another 20 percent to $5.6 billion (See fig. 7).", "As the average amount of private student loans borrowed by students  dropped, the average amount of federal education loans at all institutions  increased (see fig. 8). For example, between academic years 2007-08  and 2011-12, the average amount of private loans borrowed by students  at public 2-year institutions dropped by 28 percent while the average  amount of federal loans increased by 16 percent. At for-profit 2- and 4- year institutions, there was about an 11 percent decrease in the average  amount of private student loans borrowed and a 22 percent increase in  the amount of federal student loans. The trend of less reliance on private  student loans and more on federal student loans to fund education  persisted across all types of institutions."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Factors Contributing to Private Loan Declines", "paragraphs": ["Overall, the turmoil in the nation\u2019s financial markets and the resulting  recession set the stage for the declines in private loan borrowing and  lending, but there were other contributing factors, too.", "Lender exit. In response to the turmoil in the financial markets, some  lenders exited the student loan industry altogether, according to a  study by CFPB. These actions changed the market from one with  many lenders to a smaller market dominated by a few large lenders.", "More stringent lending criteria. Lenders responded to the crisis by  tightening their lending criteria, making it more difficult for some  students to obtain these loans, according to a study by the CFPB  which was echoed by lenders and subject matter specialists we  interviewed. The CFPB study found that in the years leading up to the  2007-2009 recession when private student lending was increasing,  lenders were making a higher percentage of loans to borrowers with  weaker credit qualifications. This trend reversed during the  recession. In the aftermath of the credit crisis and recession, private  lenders changed their criteria for making student loans. For example,  the CFPB study found that lenders began to rely more heavily on  criteria that had been traditionally used to determine a borrower\u2019s  creditworthiness, such as the borrower\u2019s ability to repay the loan and  individual repayment history as reflected by a borrower\u2019s Fair Isaac  Corporation credit score (FICO). Many lenders also required or  strongly encouraged students to have a co-signer for their private  student loans. While students could still obtain loans without a co- signer, lenders said student borrowers with a co-signer are more likely  to secure a lower interest rate and more favorable loan terms.", "New consumer protections. In addition, the fallout from the turmoil  in the national financial markets in 2008 increased scrutiny of the  private student loan market, and subsequent statutory changes  increased consumer protections (see table 4). Enacted in 2008, the  Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA) amended the Truth in  Lending Act (TILA) and the Higher Education Act of 1965 to add new  disclosure requirements related to private student loan rates, terms,  and the availability of federal student loans. For example, it provided  for a 3-day period after consummation of the loan during which a  borrower may cancel a loan without penalty and also provided that a  borrower has 30 days after a loan is approved to accept the loan,  during which time the lender generally cannot change the loan rates  or terms. The new disclosures were accompanied by new borrower  responsibilities. In an effort to prevent over-borrowing, applicants for  private student loans must now complete a self-certification form that  includes a calculation of how much the student needs to borrow, and  attest that they are aware of the federal loan options available to  them. See Appendix IV for a sample self-certification template.  Several of the officials we interviewed noted that the self-certification  forms helped to keep students from borrowing more funds than they  actually need for educational costs. Furthermore, the HEOA amended  the TILA to prohibit certain practices by private lenders, including  revenue sharing between creditors and educational institutions. (See  table 4 for more information).", "Proactive school initiatives. Officials at all of the schools in our  study described a wide range of activities they implemented to raise  student awareness and understanding of the various types of financial  aid available to them. Some school officials also described efforts  aimed at providing students with alternatives to private student loans.  While most of the schools provided personal counseling to help  students understand the obligations that come with borrowing private  student loans, financial literacy training, and a wide range of online  tools to help students calculate their college costs and financial need,  they also told us about efforts that were unique to their own  institutions. For example, officials at one public 4-year university  described how 80 to 90 percent of their students are eligible for Pell  grants, which cover much of their costs, and that many students do  not have the credit scores to qualify for private student loans. Officials  told us that they kept tuition at a level that would enable students\u2019 Pell  grants to cover the full cost of tuition. Rather than raise tuition, school  officials said the school made modest increases to room and board  prices for students who chose to live on campus.", "Officials at another public 4-year university said that they were able to  hold tuition steady by increasing enrollment. They said that they have  a multi-year plan to increase enrollment, especially for students  served through their online education programs. These officials also  described how they now offer a $10,000 degree to students who  pursue a Bachelor\u2019s degree in the specific field of organizational  leadership. The program is competency-based rather than semester  credit-hour based, and features a combination of traditional classroom  instruction and credit for life learning. The $10,000 cost of the degree  covers tuition and fees but not room and board, transit, or other  miscellaneous costs. In addition, officials at both public 4-year  institutions said that their state boards of education require them to  keep college prices below a certain designated threshold, and if they  go above it, they must then increase the amount of institutional aid to  students. Their states put this policy in place, they said, to make  college more affordable and reduce the need for students to seek  private student loans to finance their education.", "Officials at a private nonprofit 4-year institution described an  aggressive strategy for helping students pay for their education  without private or federal student loans. According to these financial  aid administrators, the university has adopted a policy of fully meeting  each student\u2019s financial aid need and that for all students in general,  they have a no loan policy. To carry out this policy, the administrators  said the university does not include loans when determining a  student\u2019s financial aid award and has increased institutional funding  for students through grants and scholarships. According to university  officials, during the recession they tapped into the university\u2019s  operating funds to ensure sufficient levels of grant aid for students. In  addition, they said the university has changed the way it calculates a  student\u2019s financial need for purposes of institutional aid by eliminating  home equity as a factor when considering a student\u2019s eligibility for  institutional aid. The elimination of home equity as an asset, school  officials said, resulted in more students from middle income families  qualifying for financial aid.", "Officials at all three for-profit institutions we interviewed said that  keeping costs down is a significant part of their effort to reduce  students\u2019 reliance on loans, similar to the efforts that public institutions  reported. Officials at one of the for-profit institutions participating in  our study said they are focusing on reducing costs for academically  gifted students by increasing merit-based financial aid. Students with  higher admission test scores and GPAs receive more aid than other  students. The same institution also recently announced that it is  offering students in its honors program full tuition for their fourth year  of school. Officials at another for-profit institution told us that the  number of its students using private student loans had decreased to  11 percent in 2009 and has remained at that level. School officials  saw this as particularly notable because students\u2019 private loan usage  had been as high as 30 percent in some years preceding 2009.  School officials told us that students who are considering private  student loans must participate in an interview at the school so that  they fully understand the terms and conditions of their private loan.  During the interview, the student is given information about private  loan interest rates, and information about federal loans. School  officials told us they encourage students considering loans to exhaust  their federal loans before they take out private loans."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Department of Education and  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for review and comment.

Thus, in the year the loan limit increases, the change in college  prices resulting from the loan limit and the trend effects is the sum of B1  and B5; we could not obtain the effects of the loan limit by itself because  B5 captures that effect as well as the trend effects.

In the academic year of the 2007-08 Stafford loan  limit increase, college prices increased for some colleges and decreased  for others. The decrease in college prices by some colleges is consistent  with the opinion that the rapid change in economic conditions may have  led state legislatures to put political pressure on colleges in their states to  keep tuition low, a sentiment that was echoed in some of our interviews  with college officials. Furthermore, some of the college officials we spoke  with said that they held down tuition increases because of the economic  downturn and financial crises. In the years following the academic year  2007-08 loan limit increase, college prices generally increased. Although  the results appear to suggest that the loan limit increase tended to  weaken the rising trend in college prices, we cannot determine which  portion of the change in college prices in the academic year of the 2007- 08 loan limit increase is attributable to the loan limit alone because it is  confounded by other events in that year as well as the ongoing rising  prices.", "The results in table 9 show the average academic year changes in  college prices before, during, and after the academic year 2008-09  Stafford loan limit increases.

Similar to the  academic year 2007-08 loan limit increase, while the results seem to  suggest that the loan limit increase in academic year 2008-09 tended to  boost the rising trend in college prices we could not determine the portion  of the increase due solely to the loan limit increase because of other  confounding effects. Also, we could not separate out the effects of the  academic year 2007-08 and 2008-09 Stafford loan limit increases from  each other after they occurred since the two events overlapped.", "Our results suggest that average academic year college prices generally  increased across all types of colleges prior to the increases in the Stafford  loan limits in academic years 2007-08 and 2008-09, and after the loan  limit increases. In the academic year of the 2007-08 Stafford loan limit  increase college prices increased for some colleges while they decreased  for others.
