At the end of fiscal year 2000, the Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) indicated that $89 billion in child support was owed but unpaid--a 96-percent increase since the end of fiscal year 1996. GAO believes that this amount is understated. Thousands of private and public sector entities can collect child support. Both private firms and state agencies reported collections from about 60 percent of their cases. Twenty-two of the 24 private firms GAO reviewed reported that they relied on private information vendors--commercial firms that sell information such as addresses, telephone numbers, and social security numbers--as their primary information source, whereas about one-third of state agencies reported using this source. State agencies relied heavily on state and federal automated databases to locate noncustodial parents and their assets. Additionally, private firms and the state agencies reported calling noncustodial parents to collect child support. However, only the private firms called third parties, such as relatives and neighbors of noncustodial parents to persuade them to prevail upon the noncustodial parent to make payments. The same enforcement tools are available to private firms and state agencies, but the process that they follow in using these tools often differ. Private firms, however, do not have access to federal tax refunds. Officials from both private firms and state agencies reported that the tool they most often use was wage withholding. However, the form and related guidance developed by OCSE for use in wage withholding make it difficult for employers to determine whether it is proper to begin withholding wages. Most of the state agencies had not provided information on noncustodial parents' location or assets from the Federal Parent Locator Service (FPLS). Practices for sharing with private firms were affected by differences in interpretation of whether federal law permits or requires state agencies to share FPLS data."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Collection of child support by private firms is a growing business, largely because of the billions of dollars owed in child support to millions of custodial parents.

However, little is known about these firms.", "To assist Congress in its future deliberations about the role of private child support collection firms, you asked us to study the practices of private child support collection firms and state child support enforcement (CSE) agencies. Specifically, our objectives were to (1) obtain information on the amount of child support owed and how it has changed in recent years; (2) identify the number and kinds of entities that can collect child support and compare the characteristics of private child support collection firms with those of state agencies; (3) compare the private firms\u2019 and state agencies\u2019 collection experiences, information sources, and collection practices; (4) compare the enforcement tools available to private firms and state agencies; and (5) determine whether state agencies provide information requested by private firms.", "In fulfilling these diverse objectives, we pursued a multifaceted methodology. We obtained information from the Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that allowed us to compute the amount of child support owed. The OCSE data was from its database of child support information reported by state agencies. To identify the number and kinds of entities that can collect child support, we reviewed relevant laws and regulations; talked to officials in OCSE, state agencies, private child support firms and other child support experts; and searched the Internet, relevant trade association membership lists, and telephone directories. To determine the characteristics, collection experiences, information sources, collection practices, and enforcement tools of private firms and state agencies, we visited four private firms and two state agencies and talked with managers, reviewed written operating policies and procedures, observed operating practices, and examined a purposefully selected sample of case files. We also conducted structured telephone interviews with responsible officials of all the state agencies and 24 of the 38 private firms that we had identified as regularly collecting child support. In addition, we used information obtained through the site visits and telephone interviews to determine whether state agencies provide information requested by private firms.", "We compared the caseload characteristics, collection experiences, collection practices, and information sources of private firms with those of state agencies. However, because of the vast differences in the characteristics of their cases, we did not compare the average time that it took for private firms and state agencies to collect child support. Further, we could not determine whether greater access to information and enforcement tools would increase the amounts of child support that private firms collect or improve the effectiveness of their efforts, because there are many factors involved in child support cases and these factors can vary with each case. We performed our work between April 2001 and January 2002 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

All 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands operate CSE programs. However, because family law, which governs many aspects of child support, is generally under the purview of the state rather than the federal government, each of the 54 CSE programs is governed by some unique state laws and procedures.", "Although the states administer the child support program, the federal government plays a major role through OCSE within the Administration for Children and Families of the Department of Health and Human Services. This includes funding most of the program, establishing enforcement policies and guidance, providing technical assistance, and overseeing and monitoring state programs. As part of its oversight role, OCSE reviews state plans for each of the state programs. These plans describe the nature and scope of a state\u2019s child support program and specify the procedures and policies adopted by each state to ensure that its program complies with all federal requirements. OCSE\u2019s approval is a condition for federal funding of state programs.", "PRWORA strengthened the CSE program by requiring, among other things, that states (1) establish an integrated, automated network linking all states to information about the location and assets of parents, (2) increase the percentage of fathers identified, and (3) implement more enforcement techniques for collection of child support from noncustodial parents.", "Additionally, PRWORA changed federal welfare policy, eliminating eligible families\u2019 legal entitlement to cash assistance and creating Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). TANF emphasizes the importance of work and personal responsibility rather than dependence on government benefits. After 2 years of assistance, or sooner if the state determines that the recipient is ready, TANF adults are generally required to be engaged in work or work-related activities. A lifetime limit of 60 months (or less, at the state\u2019s option) is placed on adults\u2019 receipt of cash benefits. Families receiving TANF benefits or benefits under the federally assisted foster care program or the Medicaid program automatically receive CSE services free of charge. Under PRWORA, TANF recipients generally must assign their rights to child support payments to the state.", "The CSE program provides services to anyone requesting them, regardless of income. In fiscal year 2000, the program managed more than 17 million cases, 35 percent of which included clients who never received assistance. Faced with growing caseloads in an environment of resource constraints and increasing federal requirements, some states contracted with private firms to provide some or all services. Generally, these firms are authorized to operate as agents of the state agencies and have access to most information usually available only to state agencies. Their employees are subject to the same penalties or other actions as state agency employees if they misuse the information.", "Unlike firms under contract with state agencies, other private firms are involved in collecting child support as independent business ventures.

In addition, OCSE data do not include unpaid child support associated with closed cases. State agencies can close cases under certain circumstances after a support order has been established, even when child support is still owed. For example, state agencies can close a case if the noncustodial parent\u2019s location is unknown and the state has made diligent efforts to locate the absent parent; or if the noncustodial parent cannot pay supportbecause the parent has been institutionalized in a psychiatric facility, is incarcerated with no chance for parole, or has a medically-verified total and permanent disability with no evidence of support potential."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Increases in the Number of, or Adjustments to, Child Support Orders Could Affect the Amount of Child Support Owed", "paragraphs": ["The increases in the amount of child support owed in spite of increased collections could be due, in part, to the rise in the number of support orders established or the rise in adjustments of individual support orders.From fiscal year 1996 to fiscal year 2000, the number of support orders established by OCSE increased by 9 percent, from 1.08 million to 1.17 million. Furthermore, provisions in PRWORA may lead to further increases in the number of support orders and the amount of child support owed. PRWORA requires that paternity be established for 90 percent of the state agency cases. OCSE reports that child support paternity was established for about 1.6 million children in fiscal year 2000, an increase of 46 percent over the 1.1 million paternities established in fiscal year 1996. Paternity must be established before child support orders can be issued. PRWORA also provided a simplified process for review and adjustment of all child support orders every 3 years. These reviews determine whether the amount of child support previously ordered is reasonable given the circumstances of both the noncustodial and the custodial parent.

Officials of the 24 firms that participated in our structured telephone interviews reported that their firms required a legally enforceable child support order before opening a case. Furthermore, all 24 private firms accepted cases in which the children were no longer minors and therefore considered emancipated. Federal and state laws largely mandate the kinds of cases that state agencies must accept and when cases can be closed. State agencies generally accept all clients whether or not a support order has been established and regardless of the amount of child support owed.

Moreover, OCSE\u2019s guidance makes it difficult for employers to ensure the validity of a wage withholding notice when sent by a private firm. Because private firms cannot authorize wage withholding, when employers receive a notice from a private firm without the underlying legal support, they do not know if wage withholding has been authorized by an appropriate authority. While the form provides a space for the sender to provide information about the underlying order and the issuing state (see app. I, items b and c), the guidance does not require the sender to provide the date of the underlying order or a copy.

Finally, the form provides space for contact information in case the employer has any doubts about the validity of the order or notice (see app. I, item f); however, we found that on forms sent by private firms, frequently the contact named is an employee of the firm and not an authorizing official who would be in a better position to verify the validity of the notice.", "Because of the difficulty of determining the validity of forms sent by private firms and the requirement that an employer begin withholding wages upon receipt of an order or notice, we found instances in which employers improperly withheld wages from a noncustodial parent\u2019s paycheck on the basis of information from a private firm. In one case, the employer was properly withholding about $900 per month on the basis of a court order issued in October 2000. In March 2001, when the employer received a wage withholding notice from a private firm indicating that about $550 per month should be deducted from the employee\u2019s income, the employer began withholding that amount as well.

The reasons that they cited most often for not requesting this information were that (1) state agencies will not provide the information, (2) there are better information sources, or (3) the information is not timely.", "Officials at the private firms that we visited gave similar reasons for not requesting location information from state agencies. For example, one private firm official told us that he did not ask for this information because the information was old and because it was unlikely that the state would have information not available from the other sources that he used. Furthermore, he stated that \u201cfor noncustodial parents who really do not want to be found, the National Directory of New Hires (NDNH), a key part of the FPLS, will not help because these parents change jobs frequently, are self-employed, or work .\u201d Another private firm official stated that the NDNH was not useful because of (1) the transience of many noncustodial parents, (2) better ways of getting employment information, and (3) the high number of self-employed noncustodial parents that the database does not capture. Additionally, the official stated that he did not use FPLS data even for cases that he handled under a contract with a state agency, which gives him full access to FPLS data. Officials of the firm agreed that private information vendors provided more accurate information more quickly and more efficiently. When asked which state information sources would be helpful, another firm official responded that apart from the quicker access to drivers\u2019 records, private information vendors provided information more quickly than state sources, although the amount of information is limited.", "One state agency official who participated in our structured telephone interviews said that the state agency provided location information to private firms. Four state agency officials stated that sometimes they provided location information, but 45 state agency officials told us that they never did. Because state agencies can access the FPLS, state agencies can obtain data on individuals nationwide. A state agency that provides data to private firms can provide information on individuals residing in other states, including information that originated in another state. In our review of case files from private firms, we found instances where location data obtained from the FPLS were provided when the custodial parent and children lived in state A, the noncustodial parent lived in state B, and state C provided the data.

To prevent disclosure of personal information to unauthorized persons or for unauthorized purposes, the law strictly limits access to, and use of, FPLS data.

As a result, noncustodial parents\u2019 wages have been improperly withheld. In addition, some private firms are requesting and receiving confidential FPLS data. It is not clear, however, whether these firms are authorized to receive the data. A determination by OCSE would ensure that all firms and their clients were treated the same.", "Given the growth in the amount of child support owed, it is possible that more private firms will enter the business or that those in the business will acquire more clients. Therefore, it is important to clarify as soon as possible the areas in which there is ambiguity.

The department also stated that it is misleading for GAO to focus on unpaid child support accumulated since the program was established 27 years ago. In addition, the department stated that, for a number of reasons, some of the accumulated child support can never be collected. We noted in the body of the report that the total child support owed includes amounts unpaid since the inception of the program.

The department noted that other reasons include interest on unpaid child support, more accurate reporting, and child support awards that low-income fathers are unable to pay. We noted in the report that the amount of unpaid child support includes interest added by some states. We did not change the report to address the statement about data accuracy, because we did not determine whether the reliability of OCSE\u2019s data has improved. Furthermore, we did not change the report to address whether amounts have been awarded that low-income fathers are unable to pay, because we did not examine this issue.
