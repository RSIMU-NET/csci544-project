From December 2003 through May 2007, the number of coalition troops decreased from 24,000 to 12,600; the number of coalition nations contributing troops decreased from 33 to 25. The United Kingdom, Poland, and Republic of Korea are responsible for leading operations in three of seven security sectors in Iraq. In addition, coalition troops have performed humanitarian, medical, and reconstruction missions. Some have provided combat capabilities, such as infantry and explosive ordinance capabilities. The United States has spent about $1.5 billion to transport, sustain, and provide other services for military troops from 20 countries other than the United States and Iraq. The United States used about $1 billion of the $1.5 billion to feed, house, and equip these countries. In terms of allocation by country, about $988 million, or 66 percent, was used to support Poland and the countries under its command, and $300 million, or 20 percent, supported Jordan for border operations and other activities. In addition to support for operations in Iraq, the United States, through the State Department, has provided about $1.9 billion in security assistance for military training and equipment to 10 coalition members and Jordan since 2003. As of April 2007, international donors had pledged about $14.9 billion for reconstruction efforts in Iraq. Some countries exceeded their pledges by an additional $744 million for a total of $15.6 billion. About $11 billion, or 70 percent, of these pledges are loans, with the remaining $4.6 billion in the form of grants.

This testimony is based on  prior GAO reports and on data collected for this hearing. Although we  reviewed both classified and unclassified documents, the information in  this statement is based only on unclassified U.S. government documents.  This limits the detail we can provide on coalition troop strength in Iraq  since DOD classifies the specific troop levels for each coalition country  that contributes to operations in Iraq.

For troop levels from coalition countries,  DOD  and State provided data for December 2003 to April 2007. However, the  departments did not have information on coalition troops in Iraq from  March to November 2003. We determined that the data we did receive  were sufficiently reliable for estimating the U.S. contribution in support of  coalition troops and the number of troops contributed by other countries.

The original \u201ccoalition of the willing\u201d consisted of 49 countries  (including the United States) that publicly committed to the war effort and  also provided a variety of support, such as direct military participation,  logistical and intelligence support, over-flight rights, or humanitarian and  reconstruction aid. The term \u201ccoalition of the willing\u201d refers to those  countries that declared political support for the war effort; not all of these  countries contributed troops to multinational operations.  Between  December 2003 and May 2007, 39 countries (including the United States)\u2014 some of which were not original coalition members\u2014provided troops to  support operations in Iraq.", "Three sources of funding help support non-U.S. coalition troops in Iraq:  coalition support funds, lift and sustain funds, and peacekeeping  operations funds. First, the Emergency Wartime Supplemental  Appropriations Act of 2003 authorized DOD to use up to a certain amount  of its operations and maintenance funds to reimburse countries for the  logistical and military support they provided to U.S. military operations in  Iraq. DOD refers to these funds as coalition support funds. Congress has  continued to make such funds available in each subsequent fiscal year.  Second, DOD\u2019s annual Appropriations Act in 2005 authorized DOD to use  funds from its operations and maintenance accounts to provide supplies  and services; transportation, including airlift and sealift; and other  logistical support to coalition forces supporting military and stability  operations in Iraq. DOD refers to these funds as lift and sustain funds. This  authority has also been continued in subsequent appropriations acts.", "According to a DOD official, both coalition support funds and lift and  sustain funds are used for any requirements that could be appropriately  paid for from operations and maintenance accounts, including airlift,  sealift, and sustainment services such as feeding and billeting for coalition  troops, among other things. In addition, a DOD official stated that both of  these funds are used to support nations whose economic conditions  prevent them from fully funding their troops\u2019 presence in Iraq. The key  distinction between the coalition support and the lift and sustain funds is  that coalition support funds are used to reimburse countries for costs they  incur, and lift and sustain funds are used to reimburse U.S. military  departments for services they provide to support eligible countries.", "Third, the State Department provided peacekeeping operations (PKO)  funds in 2003 and 2004 to provide basic supplies and equipment such as  armor and medical supplies to coalition troops in Iraq. These funds were  used to make initial equipment purchases for countries participating in  Polish and U.S.-led divisions in Iraq.", "Many nations and various international organizations are supporting the  efforts to rebuild Iraq through multilateral or bilateral assistance.  U.N.  Security Council Resolution 1511 of October 16, 2003, urged member  states and international and regional organizations to support the Iraq  reconstruction effort.  On October 23-24, 2003, an international donors  conference was held in Madrid, with 76 countries, 20 international  organizations, and 13 nongovernmental organizations participating."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Troop Contributions from Coalition Members Have Declined and Represent a Small Percentage of Total Forces", "paragraphs": ["As of May 2007, 25 coalition nations were contributing about 12,600 troops  to multinational force operations in Iraq.

As of October 2006, coalition troops in this sector were  from Italy, Japan, Australia, Romania, Denmark, Portugal, Czech Republic,  and Lithuania. Since that time, Italy and Portugal have withdrawn troops  from military operations in Iraq. The United Kingdom has provided the  largest number of non-U.S. coalition troops, peaking at 46,000 from March  through April 2003, then declining to 7,100 in November 2006. British  forces have conducted combat operations to improve the security  environment and have trained Iraqi security forces, among other things.  They had sustained 147 fatalities as of May 1, 2007. The United Kingdom  announced that it will begin withdrawing troops in 2007 but has pledged to  maintain a presence in Iraq into 2008.", "Poland has led operations in the MND-Central South, which is south of  Baghdad, since September 2003.

Poland\u2019s highest troop level was 2500, declining to 900 by October 2006.

Their peak number  of troops was 3,600 troops in that year but declined to 1,600 in March 2007.  Their missions have included medical, humanitarian, and reconstruction  efforts.

Figure 4 shows the countries that have  contributed troops between 2003 and 2007. According to State Department  officials and government press releases, the decline in the number of  troops can be attributed to completion of missions, domestic political  considerations, and the deteriorating security condition in Iraq.", "As the figure shows, eight countries withdrew their troops from Iraq  during 2004. For example, in mid-April 2004, the new government of Spain  announced that it would withdraw its 1,300 troops from Iraq. The  government withdrew the troops much earlier than the United States  expected, after violence escalated in the Spanish area of operations in  Iraq.

However, one exception to this policy was the decision in 2005 to  reimburse the United Kingdom about $5.6 million for improvements it  made to Royal Air Force (RAF) Base Akritori on Cyprus to accommodate  U.S. requirements for lift and refueling needs.  Jordan was the next largest  recipient of support, receiving reimbursement or services worth about  $300 million for border operations and other activities.", "It is important to note that the United States also has provided security  assistance funds to develop and modernize the militaries of several  countries contributing to operations in Iraq. Security assistance has  included military equipment, services, and training.
