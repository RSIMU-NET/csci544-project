There was considerable variation in tax rates across these taxpayers. The average U.S. effective tax rate on the foreign-source income of these large corporations was around 4 percent, reflecting the effects of both the foreign tax credit and tax deferral on this type of income. Effective tax rates on the foreign operations of U.S. MNCs vary considerably by country. According to estimates for 2004, Bermuda, Ireland, Singapore, Switzerland, the United Kingdom (UK) Caribbean Islands, and China had relatively low rates among countries that hosted significant shares of U.S. business activity, while Italy, Japan, Germany, Brazil, and Mexico had relatively high rates. U.S. business activity (measured by sales, value added, employment, compensation, physical assets, and net income) increased in absolute terms both domestically and abroad from 1989 through 2004, but the relative share of activity that was based in foreign affiliates increased. Nevertheless, as of 2004, over 60 percent of the activity (by all six measures) of U.S. MNCs remained located in the United States. The U.K., Canada, and Germany are the leading foreign locations of U.S. businesses by all measures except income. Reporting of the geographic sources of income is susceptible to manipulation for tax planning purposes and appears to be influenced by differences in tax rates across countries. Most of the countries studied with relatively low effective tax rates have income shares significantly larger than their shares of the business measures least likely to be affected by income shifting practices: physical assets, compensation, and employment. The opposite relationship holds for most of the high tax countries studied."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As globalization has intensified, cross-border investment has grown  dramatically.

(MNCs have various ways to shift income reported for tax  purposes, including the manner in which they price transactions among  affiliated entities within the corporate group.) Statutory tax rates do not  provide a complete measure of the burden that a tax system imposes on  business income because many other aspects of the system, such as  exemptions, deferrals, tax credits, and other forms of incentives, also  determine the amount of tax a business ultimately pays on its income.

A parent corporation may directly own (either wholly or  partially) multiple subsidiary corporations. In turn, these subsidiaries may  own other corporate subsidiaries, and any of these corporations may own  stakes in partnerships. A domestic parent corporation (one that is  organized under U.S. laws) may head a large group of affiliated businesses  that includes both domestic and foreign subsidiaries and partnerships. The  timing of when these various entities pay U.S. tax on their income and the  tax return on which their income and taxes are reported varies depending  on both the location of the entities and choices made by the parent  corporation. These timing and reporting differences, which are  summarized in table 1 and table 2, matter in the estimation of effective tax  rates. In particular, the fact that the income of a controlled foreign  corporation (CFC) is not reported or taxed on a U.S. return until it is  recognized under Subpart F or repatriated in the form of dividends means  that an effective tax rate estimate based solely on income reported for tax  purposes would not reflect the tax treatment of a significant component of  the income of MNCs. This limitation is one reason why prior analysts have  used income reported on financial statements, rather than tax-reportable  income, when computing effective tax rates.", "Two aspects of the U.S. tax treatment of foreign income lead to much  lower U.S. tax burdens on foreign income than on domestic income, which  is one reason why it makes sense to look at these effective tax rates  separately. The first aspect is the aforementioned deferral of tax on the  income of CFCs generally until that income is repatriated. The second  aspect is the foreign tax credit, which is designed to prevent the double  taxation of foreign income (once by the government of the country in  which the income is earned and once by the United States). In effect, the  United States taxes the foreign income only to the extent that the U.S.  corporate tax rate exceeds the foreign rate of tax on that income. If the  foreign rate of tax is equal to or exceeds the U.S. rate, the United States  collects no tax on that income.", "Department of the Treasury tax regulations generally effective since  January 1, 1997 have an important influence on some of the effective tax  rate estimates and data on business activity location that we present  below. These regulations, commonly known as check-the-box rules,  permit corporate groups to treat a wholly owned entity either as a separate  corporation or to \u201cdisregard\u201d it as an unincorporated branch simply by  checking a box on a tax form. Taxpayers have used this flexibility to  create \u201chybrid entities,\u201d which are business operations treated as  corporations by one country\u2019s tax authority and as unincorporated branch  operations by another\u2019s. Hybrid entities can be used in a variety of ways  for tax-planning purposes. In one example, a U.S. MNC can put substantial  equity into a finance subsidiary located in a low-tax country. That  subsidiary then can lend money to an affiliate in a high-tax country to  finance most of the latter\u2019s operations. The high-tax affiliate makes tax- deductible interest payments to the finance subsidiary, which will pay a  low rate of tax on this interest income. Prior to the check-the-box rules the  interest income of the finance subsidiary would have been subject to U.S.  tax on a current basis under the subpart F rules. Now, however, the  taxpayer can, in certain circumstances, treat the high-tax affiliate as an  unincorporated branch of the low-tax subsidiary, so the interest payment  is not recognized as a transaction for U.S. tax purposes. Subject to  Subpart F, the United States only taxes that income if it is repatriated.", "The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 provided a temporary incentive  for U.S. MNCs to repatriate income from their CFCs. The act allowed  recipients to make a special, one-time election to deduct 85 percent of  \u201cextraordinary\u201d dividends received from CFCs during either the recipient\u2019s  last tax year beginning before October 22, 2004, or its first tax year  beginning after that date, provided that the CFCs\u2019 dividends were not  funded by money borrowed from their U.S. shareholders and provided that  the repatriated funds were used for allowable domestic investments.  Dividends were extraordinary to the extent that they exceeded the average  dividends that the shareholder received from its CFCs over the previous 5  years (disregarding the highest and lowest amounts out of those 5 years).  IRS tracked the amount of qualified dividends repatriated under this  provision and found that 843 corporate owners of CFCs reported the  receipt of $312.3 billion in qualified dividends from tax years 2004 through  2006. Only $9.1 billion of this total was repatriated during tax year 2004,  the year on which most of our data analyses are based.

The income reporting in these financial statements (commonly  known as book income) differs in important ways from the income that  the corporations report on their federal tax returns. One key difference is  that book income will include a parent corporations\u2019 share (in proportion  to its ownership share) of all of the income of all subsidiaries, both  domestic and foreign, in which it has at least a 20 percent ownership  stake. Other differences arise because income reported for tax purposes  reflects the effects of various incentives and disincentives embedded in  the tax code (such as accelerated depreciation to encourage investment  and limits on deductible compensation to discourage excessive payments).", "In the early 1980s, the Joint Committee on Taxation developed an  approach for using book income and taxes to estimate effective tax rates  of foreign taxes on foreign-source income, U.S. taxes on domestic income,  and worldwide tax on worldwide income. A limitation of this approach  was that the book measures of taxes did not allow a distinction between  U.S. taxes paid on domestic income and the U.S. residual tax on foreign- source income. This limitation can be overcome by using data from  Schedule M-3 of the federal tax return, which just recently became  available to researchers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Information Available from Schedule M-3", "paragraphs": ["Beginning with tax year 2004, U.S. domestic corporations with assets of  $10 million or more are required to include the Schedule M-3 in their tax  returns.

Data from the Schedule M-3 allow for the  computation of effective tax rates, with some limitations, that use book  measures of income and taxes actually reported on returns. As a result,  one can take advantage of the broader scope of foreign-source income  reported in financial statements and the more detailed information on  taxes paid, which permits a separation of U.S. taxes paid on domestic and  foreign income. However, some data limitations remain (these are  discussed in detail in app. I). The most significant limitation is that the  data do not permit a comprehensive measurement of foreign income  without some double counting of income. This limitation is best addressed  by estimating a range of effective tax rates for foreign income using  alternative measures of income. The most inclusive measure is likely to  contain some double counting and, therefore, cause an understatement of  the effective rate. The least inclusive measure avoids double counting but  will leave out some income that should be included, causing an  overstatement of the effective rate.

First, in  cases where a U.S. MNC has paid foreign income taxes at a rate that is  close or equal to the U.S. tax rate, the U.S. foreign tax credit eliminates  most or all of the U.S. tax liability on that corporation\u2019s foreign-source  income. Second, in many cases a substantial portion of the foreign-source  income earned by U.S. MNCs is not taxed until it is repatriated to the  United States. The denominator of our tax rate reflects all of the foreign  income that was earned in 2004, but the numerator includes only taxes  that were actually paid in 2004. Consequently, the numerator does not  include any tax on nonrepatriated 2004 income; however, it does include  tax on repatriated dividends paid out of income that CFCs earned prior to  2004. It is important to recognize that tax deferral does not necessarily  mean that the tax will never be paid.", "Figure 2 presents estimates for the distribution of effective tax rates that  are based on our broadest income measure. The distributions of effective  tax rates based on our other income measures did not look dramatically  different. Approximately 80 percent of the large taxpayers with positive  foreign income, accounting for about 30 percent of that population\u2019s total  foreign income, paid no federal income tax on that income. An additional  8.5 percent of this population, accounting for about 52 percent of the  foreign income, had positive average effective U.S. tax rates of 5 percent  or less. Less than 10 percent of this population had effective tax rates over  10 percent. The taxpayers with the higher effective rates may have had  relatively high ratios of repatriations over current-year income from their  CFCs, or the dividends that they repatriated may have been paid out of  income earned in relatively low-tax locations.", "Due to the incentives under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, the  ratio of repatriations to CFC income may have been different in 2004 than  it was in surrounding years. Some U.S. MNCs may have delayed  repatriations in the year or two prior to the year in which the made a one- time \u201cextraordinary\u201d dividend payment, so that their repatriations first  were lower than normal, then became higher than normal. The timing of  this behavior could have varied across firms, depending on when their  management became sufficiently confident that the tax preference would  be enacted, the timing of their tax years, and other factors. The IRS data  on repatriated income presented earlier suggest that the 2004 ratio of  repatriations is likely to be lower than the ratio for 2005 and, perhaps,  2006. The effects of these differences on the average effective rates of tax  on foreign-source income in all of those years are uncertain. On the one  hand, a higher rate of repatriation would mean that more of the CFCs\u2019  income would become subject to U.S. taxation in that year; on the other  hand, the temporary deduction would effectively exclude 85 percent of the  repatriations from U.S. taxable income."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Tax Credits Have a Relatively Small Effect on U.S. Average Effective Tax Rates", "paragraphs": ["We estimated the effect of federal income tax credits (other than the  foreign tax credit) on U.S. average effective tax rates by computing rates  before and after the inclusion of the credits.

We also  found that tax credits reduced the precredit tax liabilities on foreign- source income by a weighted average 0.8 percentage points. These  estimates indicate the extent to which tax preferences in the form of tax  credits reduce corporate tax burdens. We have no way to precisely  measure the effects of other forms of tax preferences, such as exemptions  or accelerated depreciation.

The income from CFCs represents a significant  component of U.S. businesses\u2019 foreign-source income. We used IRS data  on CFCs for 2004 to estimate that the average combined (U.S. and foreign)  effective tax rate on the worldwide income of CFCs (excluding those that  had negative income) was 16.1 percent. One limitation of this estimation  approach is that when aggregated, the CFC income data double counts  income earned by lower-tier CFCs that is distributed to higher-tier CFCs in  the form of dividends. We computed a separate effective tax rate for  manufacturing CFCs only, which exclude holding companies that may be  used to accumulate income from lower-tier CFCs. We found that the rate  for manufacturing CFCs, at 15.4 percent, was actually lower than the rate  for all CFCs. One possible explanation for this result is that, if U.S. MNCs  do route substantial amounts of dividends to holding company CFCs, the  dividend-paying businesses may be hybrid entities that are disregarded for  U.S. tax-reporting purposes rather than CFCs themselves. That practice  would make sense from a tax-planning standpoint. Under such an  arrangement, the income of the hybrid entities would not be reported  separately in the IRS data we used; it would be counted only once, as part  of the income of a higher-tier CFC.", "Our estimate for the effective rate of tax on manufacturing CFCs is  significantly lower than the 21 percent effective rate that Altshuler and  Grubert estimated for manufacturing CFCs for tax year 2001. Those  authors noted that the effective tax rate has declined steadily from 33  percent in 1980. Our estimate suggests that effective rates may have  continued to drop since 2001. This decline predominantly represents a  reduction in the amount of tax paid to foreign governments, not to the  United States. Altshuler and Grubert conclude that a significant portion of  the effective tax rate reduction may be attributable to the increased tax- planning flexibility that U.S. MNCs have enjoyed since the introduction of  the check-the-box rules. Oosterhuis (2006) points to Altshuler and  Grubert\u2019s recent estimates as evidence of how the check-the-box rules  have enabled U.S. MNCs to reduce their payments of foreign taxes.  Oosterhuis notes that, although a reduction in foreign taxes may make U.S.  MNCs more competitive overseas against foreign MNCs, it also makes  foreign investment by U.S. MNCs more attractive relative to investment in  the United States.", "Another approach for estimating the effective tax rate on the foreign- source income of U.S. businesses is to use BEA\u2019s data on the operations of  U.S. MNCs, which includes the amount of net income earned and foreign  taxes paid by foreign affiliates of these MNCs. In the case of U.S.  majority-owned foreign affiliates, the BEA data permit one to compute net  income with and without equity income. The latter measure of income  eliminates some important forms of double counting (discussed below).  An unavoidable limitation of BEA\u2019s foreign affiliate income measure for  the purposes of estimating effective tax rates is that it includes negative  values for affiliates that incur losses. As a consequence, when the income  data are aggregated at the country level or for the full population, the net  value will be lower than the aggregate income of just those businesses that  are profitable. In the absence of any offsetting factors, effective tax rates  that have this income measure as the denominator will overstate the rates  that profitable businesses pay. Using data from BEA\u2019s 2004 benchmark  survey, we estimate that the average effective tax rate on foreign affiliates  was 28.7 percent, significantly higher than our estimate based on CFC  data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Effective Tax Rates by Principal Place of Business", "paragraphs": ["Although the CFC data may be preferable to the BEA data for estimating  an overall average effective tax rate for the foreign operations of U.S.  MNCs, the former data provide an imperfect basis for estimating average  effective tax rates for specific countries. Although the CFC data can be  aggregated by principal place of business, the allocation of income and  taxes paid by principal place of business is not perfectly correlated with  where the income and taxes of the CFCs are actually earned and paid  because some CFCs earn income and pay taxes in multiple locations. The  growing use of hybrid entities has likely reduced this correlation,  particularly for CFCs located in countries that are favored locations for  accumulating income. Some hybrids may formerly have been CFCs with  separate U.S. tax filing requirements that indicated where their principal  operations were located. Now, as hybrids, their income and tax data  would not be separated from that of the CFCs into which they have  become absorbed for U.S. tax-reporting purposes. Consequently, the data  for those hybrids are now associated with the country where the CFC has  its principal operations, rather than where the hybrid has its own  operations. In contrast, the BEA data treat the disregarded hybrid entities  as separate affiliates, and their data are associated with the countries  where their physical assets are located or where their primary activities  are carried out. An important exception to this general treatment applies  in the case of holding companies. When a corporation has physical assets  or operations in multiple foreign countries, it is classified as a holding  company and the assets assigned to its country of incorporation include  the equity that it holds in the operations in the other countries. Those  outside operations are reported as separate foreign affiliates, so when the  BEA data are aggregated there is some double counting of assets.", "Figure 3 compares the three effective tax rates we estimated for 17 of the  most important foreign locations of U.S. MNC operations, based on their  shares of various measures of U.S. business activity. In most cases the  effective tax rates based on BEA data are higher than those based on  either set of CFC data. Despite the variation in results from the three  different measures, one subset of countries (shown in the top panel) can  be identified as having relatively low effective rates of tax on the U.S.  business operations located there. Similarly, a subset of countries (shown  in the middle panel) has relatively high rates (over 18 percent) by any of  the three measures. Of the remaining four countries, Australia is near the  boundary between high and low effective rates by all three measures, the  Netherlands and the United Kingdom are shown to have low effective tax  rates according to the CFC data but high rates according to the BEA data,  and Luxembourg appears to have very low overall effective tax rates, but  not for manufacturing CFCs.

The two other studies, which  covered limited selections of countries, suggested that effective tax rates  in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, France and Australia  were within 5 percentage points of each other, while Canada had a  significantly lower rate and Japan a significantly higher rate. A  comparison of the country rankings based on these estimated effective tax  rates for all corporations and the rankings based on our estimates of  effective rates for U.S. CFCs and other foreign affiliates of U.S. MNCs  reveals both consistencies (low rates for Ireland and high rates for Italy  and Japan) and inconsistencies (in the cases of Netherlands and the  United Kingdom)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "A Growing Share of U.S. Businesses\u2019 Activity Is Located Abroad, and the Sourcing of Income Appears to Be Influenced by Foreign Country Tax Rates", "paragraphs": ["Business activity can be measured in a variety of ways and the location of  these activities can be influenced by numerous factors, with certain  factors having greater influence on some activities than on others.

In contrast, all of the countries with  relatively high effective tax rates, except for Japan, have income shares  that are smaller than their shares of physical assets, compensation, and  employment. Of the four countries with a mix of both high and low  estimated effective tax rates, the United Kingdom bears a similarity to the  high-tax pattern and Luxembourg to the low-tax pattern, while Australia is  balanced across all eight measures.

The problem with this broad measure is that it likely  double counts some income in the aggregate. Lines 5a/b list 100 percent of  the income of majority owned foreign subsidiaries, even if the taxpayer  filing the Schedule M-3 owns less than 100 percent of the subsidiary. Thus,  5a/b overstates the consolidated group\u2019s share of the income or loss of  majority owned foreign subsidiaries. This reporting limitation, by itself,  would not be a problem for our aggregate measure of the foreign income  of Schedule M-3 filers, except to the extent to which the minority owners  of the less-than-100-percent-owned subsidiaries are not Schedule M-3 filers  themselves. However, a larger potential overstatement problem arises  when we include equity-method income and dividends and distributions in  our measure. For example, if a foreign subsidiary is owned 75 percent by  one U.S. parent and 25 percent by a second U.S. parent, line 5a/b would  provide 100 percent of the income of the foreign subsidiary and line 1 in  Part II of the Schedule M-3 providing the equity method income of foreign  subsidiaries would add another 25 percent of the income of that  subsidiary.

If the corporation is  below the credit limit, then there is a residual US tax on repatriated  foreign income, which would be included separately in the U.S. taxes on  foreign-source income measure. In that case the U.S. tax on domestic  income is found by removing the initial U.S. tax on repatriated foreign  income (the credit limit) from the U.S. tax on worldwide income (Form  1120 tax liability without foreign tax credit). In both cases, the foreign tax  credit limit represents the potential tax due on foreign-source income, and  by removing it the remaining tax is on domestic income.", "U.S. residual tax on foreign-source income was calculated as the  difference between the foreign tax credit limit and the foreign tax credit  (with any negative values treated as zeros).

The U.S. residual tax on  foreign-source income is zero if the corporation has paid substantial  foreign taxes such that its foreign tax credit limit is binding. For example,  if a corporation paid taxes in a single country with a tax rate of 40 percent,  the United States would not collect any residual tax on the repatriated  income because the taxes paid abroad would be greater than the taxes due  in the United States at the corporate rate of 35 percent. The residual tax is  positive as long as the corporation\u2019s creditable foreign taxes paid are  below the foreign tax credit limit.
