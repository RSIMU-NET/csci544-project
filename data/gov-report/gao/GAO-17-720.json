For example, for 2020 through 2039, one study estimated between $4 billion and $6 billion in annual coastal property damages from sea level rise and more frequent and intense storms. Also, under this study, the Southeast likely faces greater effects than other regions because of coastal property damages (see figure).", "Information about the potential economic effects of climate change could inform decision makers about significant potential damages in different U.S. sectors or regions. According to several experts and prior GAO work, this information could help federal decision makers identify significant climate risks as an initial step toward managing such risks. This is consistent with, for example, National Academies leading practices, which call for climate change risk management efforts that focus on where immediate attention is needed. The federal government has not undertaken strategic government-wide planning to manage climate risks by using information on the potential economic effects of climate change to identify significant risks and craft appropriate federal responses.

According to a May 2014  assessment by the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP),  the impacts and costs of extreme events\u2014such as floods, drought, and  other events\u2014will increase in significance as what are considered rare  events become more common and intense because of climate change. A  November 2016 assessment by the Office of Management and Budget  (OMB) and the Council of Economic Advisers found that recurring costs  that the federal government incurred as a result of climate change could  increase by $12 billion to $35 billion per year by mid-century and by $34  billion to $112 billion per year by late-century, the equivalent of $9 billion  to $28 billion per year in today\u2019s economy. For example, according to  this assessment, wildland fire suppression costs have increased as fire  seasons have grown longer and the size and severity of wildland fires  have increased, in part because of climate change.", "Reflecting such observed and projected climate-related costs to the  federal government, in February 2013 we placed Limiting the Federal  Government\u2019s Fiscal Exposure by Better Managing Climate Change  Risks on our list of agencies and program areas that are high risk  because of their vulnerabilities to fraud, waste, abuse, and  mismanagement or are in most need of transformation. In that report, we  identified a number of areas in which the federal government faces fiscal  exposure from climate change risks, including its role as (1) the owner  and operator of extensive infrastructure and federal property vulnerable to  climate impacts, (2) the insurer of property and crops vulnerable to  climate impacts, and (3) the provider of aid in response to disasters. As  an example illustrating the government\u2019s fiscal exposure because of its  ownership of infrastructure, in May 2014, we reported that the  Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) 2010 and 2014 Quadrennial Defense  Reviews stated that climate change poses risks to defense infrastructure,  particularly on the coasts. This defense infrastructure consists of more  than 555,000 defense facilities and 28 million acres of land, with a  replacement value of close to $850 billion.", "As reported in our 2015 High-Risk update, climate change adaptation\u2014 defined as adjusting natural or human systems in response to actual or  expected climate change\u2014is one way for the federal government to  manage climate risks. Adaptation can help protect vulnerable sectors  and communities that might be affected by changes in the climate.  Adaptation measures to protect infrastructure, for example, include  raising river or coastal dikes to protect infrastructure from sea level rise,  building higher bridges, and increasing the capacity of storm water  systems. According to a 2010 National Academies report, choices  regarding how and when to adapt vary greatly, and priorities for  addressing climate risks through adaptation need to be set relative to  other important priorities. Setting such priorities for the federal  government would require an understanding of relative risks across  economic sectors, such as agriculture, health, and energy. To more  effectively understand such risks and the range of options for managing  them, the National Academies, in its 2016 review of USGCRP\u2019s strategic  plan update, reported that social science research, including economic  research, is needed to support effective decision-making processes.", "You asked us to review the potential economic effects of climate change  impacts and resulting risks to the federal government.

We then reviewed these studies using standard  economic principles, including a review of objective and scope,  methodology, analysis of effects, sensitivity analysis, and  documentation. Second, we interviewed 26 selected experts, including  agency officials, researchers, and consultants. We identified these  experts through our literature search and snowball sampling based on,  among other things, their expertise related to our objectives, such as  knowledge of the strengths and limitations of methods used to estimate  the economic effects of climate change.

The different types of climate and economic models include the  following:", "Climate models: Climate models are mathematical representations  of physical, chemical, and biological processes in Earth\u2019s climate  system, including the atmosphere, land surface, ocean, and sea ice.  These models use scenarios of future greenhouse gas emissions as  input, such as a scenario in which current trends in greenhouse gas  emissions continue or a scenario in which future emissions are  reduced. Based on these scenarios, the models simulate future  changes in climate variables, such as changes in temperature and the  amount of precipitation. In the United States, global-scale climate  models are developed at federally funded institutions, such as the  National Center for Atmospheric Research. The American Climate  Prospectus and Climate Change Impacts and Risk Analysis studies  both used climate models from the National Center for Atmospheric  Research, including the Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse- gas Induced Climate Change and the Community Atmosphere Model.", "Economic models for individual sectors: These models estimate  the direct economic effects in certain sectors from changes in climate  variables, such as temperature, and related climate impacts, such as  sea level rise. Some economic models for individual sectors are  based on relatively new econometric research that uses historically  observed relationships between climate variables and economic  effects to assess the potential economic effects of climate change on  certain segments of the economy. For example, the American Climate  Prospectus study used analyses of the historical relationships among  temperature and changes in mortality, labor productivity, and violent  crime, among other things, to project the economic effects of climate  change. Other types of sector-specific models use known or  theoretical relationships among climate variables and economic  effects to make projections. These types of process-based models  include, for example, the Forest and Agricultural Sector Optimization  Model, used in the Climate Change Impacts and Risks Analysis study,  which estimates changes in market outcomes associated with  projected impacts of climate change on U.S. crop and forest yields.  The 2015 Climate Change Impacts and Risks Analysis report included  18 process-based models and 2 econometric models, according to  EPA officials. Also, a version of the U.S. Energy Information  Administration\u2019s National Energy Modeling System, maintained by the  Rhodium Group and used in the American Climate Prospectus study,  models the impact of changes in temperature on energy demand,  power generation, and electricity costs.", "Economy-wide models: These models\u2014called Computable General  Equilibrium (CGE) models\u2014can help assess how the entire economy,  including individual sectors or regions, might react to the impacts of  climate change and how their reactions can have implications for  other sectors and regions. For example, as a result of changes in  climate (e.g., higher temperatures), increases in energy demand and  costs can increase the price of a wide range of goods, and decreases  in crop yields in Iowa can affect food prices nationwide. As they  encompass multiple sectors in a model of the U.S. economy, CGE  models can more fully account for interactions between sectors than  individual sector models can, potentially affecting findings on the  effects of climate change. The American Climate Prospectus used a  CGE model to examine how these types of interactions among  sectors affect the magnitude and regional variation of effects on the  sectors analyzed in the study. According to EPA officials, although  the Climate Change Impacts and Risk Analysis study did not use a  CGE model to analyze interactions among sectors, some interaction  between sectors was analyzed. For example, water supply and  availability projections from the water balance model were used to  inform irrigation supply in the agricultural sector.", "Figure 1 provides an example of how climate models, economic models  for specific sectors, and economy-wide models can be linked together  sequentially in a framework to estimate the economic effects of climate  change.", "While the two national-scale studies of the economic effects of climate  change across sectors in the United States use sequential modeling  frameworks similar to the one shown in figure 1, other methods\u2014referred  to by several experts we interviewed as complex integrated assessment  models\u2014also incorporate feedback between the different climate and  economic modeling components. Such models include the Integrated  Global System Model, developed at the Massachusetts Institute of  Technology, and the Global Change Assessment Model, developed at the  Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. Some experts we interviewed  noted that these complex integrated assessment models have  traditionally been used to analyze the effects of different policies on the  energy sector. The models currently have limited capability to quantify  economic effects on individual sectors, according to some experts we  interviewed.

According to literature  we reviewed, future greenhouse gas emissions are one key source of  uncertainty because they will depend on factors that are extremely  challenging to predict decades into the future, such as rates of economic  and population growth, technological developments, and policy decisions.  Climate models use as input different scenarios that represent a range of  potential future greenhouse gas emissions. These scenarios are based  on various actions that could be taken to reduce future emissions, such  as particular policies initiated by the international community. For  example, the Climate Change Impacts and Risk Analysis study used a  scenario based on significant global action being taken to reduce future  emissions. The study does not specify what significant global action  would cost the United States, or what it would entail, and such action may  or may not occur. concentration.

For example,  some sector-specific models assume that historical observed  relationships between weather events and economic output variables\u2014 such as between temperature and crop production\u2014will represent the  effects of long-term climate change. However, over the long time periods  under which climate change is expected to occur, individuals, businesses,  and government institutions may develop new approaches or  technologies to adapt to climate change, lessening its economic effect.  For example, one expert said that farmers may respond by making  different crop choices. On the other hand, future climate change may  have effects that are not revealed in historical events. According to one  study, the likelihood that the climate will produce unprecedented effects\u2014 for example, heat so extreme that it can induce heat stroke in healthy  individuals\u2014will increase as temperatures rise outside the realm of past  human experience.", "Similarly, data showing how populations will adapt to climate change are  limited, so the methods use different assumptions about the extent to  which society will adapt to climate change in different sectors. For  instance, the Climate Change Impacts and Risk Analysis study assumed  that for some sectors, such as agriculture, cost-effective adaptation  actions will be taken, such as adjusting the type of crops grown in a  region. For the coastal sector, the study considered four adaptation  strategies: beach nourishment (adding sand), property elevation,  shoreline armoring (using physical structures to protect from erosion), and  property abandonment. However, for other sectors, such as the labor  sector, the study did not take into account potential adaptation  measures\u2014such as using potential technological advances to reduce  exposure\u2014that could reduce future economic effects. The American  Climate Prospectus study generally assumed that no adaptation would  occur in response to climate change. Also, the methods might not  incorporate potential market inefficiencies. For example, in the Climate  Change Impacts and Risk Analysis, the coastal sector analysis does not  consider how subsidized insurance might affect adaptation actions. If  insurance prices do not reflect actual risks\u2014such as in the presence of  insurance subsidies\u2014insurance availability might disincentivize  adaptation actions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Incomplete Coverage of Sectors, Interactions, and Impacts", "paragraphs": ["The methods have not included all sectors because the U.S. economy is  complex and the information available for different sectors and climate  impacts varies.

In addition, the methods do  not fully cover some of the sectors that are included. For example, the  American Climate Prospectus study\u2019s analysis of the agricultural sector  included the impacts of temperature and precipitation changes on the  largest commodity crops\u2014maize, wheat, soy, and cotton\u2014but not on  fruits, vegetables, nuts, or livestock, which dominate the agricultural  sectors in some states.", "Furthermore, the methods do not always capture interactions between  sectors that may influence economic effects. Such interactions include  the ability of capital and labor to move between sectors in the economy,  potentially lessening the economic effects of climate change; the impact  of changes in water supply on the cost of electric power generation; or the  effects of an extreme event cascading throughout a region over time by  redistributing the workforce or raising the cost of capital.", "Finally, the methods do not include potential impacts that fall outside of  the market economy\u2014such as the loss of species from ecosystem  disruptions and threats to endangered historical or cultural monuments  from rising sea levels or more intense storms\u2014because many of these  impacts are difficult to quantify in monetary terms."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Challenges of Modeling over Long Time Frames", "paragraphs": ["Modeling the effects of climate change is challenging because, among  other things, it often involves projections over long periods into the future,  and these projections become more uncertain over time.

As a result of this high degree of uncertainty, the methods require that  modelers make assumptions about these factors. For example, the  American Climate Prospectus study assumed that the structure of the  U.S. economy would remain as it is today\u2014an assumption the study  notes is almost guaranteed to be wrong\u2014and therefore provided a  projection of the effect of potential climate changes through the end of  this century on today\u2019s economy, as opposed to projecting these effects  on the economy of the future.

According to OMB,  benefits or costs that occur sooner are generally more valuable than  those that occur later. However, according to the literature reviewed and  some experts interviewed, the appropriate discount rate to apply when  considering benefits and costs across generations, such as those  associated with climate change, is subject to much debate. According to  one of its authors, this debate was one reason why the American Climate  Prospectus study did not present its estimates in discounted terms. For  several sectors, the Climate Change Impacts and Risk Analysis study  presented some estimates in discounted present value terms consistent  with OMB and EPA guidance but presented undiscounted estimates of  economic effects for all sectors for 2050 and 2100. Nevertheless,  climate change could have both positive and negative potential economic  effects at different points in time in the future. Discounting is a way to  account for differences in the timing of these effects.", "As a result of the challenges of modeling over long time frames,  economic analyses may assess the uncertainty in assumptions and data  used in making long-term projections. For example, according to one  author, the American Climate Prospectus study provided ranges of  estimated economic effects for each sector to help account for uncertainty  associated with the underlying climate and economic models, such as  uncertainty in climate sensitivity. The Climate Change Impacts and Risk  Analysis study primarily reported results as point estimates, not providing  a range of estimated effects, and reported on only a limited assessment  of uncertainty.

The results of this  study, shown in table 2, were primarily presented in terms of the benefits  associated with significant global action to reduce greenhouse gas  emissions.", "According to EPA officials involved in the study, the results highlighted  sectors with potentially higher economic effects of climate change. For  some sectors, the study estimated the costs of climate changes without  any emissions reductions. For example, the study reported $5.0 trillion in  economic costs to coastal property from climate change through 2100  (discounted at 3 percent). However, the study did not explain how these  estimated costs were obtained, and these estimated costs did not match  those reported in the underlying journal papers. EPA officials told us  that the scenario that led to this estimate was added as a result of  reviewer comments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "National-Scale Studies and Experts Interviewed Suggested That the Potential Economic Effects of Climate Change Could Be Unevenly Distributed across Sectors and Regions", "paragraphs": ["According to the two national-scale studies and several experts we  interviewed, potential economic effects could be unevenly distributed  across sectors and regions. First, the studies and some experts  suggested that climate change will affect certain sectors more than  others. The results of the American Climate Prospectus study suggested  that nationwide economic effects on sectors, including human health,  labor, coastal infrastructure, and energy, could exceed the economic  effects on the agriculture and crime sectors. The factors driving the  economic effects on the health, labor, coastal infrastructure, and energy  sectors included costs associated with, respectively, (1) an increase in  premature mortality from higher temperatures, (2) reduced number of  hours worked because of high temperatures, (3) infrastructure damage  from increased flooding and storm surge, and (4) increased energy  demand. In the near term, the annual sector-specific economic effects  reported in this study for 2020 through 2039 varied from a range of $8.5  billion in benefits to $9.2 billion in costs for the agriculture sector up to a  range of $0.1 billion to $22 billion in costs from changes in labor  productivity. In the long term, for 2080 through 2099, the annual sector- specific economic effects reported in this study varied from a range of $12  billion in benefits to $53 billion in costs for the agriculture sector up to a  range of $90 billion to $506 billion in mortality costs for the health sector.", "The Climate Change Impacts and Risk Analysis study suggested that the  benefits from emissions reductions would affect some sectors more than  others. For example, among the sectors analyzed, the study reported that  emissions reductions would generate relatively larger effects in 2050 for  sectors relating to human health, water resources, and electric power.  The factors driving the estimated economic effects in this study included  lost labor hours and premature mortality from poor air quality and extreme  heat in the health sector, costs to water users\u2014such as domestic and  industrial water users\u2014when sufficient water is not available, and costs to  expand power system capacity in the energy sector.", "Another difference in the economic effects across different sectors  identified in the studies is that adaptation actions can reduce the negative  economic effects of climate change in particular sectors, according to the  national-scale studies and several experts we interviewed. For example,  the Climate Change Impacts and Risk Analysis study reported that  protective adaptation measures\u2014such as beach nourishment, property  elevation, shoreline armoring, and property abandonment\u2014can reduce  projected coastal property damage in the contiguous United States. In  addition, some experts we interviewed said that adaptation actions in  coastal areas can be cost effective. However, according to the studies  and some experts, information on the cost-effectiveness of adaptation  actions in many other sectors remains limited.", "With regard to variation across regions, the studies suggested that the  economic effects of climate change could be more significant in some  geographic areas than others. For example, the American Climate  Prospectus study reported that depending on the specific climate impacts  evaluated, the combined direct net economic effects for each state could  range from annual benefits of 0.8 to 4.5 percent of economic output in  Vermont to annual costs of 10.1 to 24 percent of current economic output  in Florida by the end of the century. In the Tampa Bay, Florida, area  alone, the Climate Change Impacts and Risk Analysis study estimated  that damage to coastal property from sea level rise and storm surge could  reach $2.8 billion per year by 2100. Figure 2 shows examples of  potential economic effects in different U.S. geographic areas.", "According to the American Climate Prospectus study, the Southeast,  Midwest, and Great Plains regions will likely experience greater combined  economic effects than other regions, largely because of coastal property  damage in the Southeast and changes in crop yields in the Midwest and  Great Plains. The Climate Change Impacts and Risk Analysis study also  reported economic effects in particular regions. For instance, according to  the study, ocean acidification in the Pacific Northwest is already affecting  shellfish harvests, which the study projected could decline by 32 to 48  percent by the end of the century in a scenario without emissions  reductions. In addition, under the same scenario, the study estimated that  wildfires could burn an additional 1.9 million acres annually in the Rocky  Mountains by the end of the century, compared to today, which would  significantly increase wildfire response costs. Some experts noted the  importance of considering the economic effects of climate change in  specific sectors and regions because nationwide estimates can average  out some important differences. For example, in the agricultural sector,  climate change could cause economic benefits in northern regions of the  country from moderate warming, which could offset some agricultural  economic losses from more extreme heat in southern regions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "According to Leading Practices and Experts, Information on the Potential Economic Effects of Climate Change Could Help Decision Makers Better Manage Climate Risks", "paragraphs": ["Information on the potential economic effects of climate change could  help federal decision makers better manage climate risks, according to  leading practices for climate risk management and economic analysis we  reviewed and the views of several experts we interviewed. Several  experts we interviewed said that existing information on the potential  economic effects of climate change could help federal decision makers  identify significant climate risks to the federal government. Further,  additional economic information could help federal, state, local, and  private sector decision makers manage climate risks that drive federal  fiscal exposure."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Existing Information on Potential Economic Effects Could Help Identify Significant Climate Risks to the Federal Government", "paragraphs": ["Even though existing information on the potential economic effects of  climate change, such as that from the two national-scale studies, is  imprecise, it is a first step toward effective climate risk management at the  federal level. Several experts we interviewed said federal decision  makers could use the insight this information provides about economic  damages in various sectors or regions for different scenarios. Along with  other available information about current and future climate risks,  collectively this information could start informing federal decision makers  about climate risks in different sectors and identifying areas of high fiscal  exposure. For example, several experts we interviewed said that existing  research indicates that infrastructure in coastal areas faces high financial  risks relative to the risks posed to many other sectors or geographic  regions. In addition, according to some experts we interviewed,  projections about adverse economic effects in coastal areas, when  considered with other information\u2014for example, disaster costs already  incurred such as the approximately $50 billion appropriated for recovery  from Hurricane Sandy\u2014could help decision makers better understand the  potential magnitude of risks to coastal areas and identify vulnerable  coastal infrastructure as a source of potentially high fiscal exposure.", "Such a first step in risk assessment is consistent with leading practices  for climate risk management and federal standards for internal control.  The National Academies\u2019 2010 leading practices state that managing risk  in the context of climate change involves using the best information,  including economic information, to assess risks and determine priorities  for managing them. Further, in its 2010 report, the National Academies  concluded that an iterative process\u2014in which decisions are based on an  evolving understanding of the underlying natural and social science\u2014can  improve decisions related to climate change risk management because of  the opportunities it offers for considering uncertainty. This is consistent  with what we reported in December 2016\u2014that the first steps in  developing enterprise risk management involve identifying and assessing  risks to understand the likelihood of impacts and their associated  consequences. As we found in that report, federal managers often  handle complex and risky missions, such as preparing for and responding  to natural disasters and building and managing safe transportation  systems. While it is not possible to eliminate all uncertainties associated  with these missions, risk management strategies exist to help federal  managers anticipate and manage risks. In addition, under federal  standards for internal control, management\u2014in this case, the federal  government\u2014should identify, analyze, and respond to risks related to  achieving the defined objectives. For example, management estimates  the significance of a risk by considering the magnitude of impact,  likelihood of occurrence, and nature of the risk\u2014which provides a basis  for responding to the risks\u2014and management may need to conduct  periodic risk assessments.", "Our past work and the work of others have reported that climate change  impacts and their economic effects have already cost the federal  government money and pose future risks that could lead to increased  federal fiscal exposure. As we concluded in our October 2009 report,  given the potential magnitude of climate change and the lead time  needed to adapt, preparing for these impacts now may reduce the need  for far more costly steps in the decades to come. For example, we  reported in our February 2013 High-Risk update that federal disaster aid  functions as the insurance of last resort in certain circumstances,  increasing the federal government\u2019s fiscal exposure to a changing  climate. We also reported in December 2014 that from fiscal years 2004  through 2013, the Federal Emergency Management Agency obligated  about $95 billion in federal disaster assistance for 650 major disasters  declared during this time frame. Then, in July 2015, we reported that the  federal government does not adequately plan for disaster resilience and  that most federal funding for hazard mitigation is available after a  disaster.", "Even with the magnitude of these disaster recovery costs, the federal  government does not have government-wide strategic planning efforts in  place to help set clear priorities for managing significant climate risks  before they become federal fiscal exposures. The federal government has  not undertaken strategic, government-wide planning to manage climate  risks, using the best available information, including information on the  potential economic effects of climate change, to identify and assess  significant risks. In May 2011, we found that a government-wide strategic  planning process could enhance how priorities for an overall federal  response to climate change are set and recommended that the Executive  Office of the President establish federal strategic climate change  priorities. The Executive Office of the President has not implemented  this recommendation. Later, in July 2015, we found that the federal  government had no comprehensive, strategic approach to identifying,  prioritizing and implementing investments for disaster resilience. This  report concluded that a strategy to guide federal investments in disaster  resilience could result in more effective returns on these investments.  Building disaster resilience can include taking actions to adapt to the  effects of climate change, as we found in May 2016.", "In addition, in our February 2015 High-Risk update, we reported that  federal officials do not have a shared understanding of strategic  government-wide priorities related to climate change, which along with other issues, limits the federal government\u2019s ability to manage climate  risks. In February 2017, we found that federal agencies had undertaken  various strategic planning efforts, but it was unclear how they related to  each other or whether they amounted to a government-wide approach for  reducing federal fiscal exposures. Subsequently, a March 2017  Executive Order rescinded some of these planning efforts and created  uncertainty about whether other planning efforts would continue or take  their place.", "The National Academies\u2019 2010 leading practices state that climate  change risk management efforts need to be focused where immediate  attention is needed and that, by prioritizing federal climate risk  management activities well, the federal government can help to minimize  negative impacts and maximize opportunities associated with climate  change. In addition, most experts we interviewed told us that federal  decision makers should prioritize risk management efforts on significant  climate risks that create the greatest fiscal exposure. By using information  on the potential economic effects of climate change to assess and identify  significant climate risks and craft appropriate federal responses, the  federal government could take an initial step in establishing government- wide priorities to manage significant climate risks, which we  recommended in May 2011 to reduce federal fiscal exposure and  continue to believe is important. This initial step could include  establishing a strategy to identify, prioritize, and guide federal  investments to enhance resilience against future disasters, as we  recommended in July 2015.", "To achieve the ultimate objective of establishing government-wide  priorities, decision makers need information on policy alternatives that are  representative of all available alternatives and their economic effects,  such as benefits and costs. The authors of the American Climate  Prospectus study highlighted, for instance, that national decision makers  must weigh the potential economic and social impacts of climate change  against the costs of policies to reduce emissions or make our economy  more resilient. Further, EPA officials stated that using information from  national-scale economics reports to make policy choices would involve a  number of intermediate analytical steps, including (1) estimating the  federal risk exposure from the national or regional estimates, (2)  identifying policy options, and (3) analyzing the costs and benefits of  those options. The relevant point for decision makers, according to these  EPA officials, is that multisector, national estimates of climate damages  can be made available for use, though additional analysis may be needed  for specific policy actions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Additional Information on Potential Economic Effects Could Help Decision Makers\u2019 Efforts to Manage Climate Risks", "paragraphs": ["A strategy to identify, prioritize, and guide federal investments to enhance  resilience against future disasters could include additional information on  the economic effects of climate change.

The 2010 National Academies report, literature  we reviewed, and several experts we interviewed noted that to make  informed adaptation choices, decision makers need more comprehensive  information on economic effects to better understand the potential costs  of climate change to society and begin to develop an understanding of the  benefits and costs of different adaptation options. In addition, economic  guidance generally states that investment decisions\u2014which would  include decisions about adaptation investments\u2014should be informed by a  consideration of both benefits and costs of relevant alternatives. For  example, OMB has issued guidance on using benefit-cost analyses to  help federal agencies efficiently allocate resources through well-informed  decision making. This guidance includes OMB Circular A-94, which  directs agencies to follow certain economic guidelines for benefit-cost and  cost-effectiveness analyses of federal programs or policies to promote  efficient resource allocation through well-informed decision making in  certain circumstances.", "The American Climate Prospectus study also recognized the importance  of balancing benefits and costs, stating that national policy makers must  weigh the potential economic and social impacts of climate change  against the cost of the policies to manage climate risks. When it comes to  managing climate risks through adaptation, the literature we reviewed and  several experts we interviewed noted that a full understanding of the  adaptation alternatives would require information on the economic effects  of climate change impacts, how adaptation may lessen some of these  effects, and the costs of adaptation.", "In our 2013 High-Risk update, we reported that the federal government  has a role to play in providing information to decision makers so they can  make better choices about adapting to climate change since their  decisions can drive federal fiscal exposure. Moreover, we found in our  2015 High-Risk update that state, local, and private sector decision  makers drive federal climate-related fiscal exposures because they are  responsible for planning, constructing, and maintaining certain types of  vulnerable infrastructure paid for with federal funds, insured by federal  programs, or eligible for federal disaster assistance. Therefore, federal  efforts to provide information to these decision makers could help them  make more informed choices about how to manage climate risks,  ultimately helping to reduce federal fiscal exposure. In our November  2016 report, we reported that these decision makers need climate  information\u2014including economic information\u2014that represents the best  available information and is updated over time.", "Some experts we interviewed noted that emerging research\u2014which  includes updates to the national-scale studies of the economic effects of  climate change\u2014will help fill information gaps. Recognizing that decision  makers need more comprehensive economic information to manage  climate risks, the National Academies recommended in 2016 that  USGCRP integrate social, behavioral, and economic science into the  National Climate Assessment to support decision-making processes.  EPA officials told us that, as a step toward this integration, the agency\u2019s  updates to the Climate Change Impacts and Risk Analysis project  advance the understanding of economic effects of climate change.
