For timber sale receipts, the Forest Service first distributes a portion of the receipts to two funds that are used for various timber sale activities, such as reforestation or preparing and administering future salvage sales. The remaining timber sale receipts are deposited in the NFF and combined with the receipts from other resources. Each forest has its own sub-NFF account that is accumulated at the regional level, and all regional NFF accounts are accumulated to develop the national NFF.

The listing was followed by a decline in timber receipts and returns to the Treasury. However, the decline in the amounts available for return to the Treasury was even more severe because the Forest Service chose to make the payments for the spotted owl guarantee from the NFF during fiscal years 1994 and 1995. In fiscal year 1995, the amount available for return to the Treasury from the timber program dropped to a low of $1.5 million. In fiscal year 1996, the NFF lacked sufficient funds to meet its obligations\u2014including the spotted owl payments\u2014by a deficit of $77.6 million.

The Forest Service took two actions to remedy this problem. First, the Forest Service transferred to the NFF a total of $56.1 million originally intended to be deposited in the Salvage Sale Fund and the Knutson-Vandenberg Fund. However, even with this additional money, a shortfall of $17.8 million still remained in the NFF. The Forest Service\u2019s next action was to request the appropriation of about $135 million for the 1996 payments for the spotted owl guarantee authorized by the Omnibus Budget and Reconciliation Act of 1993 (P.L. 103-66, as amended)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Forest Service Transferred $56.1 Million to the NFF", "paragraphs": ["The Forest Service\u2019s first analysis\u2014performed in May 1996\u2014of the estimated receipts for fiscal year 1996 showed that the NFF\u2019s anticipated receipts were dangerously low. The analysis, generally performed to estimate the payments to the states, resulted in the Forest Service\u2019s beginning a series of internal discussions to identify why the receipts were so low. While the Forest Service estimated that it would be able to cover the payments to the states, it also estimated that only $33.6 million would be available in the NFF to cover all other needs.", "Even though the Forest Service was aware as early as May 1996 that the NFF was projected to be dangerously low at the end of 1996, and informally discussed the potential shortage internally between April and August, it did not formally initiate procedures to activate the spotted owl guarantee appropriation until September 1996. Instead, on August 27, 1996, the Forest Service instructed its regions to transfer the funds to the NFF that had been originally intended for deposit in the Salvage Sale Fund and Knutson-Vandenberg Fund for the remainder of the fiscal year to make up for the shortfall. The memorandum pointed out that the problem was occurring for several reasons, including the reduction in total receipts, the requirement for the spotted owl guarantee payments to some states, the setting aside of funding for tripartite land exchanges by the national forests covered by the spotted owl guarantee, and the deposit of receipts in both the Salvage Sale Fund and the Knutson-Vandenberg Fund. The memorandum pointed out that the regions needed to review the balances in their NFF, Salvage Sale Fund, and Knutson-Vandenberg Fund and stressed that if the regions had a deficit in their NFF accounts, it should be offset by a transfer of funds from one of the other accounts. These adjustments resulted in a total of $56.1 million being transferred to the NFF\u2014$35.6 million that would have been deposited in the Salvage Sale Fund and $20.5 million that would have been deposited in the Knutson-Vandenberg Fund. According to the Forest Service\u2019s records, the regions used a variety of approaches to make these accounting adjustments. While most regions made the adjustments at the regional level, some were made at the forest level, and one region was granted permission to make no adjustments at all.", "Although the regions and forests were told that the August and September accounting adjustments would be reversed, thus allowing them to deposit the funds into the Salvage Sale Fund and the Knutson-Vandenberg Fund as originally intended, this was not possible because the balance in the NFF is unavailable for disbursement after the close of the fiscal year. These funds must be returned to the Treasury, and therefore, the Forest Service\u2019s Salvage Sale Fund and the Knutson-Vandenberg Fund lost this amount for fiscal year 1996."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Forest Service Received $135 Million Spotted Owl Guarantee Appropriation", "paragraphs": ["According to Forest Service officials, several situations arose after the initial analysis of the NFF shortfall. In early summer, the Pacific Northwest Region sharply curtailed its timber harvesting program because of the extensive fire season it was experiencing, which reduced the estimated receipts from that region. In addition, several internal deliberations raised concerns about the budget implications of requesting the spotted owl guarantee appropriation, which necessitated additional discussions with congressional committees. Also, according to Forest Service officials, external concerns arose about the interpretation of the statutory amounts allowed under the legislation\u2014that is, Office of Management and Budget (OMB) attorneys questioned whether the Forest Service was entitled to the entire spotted owl guarantee or just the shortfall. Because of the uncertainty about whether the Forest Service would receive the appropriation, the Forest Service needed to assure the U.S. Department of Agriculture that all external parties would agree to the request before it could be submitted.", "Thus, in early September 1996, the Forest Service started working with OMB to obtain its concurrence with the request for the spotted owl guarantee appropriation from the Treasury because of the $17.8 million shortfall in the NFF. In a letter dated September 19, 1996, the Forest Service requested that the Treasury provide the spotted owl guarantee appropriation for fiscal year 1996 of $135 million as authorized by P.L. 103-66, as amended. In its request, the Forest Service stated that its national forest receipts had declined significantly in fiscal year 1996 and would not be sufficient to cover the full payments due the states, including the spotted owl guarantee.", "On October 3, 1996, the Treasury advised the Forest Service that while the Forest Service had the authority to obtain the spotted owl guarantee appropriation, funds could not be deposited directly into the NFF as requested and that the request must be resubmitted for a new General Fund expenditure account. Five weeks later, on November 7, 1996, the Forest Service resubmitted its request to the Treasury for a new General Fund expenditure account entitled \u201cPayments to the States, Northern Spotted Owl Guarantee, Forest Service.\u201d According to a Forest Service official, this delay in resubmitting the request to Treasury resulted from higher-priority tasks of year-end closings. Because they were assured that they would be receiving the appropriation and that the moneys would be received in fiscal year 1997 for the fiscal year 1996 payments, the Forest Service considered the year-end closings a higher priority.", "On November 26, 1996, the Treasury\u2014with the concurrence of OMB\u2014approved the request and provided a warrant of $135 million to the Forest Service to make the spotted owl guarantee payments. Because the deficit in the NFF was only $17.8 million, when the Forest Service placed the $135 million into the NFF, it created a balance of $115.9 million after final adjustments. Forest Service officials told us that they will return this amount to the Treasury; however, as of August 12, 1997, the Forest Service still retained the money in the NFF."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Poor Financial Management Contributed to the NFF Shortfall in Fiscal Year 1996", "paragraphs": ["Our review of the fiscal year 1996 timber balances in the NFF revealed that many forests\u2014especially in the Pacific Northwest Region\u2014had negative year-end balances in their NFF accounts. According to the Forest Service\u2019s records, the negative balances at the forest level resulted when these forests transferred funds from the NFF to the Salvage Sale Fund and the Knutson-Vandenberg Fund during the year, even if sufficient receipts had not been received on the particular sale in the current fiscal year. According to a Forest Service official, the forests and regions were not aware that the NFF is closed out annually. The Salvage Sale Fund and the Knutson-Vandenberg Fund, however, remain open.", "A negative balance in the NFF is very similar to writing a check without any money in the bank. The forests with negative NFF balances were forests that relied on the fact that other forests would have sufficiently large positive balances to counteract their negative amounts. For example, while 10 of the 19 forests in the Pacific Northwest Region had negative balances of about $37 million, the overall region had a positive balance of about $24 million.", "While we do not know the extent of all of these types of adjustments nationwide, we have reason to believe that their total amount would exceed $37 million. However, even if the amount was only $37 million, it still would mean, in effect, that over 10 forests in the Pacific Northwest Region deposited nothing in the NFF for the entire fiscal year. We believe that these adjustments contributed to the overall shortfall in the NFF and portray a lack of sound financial management by the Forest Service.

This was an unauthorized use of the fund. Instead, the Forest Service was required to use the appropriations specifically made available by the Congress by the Omnibus Budget and Reconciliation Act of 1993 (P.L. 103-66, as amended) for the spotted owl guarantee and should continue to use this appropriation until fiscal year 2003, when it expires.", "The Forest Service is required to pay the states 25 percent of the gross receipts earned on national forests for the use by the counties in which the receipts were earned. For specific counties in California, Oregon, and Washington, the listing of the northern spotted owl as a threatened species accounted for a substantial drop in the size of timber harvests\u2014and therefore a substantial drop in the receipts that the counties would have received. To reduce this fiscal impact, the Congress included the \u201csafety net\u201d spotted owl guarantee legislation in the yearly appropriations for fiscal years 1991, 1992, and 1993, and provided that the payments to the states be made out of the NFF\u2014an indefinite appropriation. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 provided appropriations to make such payments to these states beginning in fiscal year 1994 through fiscal year 2003 and established the formulas for calculating the payments. The Forest Service did not use this authority in 1994 and 1995; rather, it elected to make the spotted owl guarantee payments from the NFF as it made its normal payments to the states. The Forest Service chose this method of payment because ample receipts were available in the NFF, which, if not used for the payment, would have been returned to the Treasury. The Forest Service also told us that its decision not to use the spotted owl appropriation was articulated in its budget explanatory notes approved by OMB and submitted to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations.", "The Forest Service should have used the spotted owl appropriation rather than the NFF to make the spotted owl guarantee payment for fiscal years 1994 and 1995. This specific appropriation was enacted in lieu of the Congress\u2019s prior practice in fiscal years 1991, 1992, and 1993 of providing annual appropriations from the Forest Service\u2019s receipts for this purpose.", "Using the specific appropriation is in keeping with 31 U.S.C. 1301(a), which provides that public funds may be used only for the purpose or purposes for which they were appropriated. This provision prohibits charging authorized items to the wrong appropriation and unauthorized items to any appropriation. Moreover, the Forest Service\u2019s disclosure in its budget submission to the Congress is not a substitute for legislation and, therefore, did not authorize continued payments from the NFF."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Forest Service\u2019s Actions in Fiscal Year 1997 to Improve the NFF\u2019s Management", "paragraphs": ["On January 29, 1997, the Deputy Chief, National Forest System, issued initial guidance to the regions on the actions they should take in the short term and discussed the long-term actions needed to more effectively manage these funds. In the short term, the regions were asked to implement a series of distribution priorities for timber sale receipts to ensure that funds are available to make the payments to the states and to meet other obligations, as well as to support critical elements of the reforestation and salvage sale programs. The guidance also required that each region initiate a sale review process within the region to ensure that the trust funds and timber sale accounts are being managed in accordance with these priorities. According to Forest Management and Financial Management officials, the intent of the guidance was not to dictate a specific priority or action for each individual timber sale. Rather, the guidance was intended to establish a framework for managing overall receipts and to make the regions and the forests aware of their obligations and of the need to manage their programs to meet these obligations.", "For the long term, the January 29, 1997, guidance pointed out that solutions to the problem will require changes in both work processes and patterns of behavior and that effective controls will also require changes in accounting procedures. The Deputy\u2019s memorandum concluded that, clearly, actions are needed at all levels to tackle the problem. At the national level, an improved process is needed for program-level decisions to cover the required payments. To make progress in these areas, the Deputy said that he would appoint a task force in early 1997 to focus on the long-term solutions that would ensure that sufficient money is available to make the 25-percent payments to the states.", "We contacted each of the regions to gain an understanding of how they were implementing the short-term actions discussed in the January 29, 1997, guidance. All of the regions told us that they would manage the timber receipts and corresponding deposits to the NFF from a forest or regional perspective rather than on a sale-by-sale basis. Most of the regions have instituted monitoring procedures, such as developing a spreadsheet showing projected total receipts and balances for each forest\u2019s NFF after required obligations are met. However, four regions said that because they had not experienced any problems in the past, they had instituted no special procedures.", "On May 2, 1997, the Forest Service provided additional guidance to the regions on how to correct some of the accounting adjustments made in August and September 1996. As pointed out earlier, these adjustments created a multitude of problems. For example, some of the regional and forest adjustments resulted in overpayments to the states of about $730,000 in fiscal year 1996. According to the Forest Service, these overpayments will be adjusted in the states\u2019 fiscal year 1997 payments.", "In addition, this guidance formally advised the regions that the amounts transferred to the NFF in fiscal year 1996 that had originally been intended for deposit in the Salvage Sale Fund and the Knutson-Vandenberg Fund would not be returned to each forest but instead would be returned to the Treasury. However, the guidance permitted each region to recover these funds out of fiscal year 1997 receipts to the extent that the region was able to meet all of its NFF requirements. In other words, if a forest earned fiscal year 1997 receipts beyond those needed for the payments to the states and for other NFF obligations that normally would have been deposited in the NFF, the forest could deposit that excess into the Salvage Sale Fund and the Knutson-Vandenberg Fund to the extent that it had transferred funds originally intended for those accounts in fiscal year 1996. Forest Service officials told us that the regions had sufficient receipts in fiscal year 1997 to recover the $56.1 million they had transferred to the NFF in fiscal year 1996. The Forest Service is also projecting that there will be a balance in the NFF at the end of the fiscal year of $127.5 million to be returned to the Treasury.", "The Forest Service also told us that in early October 1997, it would request the fiscal year 1997 spotted owl guarantee appropriation amounting to $129.9 million. According to Forest Service officials, because the Treasury account is already established, they should not experience the same types of problems for fiscal year 1997.", "A final long-term action involved establishing, in late May 1997, the National Task Force for Trust Funds and Payments to the States\u2014composed of regional and headquarters fiscal, accounting, and forest management representatives. The task force was charged with developing a national policy on the management of receipts and trust funds so that sufficient receipts would be available in the NFF to make the payments to the states along with meeting the Forest Service\u2019s other mandatory obligations. According to the task force leader, the task force plans to provide definitive guidance on periodic monitoring of NFF balances; adjustments among the NFF, the Salvage Sale Fund, and the Knutson-Vandenberg Fund; and the allowable uses of excess NFF balances. The task force estimates that it will issue its final report in August 1997.

Only in recent years, with the drastic reduction in timber sales and corresponding decreases in receipts, has it become more apparent that the Forest Service\u2019s financial management of its receipts and trust funds is in need of improvement.", "Lured into a false sense of security by the historically large returns to the Treasury, the Forest Service was unprepared to handle the crises it faced in fiscal year 1996. The problems of insufficient funds in its NFF and the loss of $56.1 million to other timber-related funds could have been lessened, if not mitigated, if the Forest Service had better financial controls over the adjustments made among the Salvage Sale Fund, the Knutson-Vandenberg Fund, and the NFF and more oversight of its funds\u2019 management practices. The inability of the Forest Service to initiate the spotted owl guarantee appropriation in a timely manner greatly contributed to the problems experienced at the forest, regional, and national levels. However, the fiscal year 1996 occurrences are an illustration of the much larger fiscal accountability problems facing the Forest Service.", "In short, because the Forest Service does not now have the benefit of hundreds of millions of dollars as a cushion, it is now incumbent on the Forest Service to establish sound financial management controls. We have pointed out some of these weaknesses in two of our recent reports on the Knutson-Vandenberg Fund.
