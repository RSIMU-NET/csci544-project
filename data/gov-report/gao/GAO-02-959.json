The processes for managing GuardNet are not effective in three key areas: Requirements: For example, the Guard has not developed a requirements management plan or clearly established users' roles in developing and changing requirements. Configuration: For example, the Guard has not documented the network's configuration and is not controlling changes to configuration components. Security: For example, the Guard has not implemented needed security controls, such as firewalls, to protect GuardNet and does not monitor controls on an ongoing basis to ensure that implemented controls are working as intended. According to Guard officials, establishing these management processes has not been a priority. Without these basic processes, the Guard cannot ensure that GuardNet will perform as intended and provide its users with reliable and secure services.

In this role, the  Guard is a supplemental reserve force for the Army and the Air Force. Its  state-level mission, which is executed under the control of state and  territory governors and, for the District of Columbia, the President, is to  protect life and property and preserve peace, order, and public safety.

The Army National Guard  comprises military and civilian personnel who serve their country on either  a full- or part-time basis; it has about 350,000 soldiers in 1,832 units.  Currently, about half of these are combat units. The Air National Guard is a  reserve component of the Department of the Air Force, employing about  107,000 officers and airmen in 368 units.

However, we did not find evidence that such an understanding  exists. For example, although the officials initially attributed their  understanding of the network\u2019s use to memorandums of agreement  between NGB and the states, territories, and the District of Columbia, they  subsequently stated that the memorandums do not currently exist, but they  should in the near future. In addition, while they provided us with a list of  130 DOD and bureau applications that GuardNet supports, they did not  know whether this list was complete, and other sources of information  suggest that the list is not complete.

The  bureau provided the results of an ongoing study commissioned by NGB\u2019s  Chief Information Officer (CIO) to identify future network requirements in  support of homeland security command, control, and communications  activities. However, the results to date do not yet identify GuardNet  requirements. Instead, these results raised states\u2019 concerns about network  security and reliability and interoperability with other networks, all of  which the states currently deemed inadequate. According to a Guard  official for Iowa, the state uses its own network, instead of GuardNet, for  video teleconferencing (VTC) because it is more reliable and faster.", "Because of states\u2019 concerns about GuardNet\u2019s capabilities, we attempted to  interview Virginia and Iowa state officials using GuardNet\u2019s VTC facilities.  To accomplish this, we requested that these interviews be conducted at a  site that was used for VTC purposes by the Army National Guard and  others following the September 11th terrorist attacks, specifically asking  that GuardNet be used to establish both the voice and video connection.  We experienced difficulties in getting this connection and using the VTC  capabilities at this facility. For example, in connecting with Virginia  officials, it took four attempts to establish the initial video connection,  which lasted about 15 minutes before communications were lost  altogether; a voice connection was never established. As a result, we  communicated with Virginia officials using a telephone. In the case of Iowa,  a connection was established; however, the quality of both the video and  voice connections was poor. For example, the screen froze several times  during the meeting and, at times, it was difficult to hear the Iowa officials.  After receiving a draft of this report for comment, the Acting Director of  NGB\u2019s Information Systems Division informed us that the public switched  network was used to connect us with the states, not GuardNet. To verify  this, we requested copies of error logs that document problems associated  with the network\u2019s usage. However, NGB did not provide us the logs.  Further, the NGB official who established our connection with Virginia and  Iowa told us that we had used GuardNet, as did a Virginia official. Two  other Virginia officials, however, stated that we had not used GuardNet.", "In addition to the list that NGB provided of 130 DOD and bureau  applications that GuardNet supports, NGB-AIS officials stated that the  network has been used recently to support activities related to homeland  security. For example, after last year\u2019s terrorist attacks, NGB officials used  GuardNet to communicate with states, territories, and the District of  Columbia on the use of National Guard units to coordinate airport security  activities. They also used GuardNet to inform the public about anthrax and  coordinate with first responders. In addition, these officials stated that  NGB\u2019s recently established Homeland Security Program Office is  considering GuardNet for future homeland security support. Further, the  Information Technology Advisor of DOD\u2019s Homeland Security Task Force  told us that GuardNet is being considered for homeland security mission  support, and although a final decision has not been made, it may be the best  choice of network support because it already exists. In addition, NGB and  several states are currently conducting a pilot project, referred to as the  Domestic Emergency Response Information System, to evaluate  GuardNet\u2019s capabilities to support wireless communications between NGB  and first responders in the event of a national emergency. At the same time,  the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs is  defining requirements for a Nationwide Distributed Fiber Optic Network to  support the National Guard\u2019s distance learning program.

NGB\u2019s CIO agreed that this is a problem and  that an assessment of GuardNet\u2019s requirements is needed.

Central management is  especially important for managing the increased risks associated with a  highly connected computing environment, such as GuardNet, where  security weaknesses in one organization\u2019s network can compromise the  security of other organization\u2019s IT assets.", "NGB has established a central management function that is responsible for  many of the tenets of effective security management, such as assessing  network risks on a periodic basis, developing security plans to address the  risks identified, implementing needed security controls, and independently  ensuring that implemented controls are operating as intended. However, as  previously discussed, NGB\u2019s security management function is not  effectively discharging its assigned responsibilities.", "NGB officials told us that key security management duties have not been  performed because network security has not been designated a bureau  priority and thus has not received adequate management attention and  resources, including staff.

However, GuardNet is not ready to meet this challenge because NGB does  not fully know the network\u2019s requirements and is not effectively managing  the network. More specifically, important controls in the three interrelated  areas of network requirements, configuration, and security management  are absent, precluding NGB from fully knowing such things as what the  true makeup of the network is, how and by whom it is being used, how it is  performing, what risks it faces, and what security features are needed. This  absence of controls is due to insufficient NGB management attention and  resources being devoted to these three areas. Without giving swift and  immediate management attention and priority to limiting network users\u2019  current exposure to risk; understanding and evaluating the network\u2019s  current requirements, configuration, and security posture; and developing  and implementing plans of action to appropriately address current network  management weaknesses and risks, the mission effectiveness of not only  the bureau, but also all organizations that either use or are connected to the  network, is at risk."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To strengthen NGB\u2019s management of GuardNet and reduce the risks  associated with federal, state, and local governments relying on it to  perform mission-critical functions, we recommend that the Secretary of  Defense direct the Secretary of the Army to ensure that GuardNet  management is given the priority attention and resources commensurate  with the criticality and importance of the network\u2019s current and potential  uses. To this end, we recommend that the Secretary, through the Secretary  of the Army, direct the NGB Chief to immediately  develop a complete and comprehensive inventory of network user   fully disclose to these users all known network management  weaknesses and security vulnerabilities;   advise these users to take appropriate steps to ensure that their  respective needs for reliable and secure network services are met; and   fully disclose, in a controlled manner, all known network management  weaknesses and security vulnerabilities to all known potential network  users, particularly potential homeland security-related users at the  federal, state, and local government levels.", "Next, we recommend that the Secretary of the Army direct the NGB Chief  to ensure that near-term changes to the network are limited to those  needed to address already identified performance and security problems.  During this period of limited network change, we further recommend that  the Chief develop an authoritative and comprehensive baseline  understanding of GuardNet\u2019s requirements, configuration, and security  posture.", "Next, we recommend that the Secretary of the Army direct the NGB Chief  to correct each network management process weakness discussed in this  report. More specifically, we recommend that the NGB Chief develop  management process improvement plans for requirements management,  configuration management, and security management. We further  recommend that each of these plans, at a minimum, specify measurable  goals and objectives, assign roles and responsibilities, involve network  users, and identify work tasks, implementation schedules, and resource  needs. In addition, we recommend that  the requirements management improvement plan provide for  establishing a process that includes (1) developing a requirements  management plan, (2) involving network users in developing and  changing requirements, (3) developing requirements management  baseline documentation, such as a mission needs statement and an  operational requirements document, and (4) establishing controls for  assessing and approving proposed changes to the baseline;  the configuration management improvement plan provide for  establishing a process that includes (1) identifying and documenting the  network\u2019s components/subcomponents (hardware and software), (2)  creating a baseline configuration (development, test, and production  environments) of these component parts, (3) controlling changes to  these configuration baselines through a formal change process that  allows only the NGB-AIS Configuration Control Board to approve  changes to GuardNet, (4) ensuring that network documentation remains  current to enable accurate reporting of changes as the network evolves,  and (5) periodically auditing to ensure that the documentation is  complete and accurate; and   the security management improvement plan provide for establishing a  process that includes (1) assessing risks to determine security needs, (2)  implementing needed controls in accordance with applicable policy and  guidance, (3) monitoring existing controls to ensure that they are  operating as intended, and (4) ensuring that the network is certified and  accredited in accordance with DOD policy.", "Last, we recommend that, until these recommendations are fully  implemented, the NGB Chief report to the Secretary of the Army and advise  the Director of the White House\u2019s Office of Homeland Security, on a  quarterly basis, on NGB\u2019s progress in implementing each of these  recommendations and the associated reliability and security risks faced by  GuardNet users in the interim."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In DOD\u2019s written comments on a draft of this report signed by the Acting  Chief of NGB (see app. II), the department agreed with our conclusion that  GuardNet is not ready to reliably and securely support the homeland  security mission, and it endorsed the network management processes that  we described as needed. In addition, the department characterized our  report as timely and our recommendations as valued, and stated that it  would use these recommendations to enhance network services.", "However, DOD did not agree with one component of our recommendation  aimed at disclosing to GuardNet users, current and future, all known  network management weaknesses and security vulnerabilities so that these  organizations could take appropriate steps. In particular, the department  did not agree with the need to first establish an inventory of network users,  stating that it would serve no meaningful purpose to NGB because user  lists are maintained by the organization that provides local-area network  access. We understand DOD\u2019s point and, in fact, these user organizations  are precisely the users we are referring to in our recommendation.  Therefore, we have modified our recommendation to refer to \u201cusers\u201d as  \u201cuser organizations\u201d to alleviate any misunderstanding.", "Also, DOD did not agree with our recommendation to develop a security  management improvement plan for establishing an effective security  management process, stating that NGB already addresses GuardNet  security requirements with appropriate representatives, attributing current  security deficiencies to funding inadequacies. We disagree with DOD  because its comments neither provide sufficient basis for the position it  takes nor refute the facts presented in the report that are the basis for our  recommendation. As we state in the report, NGB has not established an  effective security management process for the network. For example, NGB  has not performed a risk assessment to understand security needs,  implemented needed controls, or certified and accredited GuardNet, each  of which is a critical element of an effective security management process.  Accordingly, we recommended that NGB develop a security management  improvement plan that provides for putting these missing process elements  in place. Without this plan, which should include a provision for adequate  resources, NGB\u2019s efforts to address its security management weaknesses  are unlikely to be successful.", "Last, the Acting Director of the NGB\u2019s Information Systems Division  provided other clarifying comments on our experience in using GuardNet  to video teleconference with Army National Guard officials in Virginia,  which we have incorporated as appropriate in the report.", "We are sending copies of this report to interested congressional  committees.
