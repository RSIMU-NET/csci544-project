GAO was asked to testify today on steps VA has taken to improve its employment screening requirements and VA's physician credentialing and privileging processes because of their importance to patient safety. This testimony is based on two GAO reports released today that determined the extent to which (1) VA has taken steps to improve employment screening for practitioners by implementing GAO's 2004 recommendations, (2) VA facilities are in compliance with selected credentialing and privileging requirements for physicians, and (3) VA has internal controls to help ensure the accuracy of privileging information."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In its report released today, \"VA Health Care: Steps Taken to Improve Practitioner Screening, but Facility Compliance with Screening Requirements Is Poor,\" GAO-06-544 , GAO found that VA has taken steps to improve employment screening for practitioners, such as physicians, nurses, and pharmacists, by partially implementing each of four recommendations GAO made in March 2004. However, gaps still remain in VA's requirements. For example, for the recommendation that VA check all state licenses and national certificates held by all practitioners, such as nurses and pharmacists, VA implemented the recommendation for practitioners it intends to hire, but has not expanded this screening requirement to include those currently employed by VA. In addition, VA's implementation of another recommendation--to conduct oversight to help facilities comply with employment screening requirements--did not include all screening requirements, as recommended by GAO. In another report released today, \"VA Health Care: Selected Credentialing Requirements at Seven Medical Facilities Met, but an Aspect of Privileging Process Needs Improvement,\" GAO-06-648 , GAO found at seven VA facilities it visited compliance with almost all selected credentialing and privileging requirements for physicians. Credentialing is verifying that a physician's credentials are valid. Privileging is determining which health care services--clinical privileges--a physician is allowed to provide. Clinical privileges must be renewed at least every 2 years. One privileging requirement--to use information on a physician's performance in making privileging decisions--was problematic because officials used performance information when renewing clinical privileges, but collected all or most of this information through their facility's quality assurance program. This is prohibited under VA policy. Further, three of the seven facilities did not submit medical malpractice claim information to VA's Office of Medical-Legal Affairs within 60 days after being notified that a claim was paid, as required by VA. This office uses such information to determine whether VA practitioners have delivered substandard care and provides these determinations to facility officials. When VA medical facilities do not submit all relevant information in a timely manner, facility officials make privileging decisions without the advantage of such determinations. VA has not required its facilities to establish internal controls to help ensure that physician privileging information managed by medical staff specialists--employees who are responsible for obtaining and verifying information used in credentialing and privileging--is accurate. One facility GAO visited did not identify 106 physicians whose privileging processes had not been completed by facility officials for at least 2 years because of inaccurate information provided by the facility's medical staff specialist. As a result, these physicians were practicing at the facility without current clinical privileges."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss efforts by the Department of  Veterans Affairs (VA) to ensure that its health care practitioners provide  safe care to veterans. Specifically, I want to discuss findings related to  patient safety in two reports that we are releasing today. The first report  focuses on employment screening requirements that VA medical facility  officials must follow. Under these requirements, VA facility officials check  the professional credentials and personal backgrounds for all practitioners  their facilities employ. VA practitioners include physicians, nurses, and  pharmacists, among others. Part of the screening process includes  credentialing, which is the process of checking that a practitioner\u2019s  professional credentials, such as licensure, education, and training, are  valid and meet VA\u2019s requirements for employment. Our second report  specifically examines credentialing and privileging processes intended to  ensure the safe delivery of care by VA physicians. Physician privileging is  the process for determining which health care services or clinical  privileges, such as surgical procedures or administering anesthesia, a  physician can provide to VA patients without supervision. These clinical  privileges must be renewed at least every 2 years. While VA\u2019s requirements  cannot guarantee patient safety in health care settings, they are intended  to minimize the chance of patients receiving care from someone who is  incompetent or who may intentionally harm them.", "In March 2004, we reported and testified before this subcommittee on gaps  in VA\u2019s practitioner screening requirements. We found that VA did not  require that all of its health care practitioners with access to patients be  thoroughly screened. In addition, we found mixed compliance with VA  screening requirements at the medical facilities we visited. We concluded  that the gaps in and mixed compliance with VA\u2019s screening requirements  created vulnerabilities that could allow VA to employ health care  practitioners who could place patients at risk. In our 2004 report, we made  four recommendations to address the gaps we identified in VA\u2019s screening  requirements and the noncompliance we found at the VA medical facilities  we visited. VA generally agreed with our findings and conclusions and  stated it would develop a detailed action plan to implement our  recommendations.", "The subcommittee is interested in the progress VA has made in  implementing our March 2004 recommendations and in efforts by VA to  ensure that its health care practitioners are qualified and have appropriate  backgrounds to safely deliver care to veterans. My remarks today focus on  the extent to which (1) VA has taken steps to improve employment  screening for practitioners by implementing the four recommendations  made in our March 2004 report, (2) VA medical facilities are in compliance  with VA\u2019s employment screening requirements for health care  practitioners, (3) VA medical facilities are in compliance with selected  credentialing and privileging requirements for physicians, and (4) VA has  internal controls to help ensure the accuracy of information medical  facilities use to renew physicians\u2019 clinical privileges.", "In carrying out this work, we reviewed VA\u2019s policies and procedures for  employment screening and interviewed VA headquarters officials to  determine if the recommendations we made in March 2004 were  implemented. We also reviewed VA policies outlining the processes for  credentialing and privileging physicians. In addition, we visited seven VA  medical facilities for each report. At each facility we visited, we reviewed  a sample of practitioner files to determine if documentation in the files  demonstrated compliance with the requirements in our reviews. For the  employment screening report, we selected five employment screening  requirements, and for the physician credentialing and privileging report,  we selected four credentialing and five privileging requirements for  physicians. See appendix I for the four recommendations we made in  March 2004 and the VA screening, credentialing, and privileging  requirements we used in our reports to measure VA medical facility  compliance. We also identified the internal controls VA has in place for its  privileging process and, using GAO\u2019s standards for internal controls in the  federal government, determined whether these controls are adequate. We  performed our work from April 2005 to May 2006 in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards.", "In summary, VA has taken steps to improve employment screening of its  health care practitioners by partially implementing each of the four  recommendations made in our March 2004 report; however, gaps still  remain in VA\u2019s health care practitioner screening requirements. For  example, for our recommendation that VA check all state licenses and  national certificates held by all practitioners, VA implemented the  recommendation for practitioners it intends to hire, but has not expanded  this screening requirement to include those currently employed by VA. In  addition, VA\u2019s implementation of another recommendation\u2014to conduct  oversight to help facilities comply with employment screening  requirements\u2014did not include all types of practitioners and screening  requirements, as we recommended.", "At the seven VA medical facilities we visited for our review of VA\u2019s health  care practitioner screening, we found poor compliance with four of the  five VA screening requirements we selected for review. Based on the  practitioner files we reviewed, we found that none of the facilities we  visited had a compliance rate of 90 percent or more for all screening  requirements, and VA policy requires 100 percent compliance with these  requirements.", "At the seven VA medical facilities we visited for our review of VA\u2019s  physician credentialing and privileging requirements, we found  compliance with almost all selected credentialing and privileging  requirements. Specifically, the physician files we reviewed demonstrated  compliance with the four selected credentialing requirements and four of  the five privileging requirements. Compliance with a fifth privileging  requirement\u2014to use information on a physician\u2019s performance in making  privileging decisions\u2014was problematic at six of the VA medical facilities.  At these six, officials obtained this information from their facilities\u2019 quality  assurance programs. Use of such information in connection with  privileging is prohibited by VA policy, and according to VA officials, this  prohibition exists to protect the confidentiality of quality assurance  information and to encourage physicians to participate in quality  assurance programs. VA has not provided guidance to help medical  facilities find alternative ways to efficiently collect performance  information, outside of a facility\u2019s quality assurance program, that could be  used in the renewal of clinical privileges. At the seventh medical facility,  officials did not use performance information to renew physicians\u2019 clinical  privileges, as required. Further, three of the seven facilities did not submit  medical malpractice claim information to VA\u2019s Office of Medical-Legal  Affairs within 60 days after being notified that a claim was paid, as  required by VA. This office is responsible for forming panels of  practitioners to determine whether VA practitioners have delivered  substandard care.

As a result, these physicians were practicing at the  facility without current clinical privileges. This facility has since  implemented internal controls to reduce the risk of a similar situation  occurring in the future. During our visits to other VA facilities for the  physicians\u2019 credentialing and privileging report, we did not identify any  facilities that had established internal controls to help ensure the accuracy  of physician privileging information.", "To better ensure the safety of veterans receiving health care at VA  facilities, in our reports we recommended that VA expand its oversight to  include a review of VA facilities\u2019 compliance with screening requirements  for all types of health care practitioners, provide guidance to medical  facilities on how to collect individual physician performance information  in accordance with VA\u2019s credentialing and privileging policy to use in the  renewal of physicians\u2019 clinical privileges, and enforce the requirement that  medical facilities submit information on paid VA medical malpractice  claims in a timely manner to VA\u2019s Office of Medical-Legal Affairs.  Additionally, we recommended that VA instruct its medical facilities to  establish internal controls to ensure the accuracy of their physician  privileging information. In commenting on drafts of these reports, VA  agreed with our findings and conclusions and concurred with our  recommendations. VA provided an action plan to address the three  recommendations in the report on VA\u2019s physician credentialing and  privileging requirements, and stated that it will provide an action plan to  implement the recommendations in the practitioner screening report after  issuance of the report."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["VA operates the largest integrated health care system in the United States,  providing care to nearly 5 million veterans per year.

VA policy requires officials at its medical facilities to screen  each applicant for positions at VA to determine whether the applicant  possesses at least one current and unrestricted state license or an  appropriate national certificate, whichever is applicable for the position  sought by the applicant. VA also requires officials at its medical facilities  to periodically verify licenses or national certificates held by health care  practitioners already employed at VA. In general, for both applicants and  employed health care practitioners, VA\u2019s employment screening process  proceeds in two stages. First, applicants and employed health care  practitioners are required to disclose to VA, if applicable, their state  licenses and national certificates. Applicants disclose their credentials to  VA during the application process, and employed health care practitioners  disclose credentials to VA as they expire and are renewed with the state  licensing board or certifying organization. Second, VA facility officials are  required to check whether the disclosed credentials are valid.", "State licenses are issued by state licensing boards, whereas national  certificates are issued by national certifying organizations, which are  separate and independent from state licensing boards. Both state licensing  boards and national certifying organizations establish requirements that  practitioners must meet to be licensed or certified. Licensed practitioners  may be licensed in more than one state. \u201cCurrent and unrestricted  licenses\u201d are licenses that are valid and in good standing in the state where  issued. To keep a license current, practitioners must renew their licenses  before they expire. When licensing boards discover a licensee is in  violation of licensing requirements or established law, for example,  abusing prescription drugs or intentionally or negligently providing poor  quality care that results in adverse health effects, they may place  restrictions on or revoke a license. Restrictions from a state licensing  board can limit or prohibit a practitioner from practicing in that particular  state. Some, but not all, state licenses are marked to indicate whether the  licenses have had restrictions placed on them. Practitioners, such as  respiratory and occupational therapists, who are required to have national  certificates to work at VA, must have current and unrestricted certificates.  National certifying organizations can restrict or revoke certificates for  violations of the organizations\u2019 professional standards. Generally, each  state licensing board and national certifying organization maintains a  database of information on restrictions, which employers can often obtain  at no cost either by accessing the information on a board\u2019s Web site or by  contacting the board directly."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Background Investigations", "paragraphs": ["In addition to holding valid professional credentials, when hired, health  care practitioners are required to undergo background investigations that  verify their personal and professional histories. Depending on the  position, the extent of the background investigations for health care  practitioners varies. For example, the minimum background investigation  is a fingerprint-only investigation, which compares a practitioner\u2019s  fingerprints to those stored in criminal history databases. A traditional  background investigation, which covers a health care practitioner\u2019s  personal and professional background for up to 10 years, is the most  common type of background investigation conducted by VA on its health  care practitioners. The traditional background investigation verifies an  individual\u2019s history of employment, education, and residence, and includes  a fingerprint check against a criminal-history database. The Office of  Personnel Management conducts background investigations for VA. To  determine the level of background investigation required for employment,  VA facility officials are required to complete VA Form 2280, which  documents the level of risk posed by a particular position."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Physician Credentialing and Privileging", "paragraphs": ["For physicians, VA has specific requirements that facility officials must  follow to credential and privilege physicians. Officials must follow these  requirements when physicians initially apply to work in VA\u2014which is  known as initial appointment\u2014and then again at least every 2 years when  physicians must apply for reappointment in order to renew their clinical  privileges. Prior to working at VA, physicians enter into VetPro, a Web- based credentialing system VA implemented in March 2001, information  used by VA medical facility officials in the credentialing process. For  example, physicians enter information on their involvement in VA and  non-VA medical malpractice claims and their medical education and  training. For their reappointments, physicians must update this  credentialing information in VetPro. A facility\u2019s medical staff specialist  then performs a data check to be sure that all required information has  been entered into VetPro. In general, the medical staff specialist at each  VA medical facility manages the accuracy of VetPro\u2019s credentialing data.  The medical staff specialist verifies, with the original source of the  information, the accuracy of the credentialing information entered by the  physicians. Once a physician\u2019s credentialing information has been verified,  the medical staff specialist sends the information to the physician\u2019s  supervisor, known as a clinical service chief.", "In addition to entering credentialing information into VetPro, physicians  complete written requests for clinical privileges. The facility medical staff  specialist provides a physician\u2019s clinical service chief with the requested  clinical privileges and information needed to complete the privileging  process, including information that indicates that the credentialing  information entered by the physician into VetPro has been verified with  the appropriate sources. The requested clinical privileges are reviewed by  the clinical service chief, who recommends whether a physician should be  appointed or reappointed to the facility\u2019s medical staff and which clinical  privileges should be granted. For reappointment only, VA\u2019s policy requires  that information on a physician\u2019s performance, such as a physician\u2019s  surgical complication rate, be used when deciding whether to renew a  physician\u2019s clinical privileges. Based on the physician\u2019s performance  information, the clinical service chief recommends that clinical privileges  previously granted by the facility remain the same, be reduced, or be  revoked, and whether newly requested privileges should be added.

For those currently employed, such as nurses and pharmacists, VA  only required facility officials to physically inspect one license of a  practitioner\u2019s choosing. Physical inspection of a license cannot ensure  that it is valid and without restriction, nor can it ensure that there are not  other licenses from other states that may have restrictions. Checking all  licenses against state records is the only way to identify practitioners with  restricted licenses. We reviewed a draft of a VA policy that if issued in its  current form would fully address our recommendation to require medical  facility officials to verify all state licenses and national certificates of  currently employed health care practitioners.

However, officials were not directed to periodically query  HIPDB for health care practitioners currently employed by VA. Officials  told us that VA is working with HHS to develop a process whereby VA can  electronically query HIPDB for current VA employees. Once this process is  in place, and VA is using it to periodically query HIPDB for those currently  employed at VA, the department will have fully implemented our  recommendation. However, VA did not provide a time frame for  implementing this electronic query of HIPDB.", "To address our third recommendation that VA expand the use of  fingerprint-only background investigations for all practitioners with direct  access to patients, VA issued a policy that required all VA medical facilities  to begin using electronic fingerprint machines by September 1, 2005.

However, the oversight program does not ensure that facilities are  complying with all of VA\u2019s key screening requirements, as we  recommended.
