In response to the Deepwater Horizon incident, Interior  issued a number of these notices, which, among other things, notified  operators that Interior would be evaluating whether they had submitted  adequate information about their well containment capabilities with their  oil spill response plans. Specifically, in a November 2010 notice, Interior  informed operators that it would evaluate whether operators could  demonstrate that they had access to and could deploy well containment  resources that would be adequate to promptly respond to a blowout or  other loss of well control. This notice applies only to operators conducting  operations using subsea blowout preventers, which are devices placed on  wells to help maintain control over pressures in the well, or blowout  preventers on floating facilities. Operators provide information on their  well containment capabilities to Interior in a collection of documents that  compose a well containment plan.

For additional information  on the types of information operators provide in their well containment  plans, see appendix I.", "There are three phases to produce oil or gas from a subsea well: drilling,  completion, and production. During the drilling phase, operators drill a  hole, called the wellbore, from the seafloor down to the reservoir of oil or  gas. Early in this phase, a blowout preventer is placed on top of the  wellhead, which, in turn, is installed on top of the wellbore to provide an  interface between the wellbore and other equipment. A large-diameter  pipe called the riser connects the drilling rig to the blowout preventer, and  the drill pipe, drill bit, drilling mud, and casing are routed down to the well   Industry officials we spoke with  through the riser and blowout preventer.said that during the drilling phase, operators must constantly balance the  pressure of the drilling mud inside the wellbore with the pressure from the  surrounding formation thousands of feet below the seafloor. Interior  officials explained that during this phase, operators may encounter a  number of unknown well conditions, which if not controlled or corrected  could pose a risk of a blowout. During a blowout, operators close the  valves in the blowout preventer in an attempt to seal the wellbore and  prevent oil and gas from escaping to the surface. Figure 1 illustrates the  drilling phase.", "In the second phase, known as completion, the operator opens the  wellbore to allow the flow of oil and gas from the reservoir, and installs  equipment at the top of the wellbore to control and collect the oil and gas.  The third phase is production, the extraction of oil or gas from the well.", "The difficulty of the drilling process can vary depending on the depth of  the seafloor as well as the depth of the reservoir. According to a 2010  Interior study, the majority of oil production in the Gulf of Mexico occurs in  deep water, which the study defined as 1,000 feet or more below sea  level. and gas compared with wells in shallower water, in part because high  reservoir pressures contribute to well productivity. These high pressures  also make drilling deepwater wells significantly more dangerous than  drilling shallow wells because, among other things, the increased  pressure can exacerbate the effects of a blowout and make a well  containment response more challenging. In the case of the well that the  Deepwater Horizon was drilling, the seafloor was nearly 5,000 feet below  sea level, and the operator, BP, drilled an additional 13,000 feet below  the seafloor to reach the reservoir.", "According to a 2011 report by the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon  Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling, companies and governmental organizations have adopted  definitions for deepwater ranging from 600 to 1,500 feet. that is specifically designed to cap a well after a blowout.blowout preventer is designed to manage drilling operations and prevent  a blowout, a capping stack is designed to be deployed after a subsea  blowout has already occurred.

HWCG was created around the well  containment capabilities offered by one deepwater services company  whose equipment was used in the response to the Deepwater Horizon  incident.", "According to representatives from both well containment organizations,  members also commit to mutual aid agreements in which operators agree  to provide equipment or other support to consortium members that  experience a subsea well blowout. Representatives of the well  containment organizations said that both HWCG and MWCC also offer  services to nonmembers on a fee basis. Furthermore, representatives of  the well containment organizations we spoke with generally agreed that  should another incident like Deepwater Horizon occur, industry would  mobilize to make available all of the equipment and services necessary to  ensure a quick and effective response.", "In addition to equipment and services, both MWCC and HWCG provide  overall plans that identify how the equipment and services are to be  deployed and used; a schedule of activities to be followed; various  contingencies for high-risk activities, such as straightening a bent  wellhead that may have been damaged by a blowout; and names and  contact information for technical experts who may be called on as  required. According to Interior officials, operators would need to  customize the well containment organizations\u2019 overall plans to their  specific well design. For example, the well pressure would determine the  specifications of the capping stack, and the depth of the well would  specify which ships have cables long enough to reach it. These  customized plans comprise some of the documents in the well  containment plans that operators submit to Interior. However, operators  may need additional equipment and services that the well containment  organizations do not provide. For example, the well containment  organizations provide capping stacks for well containment, but in some\u2013\u2013 if not all\u2013\u2013cases the operator must identify a separate service provider to  transport the capping stack to the site and deploy it to the well. In their  well containment plans, operators also identify other needed equipment  and services that may not be provided by the well containment  organization, including debris removal equipment, remotely operated  underwater vehicles, which are controlled from surface vessels and used  to, among other things, clear debris, and apply chemicals called  dispersants that are used to disperse leaked oil."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Subsea Well Containment Capabilities Available for the Gulf of Mexico Consist Primarily of Modifications to Established Technologies", "paragraphs": ["The subsea well containment capabilities that MWCC and HWCG offer  for the Gulf of Mexico consist primarily of established technologies that  have been modified to support well containment.

The capping  stacks built for MWCC and HWCG are designed to withstand the high  pressures experienced in deepwater reservoirs\u2014up to 15,000 pounds per  square inch for the most recent capping stacks. These stacks can be  deployed to 10,000 feet below sea level. Most capping stacks have  multiple outlets that allow oil and gas to be routed to surface vessels and  processed. Capping stacks are usually deployed on top of the blowout  preventer but can also be installed on other points, including the  wellhead. Industry representatives told us that fittings between connection  points are generally standardized but that capping stacks can be modified  with different fittings to allow for proper installation. Once a capping stack  is installed, depending on the scenario, the containment plans typically  call for slowly closing each of the outlets until the well is closed. In some  cases, operators may also be able to deploy dispersants into or around  the capping stack to help break up the oil (see fig. 3).", "Capping stacks are a primary component of HWCG and MWCC well  containment capabilities, but Interior officials told us that it does not  require operators to use any particular technology in the Gulf of Mexico.  Instead, Interior expects operators to demonstrate that they have the  capability to control a well with a capping stack or some other functionally  equivalent technology, and according to Interior officials, capping stacks  have demonstrated that capability. Industry representatives told us that  capping stacks are tested periodically and physically located near staging  points around the Gulf of Mexico, where they can be moved offshore  rapidly.

In certain situations,  capping the well shut could cause portions of the well to burst, potentially  allowing oil and gas to flow up through the seabed and releasing oil and  gas into the sea from outside the wellbore. This new software tool, called  the well containment screening tool, helps Interior and operators evaluate  whether a well could be closed using a capping stack and still maintain  wellbore integrity. The development of this screening tool was initiated by  Interior and completed with input from the oil industry. The screening tool  analyzes potential well integrity and risk based on various factors  including well design, geological characteristics, reservoir pressures, and  wellbore fluid gradients. Interior provides the tool to operators and then  reviews each operator\u2019s analysis of expected wellbore integrity; following  this review, Interior may advise operators to adjust screening tool  parameters when appropriate. According to Interior officials, on at least  12 occasions, an operator strengthened its wellbore design based on the  results of the screening tool. Industry representatives we met with also  said that the screening tool was valuable for helping address the risks  associated with a subsea blowout by requiring operators to document  their well design decisions and have those decisions reviewed by Interior.

Interior officials told us that they expect well containment  plans to list multiple replacement vessels and equipment to demonstrate  this redundancy, and these officials believe this sufficiently mitigates the  possibility that resources could be unavailable in the event of a subsea  blowout.

In the event of a subsea well blowout, Shell will deploy a  capping stack as its primary response. The capping stack is to be housed  on an icebreaking vessel supporting drilling operations in the Beaufort  Sea, according to the Shell representatives. The icebreaking vessel is to  have the lifting capability to deploy the stack onto an uncontrolled well.  Shell representatives said that if a blowout occurred on a well in the  Chukchi Sea, operations in the Beaufort Sea would be shut down and the  icebreaking vessel with the capping stack and other supporting vessels  would be deployed from the Beaufort Sea to the Chukchi Sea.

For example, the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas are inside the Arctic Circle,  with cold and icy conditions for much of the year and with few daylight  hours during the winter. Interior and Coast Guard officials said that a well  containment response in Alaskan waters might face certain risks that  could delay or impede a response to a blowout. For example, if a  blowout were to occur at the end of the drilling season in late October,  surface ice and temperatures could pose risks to a well containment  response.", "Even with Shell\u2019s plans to have dedicated capping stack and well  containment capabilities in the region to provide rapid response in the  event of a blowout, these dedicated capabilities do not completely  mitigate some of the environmental and logistical risks associated with  the remoteness and environment of the region. Environmental challenges  include the following:", "Surface ice. According to Interior officials, Shell proposes to drill from  July 15 through October 31, except for a period in late August to allow  for whale hunting by the indigenous population. A regional drilling  expert told us that if a blowout occurred late in the season, icy  conditions in November and December could make well containment  challenging. Shell plans to maintain an icebreaking vessel at each  drilling site to conduct ice management operations, but these  conditions could still pose a challenge to well containment response.", "Ice scouring. In addition to ice that can accumulate on the surface of  the ocean, in shallow waters, floating ice can scrape along the surface  of the seafloor. This has the potential to damage the wellhead and  blowout preventer, as well as other well containment equipment on  the seafloor. Shell representatives told us that Shell will place the  wellhead and blowout preventer in a hole on the seafloor to prevent  damage from ice scouring. However, this does not eliminate the  possibility that the capping stack or other equipment placed on or  above the seafloor, such as dispersant systems or risers, could be  obstructed or damaged by floating ice.", "Logistical challenges include the following:", "Limited infrastructure. Shell officials told us that they will have self- sufficient, dedicated subsea well containment capabilities situated on  vessels in the Arctic seas during drilling operations. Nonetheless,  these officials told us that additional personnel would be needed to  respond to a subsea well blowout. Moving personnel to the site could  delay a response, since harbors, airstrips, and hotels necessary to  support personnel are limited in number and size along Alaska\u2019s  northern shore. The facilities are also generally much farther from the  drilling sites than they are in the Gulf of Mexico, and harbors and  airstrips have much less capacity to move and support response  personnel.", "Lack of redundant vessels and equipment. According to Interior  officials, because of the low rate of offshore production in the outer  continental shelf off Alaska compared with the Gulf of Mexico, there is  not an established industry in Alaska to manage subsea oil production  or respond to a subsea blowout. Therefore, the availability of vessels  and equipment to provide additional support to respond to a subsea  well blowout may be limited. For example, we reported in October  2010 that U.S. Coast Guard infrastructure and assets for Arctic  missions are limited, including by fuel capacity, distance to fuel  sources, and crew rest requirements. Shell representatives told us  that the company plans to have two concurrent drilling operations  capable of providing mutual assistance, but there are few additional  resources available in the region to respond in the event that Shell\u2019s  capabilities are insufficient.", "Because Interior has not seen or evaluated Shell\u2019s well containment plans  and other required documents, it is too early for us to evaluate Interior\u2019s  oversight of oil and gas development and well containment capabilities in  Alaskan waters.

Interior is developing and documenting oversight processes, and in some  cases has established time frames for completion. For example, while  Interior has not fully documented its well containment plan review  process, Interior officials told us that they expect to have documentation  in place by spring 2012. Interior has also not established a regular  inspection process for well containment equipment listed in well  containment plans, but Interior officials told us that they are developing  such a process for this equipment and plan to have it in place by June  2012. Similarly, Interior does not have a documented process for  monitoring the availability of equipment identified in operators\u2019 well  containment plans, but Interior requires operators to list multiple and  redundant vessels and equipment in their well containment plans, and  Interior officials believe this sufficiently mitigates the risk if certain  equipment is unavailable. The availability of redundant vessels and  equipment found in the Gulf of Mexico does not exist in Alaska, however,  and is something that Interior will need to consider as it receives and  evaluates Shell\u2019s plans to drill in waters off Alaska. Finally, Interior has  conducted two unannounced spill drills that have included a subsea well  containment scenario, and Interior officials told us it will incorporate these  scenarios into future spill drills.

It is designed to sit on top of  other equipment that sits on top of a subsea well, such as the wellhead or  a blowout preventer, and forms a high-pressure seal around the well.  Capping stacks have a combination of gate or ram valves to block fluid  flow. Capping stacks also have side outlet valves that can allow for the  partial flow of oil, reducing the pressure in the wellbore, if needed. For  instance, if the well containment screening tool indicates wellbore integrity  will not allow for a full well shut-in, the side outlet valves will be used to  direct flow to the surface capture vessels as necessary. In this scenario,  a procedure known as \u201cflow and capture\u201d could be used to partially flow  the oil to a surface vessel for processing and transport.", "The technical features of all capping stacks designed and developed for  the Gulf of Mexico are similar and made from pre-engineered  components commonly used in the oil industry. Capping stacks typically  feature multiple rams for redundancy. Some stacks are rated for well  pressures up to 15,000 pounds per square inch (psig) and can operate in  water depths of up to 10,000 feet. Capping stacks vary somewhat in  height but are generally about 30 feet tall and weigh approximately 100  tons.", "In response to Deepwater Horizon, the global oil industry formed  initiatives and advisory groups to design and develop capping stacks.  Capping stacks that are ready for deployment include the following:  Other containment devices, including top hats, caissons, and cofferdams,  are used to collect or contain the flow of oil from the wellhead when a  capping stack cannot be connected, such as when a secure seal cannot  be achieved. A top hat provides a low-pressure seal and allows for a  limited collection of oil. A top hat is typically a temporary measure used  while the operator is evaluating or preparing alternative options. A  caisson creates a soft seal with the seabed\u2014similar to a top hat\u2013\u2013by  covering the damaged blowout preventer.
