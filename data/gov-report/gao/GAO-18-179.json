Most programs were operated under Medicaid waivers that allow states to target certain populations, limit enrollment, or restrict services to certain geographic areas.", "With respect to oversight of their largest assisted living programs, state Medicaid agencies reported varied approaches to overseeing beneficiary health and welfare, particularly in how they monitored critical incidents involving beneficiaries receiving assisted living services. State Medicaid agencies are required to protect beneficiary health and welfare and operate systems to monitor for critical incidents\u2014cases of potential or actual harm to beneficiaries such as abuse, neglect, or exploitation.", "Twenty-six state Medicaid agencies could not report to GAO the number of critical incidents that occurred in assisted living facilities, citing reasons including the inability to track incidents by provider type (9 states), lack of a system to collect critical incidents (9 states), and lack of a system that could identify Medicaid beneficiaries (5 states).", "State Medicaid agencies varied in what types of critical incidents they monitored. All states identified physical, emotional, or sexual abuse as a critical incident. A number of states did not identify other incidents that may indicate potential harm or neglect such as medication errors (7 states) and unexplained death (3 states).", "State Medicaid agencies varied in whether they made information on critical incidents and other key information available to the public. Thirty-four states made critical incident information available to the public by phone, website, or in person, while another 14 states did not have such information available at all.", "Oversight of state monitoring of assisted living services by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is limited by gaps in state reporting. States are required to annually report to CMS information on deficiencies affecting beneficiary health and welfare for the most common program used to provide assisted living services. However, states have latitude in what they consider a deficiency. States also must describe their systems for monitoring critical incidents, but CMS does not require states to annually report data from their systems. Under federal internal control standards, agencies should have processes to identify information needed to achieve objectives and address risk. Without clear guidance on reportable deficiencies and no requirement to report critical incidents, CMS may be unaware of problems. For example, CMS found, after an in-depth review in one selected state seeking to renew its program, that the state lacked an effective system for assuring beneficiary health and welfare, including reporting insufficient information on the number of unexpected or suspicious beneficiary deaths. The state had not reported any deficiencies in annual reports submitted to CMS in 5 prior years."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommendations to CMS include clarifying state requirements for reporting program deficiencies and requiring annual reporting of critical incidents.

Medicaid spending on long-term  care is significant, representing about one quarter of Medicaid spending  annually and is expected to grow with an aging population. In recent  years, most states have expanded their Medicaid long-term care options  to include more home and community-based services (HCBS), which may  include services provided by assisted living facilities. Federal and state  Medicaid spending on HCBS exceeds the amount spent on nursing home  and other institutional care and, in 2015, totaled $87 billion.", "Assisted living facilities provide a residential alternative to nursing home  care for individuals who prefer to live independently but need assistance  to maintain their independence. They may provide residents with a variety  of services to assist with activities of daily living, such as bathing and  dressing.

Under broad federal  requirements, each state administers Medicaid under the oversight of the  Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), an agency within the  U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). States must  obtain CMS approval to establish HCBS programs including those that  cover assisted living services, and are then responsible for administering  their approved programs, establishing policies and procedures to monitor  the service providers, and safeguarding beneficiaries\u2019 health and welfare.  CMS has important oversight responsibilities to ensure states are  effectively administering and monitoring Medicaid HCBS programs,  including those that cover assisted living services. With approval from  CMS, states can provide Medicaid HCBS under one or more Medicaid  authorities, including several state plan and waiver authorities. States  most frequently provide assisted living services under the HCBS waiver  program, which allows states to target certain populations, limit  enrollment, or restrict services to certain geographic areas.", "The demand for assisted living services is expected to increase as a  result of the aging of the nation\u2019s population, increased life expectancy,  and increased opportunities to remain in the community for individuals  with disabilities and older adults\u2014those 65 and older, generally referred  to as aged individuals.

As part of this survey we asked states  to report information for all of their programs that provided such services  in 2014. Information requested included Medicaid spending for such  services in 2014, enrollment, type of beneficiaries served, services  provided, and federal authority used to cover the different assisted living  programs. We conducted the survey from December 2016 through  March 2017, and received a response from all states. We did not  independently verify the information reported by the states in the survey,  but reviewed responses and followed up with state officials when reported  information appeared inconsistent or needed clarification. On that basis  we believe the data are reliable for the purposes of our reporting  objectives.", "To describe how state Medicaid agencies oversee the health and welfare  of beneficiaries receiving assisted living services, we relied on information  obtained from our survey of states. Because a state may have multiple  programs covering assisted living services within the state, and these  programs may be overseen in different ways, we focused our work on  examining states\u2019 oversight of their largest programs. In particular, we  asked each state to report 2014 information only for its largest HCBS  program in terms of number of aged beneficiaries receiving services  provided by assisted living facilities.

We reviewed HCBS waiver  programs because they are the most common type of program states use  to cover assisted living services. To obtain more detailed information on  CMS oversight of state monitoring, we selected a nongeneralizable  sample of three states: Georgia, Nebraska, and Wisconsin. We selected  these states because they were overseen by three different CMS  Regional Offices and provided coverage for assisted living services to a  large number of Medicaid beneficiaries using different administrative  models. For these states, we reviewed documentation of CMS oversight  activities, interviewed state Medicaid officials and officials in CMS\u2019s  central office and the respective regional offices that have direct oversight  of the states\u2019 programs and review documentation submitted by the  states.

Spending on long-term care services provided in home and  community settings, including assisted living facilities, exceeds the  amount spent on institutional settings such as nursing homes. State  Medicaid programs may cover certain medical and non-medical services  that assisted living facilities provide; however, the Medicaid statute does  not provide for coverage of room and board charges of an assisted living  facility.", "In their federal-state partnership, both CMS and states play important  roles in the oversight of Medicaid. CMS is responsible for oversight of  state Medicaid programs. To conduct this oversight, CMS issues program  requirements in the form of regulations and guidance, approves changes  states make to their programs, provides technical assistance to states,  collects and reviews required information and data from states and, in  some cases, reviews individual state programs. States are responsible for  the day-to-day administration of their Medicaid programs, including  monitoring and oversight of the different HCBS programs through which  they cover assisted living services, within broad federal rules and  requirements. Each state is required to identify and designate a single  state agency to administer or supervise the administration of its Medicaid  program. The state Medicaid agency may partially or fully delegate the  administration and oversight of the state\u2019s HCBS programs to another  state agency or other entity, such as a state unit on aging, a mental  health department, or other state departments or agencies with  jurisdiction over a specific population or service. However, the state  Medicaid agency is ultimately accountable to the federal government for  compliance with the HCBS requirements.", "Under different authorizing provisions of federal law, states have  considerable flexibility to establish multiple HCBS programs including  those covering assisted living services. A state Medicaid program can  have multiple HCBS programs operating under different federal  authorities. CMS is responsible for ensuring that states meet the  requirements associated with their HCBS programs under these different  authorities.", "Key to states\u2019 monitoring of the health and welfare of Medicaid  beneficiaries is their tracking of, and response to, incidents that may  cause harm to a beneficiary\u2019s health or welfare, such as abuse, neglect,  or exploitation\u2014commonly referred to as critical incidents. Such  monitoring is required for most HCBS programs; however, we previously  found that requirements for states related to oversight of the health and  welfare of beneficiaries in different types of HCBS programs varied, and  recommended that CMS take steps to harmonize those requirements  across programs.", "The most common HCBS programs with the most stringent federal  requirements are HCBS waiver programs. These programs serve  beneficiaries who are eligible for an institutional level of care; that is,  beneficiaries must have needs that rise to the level of care usually  provided in a nursing facility, hospital, or other institution. CMS oversees  states\u2019 HCBS waiver programs specifically by reviewing and approving  applications and reviewing HCBS program reports that states submit.  HCBS waiver program applications include specific requirements  implementing various statutory and regulatory provisions. (See text box  below.) One requirement is that states have the necessary safeguards in  place to protect the health and welfare of beneficiaries receiving services  covered by HCBS waiver programs. For each of their HCBS waiver  programs, states must demonstrate to CMS that they are meeting various  requirements CMS has established regarding beneficiary health and  welfare.", "The Six Requirements States Must Demonstrate for Home-   and Community-Based Services Waiver Programs  1.  Administrative authority: The Medicaid agency retains ultimate  administrative authority and responsibility for the operation of the  waiver program by exercising oversight of the performance of  waiver functions by other state and local/regional non-state  agencies (if appropriate) and contracted entities.  2.  Level of care: The state demonstrates that it implements the  processes and instrument(s) specified in its approved waiver for  evaluating/re-evaluating an applicant\u2019s/waiver participant\u2019s level of  care consistent with care provided in a hospital, nursing facility, or  intermediate care facility.  3.  Qualified providers: The state demonstrates that it has designed  and implemented an adequate system for assuring that all waiver  services are provided by qualified providers.  4.  Service plan: The state demonstrates it has designed and  implemented an effective system for reviewing the adequacy of  service plans for the waiver participants.  5.  Health and welfare: The state demonstrates it has designed and  implemented an effective system for assuring waiver participant  health and welfare.  6.  Financial accountability: The state must demonstrate that it has  designed and implemented an adequate system for insuring  financial accountability of the waiver program.", "CMS also provides ongoing oversight of state HCBS programs through  annual reports that states must submit for each of their HCBS waiver  programs as well as renewal reports submitted about two years before an  HCBS waiver is scheduled to end. The state reports are intended to  provide CMS with information on the operation of state HCBS waiver  programs.", "In contrast to long-term care services provided in nursing facilities, less is  known at the federal level about the oversight and quality of care in  assisted living facilities. Generally, states establish their own licensing  and oversight requirements for assisted living facilities. As a result, the  requirements for assisted living facilities and the type and frequency of  oversight can vary across states.", "In contrast, nursing homes must meet a comprehensive set of federal  requirements in order to receive payment for long-term care services for  Medicaid and Medicare beneficiaries in addition to state requirements.  CMS contracts with state entities to regularly inspect nursing facilities and  investigate complaints to assess whether nursing homes meet these  federal quality requirements. Annually CMS publishes a comprehensive  report on nursing homes that serve Medicaid and Medicare beneficiaries,  including the extent that beneficiaries are at risk for harm, based on these  investigations and inspections. In addition, CMS publicly reports a  summary of each nursing home\u2019s quality data using a five-star quality  rating based on health inspection results, staffing data, and quality  measure data.

States are required to  provide a brief description of the state process for monitoring beneficiary  safeguards, use check boxes to indicate that beneficiary health and  welfare safeguards have been met, and identify whether deficiencies  were detected during the monitoring process. If states determine that  deficiencies were identified through monitoring, states are required to  \u201cprovide a summary of the significant areas where deficiencies were  detected\u201d and an explanation of the actions taken to address deficiencies  and ensure the deficiencies do not recur.", "CMS\u2019s written instructions for completing the HCBS annual report do not  provide further guidance regarding reporting of deficiencies. For example,  the reporting instructions do not describe or identify 1) what states are  supposed to report as deficiencies, 2) how they are to identify which  deficiencies are most significant, and 3) the extent to which states need to  explain the steps taken to ensure that deficiencies do not recur. The lack  of clarity is inconsistent with federal internal control standards, in  particular, the need for federal agencies to have processes that identify  information needed to achieve objectives and address risk. Without  clear instructions as to what states must report, states\u2019 annual reports  may not identify deficiencies with states\u2019 HCBS waiver programs that may  affect the health and welfare of beneficiaries.", "States may determine that issues or problems they identified through  monitoring do not represent reportable deficiencies and therefore may not  report those deficiencies to CMS, increasing the risk that problems are  not elevated to CMS\u2019s attention.", "In the case of one of the selected states we reviewed, no problems were  included on the annual reports submitted to CMS between 2011 and  2015. However, when CMS completed its review in the fourth year of the  state\u2019s waiver\u2014 for purpose of renewing the waiver\u2014it determined the  state was not assuring beneficiary health and welfare. CMS found that the  information the state submitted for purpose of renewal suggested a  \u201cpervasive failure\u201d by the state to assure the health and welfare of  beneficiaries receiving services, including assisted living services. In  particular, CMS noted the state provided insufficient information regarding  the number of unexpected or suspicious beneficiary deaths. CMS  concluded that the state failed to demonstrate that it has effective  systems and processes for ensuring the health and welfare of  beneficiaries.", "Lack of requirements on states to annually provide CMS information  on critical incidents. Despite the importance of state critical incident  management and reporting systems to protecting the health and welfare  of beneficiaries, CMS lacks written requirements that states provide  information needed for the agency oversight of state monitoring of critical  incidents. According to CMS, a critical element of effective state oversight  is the operation of data systems that support the identification of trends  and patterns in the occurrence of critical incidents to identify needed  improvements. Such a system is also consistent with federal internal  controls standards which specify, in particular, the need for federal  agencies to have processes that identify information needed to achieve  objectives and address risk.", "CMS requires states to operate a critical incident reporting system. On  their waiver applications states must check a box indicating they operate  a system and also describe their system\u2014including who must report and  when, and what must be reported. Despite this requirement for states to  have critical incident reporting systems, CMS does not require states to  report to CMS any data from these systems on critical incidents as part of  their required annual reports. Specifically, states are not required to  include, in their annual reports, the number of critical incidents reported or  substantiated that involve Medicaid beneficiaries. As a result, CMS does  not have a method to confirm what states describe about critical incident  management systems, which is a required component of states\u2019 waiver  applications or to assess the capabilities of states\u2019 systems. For example,  CMS cannot confirm whether the state systems can report incidents by  location or type of residential provider, such as assisted living facilities;  the type and severity of critical incidents that occurred; and the number of  incidents that involved Medicaid beneficiaries. Without annual critical  incident reporting, CMS may be at risk of (1) not having adequate  evidence that states are meeting CMS requirements to have an effective  critical incident management and reporting system and of (2) being  unaware of problems with states\u2019 abilities to identify, track, and address  critical incidents involving Medicaid beneficiaries.", "Our prior work has shown that the lack of explicit reporting requirements  on critical incidents not only impacts HCBS waiver programs but also  impacts other types of Medicaid long-term services programs as well.  Specifically,  In a November 2016 report, we found that CMS requirements for  states to report on their critical incident monitoring systems for the  HCBS waiver program were more stringent than those for other types  of HCBS programs, potentially leaving those other programs at even  greater risk. We recommended that CMS take steps to harmonize  requirements across different types of HCBS programs. HHS  concurred with the recommendation stating it would seek input from  states, stakeholders, and the public regarding harmonizing  requirements across programs.", "In an August 2017 report we found similar issues in critical incident  reporting requirements for other types of long term services programs,  particularly those used to provide HCBS and other long term services  under managed care. We found that CMS was not always requiring  states that contracted with managed care organizations to provide  long term services and supports to report to CMS sufficient  information on critical incidents and other key areas needed to  monitor beneficiary access and quality. We recommended that CMS  take steps to identify and obtain key information needed to better  oversee states\u2019 efforts to monitor beneficiary access to quality  services in their managed long-term services and supports programs.  HHS concurred with this recommendation and stated that the agency  would take this recommendation into account as part of an ongoing  review of its 2016 Medicaid managed care rule.", "We continue to believe that the implementation of our prior  recommendations is needed to help improve CMS oversight of states  monitoring of beneficiary safety.", "CMS\u2019s inconsistent enforcement of the requirement that states  submit annual reports. States must prepare and submit an annual  report for each HCBS waiver as a condition of waiver approval. According  to CMS guidance, the agency\u2019s review of the annual report is part of the  ongoing oversight of HCBS waiver programs and not submitting an  annual report jeopardizes the states renewal of HCBS waiver programs.  However, some states have not been timely in submitting the required  annual reports for their HCBS waivers. A review of 2013 HCBS annual  reports by a CMS contractor, published in 2016, found that annual reports  were missing for 29 HCBS waivers and multiple years\u2019 of annual reports  were missing for 8 waivers.", "In 2014, CMS adopted new strategies to ensure compliance with HCBS  waiver requirements, including the requirement that states submit annual  reports on a timely basis. These strategies include withholding federal  funding, placing a moratorium on enrollment in the waiver, or other  actions the agency determines necessary. CMS officials reported that  the agency had not used these new strategies with states that were  delinquent in submitting their annual reports. Officials said they were in  the process of reviewing how to implement these new strategies in the  case of one state; however, as of August 2017 officials had not finalized a  decision. CMS\u2019s ability to provide effective oversight of state programs  and protect beneficiary health and welfare is undermined by the lack of  enforcement and receipt of required annual waiver reports."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Effective state and federal oversight is necessary to ensure that the  health and welfare of Medicaid beneficiaries receiving assisted living  services are protected, especially given the particular vulnerability of  many of these beneficiaries to abuse, neglect, or exploitation. CMS has  taken steps to strengthen beneficiary health and welfare protections in  states\u2019 HCBS waiver programs, the most common type of program that  covers assisted living services and one that serves the most vulnerable  beneficiaries. In particular, CMS now has multiple requirements for states  to safeguard beneficiaries\u2019 health and welfare, including requirements to  operate an effective critical incident management and reporting system to  identify, investigate, and address incidents of beneficiary abuse, neglect,  exploitation, and unexplained death.", "However, CMS\u2019s ability to effectively monitor how well states are assuring  beneficiary health and welfare is limited by gaps in state reporting to  CMS. CMS has not provided clear guidance to states on what information  to include in annual reports on deficiencies they identify. As a result, CMS  lacks assurance that it is receiving consistent, complete, and relevant  information on deficiencies that is needed to oversee beneficiary health  and welfare. Lacking clear guidance on the reporting of deficiencies may  result in a delayed recognition of problems that may affect beneficiary  health and welfare. Further, for years, states have been required to check  a box attesting that they operate a critical incident management system,  but have not always been required to report information on incidents of  potential or actual harm to beneficiaries. Given the increasing prevalence  of assisted living facilities as a provider of services to Medicaid  beneficiaries, it is unclear why more than half of states responding to our  survey could not provide us information on the number of critical incidents  that occurred in these facilities in their states. Reporting data from their  critical incident systems, such as the number of incidents, the type and  severity of the incidents, or the location or type of facility in which the  incident occurred would provide evidence that an effective system is in  place, provide information on the extent beneficiaries are subject to actual  or potential harm, and allow for tracking trends over time.", "Finally, CMS has not ensured that all states submit annual reports on  their HCBS waiver programs as required.
