Since 2009, ARPA-E has awarded $521.7 million to universities, public and private companies, and national laboratories to fund energy research projects.", "GAO was asked to examine (1) ARPA-E\u0092s use of criteria and other considerations for making awards and the extent to which applicants identify and explain other private funding information, (2) the extent to which ARPA-E-type projects could have been funded through the private sector, and (3) the extent to which ARPA-E coordinates with other DOE program offices to avoid duplicating efforts. GAO interviewed ARPA-E program directors, award winners, and nonwinners with characteristics similar to those of award winners.

Other considerations include balancing a variety of technology approaches and the likelihood the technology would be brought to market. GAO identified 18 out of 121 award winners through ARPA-E\u0092s first three funding rounds that had received some prior private sector investment, and ARPA-E took steps to identify and understand how this funding was related to proposed projects. Beginning with the third funding round, ARPA-E began requiring that applicants explain why private investors were not willing to fund proposed projects. However, ARPA-E did not provide applicants with guidance, such as a sample response, to assist them in completing this requirement, and responses were generally limited. Some applicants provided general information about prior research but did not specifically explain why private investors would not support their projects. When applicants provided little prior funding information, ARPA-E\u0092s program directors spent time and resources to determine the extent of such funding for proposed ARPA-E projects. One applicant included a letter from its venture capital investor to explain why the investor was not willing to fund the work proposed to ARPA-E, an approach the National Institute of Standards and Technology uses as a check in its funding applications for advanced research but that ARPA-E currently does not use. Also, ARPA-E officials said that they have considered but have not used venture capital data to identify applicants with prior private investors. Examining such data allowed GAO to quickly cross-check applicants\u0092 prior private funding.", "GAO\u0092s review suggests that most ARPA-E projects could not have been funded solely by private investors. Private venture capital firms told GAO that, among other considerations, they generally do not fund projects that rely on unproven technologies and tend to invest in projects that can be commercialized in less than 3 years. Data from ARPA-E on award winners show that 91 out of 121 ARPA-E projects from the first three funding rounds had technological concepts that had not yet been proven in a laboratory setting. Also, nearly all of the ARPA-E award winners and applicants GAO spoke with estimated that their projects were at least 3 years away from potential commercialization. In addition, GAO found that few eligible applicants that were not selected for an award later secured private funding.", "ARPA-E officials have taken steps to coordinate with other DOE offices to avoid duplication. For example, ARPA-E program directors told GAO they engage in outreach with officials from related DOE offices in advance of funding announcements to identify funding gaps in research. In addition, program directors have recruited officials from other DOE offices and the Department of Defense (DOD) to review ARPA-E applications. This cross-agency interaction may also reduce the potential for overlap in funding."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that ARPA-E consider providing applicants guidance with a sample response explaining prior sources of funding, requiring applicants to provide letters from investors explaining why they are not willing to fund proposed projects, and using third-party venture capital data to identify applicants' prior funding.

The National Academies compiled  their findings and recommendations in a report that identified two key  challenges: (1) creating high-quality jobs for Americans, and   (2) responding to the nation\u2019s need for clean, affordable, and reliable  energy. The report also highlighted the idea that scientific and technical  innovations are key drivers of economic growth in the United States.

In 2007, the America  COMPETES Act created a new agency within DOE called ARPA-E. In  line with the National Academies\u2019 recommendation, the America  COMPETES Act as amended directs ARPA-E to achieve its goals by  identifying and promoting revolutionary advances in fundamental and  applied sciences, translating scientific discoveries and cutting-edge  inventions into technological innovations, and accelerating  transformational technological advances in areas that industry by itself is  not likely to undertake because of technical and financial uncertainty. As  such, ARPA-E officials told us that ARPA-E was designed to sponsor  research beyond basic science, yet riskier than what the private sector   (See fig. 1.) The National  alone or DOE\u2019s applied offices would support.Academies recommended that ARPA-E should not perform research and  development itself, but should fund it to be conducted by universities and  others in the private sector. In 2009, the American Recovery and  Reinvestment Act of 2009 appropriated $400 million for ARPA-E.", "ARPA-E is an agency with fewer than 30 federal employees, and its eight  program directors, who are generally scientists and engineers, create and  manage funding programs for the agency. ARPA-E\u2019s program development  and award selection process takes 6 to 8 months from start to finish,  beginning when the agency hires a program director for a 3-year term and  tasks the program director with identifying a gap in energy technology  research and developing a program to fill that gap. For example, ARPA-E\u2019s  batteries for transportation program, called the Batteries for Electrical Energy  Storage in Transportation (BEEST) program, was established to fill a gap in  existing federal research programs on batteries for electric vehicles.  Identifying these gaps and designing the program involves research;  consultation with scientific experts, including a workshop with outside  experts; and internal discussion at ARPA-E. From this process, program  directors develop funding announcements that describe the technical  requirements specific to each program\u2019s technology area that applicants   have to meet and the four criteria that ARPA-E uses in its selection  process. The four criteria are the  Impact of the proposed technology relative to the state of the art. The  applicant must demonstrate the potential for a transformational\u2014not  incremental\u2013\u2013advancement over current technologies. (See fig. 2.)  More specifically, the applicant must demonstrate an awareness of  competing commercial and emerging technologies and identify how its  proposed concept/technology provides significant improvement over  these other solutions.", "Overall scientific and technical merit. The applicant must demonstrate  that the work is unique and innovative. The applicant must also  demonstrate a sound technical approach to accomplish the proposed  research and development objectives. The outcome and deliverables  of the program, if successful, should be clearly defined. Specific  technical requirements that are unique to each individual ARPA-E  program funding announcement must also be addressed.", "Qualifications, experience, and capabilities. The applicant must  demonstrate that it has the expertise and experience to accomplish the  proposed project. In addition, the applicant must have access to all  facilities required to accomplish the research and development effort.", "Sound management plan. The applicant must have a workable plan to  manage people and resources. Major technical research and  development risks should be identified. The schedule and budget  should be reasonable.", "ARPA-E employs the following three-stage application process:", "Concept paper. Applicants initially submit a 5- to 7-page abstract of  their projects. Scientific experts from industry, government, and  academia serve as reviewers.", "Full application. After reviews of the concept paper, ARPA-E encourages  some applicants to submit full applications using ARPA-E\u2019s online  application system. ARPA-E\u2019s current instructions request that applicants  provide, among other things, information about other prior, current, and  pending public and private sources of funding, as well as why other  funding sources are not willing to fund the projects. Full applications are  then reviewed by leading scientific experts in the field, who evaluate  them against the four criteria and assign numerical scores.", "Reply to reviewer comments.

In  our analysis of the ARPA-E reviewers\u2019 evaluations from these 20  applications, we noted regular assignment of numerical scores rating  applicants on the extent to which they met the criteria. All eight ARPA-E  program directors told us they considered or, if they were recently hired,  will consider all four criteria, but several focused more heavily on two  criteria\u2014the impact of the proposed technology relative to the state of the  art and its overall scientific and technical merit.", "In addition to basing the numerical scores applicants receive on the  extent to which they meet the four selection criteria, program directors  told us the agency gives them the ability to take other qualitative  considerations into account when awarding funds. One of those  considerations is to fund a broad range of potential technological  solutions with varying levels of risk in solving a given technical problem.  Two program directors selected projects to reflect a variety of  technologies, and they told us they believe that this approach increases  their programs\u2019 overall chances of success. Specifically, one program  director told us he chose projects that employed a variety of new battery  technologies, a strategy that should increase the likelihood that at least  one of them will work. This program director also chose some battery  projects with much higher potential storage capacity but with a lower  probability of success in achieving project milestones and in ultimately  being brought to market. In those cases, ARPA-E provided smaller  awards to the projects with the lower probability of success.", "Several program directors also told us that during the selection process,  they considered the applicants\u2019 projects\u2019 proposed project scope and  duration, requested funding levels, and technical milestones and  negotiated to revise these, if necessary, to better align applicants\u2019  projects with ARPA-E\u2019s program goals. According to our review of ARPA- E data from the first three rounds of funding, the agency reduced  requested award amounts by 5 percent or more on 31 out of 121 projects,  for a total of $59 million below total requested award amounts for these  rounds. When ARPA-E makes these kinds of adjustments, the agency  may also reduce the proposed project scope to fund only what the  program directors consider to be the transformational part of the project  and to avoid funding applied research or development work that would be  outside ARPA-E\u2019s program goals. For example, the agency reduced the  award amount and proposed project scope for an energy storage  technology project designed to improve energy storage on the electrical  grid. The project proposal initially requested nearly $5 million to  demonstrate the technology at nearly full scale. During award  negotiations, ARPA-E reduced this amount to $750,000 to focus the  project only on smaller-scale development and testing of the technology.  ARPA-E officials told us the larger-scale demonstration could likely be  funded by the private sector."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "ARPA-E Also Considers Applicants\u2019 Prior Sources of Private Funding, but Most Award Winners We Reviewed Did Not Explain This Information", "paragraphs": ["When making award decisions or adjusting the scope of proposed  projects, ARPA-E program directors may also consider the identification  in applications of sources of private funding and the extent to which that  funding might support the proposed projects. This information can help  provide program directors with assurance that ARPA-E funds do not  overlap with private investment. During the first two funding rounds,  ARPA-E required that applicants identify relevant private investors if the  applicant believed these funds were related to the proposed project. Of  the 18 applications we reviewed from award winners that we identified as  having received private venture capital, 14 applied during ARPA-E\u2019s first  and second funding rounds. Most of these award winners did not explain  why investors were not willing to fund proposed work. ARPA-E program  directors and an ARPA-E official, speaking on behalf of the agency, told  us they took additional steps to clarify outstanding prior funding questions  when ARPA-E was aware that applicants had received private sector  funding. For example, one applicant we reviewed from the first funding  round had previously received substantial private funding for work that  appeared very similar to its proposed ARPA-E project. ARPA-E officials  told us they were initially unable to determine why the private investor  was not willing to also fund the proposed ARPA-E project and that the  company\u2019s application did not include an explanation. ARPA-E officials  told us that getting this information required them to draft a series of direct  and detailed questions that elicited several pages of written responses  from the applicant. ARPA-E officials also told us they conducted multiple  rounds of written and oral follow-up with the applicant and the private  investor. Through these efforts, ARPA-E determined that the  technological risks of key parts of the project were too high for the private  investor and therefore decided to fund the research.", "Because ARPA-E officials recognized the need for applicants to provide  better prior funding explanations, beginning with its third funding  announcement, the agency required applicants to explain why proposed  work was not sponsored internally if the applicant was a large company,  or why private investors were not willing to support the project if the  applicant was a small business or start-up company. ARPA-E did not  provide guidance on how applicants should respond to this additional  requirement by, for example, providing a sample response. Of the 18  ARPA-E award-winning companies, 4 applied during the third funding  round, and these companies provided a range of information in response  to this new requirement in their funding applications. Two explained how  ARPA-E funds would allow them to go beyond currently funded work but  did not provide reasons why investors were not willing to support the  proposed work. Another wrote only that the ARPA-E research was too  risky for the company\u2019s private investors. One application contained an  explanation outlining the specific research its private investors were and  were not willing to fund. This applicant explained that private funds were  directed toward lower-risk and higher-cost technologies. This application  also included a letter from the company\u2019s venture capital investors that  explained which parts of its research the investors were planning to  continue funding and which research was too risky for them, although not  requested by ARPA-E. This letter provided additional third-party support  for the funding information in the application. Officials from the National  Institute of Standards and Technology\u2019s (NIST) Technology Innovation  Program told us they request that applicants provide letters from private  investors to document why applicants\u2019 projects could not be privately  funded.", "When we followed up with the 18 companies, they were generally able to  explain to us why their private investors were not willing to undertake the  additional risk and uncertainty associated with the proposed projects.  When we examined the data in the VentureDeal database for a number of  applicants, the data allowed us to quickly cross-check the names of prior  private investors that applicants reported to ARPA-E. ARPA-E officials  said that they have not used such data for these purposes but that they  have considered doing so. Without an examination of outside venture  capital data on its applicants, the agency may be missing a time-saving  opportunity to check information on private funding provided in  applications, especially in instances where applicants may not have been  thorough in their explanations. We found a number of readily available  subscription-based venture capital data services that provided company  names, transaction amounts, and funding purposes.

A number of venture capital firm  representatives told us that they are generally not willing to fund the  applied scientific research sometimes required by ARPA-E-type projects.

Most of the contingently selected applicants we spoke with\u2013\u2013 17 out of the 22\u2013\u2013told us they were unlikely to receive funding from other  sources for their proposed projects because of high levels of scientific  uncertainty, an unavailable or undeveloped market, or a lack of a working  prototype. For example, one such applicant said that he only had a  computer model suggesting that his high-efficiency air conditioning device  would work, which was insufficient to convince potential private investors.  In addition, many of the ARPA-E award winners we surveyed also  recognized the inherent uncertainty in their research; 5 of the 13 told us  that their projects had a fairly low probability of success.", "Second, venture capital firms seek more rapid returns on investment and  closely analyze a project\u2019s potential return on investment over time, a  factor that influences their decisions to invest in projects that are in later  stages of development and closer to commercialization. Venture capital  firm officials told us that they focused closely on the timeliness of  investment returns, with one firm noting that the industry tended to invest  in technologies that could be commercialized in less than 3 years and that  would potentially exhibit exponential market growth in approximately 5 to  7 years. However, we found that nearly all of the ARPA-E award winners  and most contingently selected applicants we spoke with estimated that  their projects were 3 or more years away from potential  commercialization. estimated that it would take at least 3 years for their ARPA-E projects to  For example, 12 out of 13 ARPA-E award winners  reach the commercialization stage with ARPA-E funding.

At the same time, 18 out of 22 ARPA-E contingently  selected applicants estimated it would take at least 3 years for their  projects to reach commercialization if they had been able to secure  funding for the proposal they submitted to ARPA-E.", "Third, venture capital firms may not be comfortable investing in new  energy technologies, noting the historical lack of successful venture  capital investments in these types of projects. Venture representatives  said that venture firms were more comfortable investing in software  companies or other businesses with higher potential profit margins and  less costly product development than new energy technologies. One  venture representative noted that his firm looked to invest in products with  potential gross profit margins of 50 percent or more. In addition, these  representatives noted that it is difficult for new advanced energy  technologies to compete with well-established and low-margin traditional  sources of energy like natural gas. Venture representatives also noted  that venture firms had become more risk averse and reluctant to fund new  energy technologies after lackluster investment returns have made the  venture industry more aware of the challenges associated with investing  in unproven energy technologies.", "While venture capital firms generally do not fund projects that ARPA-E  looks to fund, our work suggests that receiving ARPA-E project funding  may have a positive effect on some award winners\u2019 ability to attract  follow-on funding from the private sector for their ARPA-E work. For  example, ARPA-E\u2019s data indicate that 18 out of 121 ARPA-E award  winners from ARPA-E\u2019s first three rounds of funding had received private  sector funding totaling $318 million after receiving ARPA-E funding. In  some cases, award winners received private follow-on funding  immediately after receiving ARPA-E funding. A number of the award  winners we spoke with stated that, given the highly competitive nature of  the program, receiving ARPA-E funding served as a \u201cstamp of approval\u201d  to venture capital or other private firms. These award winners told us  that an ARPA-E award served as a signal of scientific and financial  approval for potential investors. Economists call this rapid follow-on  private funding a certification effect, which may explain the experiences of  some of these award winners. This effect suggests that public awards  address information gaps that might have otherwise precluded private  investment. Some award winners and economists we spoke with told us  that the government was suited to identifying technical risks because of  its ability to draw on the expertise of many scientific reviewers, while  venture firms may not have the scientific expertise on hand to fully  understand potential investments. Furthermore, economic literature  suggests that the certification effect may be particularly relevant in the  high-technology industries, where the venture capital community plays an  important role and in which traditional financial measures of risk and  returns on investments may prove insufficient.information on the difference between research funded by selected award  winners\u2019 prior investors and ARPA-E funded work."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Few Contingently Selected Applicants Found Funding from Private Investors or Public Sources", "paragraphs": ["Eighteen of the 22 ARPA-E contingently selected applicants we  interviewed sought funding after being turned down for ARPA-E funds.

For example, the 4 contingently selected applicants that secured funding  from a government or nonprofit source modified their ARPA-E proposals  to be more focused on basic science research, rather than on developing  a commercial technology. In addition, 1 of these applicants told us that  the funding will allow it to continue exploring fundamental materials  science rather than developing a product. Also, many contingently  selected applicants and award winners said that other government  sources were limited. Some noted that Small Business Innovation  Research (SBIR) grants would not allow them to make as much progress  as larger ARPA-E awards.military funding agencies were not as focused on developing low-cost  technologies with broader market appeal, because aerospace or military  applications do not need to achieve the same low costs and market  appeal as consumer or commercial applications."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "ARPA-E Officials Have Taken Steps to Coordinate with Other Department of Energy Offices in Advance of Awarding Funds", "paragraphs": ["According to ARPA-E officials and documents, agency officials have  taken steps to coordinate with other DOE offices in advance of awarding  ARPA-E funds to help avoid duplication of efforts. These coordination  efforts can be categorized into three areas:  Prefunding coordination. ARPA-E officials told us that program directors  engage with officials from related DOE offices in advance of announcing  the availability of ARPA-E funds. ARPA-E program directors told us that  early in the development of a funding announcement, they conduct  outreach with industry, academic, and government officials both inside  and outside of DOE in an attempt to identify funding gaps related to the  technology they wish to develop. For example, by doing such outreach,  one program director determined that there had been little funding at DOE  or elsewhere for lithium air or lithium sulfur batteries, which have the  potential to last significantly longer than existing lithium ion batteries.  Program directors also hold workshops and invite relevant participants,  including those from other DOE offices and from other federal agencies,  to identify technologies that have little to no existing research funding but  that have transformational potential. ARPA-E officials told us that  directors use the workshops and other meetings to identify research  areas that other DOE offices are not working on, and the other DOE  officials provide insights on funding areas where they are not active. For  example, one of these ARPA-E program directors told us that he met with  officials from DOE\u2019s Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability  and the Solar Energy Technologies Program within the Office of Energy  Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) before announcing available  funds for the electrical power electronics funding announcement.  According to this program director, this coordination helped him identify  that there had been little funding for the development of magnetic devices  for use in electrical power electronics. He ultimately designed the ARPA- E electrical power electronics funding announcement to focus, in part, on  the development of improved magnetic devices because of the lack of  funding elsewhere.", "In addition to inviting officials from other DOE offices to ARPA-E  workshops, program directors told us they also engage with other DOE  officials in other ways, both formally and informally. The program director  responsible for ARPA-E\u2019s work on advanced batteries said that he was a  member of DOE\u2019s Energy Storage Technology Development Team and  regularly met with other officials who are engaged in applied battery  research. This director said that it had become clear that DOE\u2019s Vehicle  Technologies Program will continue to focus on incremental  improvements to existing lithium ion battery technologies that are  currently on the market, while ARPA-E will fund newer, alternative battery  technologies. Other program directors told us that they have regular  discussions with counterparts within DOE to avoid duplicating efforts,  although through other means than a formal committee.", "Coordination of application reviews. Some ARPA-E program directors told  us that they have recruited officials from other DOE offices to review  applications submitted to ARPA-E and that these officials made up as  many as one-third of the reviewers for one director. These application  reviewers rate and recommend proposals for potential ARPA-E funding.  ARPA-E program directors told us that these DOE reviewers help them  stay aware of the types of projects that other DOE offices are funding. For  example, according to one program director, DOE reviewers indicated on  a number of occasions that an ARPA-E advanced battery applicant would  be better suited for funding under DOE\u2019s Vehicle Technologies Program  because it was for a more developed technology. ARPA-E has also used  application reviewers from other federal agencies, such as the  Department of Defense. One program director told us that these  reviewers have also helped avoid funding projects similar to those  potentially funded elsewhere.", "Official DOE coordination groups. ARPA-E is also a participant in DOE\u2019s  SunShot Initiative within the Solar Energy Technologies Program. The  SunShot Initiative is an effort to coordinate solar energy research across  DOE\u2019s Office of Science, four national laboratories, the National Science  Foundation, and ARPA-E, with the goal of achieving costs of $1 per watt  for solar-generated electricity. One ARPA-E program director is a  member of the SunShot Initiative advisory board and therefore able to  coordinate ARPA-E solar-related activities with other SunShot Initiative  members. SunShot Initiative officials told us that DOE plans to make it a  model for DOE\u2019s internal coordination efforts and that DOE hopes to  expand the approach to other research areas.", "Additionally, the ARPA-E Director created the Panel of Senior Technical  Advisors (PASTA), which is a group of high-level DOE managers that  meet periodically to discuss current and future DOE research efforts.  ARPA-E officials told us that PASTA is an attempt to avoid duplicating  efforts within DOE. PASTA meeting attendees have included officials  from DOE\u2019s applied and basic science offices.", "We were not able to directly evaluate the effectiveness of ARPA-E\u2019s  efforts to coordinate with other DOE offices. Nevertheless, we found that  on the basis of our interviews with ARPA-E award winners and  contingently selected applicants, four award winners and two contingently selected applicants had received prior funding from other DOE offices.According to these award winners and contingently selected applicants,  the prior funding was either for more proven technologies or was focused  on more basic or foundational research than was the ARPA-E funded  project."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["ARPA-E recognizes the need to ensure that the agency is not funding  projects that would be otherwise funded by the private sector, and has  taken steps to get information from applicants on their other sources of  funding. The agency has also taken steps to coordinate with other DOE  offices in advance of awarding ARPA-E funds. However, for the  applications we reviewed, we found that ARPA-E\u2019s current funding  announcements have generally yielded limited information from  applicants that had prior sources of private funding. Where applicants  provided little information, ARPA-E\u2019s program directors spent time and  resources to determine the extent of such funding for projects related to  or similar to the applicants\u2019 proposed ARPA-E projects. The agency\u2019s  requirements for information on private sector funding could be improved.  For example, ARPA-E does not provide guidance to applicants, such as a  sample response, on how to meet its information requirement on prior  private funding. An approach used by another federal program that funds  advanced research is for applicants to provide letters from private  investors to document why their projects could not be privately funded.  This approach was used by one ARPA-E award winner, who included a  letter from the company\u2019s venture capital investors to explain why the  investors were not willing to fund the project proposed to ARPA-E. Also,  ARPA-E officials said that they have not used venture capital data to  identify applicants with prior private investors and to check information  applicants provide to them, but that they have considered doing so.  Examining such data allowed us to quickly cross-check applicants\u2019 self- reported prior private funding.

We selected applications from a range of ARPA-E technology program  areas to which the applications were submitted and applicant institution  types (e.g., small company or university). Because we selected a  nonprobability sample of applications to review, information we collected  cannot be generalized to all applicants; however, it provided us with an  understanding of ARPA-E\u2019s criteria and other considerations for making  an award. We also interviewed and reviewed the applications from our  sample of 18 award winners, which were private companies that we  identified as having received funding from private investors prior to  receiving an ARPA-E award. We identified these 18 companies by  searching for evidence of prior private funding for the 121 award winners  in the VentureDeal venture capital database.

We spoke  with a representative of the venture firm that funded Agrivida, who told  us that this venture funding was only for research on the corn crop  enzymes; the firm was not willing to fund additional research on other  crops because the amount of funding it could provide to any one  company in the early stages of research was limited. Agrivida officials  told us that the ARPA-E award allowed them to expand the scope of  their work and conduct additional research on switchgrass, which may  have potential to become a major biofuel crop.
