These gaps, which still exist today, include communications, infrastructure, maritime domain awareness, and icebreaking. The Coast Guard has worked to mitigate these gaps with its Arctic partners, such as other federal agencies. For example, during a 2015 annual operation in the Arctic, the Coast Guard took steps to enhance maritime domain awareness by testing the Department of Defense's communications equipment, extending communications capabilities further north than previously possible. However, in June 2016, GAO found that the Coast Guard did not systematically assess the extent to which its actions helped to mitigate these gaps. In response to GAO's recommendation, the Coast Guard is currently developing an implementation plan and corresponding metrics for its April 2019 Arctic Strategy.", "In September 2018, GAO found that the Coast Guard faced four key risks when it established the Polar Security Cutter program in March 2018: technology, design, cost, and schedule. For example, the Coast Guard's initial planned delivery dates of 2023, 2025, and 2026 for the three ships were not informed by a realistic assessment of shipbuilding activities. The schedule was driven, instead, by the potential gap in icebreaking capabilities once the Coast Guard's only operating heavy polar icebreaker\u2014the Polar Star \u2014reaches the end of its service life (see figure).", "GAO recommended in September 2018 that the program develop a realistic schedule and determine schedule risks for the program. In response, the Coast Guard is now tracking additional schedule risks for the program and is in the process of updating its program schedule. GAO will continue to monitor the Coast Guard's progress in addressing this recommendation and other recommendations GAO made to address key risks, such as design and cost, facing the Polar Security Cutter program."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["In June 2016, GAO recommended, among other things, that Coast Guard develop measures for assessing how its actions have helped to mitigate Arctic capability gaps.

As we reported in September 2018, the Coast Guard, in  collaboration with the Navy, plans to invest up to $9.827 billion for the  acquisition, operation, and maintenance of three heavy polar  icebreakers\u2014also known as the Polar Security Cutters\u2014over their entire  30-year life cycle. In April 2019, the Navy awarded an approximately  $750 million detail design and construction contract to a shipbuilder for  the first icebreaker. As the Coast Guard\u2019s only operating heavy polar  icebreaker\u2014the Polar Star\u2014nears the end of its service life, the Polar  Security Cutters will play a critical role in the Coast Guard\u2019s ability to  ensure year-round access to the Arctic. Such access affects U.S.  economic, maritime, and national security interests in this region.", "My statement today will address (1) the Coast Guard\u2019s role in the Arctic,  including its assessment of capability gaps in the region, and (2) key risks  facing the Coast Guard\u2019s acquisition of the Polar Security Cutters.", "This statement is based primarily on our June 2016 report examining  capability gaps in the Arctic and our September 2018 report examining  the Coast Guard\u2019s polar icebreaker acquisition. For the reports cited in  this statement, among other methodologies, we analyzed Coast Guard  and Navy guidance, data, and documentation, and interviewed Coast  Guard and Navy officials. Detailed information on our scope and  methodology can be found in the reports cited in this statement. Since the  issuance of these reports, we received and reviewed information from the Coast Guard on the actions it has taken in response to our  recommendations. In addition to our prior work, for this statement we  reviewed the Coast Guard\u2019s 2019 Arctic strategic outlook.", "We conducted the work on which this statement is based in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate  evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives.

Given the Arctic region\u2019s  expansive maritime domain, the Coast Guard plays a significant role in  Arctic policy implementation and enforcement. Therefore, as we have  reported, as more navigable ocean water has emerged in the Arctic and  human activity increases, the Coast Guard has faced, and will continue to  face, expanding responsibilities in the region.", "In June 2016, we found that the Coast Guard assessed its capability to  perform its missions in the Arctic in fiscal year 2012 and identified various  capability gaps, including the following:", "Communications: including the lack of communications architecture.", "Harsh weather conditions, high latitude disturbances, and  geomagnetic storms combine to make communications in the Arctic  difficult.", "Arctic maritime domain awareness: including limited nautical  charting, inadequate navigation systems, and insufficient surveillance.  Extremely limited operational assets and support infrastructure in the  Arctic, as well as the harsh operating environment, make achieving  maritime domain awareness a challenge.", "Infrastructure: including limited aircraft infrastructure on the North  Slope in northern Alaska and limited logistical support. Facilities  located below the Arctic Circle, and even those within Alaska, provide  limited capability to support Arctic missions due to the long transits to  the Arctic region. No deepwater ports currently exist on the North  Slope or near the Bering Strait that are capable of refueling and re- provisioning polar capable cutters. This forces the Coast Guard\u2019s  polar capable cutters to expend significant time transiting long  distances to and from replenishment ports. Development of  infrastructure to support operations is challenging, in part, due to the  high cost of transporting materials to the Arctic and short construction  seasons.", "Training and exercise opportunities: including a limited pool of  Arctic-trained and experienced Coast Guard personnel, and limited  training, exercise, and educational opportunities to enhance Arctic  skills among staff. According to Coast Guard officials, few  opportunities exist to train in the Arctic, in part, because of limited  Coast Guard icebreaking capacity.", "Icebreaking: including limited icebreaking capacity given the Coast  Guard\u2019s existing active inventory of one medium and one heavy polar  icebreaker, as discussed later in this testimony.", "At the time of our June 2016 review, Coast Guard officials stated that the  capability gaps were not the sole responsibility of the Coast Guard to  mitigate and did not completely impair or eliminate their ability to perform  operations. For example, while communications can be a challenge in  remote regions, the risk of lost communications can be mitigated by using  multiple assets working together to mitigate risk if lost communications is  anticipated. Coast Guard officials also stated that given its activity levels  at the time, the mobile and seasonal nature of its Arctic presence, and its  ability to leverage partners\u2019 resources, the Coast Guard has had sufficient  resources to fulfill its Arctic responsibilities. However, Coast Guard officials stated they would reassess their approach as Arctic activity and  resulting mission requirements change over time. As we reported in June  2016, if Arctic activity continues to increase, as anticipated, the Coast  Guard may have insufficient resources to meet expanded Arctic  requirements.", "In June 2016, we also found that the Coast Guard worked with its Arctic  partners\u2014such as other federal agencies\u2014to carry out actions to help  mitigate Arctic capability gaps. For example, the Coast Guard took steps  to enhance Arctic maritime domain awareness by testing communications  equipment belonging to DOD during a 2015 annual operation in the  Arctic, extending communications capabilities further north than  previously possible. However, we found that the Coast Guard did not  systematically assess how its actions helped to mitigate these gaps. Such  an assessment\u2014which includes developing measures for gauging its  progress, when feasible\u2014is critical to the Coast Guard\u2019s understanding of  its progress towards addressing these gaps. By systematically assessing  and measuring how its actions have helped to mitigate capability gaps,  the Coast Guard will be better positioned to effectively plan its Arctic  operations, including its allocation of resources and prioritization of  activities to target the gaps.", "As a result, we recommended in June 2016 that the Coast Guard (1)  develop measures for assessing how its actions have helped to mitigate  Arctic capability gaps and (2) design and implement a process to  systematically assess its progress on this. DHS concurred with our  recommendations. As of January 2020, the Coast Guard had not yet  taken action to implement these two recommendations, in part because  the Coast Guard issued its Arctic strategic outlook in April 2019 and is  currently updating its corresponding implementation plan for this  strategy. The plan is expected to provide the foundation for  systematically assessing efforts to address Arctic capability gaps. Coast  Guard officials stated that they are also developing a strategic metrics  framework for measuring progress in addressing the capability gaps.  Coast Guard officials did not identify when they plan to complete the plan  and framework, stating that these are longer-term efforts.", "The Coast Guard highlighted the Arctic capability gaps in its 2013 Arctic  Strategy and again in its 2019 Arctic strategic outlook. The 2019  strategy highlighted the need to elevate the Arctic region\u2019s prominence as  a strategically competitive space due to (1) the resurgence of nation-state  competition from the United States\u2019 two nearest-peer powers, Russia and  China, and (2) reduced ice conditions in the Arctic which have led to  increased human and economic activity in the region.", "In addition, the 2019 Arctic strategy highlighted three overarching goals: enhance capability to operate effectively in a dynamic Arctic domain,  strengthen the rules-based order, and  innovate and adapt to promote resilience and prosperity.", "Further, the 2019 Arctic strategy noted that the Coast Guard is the sole  provider and operator of the U.S. polar icebreaking fleet\u2014a critical  component in achieving the Coast Guard\u2019s overarching goals in the  strategy\u2014but currently does not have the capability or capacity to ensure  access in the Arctic region. The Coast Guard\u2019s polar icebreaking fleet  comprises two operational polar icebreakers\u2014the Polar Star and Healy\u2014 of which only the Healy is currently active and operating in the Arctic.  The Healy is a medium icebreaker that primarily supports Arctic research,  and while it is capable of carrying out a wide range of activities, it cannot  ensure timely access to some Arctic areas in the winter given that it does  not have the icebreaking capabilities of a heavy polar icebreaker. See  figure 1 for photographs of the Coast Guard\u2019s active icebreakers.", "In November 2018, the Coast Guard Assistant Commandant for  Acquisition testified that the Coast Guard\u2019s current polar icebreaking fleet  provides minimal capacity to carry out current icebreaking missions and  that the nation must take swift action to rebuild and enhance this critical  national capability. To this end, DHS approved the Coast Guard\u2019s Polar  Security Cutter acquisition program\u2019s cost, schedule, and performance  baselines in February 2018."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Coast Guard Has Taken Steps to Address Technology, Design, Cost, and Schedule Risks for the Polar Security Cutters", "paragraphs": ["In September 2018, we found that the Coast Guard did not have a sound  business case when it established the acquisition baselines for the Polar  Security Cutter program in March 2018 due to risks in four key areas:  technology, design, cost, and schedule. Our prior work has found that  successful acquisition programs start with solid, executable business  cases before setting program baselines and committing resources. A  sound business case requires balance between the concept selected to  satisfy operator requirements and the resources\u2014design knowledge,  technologies, funding, and time\u2014needed to transform the concept into a  product, which in this case is a ship with polar icebreaking capabilities.  Without a sound business case, acquisition programs are at risk of  breaching the cost, schedule, and performance baselines set when the  program was initiated\u2014in other words, experiencing cost growth,  schedule delays, and reduced capabilities.", "To address the key risks we identified and help establish a sound  business case for the Polar Security Cutter program, we made six  recommendations to DHS, Coast Guard, and the Navy in our September  2018 report. The agencies concurred with all six recommendations and  have taken steps to address some of the risks, as noted below.", "Technology. The Coast Guard planned to use proven technologies  for the program, but did not conduct a technology readiness  assessment to determine the maturity of key technologies prior to  setting baselines. As a result, the Coast Guard did not have full  insight into whether these technologies were mature and was  potentially underrepresenting the technical risk of the program. We  recommended that the program conduct a technology readiness  assessment, which DHS completed in June 2019. DHS determined  that two of the three key technologies were mature and the remaining  technology was approaching maturity. The Coast Guard now has  plans in place to use testing results to increase the maturity and  reduce risks for the remaining technology\u2014the hull form.", "Design. The Coast Guard set program baselines before conducting a  preliminary design review. This review is a systems engineering event  intended to verify that the contractor\u2019s design meets the requirement  of the ship specifications and is producible. By not conducting this  review before establishing program baselines, the program is at risk of  having an unstable design, thereby increasing the program\u2019s cost and  schedule risks. We recommended that the program update its  baselines prior to authorizing lead ship construction and after  completion of the preliminary design review. DHS and the Coast  Guard agreed and plan to take these steps by fiscal year 2022.", "Cost. The cost estimate that informed the program\u2019s $9.8 billion cost  baseline\u2014which includes life cycle costs for the acquisition,  operations, and maintenance of three polar icebreakers\u2014substantially  met our best practices for being comprehensive, well-documented,  and accurate. But the estimate only partially met best practices for  being credible. The cost estimate did not quantify the range of  possible costs over the entire life of the program, such as the period  of operations and support. As a result, the cost estimate was not fully  reliable and may underestimate the total funding needed for the  program. We recommended that the program update its cost estimate  to include risk and uncertainty analysis on all phases of the program  life cycle, among other things. Subsequently, in December 2019, we  found that while the Coast Guard updated the cost estimate in June  2019 to inform the budget process, the estimate did not reflect cost  changes resulting from the contract award two months prior. Coast  Guard officials acknowledged these cost risks and plan to address  them as part of the next update to the program\u2019s cost estimate. Coast  Guard officials told us that they plan to update the cost estimate by  the end of February 2020.", "Schedule. The Coast Guard\u2019s initial planned delivery dates of 2023,  2025, and 2026 for the three ships were not informed by a realistic  assessment of shipbuilding activities. Rather, these dates were  primarily driven by the potential gap in icebreaking capabilities once  the Coast Guard\u2019s only operating heavy polar icebreaker\u2014the Polar  Star\u2014reaches the end of its service life. In addition, our analysis of  selected lead ships for other Coast Guard and Navy shipbuilding  programs found the icebreaker program\u2019s estimated construction time  of 3 years to be optimistic. An unrealistic schedule puts the Coast  Guard at risk of not delivering the icebreakers when promised. As a  result, the potential gap in icebreaking capabilities could widen. We  recommended that the program develop a realistic schedule, including  delivery dates, and determine schedule risks during the construction  phase of the program. In response, the Coast Guard is now tracking  additional schedule risks for the program and is in the process of  updating its program schedule. Further, in December 2019, we found  that the contract delivery date for the lead ship, May 2024, is 2  months after the delivery date in the program\u2019s schedule baseline.  Coast Guard officials said they plan to address this risk when they  update the program\u2019s schedule by the end of March 2020.", "In summary, the Arctic region has increased in strategic importance in  recent years, and with the increase comes more responsibility for the  Coast Guard. The Coast Guard has emphasized that as the Arctic  continues to open and strategic competition drives more actors to look to  the Arctic for economic and geopolitical advantages, the demand for  Coast Guard leadership and presence will continue to grow. As the Coast  Guard embarks on the acquisition of its new polar icebreakers, it faces a  number of key acquisition risks. The Coast Guard has begun to take  steps to address these risks and must remain committed to executing a  sound business case for the program to mitigate capability gaps in the  Arctic. To this end, we will continue to monitor the Coast Guard\u2019s  progress in addressing our recommendations.", "Chairman Correa, Ranking Member Lesko, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this concludes my prepared statement.
