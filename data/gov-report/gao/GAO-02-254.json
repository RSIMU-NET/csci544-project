The 1998 amendments to the Higher  Education Act (HEA) authorize the secretary of Education to enter into  \u201cvoluntary flexible agreements\u201d (VFAs) with individual guaranty agencies.  Each VFA provides a guaranty agency flexibility to implement new  business practices by waiving or modifying some of the requirements  established under federal regulations that apply to other guaranty  agencies. As of November 2001, Education had signed VFAs with four of  the nation\u2019s 36 guaranty agencies. Five other guaranty agencies applied,  but were not selected, withdrew, or did not reach agreement with  Education.", "Although the 1998 VFA legislation gave Education flexibility in developing  these agreements with the guaranty agencies, it also imposed some  restrictions. For example, while the agreements could potentially change  almost any aspect of how the guaranty agencies are compensated for  services by Education, the VFA legislation prohibited the agreements from  increasing projected federal program costs. Additionally, the agreements  could change how the guaranty agencies process loans, but the VFA  legislation prohibited the agreements from changing the statutory terms  and conditions of loans, such as the borrowers\u2019 interest rate. Some  guaranty agencies and other program participants, such as representatives  of lender and loan servicing groups, told us that Education could have  done a better job in developing the agreements and some expressed  concern that the agreements may not have entirely complied with the  restrictions contained in law. You asked us to examine these matters.  Specifically, as agreed, we focused on answering the following questions:  1.\t To what extent did the VFA development process meet the needs of  guaranty agencies and other program participants?  2.\t To what extent do VFAs comply with requirements in the VFA  legislation?  3.  What changes are being implemented under the VFAs?  4.

We reviewed the four, signed agreements for compliance with the  provisions in the VFA legislation. We used Education\u2019s analyses to  determine whether the VFAs complied with the requirement not to  increase projected federal program costs.

Both programs provide  subsidized and unsubsidized Stafford loans, Parent Loans for  Undergraduate Students and Consolidation loans. Under the FFELP,  private lenders, such as banks, provide loan capital. The federal  government guarantees the loans but uses 36 guaranty agencies to  administer many aspects of the program. With federal funding, these  guaranty agencies generally provide insurance to the lenders for 98  percent of the unpaid amount of defaulted loans. The guaranty agencies  also work with lenders and borrowers to prevent loan defaults and collect  on the loans after default. In contrast, under the FDLP the federal  government provides the loan capital to borrowers.", "For over a decade, GAO has included student aid programs on a list of  \u201chigh-risk\u201d federal programs.

Five other guaranty agencies applied for VFAs but  either were not selected or failed to reach agreement with Education (see  table 1). Since the beginning of fiscal year 2002, Education has had the  authority to enter into VFAs with all of the guaranty agencies.", "In May 1999, Education officials discussed VFAs with guaranty agency  representatives who were attending a conference hosted by the National  Council of Higher Education Loan Programs, Inc.

Most of these guaranty agency  officials, including those that were generally supportive of Education,  expressed a variety of concerns about Education\u2019s communication efforts  during the VFA development process. For instance, several guaranty  agencies indicated a need for more information on Education\u2019s  methodology for analyzing the projected federal program costs of the  VFAs, or on Education\u2019s five criteria for selecting the VFAs.", "Furthermore, the established timetable was not met. Education indicated  it would select the six initial guaranty agencies within two weeks after the  application deadline of August 27, 1999, but the notice of selections did  not occur until February 2000. Education set December 1, 1999, as the  target date for signing the VFAs; however, the first VFA was not signed  until November of 2000 and the other three were not signed until March  2001. Guaranty agency officials told us that criticisms of Education\u2019s  failure to meet its own timetable would have been somewhat mitigated if  Education had done a better job in communicating the status of the VFAs  to the guaranty agencies. In response to these criticisms, Education  officials explained that the process was hampered by organizational  changes and staff turnover that occurred during the VFA development  process. For instance, officials told us that delays were partially the result  of Education\u2019s decision to place a higher priority on developing  regulations for implementing other 1998 HEA amendments and on  reorganizing the Office of Student Financial Assistance as a performance- based organization.

However, some  third parties told us that information available on the Web site was  insufficient to evaluate the draft agreements and that Education did not  provide responses to those who commented on the draft agreements. In  response to this, Education officials told us that the Internet posting was  not required by the VFA legislation, but that they did so to increase  opportunities for public comment.

Another participant said that VFA proposals should  have been solicited through a more formal process, such as those used in  federal contracting procedures.

For  instance, we found that as required by the VFA legislation, the agreements  made no changes to the statutory terms and conditions of the loans.  However, we were not convinced that the agreements conform to the  requirement that the projected program cost to the government not  increase due to the VFAs. For one VFA, Education projected federal  program costs would increase each year of the 3-year analysis period.  Furthermore, the agreements appear to have violated the cost requirement  if Education\u2019s cost determination had been based on a different time  period, or if the analyses had been based on changes in assumptions about  certain factors, such as default rates.", "The authorizing statute specifies, \u201cin no case may the cost to the Secretary  of the agreement, as reasonably projected by the Secretary, exceed the  cost to the Secretary, as similarly projected, in the absence of the  agreement.\u201d  Education\u2019s budget service analyzed each of the four VFAs in  the course of Education\u2019s negotiations with the guaranty agencies and  concluded that each agreement met the requirement. However,  Education\u2019s analysis of the Texas VFA projected that federal costs will  increase an average of about $1 million a year. Budget service staff  indicated that they regarded this amount as insignificant compared with  total federal cash flows being estimated. Education\u2019s estimates for the  Texas agency show that the projected amount of collections on defaulted  loans less federal program costs is an average of  $161 million per year  over fiscal years 2001 to 2003.  An alternative basis of comparison could be  to use the projected net amount of the agency\u2019s receipts from federal  sources and its retentions of collections (an average of $71 million per  year over the same time period). In either case, the projected increase is  not consistent with the VFA legislative requirement that the projected  federal program costs not increase due to the VFA.", "Our review of Education\u2019s analyses raised two additional questions about  Education\u2019s conclusion that the VFAs would not increase projected federal  costs.", "Costs considered for first 3 years only. First, Education based its  conclusion on projected costs for only the first 3 years, while Education\u2019s  projections show that costs for three VFAs would increase substantially in  years 4 and 5. As table 2 shows, during the first 3 years, only the Texas  agreement (discussed above) was projected to cause an increase in federal  costs. By including projections for the fourth year or for both the fourth  and fifth year, however, costs for three of the four VFAs would rise, with  costs for the Texas and Great Lakes guaranty agencies rising substantially.  These increases would occur as the size of these guaranty agencies\u2019 loan  volumes and the cumulative size of their portfolios increase.", "Education officials and Office of Management and Budget officials said  they took this approach because they viewed the VFAs as demonstration  programs of limited duration to be evaluated by the Congress during the  next reauthorization of HEA. This act is due for reauthorization at the end  of fiscal year 2003. Although the American Student Assistance VFA  specifies a termination date at the end of fiscal year 2003, the other three  agreements have no specified termination date. They each remain in effect  until either the guaranty agency or Education chooses to withdraw with  advanced written notice.", "Effects of changes in performance not adequately considered.  Second, budget service officials reached their conclusions about the cost  effects of the VFAs using a set of base year assumptions that did not  adequately consider the effect of changes in guaranty agency  performance\u2014that is, they assumed that such things as default rates,  collection rates, and delinquency rates would remain unchanged in future  years. The VFAs were designed to improve guaranty agency performance  and under the agreements, doing so would mean higher payments to the  guaranty agencies for their improved performance. Thus, analyzing the  proposed payment structures to estimate how such improvements would  affect net federal costs\u2014in the form of lower default rates, for example\u2014  seems warranted. However, according to budget service officials this  happened in only one case and to a limited extent.", "In that particular case, budget service staff analyzed the effect of a decline  in loan defaults for the California VFA, and its estimates illustrate the  importance of considering the effect of changes in guaranty agency  performance on federal costs. A provision in the California VFA provides  an incentive payment to the guaranty agency for achieving lower default  payments. At the time this VFA was being developed Education staff  calculated that California\u2019s fiscal year 1998 \u201ctrigger default rate\u201d\u2013was 3.1  percent compared with the aggregate national rate of 2.9 percent. In an  effort to encourage the California guaranty agency to reduce its trigger  default rate, the VFA provides for a payment from Education to the  guaranty agency equal to half of the amount of claims payments avoided  by having a trigger rate below 3 percent. Budget service staff then  analyzed the effects of a decline in trigger default rates below 3 percent\u2014  to see how much the payment would be in the event the agency was able  to reduce it\u2019s trigger default rate that much. Education found that the  payment to California would be greater than the savings from the reduced  defaults\u2014and thus would result in increases in federal costs. However, in  doing their formal analysis of the California\u2019s VFA, budget service staff did  not include the results of their default analysis and instead assumed no  change in the base-year 3.1 percent trigger default rate; thus as table 2  shows, there are no projected increases or decreases to the costs for that  VFA. Subsequently, California\u2019s trigger default rate did drop below 3  percent\u2014down to 2.6 percent for fiscal year 2001. Our analysis based on  Education\u2019s estimates shows that the California guaranty agency\u2019s fiscal  year 2001 trigger rate of 2.6 percent entitles it to a VFA incentive payment  of about $17.3 million\u2014an amount approximately $2.6 million greater than  the estimated total the government saved due to the lower volume of  defaulted loans. Because there were no other projected cost  considerations for this VFA, the decline in loan defaults under the VFA  resulted in an increase in projected net federal costs.

Under the traditional payment  structure that continues to be used for the non-VFA agencies, it is  financially more beneficial for a guaranty agency to allow borrowers to  default on their loans and to subsequently collect on the loans than to  prevent defaults in the first place. A guaranty agency currently retains 24  percent of the money that it recovers from borrowers whose loans are in  default\u2014that is, the borrowers who are more than 270 days behind in  making payments. According to some guaranty agency officials, this  percentage is typically higher than a guaranty agency\u2019s actual cost of  collecting on defaulted loans. As a result, a non-VFA guaranty agency has  more financial incentive to \u201callow\u201d borrowers to default than to prevent  the default upfront.", "Three of the four VFAs have incentive provisions that reduce the guaranty  agencies\u2019 share of collections on defaulted loans. To compensate for this  lower collection retention rate, the VFAs have enhanced incentives for  better performance. For example, the American Student Assistance VFA  reduces the collection retention rate from 24 percent to 18.5 percent for  regular collections on defaulted loans in exchange for potentially greater  incentive payments for lower defaults. To implement such incentive  provisions, VFA agencies have created programs aimed at improving their  performance, particularly in the areas of reducing delinquencies and net  defaults. For example:", "To help borrowers with defaulted loans, American Student Assistance  created Bright Beginnings. This program focuses on providing support  to the borrowers and finding solutions to loan default instead of  making payment demands and threatening sanctions for nonpayment,  such as wage garnishment and negative reports to credit bureaus. Help  may involve, for example, working with the borrowers on a strategy to  get the education or training necessary to obtain employment that  would provide the income needed to repay their loans. Additionally,  the program points out to borrowers the advantages of making  payments on their loans. For example, if borrowers make nine  consecutive monthly payments they will be eligible for rehabilitation, a  process by which the guaranty agency sells the defaulted loan back to a  lender. Rehabilitation is important because, in addition to being current  on their loan payments, the borrowers become eligible for additional  Title IV student financial aid.", "To avert defaults by borrowers who withdraw from school without  completing their educational program, the California Student Aid  Commission is planning an early-withdrawal counseling program.  Individuals who withdraw from school early are at high risk of  defaulting on their loans and the Commission believes that early  intervention by the guaranty agency is more likely to result in the  borrowers being able to avoid default. Under current regulations, a  guaranty agency provides default aversion assistance to borrowers only  after they become 60 or more days delinquent on their loan. Under the  early-withdrawal counseling program, the Commission will contact  borrowers as soon as they withdraw from school. The program plans to  educate borrowers through a variety of services and provide  information about their responsibilities and options for avoiding  default.", "To help keep delinquent borrowers from defaulting, Great Lakes Higher  Education Guaranty Corporation and the Texas Guaranteed Student  Loan Corporation are both requiring lenders to submit requests for  default aversion assistance between the 60th and the 70th day of  delinquency.

For example, after 45 days of delinquency, the  guaranty agencies must \u201cdiligently attempt to contact the borrower by  telephone.\u201d  Between 46 and 180 days of delinquency, the agencies  must \u201csend at least three written notices to the borrower forcefully  demanding immediate commencement of repayment.\u201d Under the VFA,  American Student Assistance has flexibility to develop procedures it  considers to be more efficient utilizing best practices common to the  financial services industry.

The reasons for this reduction are likely  multiple, including a low unemployment rate (giving more people jobs to  pay off their student loans) resulting from generally favorable economic  conditions during that period.

Furthermore, it  cannot adequately determine what has happened as a result of the VFAs  through, for instance, comparisons with the results of past efforts to cure  delinquent loans and comparisons of the results of similar efforts by other  guaranty agencies.

However, other measures of VFA guaranty agency  performance might not be as easily compared across the guaranty  agencies. For example, Education currently lacks a means of calculating  the cost of the VFAs. Specifically, it cannot calculate the amount by which  VFA provisions increase federal payments to the VFA agencies, because it  does not have a way to determine the amount of default aversion fees that  each agency would have received in the absence of the VFA agreements.  Also, the Great Lakes guaranty agency plans to measure VFA performance,  in part, by measuring customer satisfaction.

Without adequate performance measures Education is not well positioned  to judge the success or failure of the VFA provisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve the VFA development process for any future VFAs, we  recommend that the secretary of Education develop a plan to more regularly communicate with guaranty agencies  concerning the status of VFA development efforts, including disclosing  to program participants the planned methods for projecting the federal  program cost effects of VFAs; and a timetable for selection, negotiation, and completion of agreements  based on experience developing the first four VFAs.", "In order to ensure that all VFAs are in compliance with statutory  requirements, we recommend that the secretary of Education  renegotiate the Texas VFA as soon as practicable to obtain changes  necessary to ensure that the VFA does not increase projected federal  costs;  renegotiate the California VFA as soon as practicable to obtain changes  necessary to ensure that the VFA does not increase projected federal  costs, with or without changing the trigger default rate;  renegotiate the Great Lakes and American Student Assistance VFAs for  time periods after fiscal year 2003 to ensure that the VFAs do not  increase projected federal program costs; and  improve projections of the cost effects of renegotiated VFAs and any  future VFA proposals by (1) requiring that each VFA specify an  effective time period, (2) conducting a cost analysis covering that  period, and (3) conducting analyses to project the cost effects of  changes in assumptions regarding guaranty agency performance, such  as default rates, in making the cost projections.", "To ensure that the results of the VFAs can be effectively evaluated, we  recommend that the secretary of Education develop specific evaluation plans enabling Education to compare VFA  guaranty agency performance with past performance and the  performance of other guaranty agencies using uniformly defined  performance measures, including delinquent loan cure rates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to Education for comment.  In its  response, Education indicated that it had a number of concerns about the  report.", "Education stated that our mention of GAO\u2019s designation of the student  financial assistance programs as \u201chigh-risk\u201d (in the Background section)  was beyond the scope of our review and that it detracts from the analysis  in the report. We disagree. The report contains analyses and descriptive  information on many aspects of the FFEL program, which provided  approximately $23 billion of loans for postsecondary students in fiscal  year 2000. The mention of the student loan programs as high risk and the  ensuing discussion are important to help establish the significance that  any changes\u2014including the VFAs\u2014might have on the program.", "Regarding the development of the VFAs, Education said that it appears  that our conclusions were based primarily on conversations with  individual guaranty agencies that did not apply for a VFA and  representatives of various interest groups, many of which had consistently  opposed the VFAs.  In fact, as indicated in our report, our conclusions are  largely based on comments from representatives of 18 guaranty  agencies\u2014including representatives from all four agencies with VFAs;  representatives from those agencies that had unsuccessfully sought a VFA;  representatives from agencies that did not seek a VFA, but may wish to in  the future; and representatives from agencies that had opposed the VFA  legislation from the beginning.", "Concerning the cost effects of the VFAs, Education stated that it had, in  keeping with its standard procedures for estimating costs, (1) used a  closed time period (in this case, 3 years) to project costs; (2) not  considered the impact of possible changes to borrower or institutional  behavior in projecting costs; and (3) appropriately treated the $1 million  per year projected cost increase for the Texas VFA as \u201cinsignificant.\u201d", "First, in looking at the 3-year time period, Education said that its  conclusions about the cost effects of the VFAs were appropriately limited  to the first 3 years because there was no reason to expect that the  agreements would necessarily remain in effect beyond the time period for  reauthorization of HEA, which may bring changes that could alter any cost  analyses.  We agree that the projected increases in federal costs in the  fourth and fifth years would not be relevant if the current agreements no  longer remain in effect after the end of fiscal year 2003.  However, since  three of the VFAs are open-ended, there is reason to believe they could  extend beyond three years.  Therefore, to ensure that projected federal  costs do not increase due to the VFAs, Education would need to  renegotiate the VFAs for the time period beyond 3 years. Education\u2019s  statement that, \"GAO's interpretation of the statute as requiring strict 'cost  neutrality' over a long period of time is not supported in the statute or the  legislative history,\" is incorrect.  We did not interpret the statute in this  manner. Instead, our reading of the statute is that the period of time to be  examined should correspond to the projected life of the agreement.  As  mentioned above, three of the agreements we reviewed were for an open- ended period of time. Education chose a 3-year period for their cost  analysis, which is within its discretion and not inconsistent with the  statute.  However, the report was intended to make clear that, given the  open-ended nature of the agreements, a decision by Education not to  terminate the agreements after 3 years would warrant a reassessment of  the cost projections and a renegotiation of the agreements, if necessary.", "Second, Education stated that it does not base cost estimates on  behavioral assumptions that cannot be supported by available data.  We  agree that this is appropriate for baseline estimates, however one of the  purposes of the VFAs is to improve guaranty agency performance, and  thus the cost effects of potential improvements need to be considered in  Education\u2019s cost projections.  Accordingly, we recommended that  Education supplement baseline estimates with sensitivity analyses in order  to avoid provisions that increase federal costs when an agency\u2019s  performance improves, by reducing default rates for example.", "Third, with respect to Education\u2019s assertion that the projected increase of  $1 million per year for the Texas VFA is \u201cinsignificant,\u201d we disagree.  Education based its assertion on a comparison of the $1 million to the  total federal cash flows being estimated.  The projected amount of  collections on defaulted loans less federal program costs averaged $161  million per year for the 3-year period\u2014an amount lower than the  \u201chundreds of million of dollars per year\u201d Education cited in its comments.  Additionally, an alternative basis of comparison could be to use the  projected net amount of the agency\u2019s receipts from federal sources and its  retentions of collections (an average of $71 million per year for the 3-year  period). In either case, the projected increase is not consistent with the  VFA legislative requirement that the projected federal program costs not  increase due to the VFAs.", "Regarding preparations to evaluate the VFAs, Education said that it is  establishing common, general measures to evaluate the performance of  each VFA and, whenever possible, to compare VFA guaranty agency  performance with other non-VFA guaranty agencies. Education noted that  it has had preliminary discussions with representatives of the 36 guaranty  agencies regarding uniform performance measures. Also, it noted that the  guaranty agencies are in the process of establishing an eight-member task  force to assist in determining the specific formulae for measuring VFA  performance. As our report indicates, Education does currently have  several possible uniform measures of agency performance.  We welcome  its efforts to develop additional measures, but conclude that a uniform  cure rate measure would assist in evaluating the performance of the VFAs,  considering that two guaranty agencies with VFAs specifically identified a  cure rate as a performance indicator.", "We reviewed these and additional Education comments and modified the  draft as appropriate. Education\u2019s comments are included in appendix IV.", "We are sending copies of this report to Honorable Roderick R. Paige,  secretary of Education; appropriate congressional committees; the  guaranty agencies with VFAs; and other interested parties.

What changes are being implemented under the VFAs?  4.  How well prepared is Education to assess the effects of the VFAs?", "To determine the extent to which Education\u2019s VFA development process  met the needs of guaranty agencies and other program participants, we  interviewed Education officials involved in the development of the VFAs,  officials at each of the nine guaranty agencies that submitted an  application for a VFA, and nine guaranty agencies that did not submit  applications. The nine guaranty agencies that did not submit applications  included the five guaranty agencies with the largest amounts of loan  guarantees and four randomly selected smaller guaranty agencies that did  not submit applications.  We also reviewed VFA proposals and comments  Education received during the public comment period.", "To determine the extent to which the VFAs complied with statutory  requirements we reviewed the VFA agreements, provisions of the Higher  Education Act (HEA) concerning the Federal Family Education Loan  Program (FFELP), and related regulations. We also discussed the  agreements with Education and guaranty agency officials, and  representatives of industry associations including the National Council of  Higher Education Loan Programs, Inc. and the Consumer Bankers  Association. To review Education\u2019s methods for projecting the costs of the  VFA agreements, we examined computerized schedules Education used to  project each VFA guaranty agency\u2019s costs and financial data compiled by  Education staff from submissions by the guaranty agencies. We also  discussed these projections with Education\u2019s budget service staff and  Congressional Budget Office and Office of Management and Budget  officials.", "To identify changes being implemented under the VFAs we reviewed the  VFAs and discussed them with the guaranty agency officials and reviewed  documents they provided concerning their programs.", "In addition, to determine how well prepared Education is to identify the  effects of the VFAs, we discussed plans for evaluation of the VFAs with  guaranty agency officials and Education officials responsible for collecting  and analyzing data from guaranty agencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comparison of Projected Federal Costs with California Trigger Default Rate at 2.6 or 3 Percent", "paragraphs": ["On the basis of budget service subsidy rate estimates, we projected the  level of noninterest federal costs for $263 million of loans\u2014the amount of  loans that would default if the California guaranty agency\u2019s trigger default  rate were 3 percent in fiscal year 2001. As shown in table 3 below, we  estimated the net federal costs of these loans (excluding interest subsidy  costs that the budget service indicated would not be affected) under four  different scenarios: (1) a 3 percent trigger default rate with all $263 million  of these loans defaulting without the VFA in effect, (2) a 3 percent trigger  default rate with the VFA in effect, (3) a 2.6 percent trigger default rate  with $228 million of the $263 million of loans defaulting without the VFA in  effect, and (4) a 2.6 percent trigger default rate with the VFA in effect. As  shown in table 3, federal noninterest costs for these loans would be about  $107 million under either scenario 1 or scenario 2. In scenario 3, federal  costs would decline by about $15 million to $92 million as trigger basis  defaults decline from 3 percent to 2.6 percent.", "Under scenario 4, however, Education would benefit from lower loan  defaults, but it would also have to pay the California guaranty agency half  of the $34.7 million reduction in the amount of claims payments to lenders  (a $17.3 million VFA fee). Because the VFA fee exceeds the benefit  Education would realize from the lower level of defaults, federal costs  would increase by an estimated $2.6 million.", "The VFA default rate incentive payment, one-half of the claims payments  avoided with a trigger default rate below 3 percent, was identified in the  VFA agreement as \u201c50% of the savings in claim payments resulting from its  default aversion activities under this VFA.\u201d This calculation, however, fails  to take into account two potentially significant factors. First, the federal  cost of loan default is mitigated in part by subsequent collections on the  defaulted loan. If the guaranty agency receives payment on a loan after the  loan defaults it generally is allowed to retain 24 percent of the amount  collected. The remaining 76 percent must be remitted to Education.  Budget service staff looked to see how the present value of these  payments would affect the present value of program costs for Subsidized  Stafford loans. They concluded that the federal cost (aside from federal  administrative costs) on a subsidized Stafford loan that defaults is on  average about 47.5 percent of the amount of the loan. The comparable  figure for the same loan without default, but with the VFA incentive  payment was 51.7 percent. In other words, the incentive payment to  California\u2019s guaranty agency exceeded the present value of the federal cost  of the default adjusted for the subsequent collections on the loan. Instead  of benefiting from fewer defaults of loans guaranteed by the California  guaranty agency, Education stands to benefit from increases in defaults  until the guaranty agency\u2019s trigger default rate reaches 3 percent. Above  that point the guaranty agency would not receive an incentive payment  and Education would not benefit from higher levels of defaults.", "The second reason for questioning the provision\u2019s definition of federal  cost savings resulting from the VFAs default aversion activities is that the  entire decline in default costs may not be solely attributable to the VFA.  Default rates change for many reasons. According to guaranty agency and  Education officials, declines in default rates are due to such factors as a  change in definition of default from 180 to 270 days of delinquency  brought by the VFA legislation, increased default aversion assistance  activities by all guaranty agencies, enhancements in loan servicing  methods, and a prosperous economy. The VFA incentive payment to  California rewards the guaranty agency for any decline in default rates  whether it is due to VFA prompted efforts or to other factors.", "As shown in figure 2 below, generally guaranty agencies have seen  declines in trigger default rates. Guaranty agencies that received VFAs and  guaranty agencies that did not both saw declines in default rates from  fiscal year 1997 to fiscal year 2000, with increases in fiscal year 2001. For  example, the largest guaranty agency, USA Funds, Inc. had a higher default  rate than California\u2019s in fiscal years 1997 and 1998. However, by fiscal year  2001, its default rate was slightly lower than California\u2019s."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individuals named above, Jonathan H.
