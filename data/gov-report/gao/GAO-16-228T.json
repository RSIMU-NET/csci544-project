Accordingly, it is important for federal agencies such as Education to implement information security programs that can help protect systems and networks. GAO has identified federal information security as a government-wide high-risk area since 1997, and in February 2015 expanded this to include protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information.", "This statement provides information on cyber threats facing federal systems and information security weaknesses identified at federal agencies, including Education.

Since fiscal year 2006, the number of reported information security incidents affecting federal systems has steadily increased, rising from about 5,500 in fiscal year 2006 to almost 67,200 in fiscal year 2014. At the Department of Education, the number of incidents reported since 2009 has fluctuated, but generally increased.", "GAO reported in September 2015, that most of 24 major agencies (including Education) had weaknesses in at least three of five major categories of information security controls for fiscal year 2014. These are controls intended to (1) limit unauthorized access to agency systems and information; (2) ensure that software and hardware are authorized, updated, monitored, and securely configured; (3) appropriately divide duties so that no single person can control all aspects of a computer-related operation; (4) establish plans for continuing information system operations in the event of a disaster, and (5) provide a security management framework for understanding risks and ensuring that controls are selected, implemented, and operating as intended. The figure below shows the number of agencies with weaknesses in these control categories.", "In addition, 19 agencies\u2014including Education\u2014reported that information security control deficiencies were either a material weakness or a significant deficiency for fiscal year 2014. Further, inspectors general for 23 of 24 agencies, including Education, cited information security as a major management challenge. In prior reports, GAO and inspectors general have made thousands of recommendations to agencies to address deficiencies in their information security controls and weaknesses in their programs, but many of these recommendations remain open.

These laws include the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of  2014 (FISMA 2014), which, among other things, reiterated the 2002  FISMA requirement for the head of each agency to provide information  security protections commensurate with the risk and magnitude of the  harm resulting from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption,  modification, or destruction of the agency\u2019s information or information  systems. This includes protections for information collected or maintained  on behalf of the agency and information systems used or operated by a  contractor of an agency or other organization on behalf of an agency.", "In addition, the act continues the requirement for federal agencies to  develop, document, and implement an agency-wide information security  program. The program is to provide security for the information and  information systems that support the operations and assets of the  agency, including those provided or managed by another agency,  contractor, or other organization on behalf of an agency.", "The act also authorizes the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to  (1) assist the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) with overseeing  and monitoring agencies\u2019 implementation of security requirements; (2)  operate the federal information security incident center; and (3) provide  agencies with operational and technical assistance, such as that for  continuously diagnosing and mitigating cyber threats and vulnerabilities."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Department of Education Relies on Information Technology Systems Containing Sensitive Information", "paragraphs": ["The mission of the Department of Education is to serve America\u2019s  students and promote student achievement and preparation for global  competitiveness by fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal  access.

At Education, the number of  reported incidents has fluctuated during the period from fiscal year 2009  to fiscal year 2014, with the department reporting 308 incidents in fiscal  year 2014 after reaching a high of 467 in fiscal year 2013.", "Figure 2 shows the different types of incidents reported by Education in  fiscal year 2014.", "The types of incidents reported by Education are generally consistent with  those reported by the other 23 major federal agencies, with a few  exceptions. For example, at 26 percent, policy violations constituted the  highest percentage of incidents reported by Education for fiscal year  2014. Policy violations involve incidents of mishandling data in storage or  transit, such as digital PII records. In contrast, only 17 percent of incidents  reported by the 24 major federal agencies were policy violations. The  second highest percentage of incidents reported by Education was non- cyber incidents, at 25 percent, which was the same percentage reported  by federal agencies. Non-cyber incidents are those that include PII  spillages or possible mishandling of PII which involve hard copies or  printed material as opposed to digital records.", "Suspicious network activity, at 15 percent, and malicious code, at 13  percent, were the third and fourth highest percentages of incidents that  Education reported for fiscal year 2014. Suspicious network activity refers  to incidents identified through Einstein data analyzed by US-CERT, and  malicious code incidents are successful executions or installations of  malicious software which are not immediately quarantined and cleaned by  preventative measures such as antivirus tools. Suspicious network  activity made up 3 percent of the 24 major federal agencies\u2019 reported  incidents, and malicious code constituted 11 percent of the incidents  federal agencies reported for fiscal year 2014.", "Finally, only 4 percent of the incidents reported by Education were for  scans/probes/attempted access, which was the most widely reported type  of incident by federal agencies (excluding non-cyber incidents). This type  of incident can involve identifying a federal agency computer, open ports,  protocols, service, or any combination of these for later exploit.", "Furthermore, the number of reported security incidents involving PII at  federal agencies has more than doubled in recent years\u2014from 10,481  incidents in fiscal year 2009 to 27,624 incidents in fiscal year 2014.

These control categories are: (1) access  controls, which limit or detect access to computer resources (data,  programs, equipment, and facilities), thereby protecting them against  unauthorized modification, loss, and disclosure; (2) configuration  management controls, intended to prevent unauthorized changes to  information system resources (for example, software programs and  hardware configurations) and assure that software is current and known  vulnerabilities are patched; (3) segregation of duties, which prevents a  single individual from controlling all critical stages of a process by splitting  responsibilities between two or more organizational groups; (4)  contingency planning, which helps avoid significant disruptions in  computer-dependent operations; and (5) agency-wide security  management, which provides a framework for ensuring that risks are  understood and that effective controls are selected, implemented, and  operating as intended. (See fig. 4.)", "Access controls: For fiscal year 2014, Education and 21 other  agencies had weaknesses in electronic and physical controls to limit,  prevent, or detect inappropriate access to computer resources (data,  equipment, and facilities), thereby increasing their risk of unauthorized  use, modification, disclosure, and loss. Specifically, Education\u2019s  inspector general reported weaknesses in several key access control  elements, including protecting the boundaries of its information  systems and handling incidents. For example, the department did not  implement controls to verify the security of non-government furnished  equipment connecting to its network via virtual private client programs  prior to authentication.", "Configuration management: For fiscal year 2014, 22 agencies,  including Education, had weaknesses reported in controls that are  intended to ensure that only authorized and fully tested software is  placed in operation, software and hardware is updated, information  systems are monitored, patches are applied to these systems to  protect against known vulnerabilities, and emergency changes are  documented and approved. For example, the department\u2019s  configuration management guidance had not been updated since  2005 and its IT security baseline configuration guidance had not been  updated since 2009.", "Segregation of duties: Fifteen agencies had weaknesses reported in  controls for segregation of duties, although Education was not one of  them. These controls are the policies, procedures, and organizational  structure that help to ensure that one individual cannot independently  control all key aspects of a computer-related operation and thereby  take unauthorized actions or gain unauthorized access to assets or  records.", "Continuity of operations: Education and 17 other agencies had  weaknesses reported in controls for their continuity of operations  practices for fiscal year 2014. For example, Education did not  consistently document the IT recovery procedures for its systems in  accordance with National Institute of Standards and Technology  (NIST) guidelines and departmental policies. In addition, the  department did not consistently perform and document testing of  contingency plans for certain systems.", "Security management: For fiscal year 2014, 23 agencies, including  Education, had weaknesses reported in security management, which  is an underlying cause for information security control deficiencies  identified at federal agencies. An agency-wide security program, as  required by FISMA, provides a framework for assessing and  managing risk, including developing and implementing security  policies and procedures, conducting security awareness training,  monitoring the adequacy of the entity\u2019s computer-related controls  through security tests and evaluations, and implementing remedial  actions as appropriate. FISMA also requires agencies to develop and  document an inventory of major systems. Regarding Education, the  inspector general reported weaknesses in several key elements,  including developing, documenting, and updating an inventory of its  systems; periodically assessing risks to its systems; ensuring staff  receive security awareness training; and remediating information  security weaknesses. For example, the department did not implement  corrective actions in a timely manner including 15 corrective actions  that were completed late without a revised planned completion date.", "In addition, independent reviews at the 24 agencies continued to highlight  deficiencies in their implementation of information security policies and  procedures. Specifically, for fiscal year 2014, 19 agencies\u2014including  Education\u2014reported that information security control deficiencies were  either a material weakness or a significant deficiency in internal controls  over their financial reporting. Education was 1 of 12 agencies that  reported that such weaknesses constituted a significant deficiency\u2014 which is less severe than a material weakness but important enough to  merit attention by those charged with governance. Further, 23 of 24  inspectors general for the agencies, including Education, cited information  security as a \u201cmajor management challenge\u201d for their agency.", "In accordance with their responsibilities under FISMA, inspectors general  at the 24 agencies continued to report on their respective agencies\u2019 fiscal  year 2014 implementation of information security programs for these 11  program components:", "Risk management: Inspectors general reported that program  components for addressing risks at 17 agencies, including Education,  were established.

However, Education\u2019s inspector general also reported  exceptions with this component. For example, the department lacked  restrictions for virtual private network client programs on non- government-furnished equipment. In addition, it had not fully  implemented two-factor authentication, and improvements were  needed in the use of mobile devices when accessing the department\u2019s  network.", "Identity and access management: Education, along with 15 other  agencies, established program components for ensuring that users  were properly identified and authenticated when accessing agency  resources. However, Education\u2019s inspector general reported that the  department needed to improve its password authentication process  and had not fully implemented logical access controls.", "Continuous monitoring: Nineteen agencies, including Education,  had established program components for continuously monitoring the  effectiveness of security policies, procedures, and practices.", "Contingency planning: Education and 16 other agencies had  established program components for ensuring continuity of operations  for information systems in the event of a disaster or other unforeseen  disruptions.

As a result, responses from inspectors general may not always  be comparable or provide a clear government-wide picture of agencies\u2019  security implementation.", "Accordingly, we recommended that OMB, in consultation with DHS and  other stakeholders, enhance the reporting guidance so that ratings would  be consistent and comparable across agencies. OMB generally  concurred with our recommendation and stated that it would continue to  work with DHS and other stakeholders to refine the FISMA reporting  metrics and enhance reporting guidance.", "Over the last several years, we and agency inspectors general have  made thousands of recommendations to agencies aimed at improving  their implementation of information security controls. For example, we  have made about 2,000 recommendations over the last 6 years. Agency  inspectors general have also made a multitude of recommendations to  assist their agencies. Many agencies continue to have weaknesses in  implementing these controls in part because many of these  recommendations remain unimplemented. For example, agencies have  not yet implemented about 42 percent of the recommendations we have  made during the last 6 years.
