Concerns about rising rates of resistance to available treatment options prompted the federal government to create the 5-year National Action Plan in 2015. The plan called for federal agencies to strengthen surveillance, advance the development of diagnostic tests and new antibiotics, and slow the emergence of resistant bacteria, among other things.", "GAO was asked to review federal efforts to address antibiotic resistance. This report examines federal efforts and challenges related to (1) surveillance of antibiotic resistance, (2) the development and use of diagnostic testing to identify antibiotic resistance, (3) the development of treatments for resistant infections, and (4) appropriate antibiotic use. GAO reviewed literature and agency documents; interviewed agency officials and health care industry, drug industry, and other stakeholders; and held a meeting of international and U.S. experts to obtain their views."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The precise magnitude of the problem of antibiotic resistance is unknown. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has made progress in expanding surveillance of infections from certain antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the United States and abroad but faces several challenges.", "Note: This figure tracks a type of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), which, according to CDC, is a \u201cnightmare bacteria\u201d resistant to nearly all available antibiotics. Shading indicates CDC confirmed the presence of these bacteria within that state in that year or a previous one.", "CDC faces challenges in conducting surveillance for antibiotic resistance due to the limited data it is able to collect through various surveillance systems. For example, CDC's primary surveillance system for gonorrhea\u2014which CDC classified as an urgent antibiotic resistance threat affecting over half a million patients annually\u2014currently tracks only an estimated 1 to 2 percent of all U.S. cases and only in males. CDC has not fully evaluated the representativeness of the gonorrhea surveillance system's results. However, it could do so, for example, by comparing the trends in their limited sample population with trends it can establish in the overall U.S. population via additional studies. Such an evaluation could give CDC more confidence that the system's data accurately reflect national trends.", "Federal agencies have taken steps to advance the development and use of diagnostic tests to identify antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections, but these efforts have limitations. For example, agencies have conducted some studies to establish whether testing can lead to positive health care outcomes, such as reduced rates of antibiotic-resistant infections. However, more such studies are needed, according to experts and agency officials. Without information to guide test usage, clinicians may not be able to select appropriate treatments for their patients. One reason for the insufficient number of studies is that Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) agencies that are in a position to conduct or fund such studies\u2014such as CDC and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority\u2014disagree about what each agency should do. By clarifying roles and responsibilities, HHS agencies could more effectively address the need for more studies. The resulting studies could help demonstrate the value of diagnostic tests for antibiotic resistance, potentially increasing their use and improving patient care.", "Experts warn that the current pipeline of antibiotics in development is insufficient to meet the threat of resistance. Several challenges impede the development of new treatments for resistant infections, notably inadequate return on investment for drug companies largely due to low prices and a limited patient population for whom these treatments would be appropriate. While HHS and Department of Defense agencies have provided financial premarket incentives to support antibiotic research and development, experts, federal officials and antibiotic developers agree that more postmarket incentives are needed to overcome the economic challenges. Advisory groups, including a presidential advisory council, and others have called for new postmarket incentives and identified multiple options for their design, including market entry rewards and reimbursement reform (see figure). However, HHS has not developed a strategy to further incentivize development of new treatments for antibiotic-resistant infections, and it may need to request authority and appropriations to create and implement certain types of incentives. Until such incentives are developed, more drug companies may exit the antibiotic development sector, and the pipeline of new treatments may continue to decrease.", "Federal agencies have made several efforts to promote the appropriate use of antibiotics across health care settings through antibiotic stewardship\u2014giving patients the right antibiotic at the right time, in the right dose, and for the right duration. However, key challenges remain. For example, federal agencies require only certain types of health care facilities to implement stewardship programs. In addition, CDC is limited in its ability to monitor and improve appropriate antibiotic use, in part because providers are not generally required to report antibiotic use data to a centralized database. The 5-year National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria (National Action Plan) calls for strengthening antibiotic stewardship and for the timely reporting of antibiotic use data across health care settings. An executive order directs an interagency task force\u2014the Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria (CARB) Task Force, coordinated by HHS\u2014to provide annual updates to the President on, among other things, plans for addressing any barriers to full implementation of the National Action Plan. However, in its progress reports covering the first 4 years of the National Action Plan's implementation, the task force did not identify plans to address barriers to expanding antibiotic stewardship programs or the collection of antibiotic use data. Until it does so, the government will not have reasonable assurance that it is fully implementing the National Action Plan and addressing antibiotic resistance."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making eight recommendations to strengthen the federal response to combating antibiotic resistance.

However, some bacteria have developed ways to resist the effects of  antibiotics, for example, by preventing antibiotics from entering the cell or  pumping them out after the antibiotic enters. Bacteria that are able to  survive in the presence of antibiotics will multiply and pass on their new  genetic material that confers resistance to future generations of bacteria  and, in some cases, to other types of bacteria. Resistance can arise in  bacteria in humans, animals, and the environment, including in health  care settings, and can spread through contact with infected people or  animals, contact with contaminated water, soil or surfaces, or  consumption of contaminated food.", "The spread of antibiotic resistance threatens not only the ability to fight  bacterial infections but also threatens to reverse some significant medical  gains. For example, in addition to treating infections, antibiotics have  allowed for numerous medical procedures, such as joint replacements,  caesarian sections, organ transplants, chemotherapy, and dialysis\u2014all of  which would be significantly riskier without effective antibiotics. Antibiotic  resistance also poses a significant economic burden resulting from the  direct costs of treating those with resistant infections and the loss of  economic productivity from those who get sick or die.", "In the 2013 Threats Report, CDC identified 17 bacterial pathogens that  the agency considers to be \u201curgent,\u201d \u201cserious,\u201d or \u201cconcerning\u201d because  they have developed enough resistance to antibiotics to be considered a  threat to human health. (See fig. 1.) According to CDC, certain types of bacteria, called gram-negative bacteria, are particularly worrisome  because they are becoming resistant to nearly all drugs that would be  considered for treatment.", "The most serious gram-negative infections can be acquired in hospitals or  other health care settings and can cause pneumonia, bloodstream  infections, wound or surgical site infections, and meningitis. Nine of the  17 bacterial threats on CDC\u2019s threat list are gram-negative. One of the  bacteria CDC considers to be an urgent threat\u2014Clostridioides difficile (C.  difficile)\u2014is classified as a threat not because it is resistant to antibiotics,  but because it is caused by the same factors that drive antibiotic  resistance, such as antibiotic use. CDC estimates that C. difficile alone  accounted for 12,800 deaths in U.S. hospitals in 2017. CDC\u2019s 2013  Threats Report also identified one type of fungus\u2014Candida auris\u2014that it  considered to be a serious threat (see text box).", "Candida auris Is a Resistant Fungal Threat Candida auris (C. auris) is an emerging infectious fungus that, according to the Centers  for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), presents a global health threat in part  because it is highly resistant to anti-fungal drugs and is challenging to address. C. auris  was first identified in Japan in 2009. CDC reported 806 confirmed cases in the United  States, as of August 31, 2019. According to CDC, C. auris is highly transmissible and  some commonly used hospital surface disinfectants appear to be less effective against  C. auris. A CDC official told us C. auris is a good example of an emerging threat that  requires more research and associated efforts to properly address.", "Addressing C. auris is challenging for reasons including the rise of resistance and  limitations in diagnostic tests. According to CDC, there are three classes of antifungals  available to treat C. auris. However, CDC has identified strains that are resistant to all  three classes. A CDC official noted that getting new antifungals to market is challenging  because, among other things, the demand for antifungals, relative to antibiotics, is low.  Additionally, according to FDA, although reliable tests for identifying C. auris exist,  commonly used laboratory tests may misidentify this fungus, posing a barrier to correct  diagnosis. In 2018, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared a test based on  mass spectrometry to identify C. auris, but this test cannot characterize resistance. FDA  officials told us there are three FDA-cleared tests available for testing for other Candida  species\u2019 resistance to fluconazole. However, none of these tests can provide rapid  results, such as within an hour. Finally, interpretation of culture-based diagnostic tests,  which examine how well bacteria grow in the presence of an antibiotic, is challenging  due to the lack of established interpretive criteria for C. auris, by both the Clinical and  Laboratory Standards Institute, which promotes the development and use of voluntary  laboratory consensus standards and guidelines within the health care community, and  by FDA.", "U.S. spending on antibiotics in health care from 2010 through 2015 was  estimated in one study to be nearly $56 billion, ranging from $8.4 billion to  $10.6 billion annually. While CDC states that antibiotic prescribing  improved nationally with a 5 percent decrease from 2011 to 2016, the  agency estimated in 2017 that at least 30 percent of antibiotics used  across both outpatient and inpatient settings are still prescribed  unnecessarily or incorrectly and, therefore, are considered  inappropriate. According to CDC, approximately 85 to 95 percent of the nation\u2019s antibiotic use, by volume, occurred in outpatient settings from  2010 through 2015; and roughly 270 million antibiotic prescriptions\u2014 equivalent to 836 per 1,000 persons in the United States\u2014were written in  these settings in 2016. (For more information on antibiotic use in the  United States, see text box.)", "Antibiotic Use in the United States A 2017 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report estimates that about  30 percent of antibiotics used in U.S. hospitals are inappropriate (unnecessary or  prescribed incorrectly), and as much as 50 percent of antibiotics prescribed in  outpatient settings\u2014such as physicians\u2019 offices, emergency departments, urgent care  centers, and retail clinics\u2014may be inappropriate. For example, CDC reports that each  year, an estimated 47 million unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions are written in  physicians\u2019 offices and emergency departments. Most of these unnecessary  prescriptions are for respiratory conditions most commonly caused by viruses\u2014 including common colds, viral sore throats, and bronchitis\u2014that do not respond to  antibiotics, or for bacterial infections that do not always need antibiotics, like many  sinus and ear infections. Furthermore, CDC reports that even when antibiotics are  needed, prescribers often favor drugs that may be less effective and may carry more  risk over more targeted, \u201cfirst-line\u201d drugs recommended by nationally recognized  antibiotic prescribing guidelines. (First-line drugs are the drugs generally recommended  for initial treatment for a given diagnosis, often combining the best efficacy with the best  safety profile or the lowest cost.) According to CDC, antibiotics are among the most  frequently prescribed medications in nursing homes, with up to 70 percent of residents  receiving one or more courses of systemic (non-topical) antibiotics in a year; CDC also  cites studies showing that 40 to 75 percent of antibiotics prescribed in nursing homes  may be inappropriate. CDC further reports that harms from antibiotic overuse include  the risk of serious diarrheal infections from C. difficile, increased adverse drug events  and drug interactions, and increased risk of infection with antibiotic-resistant organisms.", "According to CDC officials, \u201cunnecessary\u201d antibiotic use means the antibiotic was  prescribed when no antibiotic was needed, based on clinical practice guidelines.  \u201cInappropriate\u201d antibiotic use includes both unnecessary antibiotic use, as well as  inappropriate antibiotic selection, dosing, or duration when antibiotics are indicated.

For example, the Executive Order directed  the creation of the National Action Plan, which the White House released  in 2015, to provide a roadmap for federal agencies to respond to the  threat of antibiotic resistance. The National Action Plan set five major  goals over 5 years related to (1) slowing the emergence of resistant  bacteria and preventing the spread of resistant infections; (2)  strengthening national One-Health surveillance efforts to combat  resistance; (3) advancing the development and use of rapid and  innovative diagnostic tests for the identification and characterization of  resistant bacteria; (4) accelerating basic and applied R&D for new  antibiotics, other therapeutics, and vaccines; and (5) improving  international collaboration and capacities related to the first four goals.  In addition, the National Action Plan discusses the importance of  preventing and controlling infections, such as through rapid detection, to  combat antibiotic resistance domestically and globally (see text box).  Within each of these five goals, the National Action Plan contains  numerous objectives, sub-objectives, agency-specific milestones, and  other performance targets called significant outcomes. For example, the  National Action Plan set a significant outcome of reducing inappropriate  antibiotic use by 50 percent in outpatient settings and by 20 percent in  inpatient settings by 2020.", "According to the World Health Organization (WHO), effective infection prevention and  control measures are a practical and scientific approach to reduce health care- associated infections in patients and health care workers, and help combat antibiotic  resistance. Infection prevention and control measures serve as the cornerstone of  actions needed to address epidemics, pandemics, and antibiotic resistance. Such  measures include implementing hand hygiene practices, providing vaccinations,  cleaning and disinfecting hospital rooms, isolating patients with infectious diseases,  decontaminating and sterilizing medical equipment, and tracking data about emerging  infectious diseases. WHO states that health care-associated infections are a global  challenge from which no country or health care facility is immune. The Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has taken actions to address and track health  care-associated infections, including antibiotic-resistant infections. For example, in  2009, CDC issued guidance for infection control targeting Enterobacteriaceae that may  be resistant to carbapenem, a class of antibiotics. In 2018, CDC published a study  suggesting that a tracked decline in the proportion of resistant bacteria, including  carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, observed in some health care settings,  could be attributable\u2014at least in part\u2014to actions such as those outlined in its 2009  guidance.

Finally, CDC faces challenges to detecting resistance threats abroad."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Challenges in Tracking Resistance", "paragraphs": ["The first challenge CDC faces in tracking trends in resistance is  addressing low hospital participation in a new option of CDC\u2019s National  Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) system intended to address some  limitations in NHSN. NHSN is, among other things, an online system for  tracking health care-associated infections. It provides facilities, states,  regions, and the nation with data needed to identify problem areas,  measure the progress of prevention efforts, and ultimately eliminate  health care-associated infections, according to CDC.", "Patients in settings such as hospitals and  long-term care facilities (e.g., nursing homes)  in many cases already have a weakened  immune system or an underlying illness,  making an antibiotic-resistant infection  especially dangerous, according to the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  (CDC). A high proportion of the morbidity and  mortality associated with antibiotic resistance  is seen in health care-associated infections.  Tracking resistance in health care settings is  therefore critical to national surveillance  efforts.", "CDC established three modules within NHSN that allow hospitals to  report select antibiotic-resistant infections, among other things, which  include reporting required by states or by CMS, according to agency  officials. Two modules track patients who have an infection associated  with a medical device or resulting from a surgical procedure. Hospitals  only report on resistance in these modules for specific combinations of  antibiotics and bacteria, such as carbapenem-resistant  Enterobacteriaceae. The third module tracks certain hospital patients who  test positive for certain multidrug-resistant infections, including methicillin- resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)\u2014a type of bacteria found on  people\u2019s skin that is usually harmless but can cause serious infections,  according to CDC. However, according to CDC, many antibiotic- resistant infections detected during hospital care do not fall into one of  these three modules and therefore would not be captured in NHSN,  limiting CDC\u2019s ability to identify important new resistances or trends.", "In 2014, to help address this limitation, CDC officials told us they  introduced a new option for hospitals to report data on antibiotic  resistance\u2014the Antimicrobial Resistance Option (AR Option). This option  allows for reporting of data on antibiotic resistance for certain bacteria,  regardless of whether the patient has a health care-associated  infection. In contrast to the other three modules, reporting to the AR  Option is voluntary.", "As a result, while about 86 percent of the 17,529 eligible U.S. health care  facilities participate in at least one of the older three antibiotic-resistance  reporting modules, only about 10 percent of the 6,836 eligible hospitals  participate in the newer, voluntary AR Option, according to our analysis of  NHSN hospital participation data as of January 2020. The hospital  participation rate among U.S. states and territories ranged from no  participation (in nine states and territories) to about 27 percent.  Representatives from a national association of state public health officials  we interviewed said that this low rate limits the value of the data, a view  that echoed the findings of a 2018 report by the Joint Public Health  Informatics Task Force.", "CDC officials acknowledged that participation in the AR Option is low and  cited reasons for this, including hospital resource limitations, and\u2014in  many cases because participation is voluntary\u2014because hospitals do not  prioritize submitting data to the AR Option. According to CDC officials, it  is particularly challenging for many smaller hospitals and Indian Health  Service facilities with resource constraints to participate, as it requires  significant information technology investment. The Joint Public Health  Informatics Task Force report noted two other common challenges: low  capacity for information technologies needed to support data submission  to the AR Option, and a lack of motivated leadership, such as a facility  \u201cchampion,\u201d to oversee the development and maintenance of needed  reporting infrastructure. For example, the maintenance of reporting  infrastructure could address changes to electronic medical records that  are not immediately compatible with the AR Option reporting format.", "CDC officials told us the agency is taking some steps to increase  participation in the AR Option. For example, it is encouraging the over  1,500 hospitals (as of December 31, 2019) that are participating in a  related reporting effort\u2014known as the Antimicrobial Use Option (AU  Option)\u2014but not in the AR Option to participate in both. In addition, the  agency is working with vendors of equipment and electronic health record  software to make it easier for hospitals to participate in the AR Option.", "One of CDC\u2019s goals for the AR Option is to use reported data to conduct  regional and national assessments of resistance. To help meet this goal,  officials said they would like participation by all eligible hospitals in the AR  Option, but they have not determined the needed participation rates or  appropriate distribution of participating hospitals. Our past work has  shown that leading practices for federal strategic planning include  articulating specific goals, establishing a method to assess progress  toward these goals, and aligning the plans and goals with the agency\u2019s  mission. By taking steps to determine the participation rates and  distribution of participation hospitals needed for CDC to meet its goal of  conducting regional and national assessments of antibiotic resistance of  public health importance, CDC would have more reasonable assurance  that it can achieve its goal.", "The second challenge CDC faces is ensuring representativeness of its  resistant gonorrhea surveillance system. CDC has classified resistant  gonorrhea as one of the most urgent antibiotic-resistance threats in the  nation, affecting over half a million patients annually. According to the  agency, resistant gonorrhea warrants this designation because of the  limited remaining treatment options, the high number of gonorrhea  infections, potential adverse outcomes (such as increased transmission of  HIV), and the prospect that gonorrhea may become incurable if new  resistance arises and spreads.", "The Urgent Threat of Resistant Gonorrhea According to the Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention (CDC), gonorrhea is the  second most commonly reported notifiable  disease in the United States, with over  500,000 infections reported in 2017. However,  CDC estimates that the true number could be  as many as 820,000 each year. In addition to  being a very common infection, gonorrhea is  developing resistance to treatment options. As  recently as 2006, CDC had five recommended  options, but it estimates that nearly half of  U.S. infections are now resistant to available  antibiotics, including combinations.  Consequently, it now recommends only one  regimen. In 2014, a case of dual-therapy  failure was reported in the United Kingdom,  and in February 2018, a similar case in the  United Kingdom was reported that also failed  to respond to the last-resort therapy,  spectinomycin, resulting in treatment failure.  As of June 2019, CDC reported that it had not  received any reports of verified clinical  treatment failures to any cephalosporin in the  United States.", "It is not clear, however, that GISP data are representative of the general  U.S. population because GISP draws on a limited sample of that  population. Specifically, GISP collects culture specimens\u2014-called  isolates\u2014and accompanying epidemiologic data from only the first 25  men with inflammation of the urethra consistent with gonorrhea visiting  each participating sexually transmitted disease clinic each month. It does  not collect culture specimens from women. In addition, the number of  participating clinics each year has varied from 21 to 30 (see fig. 2 for the  current sites). CDC estimates that the cases of gonorrhea identified  through GISP surveillance represent only about 1 to 2 percent of all  reported cases of gonorrhea in the United States each year. Further, the  GISP sample design also over-represents cases in the western United  States, where antibiotic-resistant gonorrhea has tended to initially  emerge, according to CDC. According to CDC, this design allows for  more rapid detection of emerging resistance by ensuring a sufficient  sample size from the western United States because resistance tends to  emerge from that area. CDC has two projects\u2014Strengthening the United  States Response to Resistant Gonorrhea (SURRG) and eGISP\u2014 intended to, among other things, enhance domestic gonorrhea  surveillance and learn more about the representativeness of GISP  through limited testing of women and of body sites other than urethras,  respectively.", "However, CDC\u2019s current methodology may limit its ability to establish a  representative trend. According to CDC officials, GISP could improve its  representativeness by adding clinics or covering more of the population at  its current sites. However, efforts to expand GISP would be difficult due to  limited local capacity (see text box).", "Barriers to Expanding the Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Program (GISP)", "GISP currently tracks a limited sample of the U.S. population. According to Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) officials, a more thorough expansion of GISP  would be more difficult because of limited local capacity to conduct culture-based  testing for resistance in gonorrhea. Specifically, laboratories increasingly use newer  gonorrhea testing technology that gives more rapid results but cannot currently be used  to test for resistance. This trend has contributed to the reduced capability of many  laboratories to perform the gonorrhea culture-based testing for antibiotic susceptibility  testing, to the point that many clinics cannot collect specimens for testing, according to  CDC officials. Furthermore, officials said that adding new clinics to GISP would require  financial and other resources for, among other things, establishing culture testing for  resistance and information technology needed to report data to the system.", "Most gonorrhea cases are diagnosed outside sexually transmitted disease clinics.  However, expanding GISP to non-sexually transmitted disease clinic sites could be  particularly costly and inefficient, officials said, because these sites tend to see many  fewer gonorrhea cases per year compared to sexually transmitted disease clinics;  therefore they may not be able to contribute significant data to GISP. Through the  Strengthening the United States Response to Resistant Gonorrhea (SURRG) project,  CDC is currently exploring options to work with states to enhance gonorrhea testing  capacity. This program was established in 2016 but has not received the funding  needed to expand capacity to the extent CDC had planned. In addition, physicians and  other providers have limited time to devote to data collection and reporting needed to  participate in GISP. CDC officials also told us the reimbursement rates for providers for  these services are inadequate.", "CDC has taken some steps to assess the representativeness of the  current GISP design, but it has not conducted a comprehensive study to  assess the representativeness of the trends identified in GISP. A 2015  CDC evaluation concluded that the representativeness of GISP was  \u201cgood\u201d on a scale of fair, good, or great. However, the evaluation  covered only part of fiscal year 2014 and consisted of a limited  comparison of selected demographic characteristics captured in  gonorrhea cases identified in GISP to those captured through the  National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System, according to CDC  officials, and which has its own limitations. Further, the results of this  evaluation have not resulted in any changes to the GISP design. CDC  officials told us they hope to learn more about the representativeness of  GISP urethral isolates from testing women, patients in non-sexually  transmitted disease clinic sites in the SURRG project and eGISP, and testing at other body sites, and then comparing some of these results to  those of GISP. However, these efforts overall were not specifically  designed to fully assess the representativeness of GISP and may not  provide a sufficient assessment for impacting changes to the GISP  design.", "CDC\u2019s guidelines of efficient and effective public health surveillance  systems state that, in order to be representative, the data from a public  health surveillance system should accurately reflect the characteristics of  the health-related outcome\u2014such as resistant gonorrhea\u2014under  surveillance. A more precise evaluation of the representativeness of the  surveillance system can be done via carefully designed studies to obtain  complete and accurate data for the health event in question\u2014namely, the  urgent threat of antibiotic-resistant gonorrhea. By evaluating the  surveillance system for resistant gonorrhea to ensure that it includes  measures of its representativeness, such as by comparing the trends in  the sample population with those in the overall U.S. population, using  specially designed studies if needed, CDC would have better assurance  that the trends detected in GISP accurately reflect the characteristics of  the health-related outcome the system is designed to monitor.", "In addition to the limited design of GISP, CDC faces the challenge of  competing priorities under reduced funding that precluded it from  completing its plans to expand the SURRG project. The SURRG  expansion was designed to address a National Action Plan goal of  controlling resistant gonorrhea, among other things, but also affects  surveillance, as CDC officials told us SURRG was established to address  some limitations in GISP surveillance. Specifically, one of the plan\u2019s  milestones assigned to CDC is to maintain advanced capacity for rapid  response to antibiotic-resistant gonorrhea for at least 20 state health  departments. Such capacity includes detection, diagnosis, and  investigation of suspected resistant cases within their state or region and  assistance for health care providers in appropriately treating infected  patients. CDC officials told us that because they received about half of  the appropriations they had requested, CDC had to make cuts in some of  their projects, and SURRG was one of those that CDC chose to reduce.  Eight SURRG sites, rather than the 20 recommended by the National  Action Plan, collect and analyze data. However, in its progress reports  covering the first 4 years of the National Action Plan\u2019s implementation, the  CARB Task Force did not identify plans to address barriers related to  expanding the SURRG project. The CARB Task Force coordinators told  us that the progress reports have not identified plans to address barriers  largely because the task force focused on reporting the agencies\u2019  accomplishments in implementing the National Action Plan. The  coordinators also said that, in response to our inquiries during this review,  the task force intends to identify agencies\u2019 plans for addressing barriers in  the progress report to be published in fall 2020.", "The Executive Order directs the CARB Task Force to provide annual  updates to the President on federal government actions to combat  antibiotic resistance, including progress made in implementing the  National Action Plan, plans for addressing any barriers preventing its full  implementation, and recommendations for any new or modified actions,  taking federal government resources into consideration. Without reporting  its plans to address such barriers, the CARB Task Force has not provided  all the information required by the Executive Order and has not fully  carried out its role to facilitate and monitor implementation of the National  Action Plan, which may reduce the effectiveness of federal efforts to  combat antibiotic resistance.", "The third challenge CDC faces tracking antibiotic resistance is addressing  limitations to the use of test results in surveillance in health care settings.  For example, some health care facilities are not using the most up-to-date  testing methods for determining whether the bacteria causing an infection  are resistant to certain antibiotics, according to CDC officials and a report  from the Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance Task Force. In addition,  laboratories may only report an interpretation of the test result to CDC  (e.g., whether the bacteria is resistant or susceptible to an antibiotic) and  not the quantitative results (e.g., measures of the growth of bacteria in the  presence of the antibiotic). This presents a challenge for comparing data  from different laboratories, since they may not be using consistent testing  thresholds for determining antibiotic resistance. Another limitation is that  some test equipment may be designed to give limited results for the  purposes of guiding treatment recommendations and stewardship efforts,  which may also limit the information available to CDC. For example, the  test may inform the user that the infection is susceptible to one antibiotic  but \u201csuppress\u201d information on susceptibility to other antibiotics, in order to  guide the user toward treatment with the preferred first-line treatment.  The Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance Task Force report noted that some  suppression is done by the testing equipment itself and some by software  systems that record, manage, and store data for clinical laboratories.  CDC officials told us they are working with some diagnostic test  manufacturers to explore these issues and develop solutions to address  them. The Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance Task Force is also working  to address the diagnostic test challenges related to antibiotic resistance  surveillance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Challenges in Reporting Complete and Timely Information on Magnitude and Trends", "paragraphs": ["CDC also faces challenges in reporting timely and complete information  on the magnitude of and trends in antibiotic resistance in the agency\u2019s  Threats Reports.

As a result of these challenges, among others,  the true magnitude of, and trends in, antibiotic resistance over time are  unknown, including trends in various places and among people with  various characteristics.", "Surveillance for antibiotic resistance is complex and costly, according to  experts at our meeting, CDC officials, and literature we reviewed. Experts  told us such surveillance encompasses diverse pathogens, diseases, and  health care settings and requires a variety of data sources and collection  efforts. Furthermore, experts from our meeting told us the fundamental  data required\u2014such as data on the number of illnesses and deaths  attributable to resistance and data on related health care costs\u2014are  currently insufficient. One expert added that there is a lack of real-time  monitoring data, such as data that are available within hours or days of  being generated. The data gaps are especially large for infections  acquired in the community, as opposed to in a health care setting,  because there is very limited tracking of such infections and whether they  are resistant. As a result, CDC officials said, it is challenging to provide  ranges of uncertainty, a critical component of any effort to measure and  report on magnitude and trends.", "Neither the 2013 Threats Report nor the 2019 Threats Report provided  quantitative measures of uncertainty, such as confidence intervals, for  CDC\u2019s estimates of morbidity and mortality resulting from antibiotic- resistant infections. For example, the report stated that there are at least  23,000 deaths a year as a direct result of antibiotic-resistant infections,  but it did not include an upper limit or a single point estimate for this  number. Similarly, the 2019 Threats Report stated that there are at least  35,900 deaths a year, without an upper limit or a single point estimate. A  recent re-estimate by a group of scientists has put the likely minimum  number of deaths annually in the United States at approximately 153,000,  or about four times the 2019 CDC minimum estimate.", "CDC officials told us that because of several limitations, its estimates  were the best that could be derived from the data available. For example,  for the 2013 Threats Report, CDC only had data from a national hospital  survey intended to produce estimates of all health care-associated  infections and indirect estimates of the proportion of infections that were  resistant. These data did allow CDC to calculate confidence intervals for  infections by specific pathogens, but this information was not disclosed in  the Threats Reports. Because the data sources were not intended for this  purpose, the 2013 intervals were wide, from approximately 26 percent to  380 percent of the point estimates for each pathogen. CDC officials told  us they elected not to include these ranges of uncertainties to avoid  confusion in the 2013 Threats Report, because the report was intended  for a variety of audiences, including the general public. Officials told us  they planned to provide confidence intervals in an appendix of the 2019  Threats Report, but they did not. CDC officials explained that they  elected not to include confidence intervals in the 2019 Threats Report  because several publications are pending that provide more granular data  for many of the estimates included in the report. It is thus unclear  whether CDC plans to include any measures of uncertainties in future  Threats Reports.", "Federal standards for agency dissemination of information it produces  stipulate that when information products are disseminated, error  estimates are calculated and disseminated to support assessment of the  appropriateness of the uses of the estimates or projections. Providing  measures of uncertainties in antibiotic resistance estimates, such as  standard errors or confidence intervals, as appropriate, in its Threats  Reports would help CDC and others compare information within and  across reporting efforts, without having to consult multiple documents  over time. CDC and others could use this information to draw appropriate  conclusions about the characteristics of antibiotic resistance in the United  States, including limitations associated with reported findings and  conclusions.", "Additionally, CDC does not have a plan for timely, regular issuance of  their Threats Reports. It took CDC over 6 years to update the 2013  Threats report. CDC officials told us this length of time between reports  was in part because, following issuance of the 2013 Threats Report, the  agency was focused on implementing priority actions to improve antibiotic  resistance surveillance data, including those efforts prescribed by the  National Action Plan. In some cases, implementing these actions involved  new data collection efforts that took time to establish, including that it can  take up to 2 years to get new surveillance variables cleared by the Office  of Management and Budget (OMB), CDC officials told us. In addition,  CDC officials said it is time consuming to coordinate across the  decentralized structure of antibiotic-resistance tracking at CDC to compile  a consolidated report.", "However, lack of timely, regular updates may affect the information  available to the public as well as policy-makers. For example, the 2013  Threats Report stated that there are at least 23,000 deaths a year as a  direct result of antibiotic-resistant infections. The 2019 report stated the  number of deaths each year to be at least 35,900 deaths a year. This  report also revised the 2013 estimate from 23,000 to 44,000 deaths a  year, suggesting a nearly two-fold revision to the initial 2013 estimate.", "CDC officials told us they would like to publish the report more frequently  than every 6 years, and that it is reasonable they would develop such a  plan for frequency of publication following the 2019 report. However, they  said the agency does not currently have a plan for how often it will  release future consolidated reports. CDC\u2019s attributes of efficient and  effective public health surveillance systems include timely data  dissemination for planning, implementing, and evaluating public health  policies and programs.

Also, a lack of a sampling strategy for the detection  of cases that are antibiotic-resistant may bias the representativeness  of the data and interpretation of results.

For example, FDA  established a Payor Communication Task Force, which helps facilitate  communication between test manufacturers and payors. Such  communication is important because payors decide whether tests will be  covered by insurance, among other things. According to an FDA web  page, by communicating with payors, test manufacturers could, for  example, learn what data payors need to approve a test for coverage and  then use this information to design clinical trials to provide that  information. This process could reduce the time between when a test is  cleared or approved by FDA and when it is covered.", "A similar step FDA and CMS took to advance the use of tests was to  extend the Parallel Review program indefinitely, a move they announced  in 2016. This program established a mechanism for FDA and CMS to  simultaneously review clinical data, with the aim of reducing the time  between FDA\u2019s approval and CMS\u2019s decision on whether to pay for the  test.", "Experts told us challenges remain with test payments that may result in  lower test use. For example, a PACCARB report states that \u201ccurrently,   for many diagnostic tests is not aligned with the value of the  test,\u201d and noted that supplementing payments for tests could drive test  development and use. BARDA officials also told us that a major factor  affecting adoption of new tests is the cost of the test relative to  reimbursement. Additionally, experts, including those at our meeting, told  us that test payments remain insufficient to encourage broad test use.  For example, two experts from our meeting said that there is not always a  clear link between the medical value of a test and the payment level for  that test.

For example, CMS officials told us the payments  for some tests are based on a weighted, median, private-payor rates  pursuant to the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, so CMS  cannot specify the methodology used to set those rates. Further, for  inpatient tests, Medicare pays hospitals a single, bundled payment per  patient stay, which is based on multiple factors, including the patient\u2019s  diagnosis and treatment strategy, rather than on a specific service.

The  delay stems in part from the need for a critical testing threshold known as  a breakpoint\u2014the threshold that is used to help a clinician decide whether  or not a pathogen is resistant to the antibiotic (see text box). The  breakpoint of a new antibiotic is generally finalized only when FDA has  approved the antibiotic. This means that breakpoints may often not be  available for test manufacturers until after a new antibiotic is FDA- approved. As a result, test manufacturers generally may not be able to  complete developing FDA-authorized culture-based tests for resistance to  a specific antibiotic until after the antibiotic is commercially available. The  result is that the development of such culture-based tests may be  generally delayed even after the new antibiotic is approved by FDA. This  delay could affect the ability of clinicians to treat patients. For example,  according to an expert, such a delay could lead to underuse of a newly  available antibiotic, among other things, because a clinician may not be  willing to prescribe the antibiotic without test results to guide treatment.", "How Breakpoints Are Used to Interpret Tests According to officials from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), breakpoints, also  referred to as \u201csusceptibility test interpretive criteria,\u201d are used to define susceptibility  and resistance to antibiotics to help guide patient care. Culture-based tests rely on  breakpoints to provide a determination of resistance to clinicians. In the United States,  breakpoints (based on clinical or microbiological data) are established by standards- development organizations such as the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute  (CLSI) and FDA.  One example of how breakpoints are used involves the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion test.  This test is conducted by spreading bacteria on a laboratory agar plate containing  bacterial nutrients, and then placing paper disks containing a known amount of  antibiotics on the \u201clawn\u201d of bacteria. Plates are observed after overnight incubation to  determine the extent of bacterial growth. Closer to the disk, there is a higher  concentration of antibiotic, and the concentration declines with distance. Around most  disks, there is a \u201czone of inhibition,\u201d where the concentration of antibiotic is too high for  bacteria to grow. After allowing the bacteria to grow for a defined period of time, the  diameter of the zone of inhibition is measured in millimeters.  Procedure for Assessing Antibiotic Resistance Using Breakpoints  If the diameter is larger than or equal to the breakpoint, then the strain of bacteria is  considered susceptible to the antibiotic, suggesting that the antibiotic can be used to  treat infections caused by that strain. If the diameter is smaller than the breakpoint,  then the strain is considered resistant, suggesting that the antibiotic should not be  used. According to FDA, in most cases, there is a range of \u201cintermediate\u201d or  \u201csusceptible dose-dependent\u201d diameters for which treatment might be effective.  Other types of culture-based diagnostic tests for resistance have analogous  breakpoints for interpreting the test. For example, the minimum inhibitory  concentration\u2014the lowest concentration of an antibiotic that prevents growth of  bacteria\u2014can be compared to a breakpoint to establish whether the bacteria are  considered resistant.", "In addition to antibiotic developers waiting until FDA approves an  antibiotic before a breakpoint is finalized, there are technical hurdles in  developing a test for some new antibiotics, according to FDA officials. For  example, it may be challenging for certain automated test manufacturers  to address unique growth properties of certain bacteria in the presence of  specific antibiotics or combinations of antibiotics. According to a test  manufacturer, these hurdles include the need for additional studies, and  such studies may not be straightforward because of the need to  determine what clinical data FDA requires. In addition, in the case of  automated tests, a representative from a test manufacturer association  told us the software used to run and interpret a new test needs to be  revised, which can be time consuming.", "The delay between approval of an antibiotic and the availability of a test  for resistance could result in suboptimal treatment and increase burdens  on the health care system. For example, one expert stated that during this  delay, laboratories need to create or modify tests and then validate those  tests instead of using a FDA-authorized test, which increases the time  required and places demands on facility personnel and budgets. This  expert added that to conduct validation studies, the laboratories need a  variety of samples for testing, called \u201cisolates,\u201d which may not be  available. A second expert said that the delay leads to both overuse and  underuse of the new antibiotic: in the absence of a test, some clinicians  will prescribe the antibiotic when it may be inappropriate, leading to  overuse; some other clinicians refrain from prescribing the antibiotic, even  if appropriate, leading to underuse.", "To help address this delay, FDA has created a process known as  coordinated development, whereby test manufacturers can submit a  coordinated development plan to FDA describing the test manufacturer\u2019s  intent to coordinate with the antibiotic manufacturer. The plan is submitted  prior to, or shortly after, submission of an application to market a new  drug.", "Under the coordinated development program, FDA shares breakpoint  information from the antibiotic manufacturer with a prospective test  manufacturer. It then reviews the test application at the same time as  the antibiotic application and takes other steps to facilitate more timely  clearance of the test. FDA officials told us this process has significantly  reduced the delay between approval of the antibiotic and clearance of the  test.", "Another FDA step to help test manufacturers speed development of tests  is the establishment, in collaboration with CDC, of a centralized repository  of bacterial strains with well-characterized antibiotic resistance profiles.  These strains are available to test manufacturers and others to help them  design, validate, and evaluate tests by checking that they give the correct  results for bacteria whose profile of antibiotic resistance is known.

In particular,  experts and federal officials have noted that it is challenging to develop  antibiotics that can kill certain types of bacteria, called gram-negative  bacteria, largely due to their double membrane that makes it difficult for  antibiotics to enter the bacterial cell, and to pumps that can remove the  drug once it enters. Three antibiotic developers we spoke to explained  that as bacteria continue to evolve new ways to resist antibiotics, it is  difficult for scientists to keep pace by developing new treatments that can  overcome those mechanisms. In addition, experts noted that scientists  have already discovered most of the antibiotics from known sources, such  as soil.

Under LPAD, eligible products\u2014which are drugs and biologics intended  to treat a serious or life-threatening infection in a limited population of  patients with unmet needs\u2014may follow a streamlined development  program, similar to the approaches described in its earlier unmet medical  need guidance. A biotechnology association noted in its public  comments to the draft LPAD guidance the need for FDA to issue  additional guidance to clarify its expectations for acceptable types of  efficacy data when clinical trials are small and to clarify its interpretation  of a \u201climited population of patients\u201d for the purpose of the LPAD  pathway. An expert who attended our meeting later told us there is a  great need to address how to develop narrow-spectrum antibiotics\u2014those  designed to treat a single or small number of bacterial pathogens\u2014using  LPAD. FDA held a public meeting in July 2019 to solicit stakeholder  comments on the draft LPAD pathway guidance, and FDA officials told us  they expect to finalize the guidance by February 2020. However, as of  March 17, 2020, FDA had not yet issued final guidance.", "In addition to issuing guidance, and to help inform future guidance, FDA  engages with industry stakeholders to discuss and identify possible  solutions to challenges related to the clinical development of antibiotics  and nontraditional products. For example, FDA has held multiple public  workshops, including one in November 2019 with experts from NIH\u2019s  National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the Infectious  Disease Society of America, and The Pew Charitable Trusts to better  understand the current state of antibiotic clinical trials in the United  States, and how to enhance enrollment and research in these trials.", "FDA officials told us they believe it is too early to issue guidance that  would be broadly applicable and useful to nontraditional product  developers. They explained that for certain types of nontraditional  products, the approaches and specifics of product development are  varied and evolving quickly. Instead, FDA\u2019s Center for Biologics  Evaluation and Research has a program in place that allows developers  to meet with FDA prior to beginning clinical trials to obtain advice on a  wide range of development-related topics.", "Implemented Medicare payment mechanisms. CMS uses Medicare  payment mechanisms to help increase reimbursement to hospitals for  certain antibiotics. For qualifying antibiotics, these payments are a form of  indirect pull incentive because they have the potential to increase the  demand for the new antibiotics after they reach the market, which could in  turn improve their financial performance. Beginning in fiscal year 2020,  CMS updated how it will pay hospitals for treating Medicare patients who  have an antibiotic-resistant infection. Specifically, CMS changed the  eligibility criteria and payment amount for antibiotics that qualify for \u201cnew  technology add-on payments\u201d and how it pays hospitals for treating  Medicare patients with antibiotic-resistant infections. These payment  changes are:", "Revised eligibility criteria for and amount of add-on payments.  New technology add-on payments provide hospitals with additional  compensation for a period of 2 or 3 years when they use qualifying  new technologies or drugs that offer substantially improved clinical  treatment, and when regular Medicare payments for the hospital stay  are inadequate to cover the cost of the new technology or drug.  Generally, medical services and technologies must be new and must  demonstrate a substantial clinical improvement over existing services  or technologies to receive the additional payment. However, CMS  has acknowledged the difficulty antibiotic developers face in  demonstrating such substantial clinical improvement due to  manufacturers seeking FDA approval for most antibiotics on the basis  of noninferiority clinical trials, as described above. To make it easier  for antibiotics to qualify for the additional payments, under the  revisions to the CMS payment policy beginning in fiscal year 2021,  CMS will consider all antibiotics with a QIDP designation from FDA to  be \u201cnew\u201d for purposes of the add-on payment, and these antibiotics  will not have to meet the substantial clinical improvement criteria.", "In addition, CMS has increased the amount of the temporary add-on  payment for qualifying antibiotics. Prior to this change, the add-on  payments for qualifying antibiotics were limited to 50 percent of the  cost of the drug. Under the new policy, the payment percentage  increased to a maximum of 75 percent of the cost of the drug. CMS  has specified that two antibiotics are eligible for new technology add- on payments in fiscal year 2020.", "Increased payment for hospital stays. CMS changed the severity  level designation for certain antibiotic resistance-related diagnosis  codes, in recognition of the added clinical complexity and cost of  treating patients with antibiotic resistance. This change in severity  level can result in higher payments to hospitals when treating patients  diagnosed with antibiotic resistance, which, according to the  Administrator of CMS in an August 2019 blog post, will create  \u201cfinancial flexibility for physicians to prescribe the appropriate new  antibiotics.\u201d The Administrator also noted that CMS made this  policy change because it recognized that new technology add-on  payments are temporary and \u201cfurther action was needed to realign  financial incentives for antibiotics for the long-term.\u201d", "See appendix III for additional examples of efforts to support antibiotic  R&D by these and other federal agencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Efforts Have Not Fully Incentivized Antibiotic Development, and HHS Lacks a Strategy to Develop New Incentives", "paragraphs": ["Experts and antibiotic developers told us that the economic challenges  have remained despite the available federal push and pull incentives for  antibiotic R&D. Currently available premarket push incentives include  grants and awards from NIH and BARDA that fund antibiotic R&D;  currently available postmarket pull incentives include the additional  market exclusivity available through QIDP designation and Medicare add- on payments for antibiotics. (See fig. 3.) Both of the antibiotic companies  that declared bankruptcy in 2019 had received push incentives from  BARDA and pull incentives through Medicare New Technology Add-on  Payments and the QIDP 5-year extension of market exclusivity.", "While experts at our meeting and antibiotic developers told us that push  incentives have been helpful, they also said push incentives alone are not  sufficient to sustain antibiotic development. For example, two antibiotic  developers we spoke with explained that push incentives have provided  needed funding for conducting R&D, but said that push incentives will not  help cover the costs they will incur after their drug reaches the market\u2014 for example, to manufacture and market their product.", "Experts and antibiotic developers have indicated that the effects of the  existing pull incentives, QIDP market exclusivity, and Medicare add-on  payments on stimulating development of new antibiotics have been  limited for the following reasons:", "QIDP and market exclusivity. As we previously reported, several  pharmaceutical companies told us that the market exclusivity  incentive may not stimulate the development of new antibiotics,  because the extension is unlikely to extend past the typical patent life  of a new drug. In addition, a representative from The Pew  Charitable Trusts said that, while the passage of the Generating  Antibiotic Incentives Now Act initially bolstered private investments in  antibiotics, it did not ultimately stabilize the pipeline of antibiotics in  development, noting that since then, several large pharmaceutical  companies have discontinued their antibiotics R&D programs.", "Medicare updates to hospital payments. While CMS recently  increased new technology add-on payments for certain antibiotics  beginning in fiscal year 2020 to help improve access to antibiotics,  these payments are limited to antibiotics used to treat Medicare  patients. In addition, although Medicare increased the add-on  payment amount to up to 75 percent of the estimated costs of  qualifying antibiotics in excess of the regular Medicare payment,  hospitals could still face costs for providing these drugs that are not  covered by the Medicare payment. Furthermore, representatives from  an antibiotic company and a biotechnology trade association told us  the add-on payments do not directly incentivize hospital pharmacies  to purchase the drug, because the add-on payment may not flow back  to the pharmacy department\u2019s budget. For these reasons, it remains  to be seen whether the Medicare new technology add-on payments to  hospitals for inpatient antibiotics will help improve the return on  investment for antibiotic developers and further stimulate the antibiotic  development pipeline. Similarly, it remains to be seen how CMS\u2019s  policy change that provides increased payments for hospital stays  when Medicare patients have been diagnosed with certain types of  antibiotic-resistant infections will affect hospitals\u2019 use of new  antibiotics.", "In light of the limitation of existing incentives for antibiotic development,  experts, federal officials, and antibiotics developers have called for  additional postmarket pull incentives to reinvigorate the pipeline of  antibiotics under development. For example, PACCARB issued  recommendations to the Secretary of HHS in September 2017 and July  2019 for the adoption of pull incentives, calling for the development of  market entry rewards and options for plausible business models. In  addition TATFAR\u2014of which officials from BARDA, CDC, FDA, and NIH  are members\u2014reported that it is critical to develop a pull incentive  strategy now to ensure that enough antibiotics are available in the  future. Former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb also stated in  2018 that he was \u201cdeeply concerned that without stronger pull incentives  that encourage more R&D, we\u2019ll see a far less robust pipeline of products  than we need to address antimicrobial resistance.\u201d Eight of the  antibiotic developers we interviewed told us they think additional financial  incentives are needed. For example, one developer said that sales  revenues from antibiotics will never be sufficient to justify R&D  investments, and another noted that financial incentives are needed  during the first few years after a new antibiotic reaches the market to  cover not only these costs, but also to conduct additional clinical trials to  help expand the drug\u2019s possible market. Finally, several experts at our  expert meeting noted that, without pull incentives, most of the small  companies currently developing antibiotics are unlikely to survive, and  large pharmaceutical companies will likely continue to exit the antibiotic  market.", "Advisory groups and others have identified multiple options for how  postmarket pull incentives could be designed, including market entry  rewards\u2014either in the form of lump sum payments or transferable  vouchers that could be sold to confer additional market exclusivity to  other pharmaceutical drugs\u2014or reimbursement reform, such as licensing  arrangements or add-on payments for hospital-administered antibiotics.  (See fig. 4.) The four advisory groups whose papers we reviewed each  recommended market entry rewards as effective pull incentive options.  While Commissioner of the FDA, Dr. Scott Gottlieb proposed an  antibiotics licensing arrangement, which he called a subscription model,  in a 2018 speech.", "Views on the utility of reimbursement reform as a pull incentive strategy  are mixed. For example, representatives from The Pew Charitable Trusts  stated their view that, while CMS\u2019s recent changes to Medicare payment  for antibiotics will likely be helpful to some degree, no reimbursement  policy on its own would be able to increase antibiotic sales revenues  sufficiently to transform the business model for antibiotics. An antibiotic  developer we spoke to also told us that reimbursement policies would not  be sufficient to support their business model because of low sales  volumes for new antibiotics. The developer explained that it can take 2 or  3 years of antibiotic sales to recoup their R&D costs and finance their  ongoing business operations, and that while larger pharmaceutical  companies can rely on other profitable drugs to offset those costs, they  could not because they did not have other drugs on the market. However,  a representative from a biotechnology trade association told us that  increasing reimbursement could help alleviate some of the economic  challenges faced by developers of antibiotics that are already on or about  to reach the market while policy makers explore longer-term pull incentive  strategies. TATFAR cautioned that simply increasing reimbursement for  antibiotics could potentially limit patient access, particularly for patients  without health insurance\u2014including those in low-and middle-income  countries\u2014and it could incentivize only antibiotics for common types of  infections with a large market potential, rather than for rare, yet  dangerous, types of pathogens.", "Advisory groups and others have evaluated potential market entry reward  models, taking into consideration factors such as format, value, funding  sources, and eligibility criteria. Some have proposed that receipt of a  market entry reward should be delinked, fully or partially, from sales  revenues\u2014that is, the developer would have to forgo some or all sales  revenue as a condition of receiving the reward. Proponents of delinkage  believe that separating revenues from antibiotics sales volumes would  discourage aggressive sales that could lead to overuse. An expert who  attended our meeting later told us that policies to incentivize use of new  antibiotics must be balanced with policies to monitor prescribing of new  drugs to prevent inappropriate use. Generally, advisory groups stipulate  that to maximize the public health benefit, only antibiotics that treat what  are deemed to be high priority bacteria should be eligible for a reward.  Specific recommendations and conclusions included the following:", "TATFAR concluded in 2017 that a partially delinked market entry  reward of approximately $500 million would be the least disruptive  option but noted that additional assessment would be necessary to  select the most appropriate model and determine governance and  other design elements.", "PACCARB expressed support for a delinked model, in which a  company accepting a market entry reward would be required to forgo  marketing activities and profits based on sales volume. In addition,  they suggested the establishment of an antibiotic incentive fund  supported by an antibiotic usage fee or the sale or auction of  transferable exclusivity vouchers as plausible options for financing pull  incentives.", "The Duke University Margolis Center for Health Policy recommended  in 2017 a delinked, public-private market entry reward model. This  model was comprised of publicly funded market entry rewards for  qualifying antibiotics for the first 5 or 6 years, followed by privately  funded \u201cvalue-based\u201d contracts between antibiotic developers and  health care payors, in which the payor could agree, for example, to  pay a predetermined amount for full access to the antibiotics for a  given population. The Duke-Margolis Center proposal did not  specify a funding source, but it noted multiple options for  consideration, including general government funds, antibiotic use  taxes, or the sale of transferable exclusivity vouchers.", "The European DRIVE-AB project recommended in 2018 an  internationally funded, partially delinked market entry reward valued at  approximately $1 billion per antibiotic, paid over the course of 5 or  more years. Recipients of a market entry reward would be allowed  to sell their drug on the private market, but they would agree to certain  marketing restrictions to discourage inappropriate use.", "HHS may need to request authority and appropriations to create and  implement certain types of market entry rewards. For example, HHS does  not currently have authority to offer transferable exclusivity vouchers to  antibiotic developers, since that would require a change in statute.  Advisory groups also noted that the various pull incentive approaches  would require additional public or private expenditures and offered  possible sources of funding. For example, in addition to general fund  revenues, PACCARB suggested that pull incentives could be funded  through antibiotic usage fees, the auctioning of transferable exclusivity  vouchers, or by allowing developers of new antibiotics to earn a  transferable exclusivity voucher. The Duke-Margolis Center suggestions  included funding market entry rewards through a yearly per-member fee  for all health insurance plans. Transferable exclusivity vouchers may not  require an independent funding source, because the value of the reward  is based on the sale of the voucher to another drug developer. However,  vouchers would still increase public and private health care expenditures,  because expenditures would likely increase for drugs for which the extra  period of exclusivity was purchased due to the delayed entry of lower- priced generics. Finally, reimbursement reform could increase health care  expenditures for health care payors, including Medicare and private  health insurance carriers.", "Although PACCARB, TATFAR, and other experts have called for  additional postmarket pull incentives to increase the antibiotic pipeline, as  of January 2020 HHS has not developed a strategy for creating these  incentives. HHS officials told us that the department created an  interagency workgroup within HHS in spring 2019 to identify possible pull  incentive options, among other things. The recently convened HHS  interagency workgroup is a step in the right direction toward exploring  options for new antibiotic development incentives. Through this  workgroup, HHS has an opportunity to determine which types of  postmarket incentives it believes would most effectively incentivize the  development of new treatments for antibiotic-resistant infections.  However, it is unclear whether the HHS interagency workgroup\u2019s efforts  will include consideration of such incentives because, according to HHS  officials in January 2020, the interagency workgroup was still considering  possible recommendations for HHS leadership and had not produced any  specific documents to share with us.", "The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) and the  GPRA Modernization Act of 2010, which significantly enhanced agencies\u2019  responsibilities under GPRA, include principles for federal agencies to  consider related to developing strategies for achieving results, among  other principles. We have previously reported that these principles can  serve as leading practices for planning at lower levels within agencies,  such as individual programs or initiatives. Our past work has shown  that strategic frameworks can serve as a basis for guiding policy makers,  including congressional decision makers and agency officials, when  making decisions about resources, programs and activities, particularly in  relation to issues that are national in scope, such as antibiotic  development. Developing a strategic framework that outlines new  postmarket pull incentives and their key design elements\u2014such as  monetary value, eligibility criteria, and guidelines to prevent overuse\u2014 would be a first step toward identifying potential authorities and resources  that may be needed to create the incentives, and toward determining  agency roles for implementation and oversight of the incentives. Until  such incentives are developed, more drug companies may exit the  antibiotic development sector, and the pipeline of new treatments for  antibiotic-resistant infections may continue to decrease. Furthermore, the  current significant federal investment in push incentives to support  antibiotic R&D will remain a high-risk enterprise, if companies receiving  large R&D grants are unable to sustain their business once their  treatment reaches the market."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Federal Agencies Have Undertaken Several Efforts to Promote the Appropriate Use of Antibiotics, but Key Challenges Remain", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies have undertaken several efforts to promote the  appropriate use of antibiotics through stewardship programs and  activities.

The MIPS  program\u2019s effect on incentivizing appropriate use of antibiotics is  limited, in part, because the incentives are available only to clinicians  who meet MIPS eligibility criteria and because eligible clinicians can  choose not to report data to CMS. In addition, participating clinicians  have a wide range and number of quality measures and improvement  activities, beyond those related to antibiotics, from which the clinicians  can choose to report data to CMS to meet program requirements;  thus, the likelihood that clinicians will choose to report on antibiotics- related measures or activities may remain low.

Specifically, this activity referred  to implementation of an antibiotic stewardship program that measured  the appropriate use of antibiotics for several different conditions  (upper respiratory infections in children, pharyngitis, and bronchitis in  adults), according to clinical guidelines for diagnostics and  therapeutics."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CDC Faces Challenges in Collecting Complete Antibiotic Use Data, Limiting the Agency\u2019s Ability to Monitor and Improve Appropriate Use", "paragraphs": ["CDC\u2019s ability to monitor and improve appropriate antibiotic use is limited  by challenges it faces in collecting complete antibiotic use data across  health care settings. According to CDC, experts we interviewed, and  documents we reviewed, more data are needed to identify the extent of  antibiotic use, including inappropriate use. In turn, CDC and experts say  that more antibiotic use data would enable health care providers, federal  agencies, and others to identify and target areas for improvement, track  results over time, and adjust antibiotic stewardship activities as  needed. We have also previously reported that monitoring antibiotic  use over time in both inpatient and outpatient settings is important for  understanding patterns in antibiotic resistance and for targeting  stewardship activities. In addition, WHO notes that data on global  antibiotic use is essential for obtaining a comprehensive picture of  antibiotic resistance and for identifying areas where actions are  needed.", "Despite progress in collecting antibiotic use data (as previously  discussed), CDC faces several challenges in its efforts to collect complete  antibiotic use data. For example, health care providers across various  inpatient and outpatient settings do not record such data in one  centralized, electronic database. In addition, CDC officials told us that  there are no uniform requirements at the federal level (with the exception  of DOD and VA hospitals) for providers to report their antibiotic use data  to a centralized database such as the NHSN AU Option, and, according  to CDC officials and experts we interviewed, data collection can be costly  for CDC and health care providers. Because of these and other  challenges, CDC relies on data voluntarily reported by hospitals through  the AU Option, and the agency collects its own data or purchases  proprietary pharmacy data to estimate antibiotic use\u2014and, to some  degree, to assess appropriateness of use\u2014across health care settings.  However, these data are incomplete owing to several limitations, as  described by type of setting below.", "Hospitals. Our analysis of CDC data shows that although the number  of hospitals participating in the AU Option has gradually risen since its  launch in 2011, participation remains limited, with 1,561, or 23  percent, of the 6,849 eligible hospitals reporting at least one month of  antibiotic use data as of January 1, 2020. (See fig. 5 for a map  showing the percentage of U.S. hospitals reporting antibiotic use data  to the AU Option, by state, plus the District of Columbia and Puerto  Rico, as of August 2019.) While CDC officials told us they considered  this level of participation to be an accomplishment given that  participation is voluntary, the National Action Plan set 95 percent  participation in the AU Option by 2020 as a significant outcome to  support the plan\u2019s goal to strengthen national surveillance efforts to  combat resistance.", "Experts, including those at our meeting, cite multiple challenges that CDC  faces in collecting hospitals\u2019 antibiotic use data through the AU Option.  For example, The Pew Charitable Trusts has stated that current,  voluntary data are limited and that mandatory reporting would provide the  data needed to establish a more accurate baseline of antibiotic use,  identify stewardship interventions that would be most effective, and  measure progress toward reducing inappropriate prescribing. An expert who attended our meeting later suggested that CMS could implement a  pay-for-reporting program to incentivize hospitals to report data to the AU  Option, and that the program could transition to a pay-for-performance  program over time. In addition, experts we interviewed told us that a  participating hospital must be willing to spend as much as tens of  thousands of dollars for a vendor to customize software for their  electronic health record systems to use the AU Option, in addition to  investing time training staff on how to use it. CDC officials also told us  that the agency lacks the authority to require hospitals to report their  antibiotic use data, and that there is currently no federal funding available  to assist hospitals with the investment needed to participate in the AU  Option. Furthermore, hospitals\u2019 voluntary participation in the AU Option  may remain limited until CDC\u2019s benchmark measures are adequately risk- adjusted for different locations and patient populations. For example,  one expert we interviewed said that because the AU Option currently  aggregates data on the volume of antibiotics used without adequate risk  adjustment, a hospital with a patient population that might warrant higher  use of antibiotics may be reluctant to report its antibiotic use data to avoid  looking like an unnecessarily high prescriber. Regarding another data  source for antibiotic use in hospitals, CDC\u2019s EIP provides more granular  data at the patient level that allows CDC to assess the appropriateness of  antibiotic use. However, CDC officials told us that the agency has been  unable to repeat its hospital prevalence survey since 2015 due to  insufficient resources (the next survey is expected in 2020) and that the  survey encompasses a limited number of hospitals, patients, and states.", "Nursing homes. According to CDC, nursing homes may be the most  challenging health care setting from which the agency collects  antibiotic use data; CDC officials stated that this is because electronic  health record systems, from which data could be easily accessed, are  less common in nursing homes. In addition, CDC officials stated  that the agency\u2019s collection of antibiotic use data through the EIP  nursing homes prevalence survey has been limited in scope and  frequency due to insufficient resources.", "Outpatient settings. Collecting data for outpatient settings, such as  retail pharmacies, is also challenging. For example, CDC officials  stated that one proprietary source from which CDC purchases data  reflects the volume of pharmacy antibiotic prescriptions, but the data  do not contain diagnostic information, preventing the agency from  evaluating the appropriateness of those prescriptions. Other CDC or  proprietary data sources from which the agency collects or purchases  antibiotic use data are limited by the frequency with which those  sources release such data, the age range of patients included in the  data (i.e., whether they are over or under 65 years), or other  characteristics. As previously noted, approximately 85 to 95 percent of  the nation\u2019s antibiotic use, by volume, occurred in outpatient settings  from 2010 through 2015."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The CARB Task Force Has Not Identified Plans to Address Challenges Related to Expanding Stewardship Programs and Antibiotic Use Data Collection", "paragraphs": ["The National Action Plan calls for strengthening antibiotic stewardship  and for the timely reporting of antibiotic use data across health care  settings.

These annual updates  are to include specific goals, milestones, and metrics for proposed actions  and recommendations, taking into consideration federal resources.  However, in its progress reports covering the first four years of the  National Action Plan\u2019s implementation\u2014which were provided to the  President and the public\u2014the CARB Task Force has not identified plans  to address barriers that agencies face in expanding antibiotic stewardship  programs across health care settings. For example, the task force did  not include in the progress reports CMS\u2019s plans to address barriers to  expanding its requirements for antibiotic stewardship programs in  hospitals, which were delayed, or in certain other types of health care  facilities.", "In addition, in its progress reports to date, the CARB Task Force has not  identified plans to address the barriers to expanding the collection of antibiotic use data across health care settings. For example, the task  force did not include in the progress reports CDC\u2019s plans to address  barriers to achieving the significant outcome of 95 percent of eligible  hospitals participating in the AU Option by 2020, although participation  was only 23 percent as of January 1, 2020. The CARB Task Force  coordinators said, in response to our inquiries during this review, that the  task force intends to identify agencies\u2019 plans for addressing barriers in the  Year 5 progress report to be published in fall 2020. However, the  coordinators also stated that the progress reports to date have not  identified plans to address barriers largely because the task force focused  on reporting the agencies\u2019 accomplishments in implementing the National  Action Plan. Until the CARB Task Force identifies and reports on  agencies\u2019 plans to address barriers related to the expansion of antibiotic  stewardship programs and the collection of antibiotic use data across  health care settings to the extent feasible, the federal government will not  have reasonable assurance that it is fully implementing the National  Action Plan and addressing antibiotic resistance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Antibiotic Stewardship Training May Have Limited Success in Improving Prescribing Behavior", "paragraphs": ["While training is recognized as one component of an antibiotic  stewardship program, such training may have limited success in  improving antibiotic prescribing behavior, and federal agencies indicate  that it is challenging to evaluate the training\u2019s effectiveness. CDC officials  and experts say that inappropriate antibiotic use could be improved  through stewardship training, but it is challenging because antibiotic  prescribing behavior is driven by multiple factors and can be difficult to  change. For example, a PACCARB report stated that prescribers often  feel pressure to prescribe antibiotics\u2014even when antibiotics may not be  warranted\u2014because of their perception that a patient is demanding such  a prescription, or a patient\u2019s actual demand. In addition, CDC notes  that antibiotics are frequently prescribed for respiratory conditions most  commonly caused by viruses such as the common cold, against which  antibiotics are ineffective. Other factors that drive antibiotic prescribing behavior, as cited by experts, include habit, which may stem from what  physicians and other prescribers learn during their residencies or observe  in the workplace; the time it takes to explain to a patient why an antibiotic  is inappropriate; and \u201cdecision fatigue\u201d caused by tiredness or hunger.  (See table 4 for examples of factors that drive or deter antibiotic  prescribing behavior.)", "Nevertheless, federal agencies plan to evaluate the effectiveness of their  antibiotic stewardship training programs to some extent, although the  National Action Plan does not require the agencies to do so. For example,  CDC officials told us that their online training course for various types of  clinicians allows participants to fill out an evaluation that includes  questions about whether the participant will be able to apply knowledge  gained from the course, which the agency will use to refine and update  the course. In addition, for the antibiotic stewardship training for  nursing homes that CDC and CMS jointly developed, CDC officials told us  that participants will be asked 6 months after the training whether  participants implemented stewardship practices\u2014and whether there have  been reductions in antibiotic use\u2014as a result of the training. However,  CMS, DOD, and VA officials noted that it is difficult to isolate and  measure the effectiveness of antibiotic stewardship training specifically on  antibiotic prescribing behavior\u2014compared to other, concurrent federal  efforts, such as requirements and guidance to promote appropriate  antibiotic use. For example, DOD officials told us that their department  has looked at antibiotic use data from DOD health care facilities as a  \u201csurrogate\u201d to evaluate whether antibiotic stewardship in general has  been effective\u2014but noted that is an imperfect measure since there are  many factors that affect antibiotic prescribing behavior, and training is  only one of several interventions aimed at reducing inappropriate  antibiotic use."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Antibiotic resistance has been characterized as one of the greatest public  health threats the world faces. A concerted effort involving coordination of  multiple stakeholders and countries and across health fields is critical to  helping ensure that bacterial infections remain treatable. Steps by federal  agencies to expand surveillance, facilitate the development and use of  new diagnostic tests, fund R&D for the development of new treatments,  and issue requirements and guidance for antibiotic stewardship programs  are important efforts toward addressing the problem of antibiotic  resistance and implementing the National Action Plan.", "Significant challenges to conducting surveillance remain. For example,  CDC has not determined the participation rates or appropriate distribution  of participating hospitals needed by the voluntary antibiotic-resistance  reporting option to achieve CDC\u2019s goal of conducting regional and  national assessments of resistance. By taking steps to determine the  participation rates and distribution needed for this option, CDC would  have more reasonable assurance that it can achieve its goal. CDC  classified gonorrhea as one of the most urgent resistant threats in the  nation, but collects limited specimens\u2014representing an estimated 1 to 2  percent of the reported cases in the United States\u2014for GISP, its primary  surveillance system for resistant gonorrhea. However, CDC has not fully  evaluated the representativeness of the trends identified by this  surveillance system. By evaluating GISP to ensure that it includes  measures of its representativeness, such as comparing the trends in the  sample population with those in the overall U.S. population, using  specially designed studies if needed, CDC would have better assurance  that the trends detected in GISP accurately reflect the characteristics of  the health-related outcome the system is designed to monitor. Further,  neither the 2013 nor the 2019 Threats Reports provided quantitative  measures of uncertainty for CDC\u2019s estimates of morbidity and mortality  resulting from antibiotic-resistant infections. Providing such measures,  such as standard errors or confidence intervals, as appropriate, in its  Threats Reports would help CDC and others compare information within  and across reporting efforts, and draw appropriate conclusions about the  characteristics of antibiotic resistance in the United States, including  limitations associated with reported findings and conclusions. Finally,  there has been a 6-year interval between CDC\u2019s reports on antibiotic  resistance threats. By developing a plan for more frequent dissemination  of consolidated reporting on priority pathogens at regular intervals, CDC  would have more timely trend data and other information necessary for  users of the data, including policymakers, to prioritize, plan, implement,  and evaluate public health actions to address antibiotic resistance.", "HHS has funded some studies to assess whether certain tests for  antibiotic resistance lead to improved clinical outcomes, including more  effective treatment for patients or more judicious use of antibiotics.  However, HHS agencies that are in a position to conduct or fund such  studies have not identified leadership, roles, and responsibilities to help  further such efforts. By taking steps to identify leadership, roles, and  responsibilities, agencies could more effectively address the need for  clinical outcomes studies, potentially increasing test use, improving  patient care, and enhancing stewardship efforts. In addition, for its part,  FDA has not regularly monitored tests for antibiotic resistance to assess  breakpoint updates or evaluated any effects of using tests for antibiotic  resistance with out-of-date breakpoints. By regularly monitoring and  evaluating FDA-authorized tests that rely on breakpoints, FDA would be  able to determine whether test manufacturers are updating breakpoints  as needed and help ensure that patient care and infection control efforts  are effective.", "While government push incentives to support antibiotic R&D have been  helpful, experts and antibiotic developers have indicated that push  incentives alone are not sufficient to sustain antibiotic development.  PACCARB, TATFAR, and other experts have called for additional  postmarket pull incentives to increase the antibiotic pipeline, but HHS  does not have a strategy for doing so. Developing a strategic framework  that outlines key design elements of new incentives would be a first step  toward identifying potential authorities and resources that may be needed  and determining agency roles for implementation and oversight of the  incentives. Until such incentives are developed, more drug companies  may exit the antibiotic development sector, and the pipeline of new  treatments may continue to decrease.", "Finally, in its progress reports covering the first four years of the National  Action Plan\u2019s implementation, the CARB Task Force did not identify  plans, as required by the Executive Order, to address barriers that  agencies face in fully implementing the National Action Plan, such as  expanding (1) a CDC program designed to strengthen the U.S. response  to resistant gonorrhea; (2) antibiotic stewardship programs across health  care settings; and (3) antibiotic use data collection, to the extent feasible.  Without identifying plans to address these and other challenges, the  federal government cannot assure that the country is prepared to  overcome the urgent health consequences of antibiotic resistance. Until  the CARB Task Force, which is coordinated by HHS officials, identifies  and reports on agencies\u2019 plans to address barriers preventing full  implementation of the National Action Plan, the federal government will  not have reasonable assurance that it is fully implementing the National  Action Plan and addressing antibiotic resistance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making a total of eight recommendations, including four to CDC,  three to HHS, and one to FDA.

HHS identified  several actions it intends to take to address our recommendations. DOD  and HHS also provided technical comments, which we incorporated as  appropriate.", "In response to our first recommendation, HHS concurred and CDC stated  it is working with public health partners to promote the voluntary use of  the AR Option, providing technical support to states that may be  considering a state or local mandate to require AR and AU reporting, and  developing pilot programs to assess AR Option data and other data  sources for certain types of antibiotic resistance. While these actions are  helpful, we believe taking additional steps, such as determining goals for  participation rates and distribution for AR Option reporting, would give  CDC more reasonable assurance that hit can conduct regional and  national assessments of resistance.", "In response to our second recommendation, HHS concurred and CDC  stated it is taking additional efforts to examine the representativeness of  data collected through its primary surveillance system for resistant  gonorrhea, including working to develop laboratory methods to reduce  dependence on cultured isolates. CDC stated that steps to refine and  improve collection of resistant gonorrhea data require additional  resources. We believe that CDC requesting such resources would help  ensure that such data are representative of the overall U.S. population.", "HHS generally concurred with our third recommendation. CDC stated it  feels that it is critical to publish the data after peer review and then plans  to link the publications back to online resources of the 2019 Threats  Report. We believe that peer-reviewed publication is important, but it is  also important for CDC to take additional steps to establish and report  uncertainties for the national estimates or summary data that would help  CDC and others draw appropriate conclusions about the characteristics of  antibiotic resistance in the United States.", "In response to our fourth recommendation, HHS concurred and CDC  stated it has plans to update its enterprise-wide AR Threats Report every  three years, and that it also issues regular reports on specific groups of  pathogens.", "In response to our fifth recommendation, HHS concurred and stated that  the CARB Task Force leadership will work with relevant HHS agencies to  clarify roles and responsibilities and identify leadership, if appropriate, for  supporting research on clinical outcomes delated to diagnostic tests.", "HHS concurred with our sixth recommendation, and FDA concurred with  conducting additional monitoring and evaluation of tests relying on  breakpoints when FDA identifies or recognizes new breakpoints. FDA  stated that it has taken major steps to help address challenges  associated with updating such tests to reflect the most current  breakpoints. We believe that in addition to these steps, monitoring and  evaluation of current FDA-authorized tests that may still be using out-of- date breakpoints will enhance FDA\u2019s ability to provide assurance that  patient care and infection control efforts are effective.", "HHS did not concur with our seventh recommendation that HHS should  develop a strategic framework to further incentivize the development of  new treatments for antibiotic-resistant infections, including through the  use of postmarket financial incentives. HHS noted that, while it agrees  that additional incentives are needed to address the limited pipeline for  novel and innovative treatments to combat antibiotic resistance, it is still  conducting analyses to understand whether postmarket incentives should  be included as a component of its forthcoming strategic framework to  further incentivize the development of new treatments. However, HHS did  not specify when its framework would be released. We support HHS\u2019s  efforts to develop such a framework, as this is a complex issue with  multiple factors to consider. However, we believe our recommendation is  still warranted. Antibiotic resistance is one of the greatest global public  health threats, and experts, including the WHO, have warned that the  pipeline of new antibiotics in development is insufficient to combat the  threat. Without an adequate arsenal of treatments, we are likely to see  increasing mortality caused by these deadly infections. As we reported,  experts, advisory groups, federal officials, and antibiotic developers have  all called for additional postmarket incentives to reinvigorate the pipeline  of antibiotics under development. The current significant federal  investment in push incentives to support antibiotic R&D is helpful but will  ultimately be ineffective if companies receiving this investment are unable  to sustain their business once their treatment reaches the market.  Therefore, we maintain that it is important that HHS not delay the  development of a strategic framework that includes postmarket  incentives, which is just an initial step toward the creation of these  incentives. Until additional postmarket incentives are developed, more  drug companies may exit the antibiotic development sector, and the  pipeline of new treatments for antibiotic-resistant infections may continue  to decrease.", "In response to our eighth recommendation, HHS concurred and stated  that beginning in 2020 and continuing annually thereafter, the CARB Task  Force\u2019s progress reports will include discussion of any barriers preventing  full implementation of the National Action Plan, including, as appropriate,  barriers that GAO has identified.

We focused on these key practices when there was a lack  of specifically assigned roles in either the National Action Plan or the  PACCARB report for key activities.", "To identify challenges to developing new treatments for antibiotic- resistant infections and examine federal efforts to address these  challenges, we also interviewed 11 randomly selected companies that  conduct research and development on new treatments for bacterial  infections. We included companies that are researching or developing  both traditional antibiotics and alternatives to antibiotics\u2014which we call  \u201cnontraditional products\u201d in this report\u2014and we included companies that  had and had not received funding from the Combating Antibiotic- Resistant Bacteria Biopharmaceutical Accelerator (CARB-X) and  companies that do and do not have existing FDA-approved drugs on the market. We asked company representatives about challenges in  developing new antibiotics they have identified, support they may have  received from federal agencies, how effective the support has been to  them, and their views on additional incentives that would promote the  development of new antibiotics. We also interviewed experts on the topic  of antibiotic development and industry stakeholders, specifically The Pew  Charitable Trusts and the Biotechnology Innovation Organization. We  interviewed federal officials from BARDA, CMS, DOD, FDA, and NIH to  learn about their programs and actions to support the development of  treatments for antibiotic-resistant infections and requested information  about funding for antibiotic R&D from BARDA, DOD, and NIH. We  included relevant agency actions that began before the National Action  Plan was issued in 2015 if they continued after 2015. Finally, we reviewed  literature related to antibiotic development and reports about antibiotic  pull incentives written by health policy advisory groups, including the  PACCARB, the Transatlantic Taskforce on Antimicrobial Resistance  (TATFAR), the DRIVE-AB project, and the Duke Margolis Center for  Health Policy. We evaluated the actions taken by federal agencies to  help address the challenges to developing new treatments against  experts\u2019 and advisory groups\u2019 views on additional actions needed and  against the principles related to developing strategies outlined in GPRA  and the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010. We did not assess  challenges to developing products designed to prevent infections, such as  vaccines, nor federal actions related to these types of products.", "To examine federal agency efforts to promote the appropriate use of  antibiotics and any challenges that remain, we also analyzed CMS data  and related documentation on the quality measures and improvement  activities related to antibiotics as part of CMS\u2019s Merit-based Incentive  Payment System (MIPS) in 2017. Specifically, we identified CMS\u2019s  antibiotics-related quality measures and improvement activities by  conducting a search for the words \u201cantibiotic,\u201d \u201cantimicrobial,\u201d \u201cbacteria,\u201d  \u201cresistance,\u201d and \u201cresistant\u201d on CMS\u2019s MIPS website. We then reviewed  CMS\u2019s data on the number of MIPS-eligible clinicians who selected and  reported on these measures and activities in 2017, the most recently  available data. In 2017, there were nine MIPS quality measures related to  antibiotics, as follows:  (1) acute otitis externa: systemic antimicrobial therapy - avoidance of  inappropriate use;  (2) adult sinusitis: antibiotic prescribed for acute sinusitis (overuse);  (3) adult sinusitis: appropriate choice of antibiotic: amoxicillin with or  without Clavulanate prescribed for patients with acute bacterial sinusitis  (appropriate use);  (4) appropriate testing for children with pharyngitis;  (5) appropriate treatment for children with upper respiratory infection;  (6) appropriate treatment of Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus  bacteremia;  (7) avoidance of antibiotic treatment in adults with acute bronchitis;  (8) perioperative care: selection of prophylactic antibiotic \u2013 first- or  second-generation Cephalosporin; and  (9) total knee replacement: preoperative antibiotic infusion with proximal  tourniquet.", "In addition, there was one MIPS improvement activity related to  antibiotics in 2017: implementation of antibiotic stewardship program. We  reviewed the MIPS data for any obvious outliers or anomalies, and we  determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for reporting the  number of clinicians who reported implementing these quality measures  and improvement activities. In addition, we reviewed aggregated data  from CDC on the total number of eligible U.S. hospitals voluntarily  reporting their antibiotic use data to a CDC system (the NHSN\u2019s  Antimicrobial Use Option); we then calculated the percentage of eligible  hospitals reporting such data as of January 1, 2020. We assessed the  reliability of the aggregated data by reviewing them for any obvious errors  or missing data totals and inquiring with CDC officials about their source  and any known reliability issues. We determined that these data were  sufficiently reliable for reporting hospital participation rates in the system.  We also reviewed selected articles on antibiotic use and stewardship\u2014 compiled from a variety of sources, including CDC documents and  experts we interviewed\u2014published in literature. In addition, we  interviewed experts on antibiotic use and stewardship, including  representatives from PACCARB, Emory University\u2019s School of Medicine,  the University of Minnesota\u2019s Center for Infectious Disease Research and  Policy, The Joint Commission, the Society of Infectious Diseases  Pharmacists, The Pew Charitable Trusts, and the Association for  Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology. We evaluated  federal efforts and challenges against relevant National Action Plan  objectives and milestones and Executive Order No. 13676. We focused  on antibiotic use in the United States, rather than global antibiotic use.", "We conducted this performance audit from February 2018 to March 2020  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Expert Meeting Participant List", "paragraphs": ["We collaborated with the National Academy of Sciences to convene a  two-day meeting of experts to inform our work on federal efforts to  address antibiotic resistance; the meeting was held on September 17 and  18, 2018.
