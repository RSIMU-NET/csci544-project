Consequently, the goals of current programs are numerous and sometimes conflicting, and the federal role in these programs is unclear. For example, federal programs do not effectively address key transportation challenges, such as increasing congestion and freight demand. Many surface transportation programs are also not linked to performance of the transportation system or of the grantees, and programs often do not employ the best tools and approaches. Finally, the fiscal sustainability of the numerous highway, transit, and safety programs funded by the Highway Trust Fund is in doubt, because spending from the fund has increased without commensurate increases in revenues. A number of principles can help guide the assessment of proposals to restructure and fund federal surface transportation programs. These principles include (1) ensuring goals are well defined and focused on the national interest, (2) ensuring the federal role in achieving each goal is clearly defined, (3) ensuring accountability for results by entities receiving federal funds, (4) employing the best tools and approaches to improve results and emphasize return on targeted federal investment, and (5) ensuring fiscal sustainability. A range of options could be used to fund the growing demand for additional investment in the surface transportation system. There are two revenue sources for these additional investments: taxes and fees. Financing mechanisms, such as bonding and revolving funds, could also be used to fund transportation infrastructure projects when tax and user fee approaches are not sufficient to meet demands. However, these financing mechanisms are all forms of debt that ultimately must be repaid with interest by the general population through tax increases or reductions in government services. Each of these options has different merits and challenges, and the selection of any of them will likely involve trade-offs among different policy goals. Highway public-private partnerships show promise as a viable alternative, where appropriate, to help meet growing and costly transportation demands. The highway public-private partnerships created to date have resulted in advantages from the perspective of state and local governments, such as the construction of new infrastructure without using public funding. However, highway public-private partnerships also entail potential costs and risks including the reality that funds from public-private partnerships are largely a new source of borrowed funds--a form of privately issued debt that must be repaid to private investors. Ultimately the extent to which public-private partnerships can be used to help meet the nation's transportation funding challenges will depend on the ability of states to weigh potential benefits against potential costs and trade-offs to determine whether public-private partnerships are appropriate in specific circumstances--and if so--how best to implement them and protect the public interest."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["We appreciate the opportunity to testify on surface transportation  financing issues.

The economic and  environmental implications are significant, ranging from wasted fuel and  lost time as cars idle in traffic to increased costs for businesses as the  transportation system grows more unreliable.", "Since federal funding for the interstate system was established in 1956, the  federal role in surface transportation has expanded to include broader  goals, more programs, and a variety of program structures.

In addition, the continued relevance  of some of these programs in the 21st century is unclear. For example, the  Highway Trust Fund was created in 1956 to distribute funds for the  construction of the interstate highway system. That system is now  complete. However, the federal highway program\u2019s funding and delivery  mechanisms have not substantially changed. Furthermore, there is a  growing differential between expected Highway Trust Fund revenue and  planned levels of spending on surface transportation programs. As a  result, without significant changes in funding levels or planned spending,  the Highway Trust Fund is projected to incur significant deficits in the  years ahead. As a result, in 2007, we added financing the nation\u2019s  transportation system to GAO\u2019s High Risk List.", "Addressing these challenges is complicated by the breadth of the nation\u2019s  surface transportation network\u2014encompassing highway, transit, and rail  systems and ports that are owned, funded, and operated by both the public  and the private sectors. Moreover, surface transportation policy decisions  are inextricably linked with aviation, economic, environmental, and energy  policy concerns. In addition, exacerbating this challenge is that the federal  government\u2019s financial condition and fiscal outlook are worse than many  may understand. Specifically, the federal budget is on an unsustainable  path\u2014heightening concern about the solvency of the Highway Trust Fund  because other federal revenue sources may not be available to help solve  the nation\u2019s current transportation challenges. Addressing these  challenges requires strategic and intermodal approaches, effective tools  and programs, and coordinated solutions involving all levels of  government and the private sector. Yet in many cases, the government is  still trying to do business in ways that are based on conditions, priorities,  and approaches that were established decades ago and are not well suited  to addressing 21st century challenges.

The economic and  social importance of the nation\u2019s transportation system and the current  fiscal environment, make it even more important that federal, state, and  local governments make prudent decisions on how to invest limited  available resources. In making these decisions, governments will face an  array of challenges that include repairing and maintaining aging  infrastructure, making more efficient use of existing infrastructure,  accounting for population growth, and incorporating new technologies in  funding for infrastructure. In this environment, the infrastructure  improvements that all levels of government want may not reflect what  they need or what the nation can afford.

Most  highway infrastructure funds continue to be distributed to states in  accordance with individual grant program formulas and eligibility  requirements.

For example, while the condition of highways showed some improvement  between 1997 and 2004, traffic congestion increased in the same period.

The upward trend in  expenditures continued under the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient  Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU), which  provided an average of $57.2 billion in contract authority per year. While  expenditures from the trust fund have grown, revenues into the fund have  not kept pace. The current fuel tax of 18.4 cents per gallon has been in  place since 1993, and the buying power of the fixed cents-per-gallon  amount has since been eroded by inflation. The reallocation to the  Highway Trust Fund of 4.3 cents of federal fuel tax previously dedicated to  deficit reduction provided an influx of funds beginning in 1997.

These various approaches can be grouped into two  categories: taxes and user fees.", "A variety of taxes have been and could be used to fund the nation\u2019s  infrastructure, including excise, sales, property, and income taxes. For  example, federal excise taxes on motor fuels are the primary source of  funding for the federal surface transportation program. Fuel taxes are  attractive because they have provided a relatively stable stream of  revenues and the collection and enforcement costs are relatively low.  However, fuel taxes do not currently convey to drivers the full costs of  their use of the road\u2014such as the costs of wear and tear, congestion, and  pollution. Moreover, federal motor fuel taxes have not been increased  since 1993\u2014and thus the purchasing power of fuel tax revenues has  eroded with inflation. As CBO has previously reported, the existing fuel  taxes could be altered in a variety of ways to address this erosion,  including increasing the per-gallon tax rate and indexing the rates to  inflation. Some transportation stakeholders have suggested exploring the  potential of using a carbon tax, or other carbon pricing strategies, to help  fund infrastructure investments. In a system of carbon taxes, fossil fuel  emissions would be taxed, with the tax proportional to the amount of  carbon dioxide released in its combustion. Because a carbon tax could  have a broad effect on consumer decisions, we have previously reported  that it could be used to complement Corporate Average Fuel Economy  standards, which require manufacturers meet fuel economy standards for  passenger cars and light trucks to reduce oil consumption. A carbon tax  would create incentives that could affect a broader range of consumer  choices as well as provide revenue for infrastructure.", "Another funding source for infrastructure is user fees. The concept  underlying user fees\u2014that is, users pay directly for the infrastructure they  use\u2014is a long-standing aspect of many infrastructure programs. Examples  of user fees that could be altered or introduced include fees based on  vehicle miles traveled (VMT) on roadways; freight fees, such as a per- container charge; congestion pricing of roads; and tolling.", "VMT fees. To more directly reflect the amount a vehicle uses the road,  users could be charged a fee based on the number of vehicle miles  traveled. In 2006, the Oregon Department of Transportation conducted a  pilot program designed to test the technological and administrative  feasibility of a VMT fee. The pilot program demonstrated that a VMT fee  could be implemented to replace the fuel tax as the principal source of  transportation revenue by utilizing a Global Positioning System (GPS) to  track miles driven and collecting the VMT fee ($0.012 per mile traveled) at  fuel pumps that can read information from the GPS. As we have  previously reported, using a GPS could also track mileage in high  congestion zones, and the fee could be adjusted upward for miles driven in  these areas or during more congested times of day such as rush hour\u2014a  strategy that might reduce congestion and save fuel. In addition, the  system could be designed to apply different fees to vehicles, depending on  their fuel economy. On the federal level, a VMT fee could be based on  odometer readings, which would likely be a simpler and less costly way to  implement such a program. A VMT fee\u2014unless it is adjusted based on the  fuel economy of the vehicle\u2014does not provide incentives for customers to  buy vehicles with higher fuel economy ratings because the fee depends  only on mileage. Also, because the fee would likely be collected from  individual drivers, a VMT fee could be expensive for the government to  implement, potentially making it a less cost-effective approach than a  motor fuel or carbon tax. The Oregon study also identified other  challenges including concerns about privacy and technical difficulties in  retrofitting vehicles with the necessary technology.", "Freight fees. Given the importance of freight movement to the economy,  the Policy Commission recently recommended a new federal freight fee to  support the development of a national program aimed at strategically  expanding capacity for freight transportation. While the volume of  domestic and international freight moving through the country has  increased dramatically and is expected to continue growing, the capacity  of the nation\u2019s freight transportation infrastructure has not increased at  the same rate as demand. To support the development of a national  program for freight transportation, the Policy Commission recommended  the introduction of a federal freight fee. The Policy Commission notes that  a freight fee, such as a per-container charge, could help fund projects that  remedy chokepoints and increase throughput. The Policy Commission also  recommended that a portion of the customs duties, which are assessed on  imported goods, be used to fund capacity improvements for freight  transportation. The majority of customs duties currently collected,  however, are deposited in the U.S. Treasury\u2019s general fund for the general  support of federal activities. Therefore, designating a portion of customs  duties for surface transportation funding would not create a new source of  revenue, but rather transfer funds from the general fund.", "Congestion pricing. As we have previously reported, congestion pricing,  or road pricing, attempts to influence driver behavior by charging fees  during peak hours to encourage users to shift to off-peak periods, use less  congested routes, or use alternative modes. Congestion pricing can also  help guide capital investment decisions for new transportation  infrastructure. In particular, as congestion increases, toll rates also  increase, and such increases (sometimes referred to as \u201ccongestion  surcharges\u201d) signal increased demand for physical capacity, indicating  where capital investments to increase capacity would be most valuable.  Furthermore, these congestion surcharges can potentially enhance  mobility by reducing congestion and the demand for roads when the  surcharges vary according to congestion to maintain a predetermined level  of service. The most common form of congestion pricing in the United  States is high-occupancy toll lanes, which are priced lanes that offer  drivers of vehicles that do not meet the occupancy requirements the  option of paying a toll to use lanes that are otherwise restricted for high- occupancy vehicles."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Various Financing Mechanisms Can Also Help Fund Infrastructure Projects", "paragraphs": ["Financing mechanisms can provide flexibility for all levels of government  when funding additional infrastructure projects, particularly when  traditional pay-as-you-go funding approaches, such as taxes or fees, are  not set at high enough levels to meet demands. The federal government  currently offers several programs to provide state and local governments  with incentives such as bonds, loans, and credit assistance to help finance  infrastructure. Financing mechanisms can create potential savings by  accelerating projects to offset rapidly increasing construction costs and  offer incentives for investment from state and local governments and from  the private sector. However, each financing strategy is, in the final  analysis, a form of debt that ultimately must be repaid with interest.  Furthermore, since the federal government\u2019s cost of capital is lower than  that of the private sector, financing mechanisms, such as bonding, may be  more expensive than timely, full, and up-front appropriations. Finally, if  the federal government chooses to finance infrastructure projects, policy  makers must decide how borrowed dollars will be repaid, either by users  or by the general population either now or in the future through increases  in taxes or reductions in other government services.", "A number of available mechanisms can be used to help finance  infrastructure projects. Examples of these financing mechanisms follow.", "Bonding. A number of bonding strategies\u2014including tax-exempt bonds,  private activity bonds, Grant Anticipation Revenue Vehicles (GARVEE)  bonds, and Grant Anticipation Notes (GAN)\u2014offer flexibility to bridge  funding gaps when traditional revenue sources are scarce. For example,  state-issued GARVEE or GAN bonds provide capital in advance of  expected federal funds, allowing states to accelerate highway and transit  project construction and thus potentially reduce construction costs.  Through April 2008, 20 states and two territories issued approximately $8.2  billion of GARVEE-type debt financing and 20 other states are actively  considering bonding or seeking legislative authority to issue GARVEEs.  Furthermore, SAFETEA-LU authorized the Secretary of Transportation to  allocate $15 billion in tax-exempt bonds for qualified highway and surface  freight transfer facilities. To date, $5.3 billion has been allocated for six  projects. Several bills have been introduced in this Congress that would  increase investment in the nation\u2019s infrastructure through bonding. For  example, the Build America Bonds Act would provide $50 billion in new  infrastructure funding through bonding. Although bonds can provide up- front capital for infrastructure projects, they can be more expensive for  the federal government than traditional federal grants. This higher  expense results, in part, because the government must compensate the  investors for the risks they assume through an adequate return on their  investment.", "Loans, loan guarantees, and credit assistance. The federal  government currently has two programs designed to offer credit  assistance for surface transportation projects. The Transportation  Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 1998 (TIFIA) authorized the  Federal Highway Administration to provide credit assistance, in the form  of direct loans, loan guarantees, and standby lines of credit for projects of  national significance. A similar program, Railroad Rehabilitation and  Improvement Financing (RRIF), offers loans to acquire, improve, develop,  or rehabilitate intermodal or rail equipment and develop new intermodal  railroad facilities. To date, 15 TIFIA projects have been approved totaling  over $4.8 billion in credit assistance and the RRIF program has approved  21 loan agreements worth more than $747 million. These programs are  designed to leverage federal funds by attracting substantial nonfederal  investments in infrastructure projects. However, the federal government  assumes a level of risk when it makes or guarantees loans for projects  financed with private investment.", "Revolving funds. Revolving funds can be used to dedicate capital to be  loaned for qualified infrastructure projects. In general, loaned dollars are  repaid, recycled back into the revolving fund, and subsequently reinvested  in the infrastructure through additional loans. Such funds exist at both the  federal and the state levels and are used to finance various infrastructure  projects ranging from highways to water mains. For example, two federal  funds support water infrastructure financing, the Clean Water State  Revolving Fund for wastewater facilities, and the Drinking Water State  Revolving Fund for drinking water facilities. Under each of these  programs, the federal government provides seed money to states, which  they supplement with their own funds. These funds are then loaned to  local governments and other entities for water infrastructure construction  and upgrades and various water quality projects. In addition, State  Infrastructure Banks (SIBs)\u2014capitalized with federal and state matching  funds\u2014are state-run revolving funds that make loans and provide credit  enhancements and other forms of nongrant assistance to infrastructure  projects. Through June 2007, 33 SIBs have made approximately 596 loan  agreements worth about $6.2 billion to leverage other available funds for  transportation projects across the nation. Furthermore, other funds\u2014 such as a dedicated national infrastructure bank\u2014have been proposed to  increase investment in infrastructure with a national or regional  significance. A challenge for revolving funds in general is maintaining their  capitalized value. Defaults on loans and inflation can reduce the  capitalized value of the fund\u2014necessitating an infusion of capital needed  to continue the fund\u2019s operations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Highway Public- Private Partnerships Hold Promise, But Also Raise A Number of Issues to Consider", "paragraphs": ["Another important and emerging vehicle for funding investments in  transportation is public-private partnerships. In February 2008 we  reported on highway public-private partnerships. These arrangements  show promise as a viable alternative, where appropriate, to help meet  growing and costly transportation demands and have the potential to  provide numerous benefits to the public sector. The highway public- private partnerships created to date have resulted in advantages from the  perspective of state and local governments, such as the construction of  new infrastructure without using public funding, and obtaining funds by  extracting value from existing facilities for reinvestment in transportation  and other public programs. For example, the state of Indiana received $3.8  billion from leasing the Indiana Toll Road and used those proceeds to fund  a 10-year statewide transportation plan. Highway public-private  partnerships potentially provide other benefits, including the transfer or  sharing of project risks to the private sector. Such risks include those  associated with construction costs and schedules and having sufficient  levels of traffic and revenues to be financially viable. In addition, the  public sector can potentially benefit from increased efficiencies in  operations and life-cycle management, such as increased use of innovative  technologies. Finally, through the use of tolling, highway public-private  partnerships offer the potential to price highways to better reflect the true  costs of operating and maintaining them and to increase mobility by  adjusting tolls to manage demand, as well as the potential for more cost  effective investment decisions by private investors.", "Highway public-private partnerships also entail potential costs and risks.  Most importantly, there is no \u201cfree\u201d money in public-private partnerships.  While highway public-private partnerships can be used to obtain financing  for highways, these funds are largely a new source of borrowed funds\u2014a  form of privately issued debt that must be repaid to private investors  seeking a return on their investment by road users over what potentially  could be a period of several generations. Though concession agreements  can limit the extent to which a concessionaire can raise tolls, it is likely  that tolls will increase on a privately operated highway to a greater extent  than they would on a publicly operated toll road. To the extent that a  private concessionaire gains market power by control of a road where  there are not other viable travel alternatives, the potential also exists that  the public could pay tolls that are higher than tolls based on the cost of the  facilities, including a reasonable rate of return. Additionally, because large  up-front concession payments have, in part, been used to fund immediate  needs, it remains to be seen whether these agreements will provide long- term benefits to future generations who will potentially be paying  progressively higher toll rates throughout the length of a concession  agreement. Highway public-private partnerships are also potentially more  costly than traditional public procurement\u2014for example, there are costs  associated with the need to hire financial and legal advisors.", "In short, while highway public-private partnerships have promise, they are  not a panacea for meeting all transportation system demands. Ultimately  the extent to which public-private partnerships can be used as a tool to  help meet the nation\u2019s transportation financing challenges will depend on  the ability of states to effectively manage and implement them. For  example, states must have appropriate enabling legislation in place and  the institutional ability to manage complex contractual mechanisms\u2014 either in the form of in-house expertise or through contractors. Most  importantly, the extent to which public-private partnerships can be used  as a tool to help meet the nation\u2019s transportation funding challenges will  depend on how well states are able to weigh public interest  considerations. The benefits of public-private partnerships are potential  benefits\u2014that is, they are not assured and can only be achieved by  weighing them against potential costs and trade-offs through careful,  comprehensive analysis to determine whether public-private partnerships  are appropriate in specific circumstances and, if so, how best to  implement them, and how best to protect the public interest.", "In considering the numerous issues surrounding the protection of the  public interest, we reached the following conclusions in our February 2008  report on highway public-private partnerships:    First, consideration of highway public-private partnerships could benefit  from more consistent, rigorous, systematic, and up-front analysis. While  highway public-private partnerships are fairly new in the United States,  and although they are meant to serve the public interest, it is difficult to be  confident that these interests are being protected when formal  identification and consideration of public and national interests has been  lacking, and where limited up-front analysis of public interest issues using  established criteria has been conducted. Partnerships to date have  identified and protected the public interest largely through terms  contained in concession contracts, including maintenance and expansion  requirements, protections for the workforce, and oversight and monitoring  mechanisms to ensure that private partners fulfilled their obligations.  While these protections are important, governments in other countries,  including Australia and the United Kingdom, have developed systematic  approaches to identifying and evaluating public interest before agreements  are entered into, including the use of public interest criteria, as well as  assessment tools, and require their use when considering private  investments in public infrastructure. For example, a state government in  Australia uses a public interest test to determine how the public interest  would be affected in eight specific areas, including whether the views and  rights of affected communities have been heard and protected and  whether the process is sufficiently transparent. While similar tools have  been used to some extent in the United States, their use has been more  limited. Using up-front public interest analysis tools can also assist public  agencies in determining the expected benefits and costs of a project and  an appropriate means to deliver the project. Not using such tools may lead  to certain aspects of protecting public interest being overlooked.", "Second, fresh thinking is needed on the appropriate federal approach.", "DOT has done much to promote the benefits, but comparatively little to  either assist states and localities in weighing potential costs and trade-offs,  nor to assess how potentially important national interests might be  protected in highway public-private partnerships. This is in many respects  a function of the design of the federal program as few mechanisms exist to  identify potential national interests in cases where federal funds have not  or will not be used. For example, although the Indiana Toll Road is part of  the Interstate Highway System and most traffic on the road is interstate in  nature, federal officials had little involvement in reviewing the terms of  this concession agreement because minimal federal funds were used to  construct it, and those funds were repaid to the federal government. The  historic test of the presence of federal funding may have been relevant at a  time when the federal government played a larger role in financing  highways but may no longer be relevant when there are new players and  multiple sources of financing, including potentially significant private  money. Reexamining the federal role in transportation provides an  opportunity to identify the emerging national public interests in highway  public-private partnerships and determine how highway public-private  partnerships fit in with national programs.", "On the basis of these conclusions, we recommended that Congress direct  the Secretary of Transportation to develop and submit objective criteria  for identifying national public interests in highway public-private  partnerships, including any additional legal authority, guidance, or  assessment tools that would be appropriately required. We are pleased to  note that in a recent testimony before the House, the Secretary indicated a  willingness to begin developing such criteria. This is no easy task,  however. The recent Policy Commission report illustrates the challenges  of identifying national public interests as the Policy Commission\u2019s  recommendations for future restrictions\u2014including limiting allowable toll  increases and requiring concessionaires to share revenues with the public  sector\u2014stood in sharp contrast to the dissenting views of three  commissioners. We believe any potential federal restrictions on highway  public-private partnerships must be carefully crafted to avoid undermining  the potential benefits that can be achieved. Reexamining the federal role  in transportation provides an opportunity for DOT we believe, to play a  targeted role in ensuring that national interests are considered, as  appropriate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["The nation\u2019s surface transportation programs are no longer producing the  desired results. The reliability of the nation\u2019s surface transportation  system is declining as congestion continues to grow. Although infusing  surface transportation programs with additional funding, especially in light  of the projected shortfalls in the Highway Trust Fund, could be viewed as  a quick and direct solution, past experience shows that increased funding  for the program does not necessarily translate into improved performance.  Furthermore, the nation\u2019s current fiscal outlook may make such solutions  fiscally imprudent. In addition, before additional federal funds are  committed to the nation\u2019s surface transportation programs, we believe a  fundamental reexamination of the program is warranted. Such a  reexamination would require reviewing the results of surface  transportation programs and testing their continued relevance and relative  priority. Appropriate funding sources and financing mechanisms can then  be tailored for programs that continue to be relevant in today\u2019s  environment and address a national interest, such as freight movement.", "Over the coming months, various options to restructure and fund surface  transportation programs will likely be put forward by a range of  transportation stakeholders. Ultimately, Congress and other federal  policymakers will have to determine which option\u2014or which combination  of options\u2014best meets the nation\u2019s needs. There is no silver bullet that  can solve the nation\u2019s transportation challenges, and many of the options,  such as allowing greater private-sector investment in the nation\u2019s  infrastructure, could be politically difficult to implement both nationally  and locally. The principles that we identified provide a framework for  evaluating these various options. Although the principles do not prescribe  a specific approach to restructuring and funding the programs, they do  provide key attributes that will help ensure that a restructured surface  transportation program addresses current challenges. We will continue to  assist the Congress as it works to evaluate the various options and develop  a national transportation policy for the 21st century that improves the  design of transportation programs, the delivery of services, and  accountability for results.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared statement.
