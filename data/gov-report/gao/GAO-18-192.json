PACOM officials told GAO that there was no single rebalance-specific strategy document. Instead, officials identified a number of strategy documents published since 2012 that guided activities associated with the rebalance to the Pacific, including: Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense ; Quadrennial Defense Review ; National Military Strategy ; Guidance for the Employment of the Force ; Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan ; and the PACOM 2015 Theater Campaign Plan (DRAFT) .", "Based on GAO's analysis, DOD's six strategy documents that guided the rebalance to the Pacific included 24 of the 31 desired elements of an effective national strategy.

DOD officials also could not identify a definition for the rebalance to the Pacific in the strategy documents or provide a definition that was used consistently across the department.", "According to a DOD official with performance management responsibilities, defining the rebalance to the Pacific and identifying the initiative's strategic objectives, or end state, were important for establishing accountability and measuring progress. For instance, a clear definition of rebalance could have helped those charged with implementation to distinguish activities essential to operationalizing the strategic guidance from activities that were peripheral to that effort. Similarly, knowing the end state could have helped management make the best use of resources, enable the assessment of progress, and facilitate the development of strategic and military objectives.

According to the President, the United  States was going to play a larger and long-term role in shaping the Asia- Pacific region after spending a decade at war in Iraq and Afghanistan.  The President then directed his national security team to conduct a  global, strategic assessment of U.S. priorities. The team made key  determinations including that a pivot toward the Asia-Pacific region would  help to rebalance the projection and focus of U.S. power. Rebalancing  efforts to the Pacific subsequently became defense strategic guidance  that began to inform military planning. Consequently, in 2012 the  commander of U.S. Pacific Command (PACOM) described the military  focus of the rebalance as strengthening relationships with allies and  partners; adjusting military posture and presence; and employing new  concepts, capabilities and capacities. In a 2015 address, the Secretary of  Defense outlined other aspects of the rebalance such as reinforcing  partnerships and enhancing posture in the Asia-Pacific region. By the end  of 2015, the Department of Defense (DOD) had published strategy  documents that included references to the rebalance to the Pacific or  related concepts.

For example, as a set, the six strategy  documents contained a detailed description of the operating environment  in which activities for the rebalance were to take place and included  references that described the relationship of the rebalance to the Pacific  to other strategies, goals, and objectives. The strategy documents  referenced their purposes and, in unclassified and general descriptions,  the threats that the strategies were to address including long-range  missile threats and weapons of mass destruction. Collectively, the  strategy documents referred to selected types of resources needed, such  as the deployment of ships and aviation assets, and who would be  implementing the strategies.", "We were, however, unable to find any reference to 7 of the 31 elements  in any of the six strategy documents. For example, 2 of the 7 missing  elements were:  Lack of a documented, consistent definition of the rebalance to the  Pacific. Based on our systematic review, we found that none of DOD\u2019s  six strategy documents issued from 2012 to 2015 included a definition of  the rebalance to the Pacific that described the rebalance\u2019s key terms,  major functions, mission areas or activities. Further, DOD officials from  the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, the Joint Staff,  and the U.S. Pacific Command involved in planning and implementing the  rebalance to the Pacific were unable to identify a definition for the  rebalance to the Pacific in the strategy documents, and consequently  could not provide a definition that was in use consistently across the  department. During discussions about the absence of a definition, these  PACOM officials told us that all PACOM activities were rebalance  activities, even activities that were underway before the President\u2019s  announcement to rebalance. Senior DOD policy officials referred us to the  speeches of senior administration officials given since the President\u2019s  2011 address to derive the definition of the rebalance. However, as noted  earlier, after the President\u2019s speech in 2011, there were a number of  pronouncements from senior administration officials that varied over time.  The lack of consistent attributes to a strategy can make it difficult for  policy makers to assess its effectiveness and accountability.", "Lack of a documented end state for the rebalance to the Pacific.  Based on our systematic review, we found that none of DOD\u2019s six  strategy documents from 2012 to 2015 identified an end state for the  rebalance to the Pacific. Identifying the end state is a desired element  associated with establishing goals and objectives for effective strategies  and plans. Joint doctrine also states that military planners must know  where to look for the guidance to ensure that plans are consistent with  national priorities and are directed toward achieving national security  goals and objectives.", "A national strategy that identified the end state of the rebalance could  distinguish new efforts from the longstanding U.S. military presence in the  region, and the associated increase in resources to support the post-2011  rebalancing. For example, we found a lack of clarity concerning the end  state for the rebalance. DOD officials from the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense for Policy, Joint Staff, and PACOM\u2014whom we  interviewed because they were involved in planning and implementing the  rebalance to the Pacific\u2014said that they were unaware of an end state for  DOD\u2019s efforts to rebalance. The same officials told us that there was no  foreseeable end state because, as long as the Asia-Pacific region was  important to the U.S., the focus would remain on the region. However,  officials from different military service components told us that their  individual services had an end state for their service-specific activities to  support the rebalance. For example, officials from U.S. Army Pacific told  us that they had completed their service\u2019s rebalance. They stated that  they achieved the end state with the completion of force posture changes  and that some efforts supporting rebalancing had begun before  rebalancing was inaugurated. In contrast, a Marine Corps official in the  Pacific reported there was no end state for rebalancing. According to the  official, Marine Corps activities such as posture realignments supported  rebalancing, but these longstanding activities were ongoing prior to the  President\u2019s announcement to rebalance.", "Moreover, we found a lack of an awareness of a command-wide end  state for rebalancing and coordination among the various military service  activities in support of rebalancing. It was unclear how service-defined  end states could have been fully integrated or prioritized for funding  without a consistent overall end state for DOD\u2019s overall effort. In such  instances, a department-wide defined end state could have helped with  the allocation of resources because the most important priorities would be  known.", "A clear and consistent definition for rebalance and the identification of an  end state, as well as the inclusion of the other 5 missing elements, could  have better positioned decision makers to effectively plan, manage, and  assess DOD\u2019s progress toward rebalancing efforts to the Pacific.  According to DOD officials from the Office of the Under Secretary of  Defense for Policy responsible for policy for the rebalance to the Pacific,  the speeches by senior administration officials between 2012 and 2015  supplanted the need to identify and document a definition of the  rebalance or an end state in a strategy document. However, as noted  earlier, these statements included varying descriptions of the strategy and  objectives over time. According to a DOD official from an office with  department-wide performance management responsibilities, defining the  rebalance to the Pacific and identifying the initiative\u2019s strategic objectives,  or end state, were both important for establishing accountability and  measuring progress. For instance, a definition could have helped those  charged with implementation to distinguish activities essential to  operationalizing the strategic guidance to rebalance from those activities  that were routine or peripheral to that effort.", "Further, knowing the end state could have helped management make the  best use of resources, enable the assessment of progress toward a  particular goal, and as described in joint doctrine, facilitate the  development of strategic and military objectives.
