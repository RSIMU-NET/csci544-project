For example, DOD\u2019s Global Positioning  System provides positioning, navigation, and timing services worldwide,  and its communications satellites provide secure communications critical  for conducting military operations. These space systems are increasingly  vulnerable to a variety of threats. Threats to orbiting space assets can be  either intentional or unintentional\u2014ranging from adversary attacks and  signal jamming to electromagnetic radiation and collisions with space  debris. Both types of threats have increased in recent years because  foreign adversaries continue to pursue advanced capabilities and  because the number of objects in space continues to grow.

We also found that the Air Force had adopted a strategy of  deferring some requirements on the optimistic assumption that these  requirements could be achieved during later stages of system  development. We concluded that while such deferrals may have  permitted the Air Force to meet revised short-term goals, they also  masked the magnitude of problems the program experienced as it moved  forward. We also found that DOD had not formally evaluated the  performance risks related to deferring requirements and concluded that  the strategy of deferral significantly raised the risk that system  development would be more costly and take longer. DOD declared the  program operational in 1998; however, some critical capabilities were not  delivered. At that time, the program was nearly $1 billion over budget and  11 years late.

JMS Increment 2 encountered significant challenges  during development, and in 2016 the program experienced a critical  change because of significant schedule delays and cost increases.  Specifically, JMS Increment 2 planned to delay delivery by more than 1  year, in turn increasing total program costs by over 25 percent. According  to the August 2016 JMS Critical Change Report, which the program office  submitted to Congress in September 2016 as a result of the critical  change, several issues contributed to Increment 2\u2019s challenges. These  included an overly aggressive schedule, inadequate staffing,  underestimating the amount of work required to integrate various pieces of the system that were developed by different groups, and numerous  concurrent development efforts. An independent program assessment  team comprised of military, intelligence, and contractor staff determined  that the JMS program had underestimated the complexity of developing  the system. Further, the program reported that its organizational structure  proved problematic. For example, the program reported that program- related contracts were awarded and administered outside the program  office, which limited program flexibility and support and hampered  effective oversight. As a result of the critical change, the program re- estimated its costs, established new schedule goals, and deferred a  number of capabilities and requirements to Increment 3.", "Even after these changes, JMS Increment 2 was not successful at  delivering its planned capabilities.

Agile practices  integrate planning, design, development, and testing into an iterative life  cycle to deliver software early and often, such as every 60-90 days. The  frequent iterations of Agile development are intended to effectively  measure progress, reduce technical and programmatic risk, and be  responsive to feedback from stakeholders and users. This is different  from the way DOD has developed software in the past, in which  requirements were solidified in advance of development and the software  was delivered as a single completed program at the end of the  development cycle\u2014with no continual involvement or feedback from  users or ability to modify requirements. Traditional software development  mirrored the development of a hardware system. We have previously  reported on past DOD software programs that experienced challenges  due, in part, to that traditional development approach. The differences  between the two approaches are illustrated in figure 3.", "The Space C2 program is one of the first DOD software-intensive  programs to move away from the traditional approach and into the more  modernized Agile development methodology. Program officials told us  that many of the problems with JMS\u2019s development stemmed from its  more traditional approach, and that with the Space C2 program they  wanted to avoid circumstances that did not lead to program success.  Considering that past software development problems were caused, at  least in part, by the traditional method of software development, utilizing a  different approach could be a positive step. However, the current DOD  acquisition instruction does not include guidance for Agile software  programs. According to DOD officials, new software guidance is in  development, and this guidance is expected to offer pathways for  developing Agile programs. DOD has also developed a draft template to  assist Agile programs with developing their acquisition strategies, though  the template and associated software guidance are in the early stages of  development. In the meantime, however, Space C2 program officials  confirmed that they are currently operating without specific software  acquisition guidance. Space C2 officials also clarified that while official  Agile software acquisition guidance has not yet been formally published,  the program office has been actively engaged with the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment on refining draft  policy and guidance.

However, according  to GAO\u2019s upcoming guide for assessing Agile development programs,  known as the Agile Assessment Guide, sound engineering principles are  still beneficial when employing this approach. For example, continuous  attention to technical excellence and good design requires the developers  to consider security requirements throughout development. This is  particularly true with complex programs that process sensitive data with  complex security requirements. In past work, we have found that teams  overlooking security requirements may end up developing systems that  do not comply with current federal requirements (for example  cybersecurity requirements for information technology programs),  resulting in the software not becoming operational until these components  are addressed. In addition, the Agile Assessment Guide notes that  transitioning to Agile software development can be challenging because  Agile methods require organizations to do more than implement new  tools, practices, or processes. Agile requires a re-evaluation of existing  organizational structures, planning practices, business and program  governance, and business measures, in addition to technical practices  and tools. However, Agile does not mean eliminating the need for  documentation, planning, oversight, architecture, risk analysis, or  baseline schedule, for example.", "Leading practices for Agile software development\u2014as described in  GAO\u2019s upcoming Agile Assessment Guide\u2014state that, among other  things, programs should have the following characteristics: a product owner who manages the requirements prioritization,  communicates operational concepts, and provides continual feedback  to the development team;  staff who are appropriately trained in Agile methods; management that has established an Agile supportive environment; a program strategy that reflects the mission, architectural, safety- critical components, and dependencies; organization\u2019s acquisition policy and guidance that require the  contract type and the acquisition strategy to be aligned to support  Agile implementation; an architecture that is planned upfront to enable flexibility and to  provide support to Agile methods; and mission goals that drive the prioritization of the most advantageous  requirements (e.g., security and privacy) that are well understood and  reviewed throughout development.", "Recognizing the need to change traditional processes to accommodate  more iterative software development, both the Air Force and Under  Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment have created  software advisor positions.

In addition, DOD is looking  into how to use industry practices to modernize the way it develops  software. For example, the Office of the Secretary of Defense has a  Development Security Operations (DevSecOps) pathfinder program for  software, which helps programs define and develop a technical digital  roadmap and leverages industry and Office of the Secretary of Defense  expertise in developing appropriate infrastructure for software programs.  The DevSecOps concept emphasizes rapid prototyping, security, and  continuous integration and delivery of software products. In a May 2019  Acquisition Decision Memorandum, the Under Secretary of Defense for  Acquisition and Sustainment directed the Space C2 program to become a  pathfinder program.

DOD programs following traditional acquisition  processes conduct internal reviews at major milestones, and GAO best  practices for knowledge-based acquisitions also include conducting  independent program reviews at these milestones. The draft GAO Agile  Assessment Guide notes that while traditional DOD program milestone  reviews are not used for Agile programs, Agile programs rely on other  review methods such as stakeholder demonstrations and retrospective  program reviews during each iteration of work. In addition, the GAO  Schedule Assessment Guide, which identifies best practices for  managing a program\u2019s schedule, states that programs should conduct  periodic reevaluations of risks, and that an independent view in this is  valuable.

In addition, our work on best practices for  knowledge-based acquisitions has emphasized that the success of any  effort to develop a new product hinges on having the right knowledge at  the right time, and that a better opportunity exists to meet program goals  when the knowledge is available early. However, given that DOD\u2019s draft  template is still subject to change, including these elements in the  finalized acquisition strategy would help position the program for success."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Technical Challenges", "paragraphs": ["The Space C2 program also faces significant technical challenges, as  described in table 2. For example, the program is planning to meet  previously deferred requirements that proved too complex for prior  programs to achieve. It also plans to address new and emerging threats  to space assets, for which requirements are not yet defined. In addition,  the program plans to use an Agile software development approach, the  processes of which DOD has yet to show proficiency in applying, as  discussed above. Integration of the multiple types of software planned for  Space C2 is also likely to present considerable technical challenges.  Further, cybersecurity is a growing concern for DOD space programs,  including Space C2."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Workforce Challenges", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the management and technical risks we identified, limited  availability of staff with expertise in Agile software development poses a  challenge to the Space C2 program and to DOD in general. The Space  C2 program manager stated that the program is undertaking an effort that  is fast-paced in nature and needs to be rapidly fielded, and she  expressed confidence in her staff\u2019s abilities to meet the development  demands. However, various DOD officials told us that a lack of qualified  software developers within DOD, and within the Space C2 program, is an  issue. Agile software development methods are different from the  traditional approaches used by DOD, and according to DOD officials,  proficiency in Agile methods requires specific training. Software  developers with this training are in high demand in the private sector, and  according to DOD officials, sufficient numbers may not be immediately  available for the Space C2 program.", "One industry best practice for software development states that to be  successful, programs should ensure that each development team has  immediate access to people with specialized skills including contracting,  architecture, database administration, development, quality assurance,  operations (if applicable), information security, risk analysis, and business  systems analysis. As early as March 2009, DOD acknowledged it had a  top priority to establish a cadre of trained information technology  professionals, and that the lack thereof was a significant impediment to  successful implementation of any future software development process.  Furthermore, a 2018 Defense Science Board report highlights the lack of  Agile software expertise in DOD, citing no modern software expertise in  program offices or the broader acquisition workforce. Moreover, the  report states that DOD defense prime contractors need to build their own  internal competencies in modern software methodologies. Similarly, we  found in March 2019 that DOD faces several challenges related to hiring,  assigning, and retaining qualified personnel to work on space acquisition  programs, similar to the challenges it faces more generally with the  acquisition workforce. We also noted that DOD is taking steps to address  these challenges where possible.", "In May 2019, the DOD\u2019s Defense Innovation Board issued a  congressionally mandated study on software acquisition and practices.  The report stated that numerous past studies have recognized the  deficiencies in software acquisition and practices within DOD. The report  also noted the importance of digital talent and stated that DOD\u2019s current  personnel processes and culture will not allow its military and civilian  software capabilities to grow fast or deep enough to meet its mission  needs. In addition, the report stated that new mechanisms are needed for  attracting, educating, retaining, and promoting digital talent and for  supporting the workforce to follow modern practices, including developing  software in close coordination with users. Finally, the report emphasized  that the military services and Office of the Secretary of Defense will need  to create new paths for digital talent (especially internal DOD talent) by  establishing software development as a high-visibility, high-priority career  track and increasing the level of understanding of modern software within  the acquisition workforce. This is the case for all DOD space programs,  including Space C2."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s ability to command and control U.S. space assets, as well as  anticipate and respond to the threats these assets face, is critical.  However, over more than three decades, DOD\u2019s efforts to improve its  space command and control capabilities\u2014commensurate with the space  threats that have continued to grow in frequency and type\u2014have been  fraught with development problems. The Air Force has again undertaken  a program to meet the nation\u2019s ongoing and future consolidated  command and control needs, while trying to overcome past problems with  a modern software development process. The Space C2 program is  making a concerted effort to learn from past software development  mistakes while forging a new path for Agile development. Though DOD is  taking steps to ensure that the Space C2 program has a comprehensive  approach in place for managing, identifying, and mitigating challenges  associated with this approach, key program plans and agency-wide  guidance are still in draft form, leaving uncertainty as to how program  development and oversight will ultimately proceed. Finalizing a robust  acquisition strategy containing the key elements for ongoing planning and  evaluation would position the program for success.", "Striking the right balance between trying new development methods and  working within DOD\u2019s knowledge-based framework will be essential for  meeting cost, schedule, and performance goals. Periodic assessments of  the program\u2019s approach to developing software, done by independent  software development experts, could not only help ensure the reviews are  balanced, but would also help ensure the Space C2 program effectively  addresses the challenges it faces and is situated for success. Such  reviews would also help the Space C2 program to identify potential  roadblocks, and ultimately, potential solutions.
