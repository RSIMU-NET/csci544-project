To reduce spending, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) required that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) phase in, with several rounds of bidding, a large-scale competitive bidding program (CBP) for certain DME and other items. DME suppliers began bidding in round 1 of the CBP on May 15, 2007. After contracts were awarded, the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 (MIPPA), was enacted on July 15, 2008. Because of numerous concerns MIPPA delayed the program, terminated supplier contracts, and required CMS to begin the CBP round 1 rebid in 2009. GAO was asked to report on (1) the results of CBP round 1, (2) the major challenges CMS had in conducting CBP round 1, and (3) the steps CMS has taken to improve future CBP rounds. GAO reviewed CMS data and relevant laws and regulations, and interviewed officials from CMS and its contractors, and DME suppliers and professional associations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["About a quarter of the bids submitted during CBP round 1 resulted in awarded contracts. The contracts were in effect until terminated by MIPPA on July 15, 2008. Of the 6,374 bids submitted by 1,010 suppliers, half were disqualified before competing on price. Bids were most often disqualified for missing financial documentation or noncompliance with accreditation requirements. In nearly two-thirds of CBP round 1's price competitions--in which suppliers submitted bids to deliver items for a specific product category within a specific competitive bidding area (CBA)--the number of suppliers decreased by at least half. The largest decreases in suppliers were in the Miami CBA. CMS estimated that the reduction in Medicare payments for items acquired as a result of CBP round 1 would have averaged 26 percent when compared to payments under the Medicare fee schedule. CBP's round 1 presented several challenges to suppliers, including poor timing and lack of clarity in bid submission information, a failure to inform all suppliers that losing bids could be reviewed, and an inadequate electronic bid submission system. CMS provided some clarifying information about bidding after the bid window opened, repeatedly extended the bid window deadlines, and provided updated guidance to bidders throughout the bid window. The information CMS provided to suppliers about bidding requirements was sometimes unclear and inconsistent, particularly regarding financial documentation. CMS did not effectively notify suppliers of its postbidding review process. Because some suppliers were not aware of the review process, they missed the opportunity to have their disqualified bids reviewed. CMS found that some bids had been incorrectly disqualified. Finally, several problems with the electronic bid submission system, including data losses from automated logouts and unscheduled downtimes, made it difficult for some suppliers to submit bids. CMS has taken several steps to improve the bidding process for the round 1 rebid and subsequent rounds of the CBP. CMS is implementing MIPPA provisions to notify suppliers of missing financial documentation and create a CBP ombudsman. It has reduced financial documentation requirements and revised the request for bid instructions to make it clearer and more understandable. It is also developing a new electronic bidding submission system, the Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supplies bidding system (DBidS), which the agency claims will address the deficiencies of the system used for round 1. Bidding for the round 1 rebid began in late October 2009. The CBP has the potential to produce considerable benefits, including reducing overall Medicare spending for DME and limiting potential fraud through increased scrutiny of suppliers. Although challenges may be expected for any new program, problems occurred in round 1 because of poor communication by CMS and an inadequate bid submission system."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 2007, Medicare\u2014the federal health insurance program that currently  serves about 45 million elderly and disabled individuals\u2014spent $8.3 billion  on durable medical equipment (DME), prosthetics, orthotics, and related  supplies. Both we and the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019s  (HHS) Office of Inspector General have reported that Medicare and its  beneficiaries have sometimes paid higher than market rates for various  medical equipment and supply items. In 1997, Congress required the  Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)\u2014the agency that  administers the Medicare program\u2014to test competitive bidding for  selected DME and other items and services through demonstration  projects. The demonstrations were conducted from 1999 to 2002 and  showed that competitive bidding would save Medicare money.", "Competitive bidding can reduce Medicare payments for DME and close  the disparity with prices paid by others for the same items. The Medicare  Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA)  required that CMS implement a competitive acquisition program for DME  and certain other items. CMS was required to phase in the competitive  bidding program (CBP) in 2007 in 10 competitive bidding areas (CBA).  The CBP would be expanded in future rounds. CBP round 1 began when  the bid window opened May 15, 2007. In May 2008, CMS announced the  final winning suppliers, and contracts with winning suppliers took effect  July 1, 2008.", "Some DME suppliers and trade associations raised concerns about the  CBP round 1, questioning several aspects of CMS\u2019s bid submission and  contract award processes. They also questioned whether some winning  suppliers could provide the volume of items and services their contracts  required and whether contracts should have been awarded to suppliers  that had no prior business presence in a CBA. Two congressional hearings  addressed these concerns in May 2008.", "On July 15, 2008, the CBP round 1 was stopped when the Medicare  Improvements for Patients and Providers Act (MIPPA) of 2008 was  enacted. MIPPA delayed the CBP, terminated the contracts already  awarded by CMS to suppliers in round 1, and required CMS to repeat the  competition for round 1 CBP in 2009\u2014the CBP round 1 rebid. To ensure  budget neutrality, that is to compensate for the loss of the projected  savings from the CBP, beginning January 1, 2009, MIPPA reduced national  Medicare reimbursement payments by 9.5 percent nationally for items and  services that had been included in the CBP round 1. MIPPA also imposed  additional criteria for how CMS should conduct later CBP rounds,  including the round 1 rebid and subsequent rounds that will expand the  CBP to additional areas.", "As CMS prepares to implement the CBP round 1 rebid, you asked us to  report on (1) the results of the CBP round 1, (2) the major challenges CMS  had in conducting the CBP round 1, and (3) the steps CMS has taken to  improve future CBP rounds.", "To determine the results of the CBP round 1, we reviewed data from CMS  and Palmetto GBA\u2014the contractor CMS selected to implement the CBP  bidding and contract award process\u2014about the number of suppliers  participating in round 1 of the CBP process, the number of submitted bids,  and the bids\u2019 outcomes. We interviewed and obtained information from  CMS and Palmetto GBA officials about the Competitive Bid Submission  System (CBSS), an electronic database used by suppliers to submit part of  their bid application, including information about covered system testing  and data processing procedures. We also reviewed the instructions  provided to bidding suppliers about entering data into the CBSS. We  interviewed Palmetto GBA officials about the Competitive Bidding  Evaluation System (CBES), a repository of bid data including financial  data entered by Palmetto GBA personnel and documentation of Palmetto  GBA actions, as well as about the system\u2019s data transfer and data entry  protocols. We compared data published by CMS with the data provided to  us and followed up with the appropriate officials to resolve any  discrepancies. We assessed the reliability of round 1 data by interviewing  or reviewing information from CMS and Palmetto GBA officials and  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this  report. We did not independently evaluate CMS\u2019s estimates of beneficiary  demand, which relied on 2005 and 2006 DME claims data, the most recent  data available to it at the time, nor did we evaluate CMS\u2019s estimates of  projected savings as the result of the CBP round 1.", "To determine the major challenges CMS had conducting the CBP round 1,  we reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and policies concerning  the bidding and contract award processes. We interviewed CMS and  Palmetto GBA officials about the bid submission process, including the  CBSS, the bid evaluation and contract award processes, and the CMS and  Palmetto GBA postbidding review. We reviewed CMS and Palmetto GBA  bid submission instructions and related materials, communications to  suppliers during the bid window, and information on how CMS and  Palmetto GBA evaluated bids and awarded contracts. We also reviewed  information related to the Program Advisory and Oversight Committee  (PAOC), whose members are appointed by the HHS Secretary to advise  CMS on implementing the CBP. We reviewed PAOC meeting materials,  interviewed members about their role and input into the development of  round 1, and attended a committee meeting on June 16, 2008. We also  interviewed national and state DME trade associations and a small number  of randomly selected suppliers about the CBP bidding and contract award  processes.", "To determine the steps that CMS has taken to improve the bidding process  for future CBP rounds, we reviewed applicable CBP provisions in relevant  MIPPA sections and implementing regulations, PAOC Federal Register  notices, and interviewed CMS and Palmetto GBA officials.

Changing the long- standing policy that any qualified provider be allowed to participate in  Medicare, the MMA provided that generally only suppliers who were  awarded contracts could be reimbursed by Medicare for providing covered  Part B items and services in the selected areas. The MMA imposed certain  criteria that CMS was required to follow\u2014for example, eligible suppliers  had to meet quality and financial standards, the total amount to be paid to  contractors was expected to be less than would be paid otherwise, access  of beneficiaries to multiple suppliers in their area must be maintained, and  CMS must consider the ability of suppliers to meet the anticipated needs  of beneficiaries in the covered geographic area. CMS was also required to  ensure that small suppliers would be considered. The MMA required the  establishment of the PAOC to advise CMS on various aspects of the CBP,  including financial and quality standards. The MMA also prohibited any  administrative or judicial review of the designation of CBP\u2019s CBAs, the  selection of items and services, the establishment of payment amounts, the  bidding structure and number of contract suppliers selected, the awarding  of contracts, and the phase-in of the CBP.

CMS established the bidding process and approved policies and  procedures developed by Palmetto GBA. CMS implemented the CBP in 10  CBAs which were among the largest statistical metropolitan areas. CMS  chose the items and services to include in round 1 by focusing on the  highest cost and highest volume items and services with the largest  potential for savings. It selected 10 product categories, with 371 unique  items and services; spending for those product categories in the 10 CBP  CBAs accounted for about 9 percent of total Medicare spending on those  product categories in 2006.

To participate in CBP round 1,  DME suppliers must have met enrollment, quality, and financial standards,  obtained all the state and local licenses required to provide the relevant  services, and been accredited by a CMS-approved accrediting  organization. In addition, bids for each item had to be bona fide\u2014that is,  not higher than the Medicare fee schedule but not lower than the  supplier\u2019s cost.", "Bidder registration. The first step in the CBP bidding process was  bidder registration. Suppliers had to register with a CMS identity  management and authentication system to gain access to the CBSS.  Suppliers registered in the CBSS as one of three types of bidding entities: a  supplier with a single location, multiple suppliers sharing common  ownership or control, or 2-20 small suppliers forming a network.", "Bid submission. For purposes of the CBP, a bid was an offer by a supplier  to furnish all items within a product category throughout the entire CBA.  The bid had to include a proposed price for each item in the product  category. The number of items in a product category ranged from 3 to  142. A bid package consisted of two electronic forms, A and B, and  documents specified in the request-for-bid instructions and in other  communication with suppliers. Hard copies of the documents had to be  submitted to Palmetto GBA. Form A requested information about  suppliers, including Medicare billing numbers, addresses, ownership,  current or prior sanctions, and accreditation status. Each Form B  required suppliers to disclose annual revenues for the product category in  each CBA; estimates of the number of item units currently provided and  that could be provided in the future for that product category in that CBA;  expansion plans; and item prices, models, and manufacturers. Each Form  B constituted one bid\u2014that is, suppliers had to submit a separate form for  each product category in each CBA. Suppliers could submit a Form B for  any product category up for bid in any CBA. Hard-copy documents  required to complete the bid package included financial documents, proof  of accreditation status, letters of intent to enter into agreements with  subcontractors, network agreements, and statements certifying the  accuracy of the submissions. Financial documentation requirements  included 3 years of annual financial statements, selected forms from the  last three annual tax returns, and credit reports and credit scores for a 90- day period ending close to the date of the bid\u2019s submission. (See table 1.)", "Bid review. After the bid window closed, Palmetto GBA began to review  the bids. It determined whether each bid package was complete,  compliant with bidding requirements, and whether the submitting  supplier\u2019s financial score satisfied a minimum threshold to qualify to  compete on price. The financial score was determined using criteria  developed by CMS for this purpose including suppliers\u2019 credit scores and  10 financial measures\u2014described by CMS as standard accounting  measures. (See table 2.) If the bid package was complete, compliant with  bidding requirements, and the submitting supplier had a financial score  that was equal to or greater than the minimum threshold, the bid qualified  to compete on price. But before comparing prices, Palmetto GBA also  reviewed each qualified bid\u2019s capacity projections\u2014the supplier\u2019s ability  to provide the volume of items claimed in the bid in light of the supplier\u2019s  historical capacity, expansion plans, and financial score. It adjusted some  bids\u2019 capacity projections according to certain guidelines.", "Winner Selection. Palmetto GBA used several steps to identify the  winning bids based on price. Item prices submitted by competing suppliers  were compared using a composite pricing methodology. A bid\u2019s composite  price was calculated as each item\u2019s price multiplied by an item weight  summed across all items in the product category. Table 3 illustrates the  calculation for three hypothetical bids\u2019 composite prices in a product  category containing three items. Each weight is based on the item\u2019s share  of units billed to Medicare in 2006 as a percentage of all of the units for the  product category billed to Medicare nationwide that same year.", "For each auction\u2014a competition by qualified suppliers to deliver all items  within a single product category in a single CBA\u2014Palmetto GBA ordered  the bids by composite price from lowest to highest. Starting with the bid  with the lowest composite price, Palmetto GBA calculated the cumulative  projected capacity of the competing bids. Palmetto GBA identified the bid  where cumulative projected capacity met or exceeded CMS\u2019s estimated  beneficiary demand as the pivotal bid (see table 4). In table 4, the pivotal  bid was submitted by Supplier 9 with a composite price of $7.64, since  cumulative supply (1,765 units) reached CMS\u2019s estimated demand (1,500  units) at that bid. If projected beneficiary demand could not be met by  qualified suppliers, a pivotal bid could not be established and the auction  was considered nonviable. Otherwise, bids with composite prices equal  to or less than the pivotal bid were winners on the basis of price.", "Setting Medicare single payment amounts. Bids that won on price  were used to establish Medicare\u2019s single payment amounts for each item in  the auction. For each item, Palmetto GBA ordered these winning bids\u2019  price offers for each item from lowest to highest. The median price offered  for that item would be Medicare\u2019s payment for that auction item in that  CBA. The use of the median in setting the item\u2019s single payment amount  meant that Medicare\u2019s payment amount could be less than or more than a  particular winning supplier\u2019s actual bid for an item. Because CBP  payments may only be paid on assignment, Medicare would pay the  supplier 80 percent of the single payment amount for an item and the  beneficiary would be responsible for the remaining 20 percent.", "Contract offers. In addition to winning on price, small suppliers\u2019 bids  could also win if there were an insufficient number of small suppliers that  won on price alone. Before the initial set of contract offers, Palmetto  GBA determined whether CMS\u2019s target\u2014that 30 percent of the qualified  suppliers be small suppliers\u2014had been met by small suppliers winning on  price. In the auctions where the goal had not been met, Palmetto GBA  moved up the composite pricing order, above the pivotal bid, for small  suppliers only as a means to include additional small suppliers. These  additional small suppliers would then be offered contracts, in addition to  those suppliers whose bids won on price alone. In March 2008, CMS and  Palmetto GBA notified suppliers of the auction results and CMS extended  contract offers to winning suppliers. In May 2008, CMS announced the  suppliers that had accepted contracts for the 3-year CBP contract period  from July 1, 2008, through June 30, 2011.

Specifically, Palmetto GBA and CMS reviewed a total of 1,935  bids from 357 suppliers from March 21, 2008, through July 9, 2008. They  only reviewed the disqualified bids of suppliers who contacted them with  questions or requested a review. As a result of this review, CMS  determined that 10 suppliers had 58 bids incorrectly disqualified; the  agency subsequently offered CBP contracts to 7 of these suppliers for 27  bids.", "CMS did not effectively communicate to suppliers that they had an  opportunity to have disqualified round 1 bids reviewed. CMS officials  informed us that the agency made a decision on or about March 5, 2008, as  part of a quality assurance process, to permit Palmetto GBA to review  disqualified bids after suppliers received their March 20, 2008, letters  notifying them of their disqualifications. After the letters were sent to  suppliers on March 20, 2008, CMS officials told us that suppliers learned  about the bid review opportunity if they contacted Palmetto GBA with  questions about their bids, participated in an April 2008 CMS Open Door  Forum about the CBP program, or attended the June 16, 2008 PAOC  meeting. CMS and Palmetto GBA, however, did not provide any written  notification explaining this review process to suppliers prior to or after  they were informed of their bid disqualifications, and some suppliers were  not aware of this opportunity for review. For example, two suppliers  informed us that they were unaware that a postbidding review was an  option. Another supplier informed us that the company\u2019s bids were  disqualified and when he called Palmetto GBA to follow up, he was  informed that there would be a review and response in 30 days, but he had  not received a response as of March 25, 2009. An additional supplier  informed us that in response to his inquiries, CMS stated that there was no  formal appeal process.", "Moreover, the postbidding review was inconsistent with CMS\u2019s earlier  interpretation of its authority to conduct such reviews. Before soliciting  bids for round 1, the agency determined that it would not have the  authority to review the results of bid evaluations. The MMA prohibited  administrative and judicial review of certain round 1 determinations,  including the awarding of contracts, the bidding structure, and number of  contractors selected. Neither the MMA nor its legislative history defined  the phrase \u201cadministrative review.\u201d In the preamble to the CBP final rule,  however, CMS interpreted this provision as prohibiting review of the  results of bid evaluations. CMS did not explicitly address such a review  or any reversals of bid disqualifications elsewhere in its regulations or  other policy guidance. In the preamble, CMS also recounted that  commenters requested that it establish a grievance and review process for  suppliers. Among other things, commenters also expressed concern  about the potential for errors in disqualifying suppliers and requested that  CMS provide an opportunity for review to confirm the accuracy of these  disqualifications. In response to these comments, CMS indicated that it  did not have the authority to review the outcome of bid evaluations.  Specifically, it cited the prohibition on administrative or judicial review,  explaining that Congress enacted this prohibition to avoid any delay or  disruption in the implementation of the program as a result of challenges  brought by bidders.", "In response to our inquiries during this evaluation, CMS officials informed  us that the postbidding review process was not an administrative review  prohibited by statute, but rather a quality assurance measure. In our view,  CMS\u2019s characterization of the postbidding review process as a quality  assurance measure does not fully address the inconsistency with the  agency\u2019s earlier position that it did not have the authority to conduct such  a review. In the preamble to the CBP final rule, CMS advised that it would  notify losing bidders but would not provide debriefings due to logistics,  volume of bidders, and time constraints. As an alternative, CMS explained  that the agency would conduct an extensive education and outreach  program for suppliers and was developing a quality assurance program.  But the postbidding review process was distinct from the specific quality  assurance steps that CMS described it would take in the preamble to the  CBP final rule. In addition to its own quality assurance system, CMS  indicated that Palmetto GBA would implement a quality assurance  program, but did not elaborate on the form this program would take.  However, the agency\u2019s response to commenters rejected any suggestion of  a postbidding review citing prohibitions under federal law. CMS officials  have since informed us that the language in the CBP final rule was  ambiguous, thereby not precluding it from conducting the postbidding  review to be considered a quality assurance measure. Even if that were the  case, CMS did not provide any clarifying guidance to suppliers that  explicitly informed disqualified suppliers of the opportunity for a  postbidding review. Instead CMS made its March 5, 2008, decision to  conduct these reviews about 2 weeks before suppliers were mailed notice  of their bid disqualifications.

For this reason, a CMS official announced  at the June 4, 2009, PAOC meeting that the agency is now considering  whether to apply a different standard to evaluate the capacity of suppliers  new to a DME product category. CMS later explained the new proposal to  us. For the CBP, all suppliers, both new and experienced, estimate the  number of items they can provide to meet the projected demand of  beneficiaries for a product category in a CBA. Currently, a supplier must  meet a minimum threshold based on CMS\u2019s determination of its financial  strength in order for CMS to continue to evaluate its bid. If a supplier  meets that threshold, it is then evaluated against a second threshold to  determine whether CMS will accept the supplier\u2019s estimate of its ability to  expand its current capacity. CMS is proposing that the second threshold  be higher for suppliers new to a product category than for experienced  suppliers. According to a CMS official, new suppliers that did not meet the  second higher threshold could still be offered a contract, although the  proposal would generally result in awarding more contracts to suppliers  with experience.", "Suppliers participating in the round 1 rebid must have all local and state  licenses for a product category in a CBA at the time of bid submission in  order to be considered for a CBP contract. According to CMS, this is not a  change from CBP round 1. However, there were issues during the first  round that complicated licensure verification. CMS and Palmetto GBA  acknowledged and some trade association representatives told us that  some suppliers were offered CBP contracts during CBP round 1 for  product categories for which they were not properly licensed. Therefore,  for the round 1 rebid, CMS has further clarified the licensure requirement,  stating that suppliers must be licensed for the product category in the CBA  in which they are bidding and if a CBA covers more than one state, the  supplier needs to obtain applicable licensure in all states.

CMS was aware of these problems as the bidding  unfolded and extended the original bid window as it attempted to correct  them. The agency worked to address these problems before the round 1  rebid began.", "DBidS, the new electronic bid submission system developed by CMS and  Maricom, could be an improvement if it successfully addresses the  deficiencies identified in the system used for round 1 as CMS claims it will.  CMS\u2019s implementation of the MIPPA requirement that the agency provide  feedback on the status of suppliers\u2019 financial documentation may help  reduce the number of bids disqualified for inadequate financial  documentation. And the agency\u2019s implementation of the statutory  requirements that all suppliers, including subcontractors, provide evidence  of accreditation by October 1, 2009, and that suppliers generally must post  surety bonds may help ensure that only legitimate suppliers are enrolled in  Medicare and therefore are eligible to bid. To address the concerns that  suppliers have the experience to provide the DME items they win  contracts for, before they can submit bids, suppliers will also have to be  accredited and licensed for each DME product category and CBA in which  they bid.

We reviewed the Competitive Bid  Submission System (CBSS) User Guide, and instructions for entering data.  We interviewed and obtained information from officials from CMS and  Palmetto GBA about the CBSS, including system testing and data  processing. We asked Palmetto GBA officials about data transfers from the  CBSS to the Competitive Bidding Evaluation System (CBES), an  application designed by Palmetto GBA to automate specific portions of the  bid evaluation process that contained bid data, financial data entered by  Palmetto GBA personnel, and documentation of Palmetto GBA actions.  We asked them about CBES data checks, quality control, data entry  procedures, and security. We interviewed CMS officials about the criteria  and procedures for disqualifying bids, identifying winning bids, and  calculating single payment amounts. We reviewed information CMS  provided to the Program Advisory and Oversight Committee (PAOC) about  this process and its results. We compared data published by CMS with the  data provided to us and followed up with the appropriate officials to  resolve discrepancies. We assessed the reliability of round 1 data by  reviewing information from or interviewing CMS and Palmetto GBA  officials and determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of this report. We did not evaluate the reliability of CMS  estimates of beneficiary demand for durable medical equipment (DME)  which relied on 2005 and 2006 DME claims data, the most recent data  available to them at the time, nor did we evaluate CMS\u2019s estimates of  projected savings as the result of round 1.", "To determine the major challenges CMS had in conducting CBP round 1,  we interviewed CMS and Palmetto GBA officials and reviewed information  provided to suppliers, including CBP bid submission instructions and  related materials, bidder conference call transcripts, and CMS\u2019s and  Palmetto GBA\u2019s CBP Web sites. We reviewed these materials for  inconsistencies. We also reviewed an internal document provided by  Palmetto GBA about its implementation of the CBP round 1. We  interviewed two PAOC members concerning whether CMS used the PAOC  effectively and to gain insight about the committee\u2019s role in advising CMS  about the implementation of the CBP and establishing standards for  suppliers that bid in round 1. We reviewed transcripts and meeting  summaries of the seven PAOC meetings to assess the concerns and  feedback that the members provided about potential supplier issues and  challenges. We also interviewed CMS and Palmetto GBA officials and  reviewed documentation about CBSS\u2019s operational problems.", "We interviewed 12 suppliers about their experiences with CBP. We  interviewed 4 suppliers that were not offered a contract, 4 suppliers that  accepted a CBP contract, and 4 suppliers that rejected their CBP contract  offer. The suppliers were randomly selected from CMS\u2019s list of suppliers  that bid in CBP round 1. Because we interviewed a small number of  suppliers, our findings from these interviews are not generalizable to all  suppliers. In addition, we interviewed representatives from national and  state industry trade associations representing DME suppliers\u2014the  American Association for Homecare, the National Association of  Independent Medical Equipment Suppliers, the Florida Association of  Medical Equipment Services, and the Ohio Association of Medical  Equipment Services. We also reviewed testimony from three congressional  hearings including two 2008 hearings about the CBP implementation and  a 2009 congressional hearing on the CBP\u2019s impact on small business, in  which a CMS official discussed the results of CBP round 1, and six  representatives of various DME associations and interest groups discussed  the effect that the CBP had on their businesses and professions.", "To analyze the postbidding review authorized by CMS and conducted by  Palmetto GBA, we interviewed CMS and Palmetto GBA officials about the  development and implementation of the review process and reviewed its  results. We also reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations and  interviewed CMS officials and attorneys representing the Department of  Health and Human Services (HHS), CMS division.", "To determine the steps that CMS has taken to improve the bidding process  for future CBP rounds, we reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations,  PAOC Federal Register notices, and CMS press releases related to the  PAOC. We interviewed CMS and Palmetto GBA officials about the actions  they have taken and intend to take to improve the CBP bidding process  during the CBP round 1 rebid. We also attended the June 4, 2009, PAOC  meeting at which CMS provided updates of the process changes and  modifications that it made for the round 1 rebid.", "In addition, we interviewed Maricom officials and reviewed available  documentation related to the development, testing, and proposed  implementation of the new electronic bid submission system\u2014Durable  Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supplies bidding system  (DBidS)\u2014that will be used during the CBP round 1 rebid. We did not  assess the reliability or functionality of DBidS, but we reviewed the  processes established by CMS and its contractors for testing and accepting  such systems.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2008 to September 2009  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

According to the CMS, the savings rate was derived by multiplying the difference between the 2008  Medicare fee schedule for each item in a product category in a CBA and the item\u2019s CBP-derived  single payment amount by the same weights used to calculate composite prices for the product  category.
