The Subcommittee noted that spending at year-end may be the result of legitimate, planned, and worthwhile spending intended by Congress. However, the Subcommittee found numerous examples in which agencies took short cuts in the last few weeks of the fiscal year that led to questionable contracts. Hurry-up procurement practices resulted in the purchase of millions of dollars worth of goods and services for which there was no demonstrated current need. The Subcommittee found that to spend quickly, the government frequently paid inflated prices, incurred higher administrative costs for overtime, and awarded contracts that were not in the government\u2019s best financial interest. At the time the Subcommittee issued its 1980 report, civilian and defense agencies operated under separate procurement systems with different authorities and regulations. Agencies were expected to use competition to the maximum extent practicable, but there was no statutory requirement for the justification and approval of sole-source contracts.", "Our prior work on year-end spending has shown that problems occurred in the past when budget execution was not monitored effectively. Periodically, Congress has asked that we review and report on agencies\u2019 rates of obligations. A continuing theme of these earlier reports was the questionable quality of the data reported to Treasury and OMB. In our earlier work, we used data published in the quarterly Treasury Bulletin, which was aggregated by department, agency, and object classification, that is, by items of expense. The source of this information was Treasury\u2019s Financial Management Service (FMS) Standard Form (SF) 225 - Report on Obligations. In December 1995, according to Treasury officials, the reporting requirement and the resulting data published in the Treasury Bulletin were eliminated to reduce the reporting burden on agencies.", "OMB continues to require that agencies report their quarterly obligations on the SF 133 - Report of Budget Execution (SF 133), approximately 20 days after the close of each calendar quarter. Unlike the SF 225, obligations are not shown by object classification. Agencies are also expected to reconcile their year-end SF 133 report with comparable data provided to the Department of the Treasury on the FMS 2108 - Year-End Closing Statement (FMS 2108) and the SF 224 -Statement of Transactions (SF 224).

Correspondingly, funding for agency operating expenses, e.g., costs for federal personnel, equipment, supplies, printing, and contractual services, continues to decline as a share of total spending. As illustrated in figure 1, funding for agency operations has decreased from 48 percent of total gross obligations in fiscal year 1981 to 31 percent in fiscal year 1997.", "Deficit reduction legislation reinforced this trend by placing annual limitations on the one-third of federal spending that is controlled through the appropriations process\u2014and that includes most government day-to-day operations. At the same time, appropriators have made funds available for more than 1 year. Today, approximately two-thirds of budget accounts on an annual appropriations cycle have some funds available for more than 1 year or available until spent without fiscal year limitation.", "Agencies have been able to extend some contracts across fiscal years even though their funding is appropriated annually. Recently, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998 broadened the authority of the Department of Defense (DOD) to obligate appropriated funds for severable service contracts that cross fiscal years if the contract periods do not exceed 1 year.

Since the problems associated with wasteful year-end spending\u2014poor planning, insufficient competition, and inadequate contract oversight\u2014can occur at any time during the fiscal year, we have included the following summary of our findings regarding high-risk agencies based on our work. We also include some related examples drawn from our reviews of IGs\u2019 reports.", "We have identified contract management as a high-risk area at DOD, Energy, NASA, and EPA and noted long-standing problems with their contract payment and oversight functions. For example, as noted in our 1997 High-Risk Series, we found that in recent years, DOD experienced numerous problems in making accurate payments to defense contractors. We noted that while DOD had taken steps to address its payment problems, it should also (1) improve and simplify its contract payment system and (2) further strengthen its oversight of contractor cost-estimating systems. Doing so would enable DOD to achieve effective control over contract expenditures. The DOD IG also found examples of overpayment or unreasonable pricing. In fiscal year 1996, the DOD IG reported that overpayments of $43.6 million were made to a contractor because requests for progress payments had not been prepared properly. In another case, the IG found that various defense construction and supply centers had paid $15.8 million more than they should have on 63 procurements of spare parts.", "We also designated Energy\u2019s contract management as high risk because its extensive reliance on contracting and history of inadequate oversight of contractors failed to protect the federal government\u2019s financial interests. In our 1997 High-Risk Series, we reported that Energy had made progress in developing an extensive array of policies and procedures, such as publishing a new regulation adopting a standard of full and open competition for the award of its management and operating contracts. We concluded that the department would need to continually monitor the award of these contracts to maintain its momentum and priority in implementing contract reform. During 1997 and 1998, the Energy IG reported on problems with the performance-based incentives for fiscal years 1995 and 1996 at four sites. They ranged from incentive payments in excess of the cost of labor and materials for the work performed to the award of incentive fees for work either not completed or for work done prior to establishing the incentive program. In addition, the IG for Energy reported during 1997 on its assessment of the implementation of performance-based incentive contracts. In its report, Energy\u2019s IG raised concerns about insufficient formal guidance for developing and administering performance incentives and the lack of criteria for measuring performance or allocating fees.", "EPA has had long-standing problems in controlling contractors\u2019 charges, particularly in its Superfund program. In fact, we have repeatedly reported that EPA has not overseen its cost-reimbursable contracts to prevent contractors from overcharging the government. We also found that although EPA had recently strengthened its management and oversight of Superfund contractors, the agency remained too dependent upon contractors\u2019 own cost proposals to establish the price of cost reimbursable work. Thus, we suggested that EPA could better estimate the costs of contractors\u2019 work, use the estimates to negotiate reasonable costs, provide contractors with appropriate incentives to hold down their administrative expenses, and increase the timeliness of contract audits.", "Although NASA has improved its contract and procurement operations by placing greater emphasis on contract cost control and contractor performance, we and NASA\u2019s IG continue to identify problems in NASA\u2019s contract management and opportunities to improve procurement oversight. For example, NASA\u2019s IG concluded that one NASA-negotiated contract included $22.7 million in financing, insurance interest, and termination liability insurance costs that are generally prohibited under Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR). In 1997, we suggested that NASA identify its contract management problems early on so they could be evaluated, monitored, and corrected before becoming systemic. We also suggested that additional agencywide guidance could help NASA ensure more consistent and thorough coverage of the procurement cycle. While recent reforms have allowed agencies the option of making small purchases by credit card, a NASA IG survey report entitled NASA Procurement Initiatives, Credit Card Program found that NASA split a $168,000 computer procurement into 80 single purchases, enabling each purchase to fall below the Government Credit Card limit of $2,500. The IG concluded that NASA violated the FAR prohibition against splitting requirements. Similar problems were reported by IGs at Commerce, Energy, and Transportation.", "Only one of the IG reports we reviewed explicitly identified a relationship between poor contracting practices and the need to spend funds quickly.
