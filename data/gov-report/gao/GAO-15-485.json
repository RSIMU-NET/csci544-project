According to a representative of the committee, the committee considers  the violations and recommendations and makes sanctions designations  based on the consensus of committee members.

If the decision is affirmative, it takes  action by making sanctions designations mostly through new resolutions.  This process has resulted in 32 designations since 2006. All but one of  these designations were made through new resolutions, according to a  USUN official.

The panel\u2019s 2014 final report described  North Korea\u2019s attempt to illicitly transport arms and related materiel from  Cuba to North Korea concealed underneath thousands of bags of sugar  onboard the North Korean vessel Chong Chon Gang. North Korea\u2019s use  of evasive techniques in this case was blocked by actions taken by  Panama, a UN member state. Panamanian authorities stopped and  examined the Chong Chon Gang vessel as it passed through Panama\u2019s  jurisdiction. After uncovering items on the vessel that it believed to be  arms and related materiel, Panama alerted the committee of the possible  UN sanctions violation. According to representatives of the committee,  Panama cooperated with the panel as it conducted its investigation. The  panel concluded that the shipment was in violation of UN sanctions and  that it constituted the largest amount of arms and related materiel  interdicted to North Korea since the adoption of UNSCR 1718. The  committee placed the shipping company that operated the Chong Chon  Gang on its sanctioned entities list.", "The panel\u2019s investigations have also uncovered evidence of North  Korea\u2019s efforts to evade sanctions by routing financial transactions in  support of North Korea\u2019s procurement of sanctioned goods through  intermediaries, including those in China, Malaysia, Singapore, and  Thailand. For instance, in its investigation of the Chong Chon Gang case,  the panel found that the vessel operator, North Korea\u2019s Ocean Maritime  Management Company, Limited, used foreign intermediaries in Hong  Kong, Thailand, and Singapore to conduct financial transactions on its  behalf. The panel also identified that in most cases the investigated  transactions were made in United States dollars from foreign-based  banks and transferred through corresponding bank accounts in the United  States. The panel\u2019s 2015 final report indicated that North Korea has  successfully bypassed banking organizations\u2019 due diligence processes by  initiating transactions through other entities on its behalf.

The panel notes that the lack of detailed information in implementation  reports impedes its ability to examine and analyze information regarding  member state implementation and its challenges. It also states that  member state underreporting increases North Korea\u2019s opportunities to  continue its prohibited activities.

For instance, representatives of the committee told us  that some member states may have weak customs and border patrol  systems or export control regulatory structures because of the high  resource requirements of these programs. In addition, representatives of  the committee stated that some member states may lack awareness of  the full scope of North Korea sanctions or may not understand how to  implement the sanctions. Moreover, some countries may not make the  sanctions a high priority because they believe they are not directly  affected by North Korea. In addition, member states that are  geographically distant from North Korea or lack a diplomatic or trade  relationship with it may not see the need to implement the sanctions,  according to representatives of the committee.", "The UN has taken some steps to address this impediment.
