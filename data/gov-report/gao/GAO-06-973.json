Other stakeholders, including FAA, state that under the current system there is a disconnect between revenues contributed by users and the costs they impose on the NAS that raises revenue adequacy, equity, and efficiency concerns. Trends and FAA projections in both inflation-adjusted fares and average plane size suggest that the revenue collected under the current funding system has fallen and will continue to fall relative to FAA's workload and costs, supporting revenue adequacy concerns. Comparisons of revenue contributed and costs imposed by different flights provide support for equity and efficiency concerns. The extent to which revenues and costs are linked, however, depends critically on how costs are allocated. Thus, to assess the extent to which the current approach or other approaches aligns costs with revenues would require completing an analysis of costs, using either a cost accounting system or cost finding techniques to assign costs to NAS users. The implications of adopting alternative funding options to collect revenue from NAS users and address concerns about the current excise tax system vary depending on the extent to which users' revenue contributions reflect the costs those users impose on FAA. This report considers six selected funding options, including two that modify the current excise tax structure and four that adopt more direct charges to users. Given the diverse nature of FAA's activities, a combination of alternative options may offer the most promise for linking revenues and costs. Switching to any alternative funding option would raise administrative and transition issues. Some stakeholders who support the adoption of direct user charges also support a change in FAA's governance structure, but GAO found no evidence adoption of direct charges requires this. Authorizing FAA to use debt financing for capital projects would have advantages and disadvantages. Some stakeholders identify debt financing as attractive because it could provide FAA with a stable source of revenue to fund capital developments, while at the same time spreading the costs out over the life of a capital project as its benefits are realized. Debt financing raises significant concerns, however, because it encumbers future resources, and expenditures from debt proceeds may not be subject to the congressional oversight that appropriations receive. Concerns regarding borrowing costs, oversight, and encumbering future resources are particularly important in light of the federal government's long-term structural fiscal imbalance. The Departments of Transportation and Treasury provided comments and technical clarifications on a draft of this report which we have incorporated or responded to as appropriate. DOT's comments focused on governance reforms required to adopt a user fee approach, and whether we accurately described the status of FAA's accounting system. Treasury's raised concerns about the level of analytical development for the options and associated issues. Data was not available to conduct the analysis Treasury suggested, and we agree necessary. However, we believe the report provides useful information to facilitate debate on the options."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the Airport and Airway Trust  Fund (Trust Fund), and the excise taxes that support the Trust Fund are  scheduled for reauthorization at the end of fiscal year 2007.

The  Trust Fund\u2019s uncommitted balance decreased by more than 70 percent  from the end of fiscal year 2001 through the end of fiscal year 2005. These  excise taxes apply to purchases of airline tickets and aviation fuel, as well  as the shipment of cargo. FAA\u2019s remaining funding comes from the  General Fund of the U.S. Treasury (General Fund) (18 percent). The policy  debate over the reauthorization of FAA, the Trust Fund, and the excise  taxes that fund it encompasses a host of critical and complex issues,  including the modernization of the nation\u2019s air traffic control (ATC)  infrastructure and FAA\u2019s efforts to improve cost control and internal  management practices. The agency\u2019s reliance on revenues from both users  and the General Fund recognizes that FAA produces direct benefits for  NAS users and substantial public benefits, including safety, security, and  economic benefits. Stakeholders we talked with all agreed that these  public benefits justify a continued General Fund contribution to FAA\u2019s  budget. However, a key issue raised in the debate over FAA funding, and  the focus of this report, is how the revenues generated from users of the  NAS might be collected. Stakeholders are divided over whether Congress  should continue to rely on the current excise tax structure or adopt an  alternative structure to collect the funding contributed by users.", "You requested that we examine FAA\u2019s current funding system and  alternative funding options.

(2) What  are the implications of adopting alternative funding options to collect the  revenues contributed by users that fund FAA\u2019s budget? (3) What are the  advantages and disadvantages of authorizing FAA to use debt financing for  capital projects?", "To answer these questions, we reviewed relevant economic literature,  policy analysis, congressional testimony, industry group publications, and  stakeholders\u2019 responses to questions FAA asked them about its funding  and alternative options. We also interviewed key stakeholders, including  officials from FAA, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the  Congressional Budget Office (CBO), and the Department of the Treasury  (Treasury); representatives of aviation industry groups; and academic and  financial experts. In addition, we examined FAA budget data, Trust Fund  revenue data, FAA forecasts, and aviation activity data. We reviewed the  reliability of these data and concluded that they were sufficiently reliable  for our purposes. We conducted our work from May 2005 through August  of 2006 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Details of our scope and methodology are provided in appendix  1."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["FAA engages in three primary activities: aviation safety oversight, ATC,  and airport infrastructure development (see fig. 1). The costs associated  with each of these activities generally depend on the nature and usage of  the specific service FAA provides. FAA safety activities include the  licensing of pilots and mechanics, as well as the inspection of various  aspects of the aviation system, such as aircraft and airline operations.  According to FAA, the costs associated with these safety activities are  primarily driven by the volume of each (e.g., the number of licenses and  inspections).", "ATC includes a variety of complex activities that guide and control the  flow of aircraft through the NAS. Generally, commercial aircraft fly under  instrument flight rules (IFR) that require ATC services throughout a flight.  Such flights rely on FAA staff in control towers to guide them from the  terminal to the runway, and through takeoff. Once in the air and beyond  the immediate vicinity of the airport, they rely on terminal radar approach  control centers (TRACONs) to guide them out of the airspace in a broader  area surrounding the airport. Services provided by control towers and  TRACONs are referred to as terminal services. The TRACONs then pass  flights off to air route traffic control centers (ARTCC), which provide en-  route control until the flights near their destinations; services provided by  ARTCCs are referred to as en-route services. When a flight nears its  destination, control is passed back to a TRACON, and then to tower  guidance, to land and proceed to an airport gate. General aviation\u2019s (GA)  use of these services varies greatly. Nearly all business jet flights file flight  plans for IFR services, as do roughly half of GA piston flights. Many GA  flights operate entirely under visual flight rules (VFR) and may not require  any ATC services at all if they do not fly to airports that have towers.  These other GA flights may require ground control, or rely on beacons or  flight service stations en route. FAA states that the costs imposed by each  flight are influenced by the amount and nature of the specific services it  uses, and by whether the flight operates at peak periods.", "FAA funds airport infrastructure development through the Airport  Improvement Program (AIP). AIP is a multibillion-dollar grant program  that provides funding for the airports included in FAA\u2019s National Plan of  Integrated Airport Systems, which includes airports that range from the  largest commercial service airports in the United States to small GA  airports. Unlike safety and ATC services, AIP expenditures are not the  direct result of costs imposed by users of the NAS. FAA distributes AIP  funding based on congressional priorities established in authorizing and  appropriation legislation. Accordingly, apart from some relatively small  administrative expenses, FAA\u2019s spending for AIP does not represent a  \u201ccost\u201d of providing services to users. Therefore, it is not possible to  establish a direct link between AIP expenditures and taxes or charges paid  by system users based on their use of FAA services."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FAA Funding", "paragraphs": ["The Trust Fund was established by the Airport and Airway Revenue Act of  1970 (P.L. 91-258) to help fund the development of a nationwide airport  and airway system. The Trust Fund provides funding for FAA\u2019s two capital  accounts, AIP and the Facilities and Equipment account, which funds  technological improvements to the ATC system. The Trust Fund also  provides funding for the Research, Engineering, and Development  account, which funds continued research on aviation safety, mobility, and  environmental issues. In addition, the Trust Fund supports part of FAA\u2019s  operations.", "To fund these accounts, the Trust Fund is credited with revenues collected  from system users through the following dedicated excise taxes:    7.5 percent ticket tax on domestic airline tickets    $3.30 domestic passenger segment tax (excluding flights to or from rural  airports)   6.25 percent tax on the price paid for transportation of domestic cargo or    $0.043/gallon tax on domestic commercial aviation fuel    $0.193/gallon tax on domestic GA gasoline    $0.218/gallon tax on domestic GA jet fuel    $14.50/person tax on international arrivals and departures, indexed to    7.5 percent tax on mileage awards (frequent flyer awards tax)    $7.30 per passenger tax on flights between the continental United States  and Alaska or Hawaii (or between Alaska and Hawaii), indexed to  inflation Trust Fund revenues totaled $10.7 billion in fiscal year 2005. The ticket tax  was the largest single source of Trust Fund revenue in fiscal year 2005,  totaling about $5.2 billion, or about 48 percent of all Trust Fund receipts.  The passenger ticket tax was followed by the passenger segment tax and  the international departure/arrival taxes, which each totaled about $1.9  billion; fuel taxes, which totaled $870 million; the cargo/mail tax, which  totaled $461 million; and interest income, which totaled $430 million.  Figure 2 shows the shares received  from each source in fiscal year 2005.", "Since the Trust Fund\u2019s creation in 1970, revenues have, in aggregate,  exceeded spending commitments, resulting in a surplus or an  uncommitted balance, although expenditures from the Trust Fund  exceeded revenues in 2005. The Trust Fund\u2019s uncommitted balance,  which was about $1.9 billion at the end of fiscal year 2005, depends on the  revenues flowing into the fund and the appropriations made available from  the fund for various spending accounts. Policy choices, structural changes  in the aviation industry, and external events have affected revenues  flowing into and out of the fund. For example, the uncommitted balance  has been declining in recent years because Trust Fund revenues for the  last 5 years have been less than FAA\u2019s forecasted levels. Figure 3 shows  the fluctuations in the Trust Fund\u2019s uncommitted balance since its  inception.", "In addition to Trust Fund revenues, in most years General Fund revenues  have been used to fund FAA. The General Fund contribution has varied  greatly, ranging from 0 percent to 59 percent of FAA\u2019s budget (see fig. 4).  From fiscal year 1997, the year when existing Trust Fund excise taxes  were authorized, through fiscal year 2006, the General Fund contribution  has averaged 20 percent of FAA\u2019s total budget. About $2.6 billion was  appropriated for fiscal year 2006 from the General Fund for FAA\u2019s  operations.

According to these stakeholders, the revenues collected from users under  the current funding system, along with General Fund revenues provided by  Congress, have been sufficient for the United States to develop a safe and  efficient aviation system. As the number of air travelers grew, so did  revenues going into the Trust Fund. Even though revenues fell during the  early years of this decade as the demand for air travel fell, they began to  rise again in fiscal year 2004 (see fig. 5); FAA estimates that revenues will  continue to increase. In addition, these stakeholders state that  administrative costs of the current system are relatively low.", "Another argument put forward by some industry stakeholders and analysts  for maintaining the current funding structure is that this structure provides  a reasonable allocation of the funding burden between commercial  aviation and GA. With the current funding structure, system users who are  subject to the commercial taxes\u2014including commercial airlines, air taxis,  and many fractional ownership operations\u2014contribute about 97 percent  of the tax revenue that accrues to the Trust Fund. The remaining GA  operators, including those who operate purely private corporate and  individual aircraft, contribute about 3 percent. Representatives of the GA  segment of the industry contend that collecting the bulk of the user- contributed revenues from the commercial segment is appropriate  because the ATC system exists at its current size to accommodate the  demands of commercial aviation and GA users should not be asked to  contribute more than the incremental costs that result from also providing  services to GA aircraft. Although the incremental costs are not precisely  known, GA representatives have told us that they believe that the revenues  currently collected from fuel taxes are a rough approximation of the  incremental costs that FAA incurs from providing services to GA aircraft.  According to FAA, all cost studies to date concluded that GA users pay  less than the costs they impose on the system, while commercial aviation  users pay more than the costs they impose on the system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Disconnect between Trust Fund Revenues and FAA Costs Raises Concerns That Revenues Will Not Keep Pace with Workload Increases under the Current System", "paragraphs": ["The disconnect between sources of Trust Fund revenues and FAA costs  under the current funding system raises concerns that the current system  will not produce adequate revenue in the future to keep pace with FAA\u2019s  workload increases and, consequently, FAA\u2019s costs. The principle of  revenue adequacy requires a funding system to produce revenues  commensurate with workload changes over time. However, under FAA\u2019s  current funding system, increases in FAA\u2019s workload will not necessarily  be accompanied by revenue increases because users are not directly  charged for the costs they impose on FAA from their use of the NAS.  Rather, Trust Fund revenues are primarily dependent on the prices of  tickets (the domestic ticket tax) and the number of passengers on a plane  (the domestic ticket tax, the domestic passenger segment tax, and the  international passenger tax); neither of these factors are directly related to  workload, which is driven by flight control and safety activities. Long-term  industry trends and FAA forecasts of declines in air fares and the growing  use of smaller aircraft support revenue adequacy concerns.", "To illustrate the disconnect between revenues and costs, table 1 provides  an example of revenues generated by different aircraft making similar  flights. The use of multiple flights by smaller aircraft to carry the same  number of travelers as one larger aircraft increases FAA\u2019s workload, but  will not necessarily be accompanied by increased revenues from system  users to fund FAA\u2019s additional costs associated with the workload  increase. This example shows the taxes that would be generated from  transporting 105 passengers from Los Angeles to San Francisco by (1) one  flight using a common narrow-body jet (Boeing 737), and (2) three flights  using a common regional jet (CRJ-200). In this case, the narrow-body jet  has the capacity to carry 132 passengers, while each regional jet has the  capacity to carry 48 passengers.", "As the table shows, differences in FAA\u2019s workload are not reflected in  revenues. FAA states, all other factors being equal (e.g., time of flight), that  the total ATC costs of the three regional jet flights would be about three  times the cost of one narrow-body flight. Revenues from the three regional  jet flights, however, total only about $37, or 3 percent, more than the  revenue generated by the one narrow-body jet flight. Revenue increases  are not linked to cost increases because, under the current system,  revenues are primarily influenced by the number of passengers, the  average price of tickets, and the amount of fuel used\u2014not the costs  imposed on FAA through the use of its services.", "The disconnect between revenues and workload can work both ways;  increases in the number of passengers on planes (e.g., larger planes or  higher load factors) or increases in fares can result in higher revenues  relative to workload. In fact, load factors have increased over the past  several years, and fares have increased over the past year. However, long- term trends and FAA\u2019s projections for both domestic fares and plane size  suggest that Trust Fund revenues have declined relative to FAA\u2019s  workload and will likely continue to do so for the next several years.", "Trends in average fares suggest that the Trust Fund is collecting less  revenue relative to workload than in the past, and FAA\u2019s projections  suggest that this decline will continue. Since the passenger ticket tax is a  percentage of the ticket price, reductions in the average ticket price result  in lower ticket tax revenues relative to FAA\u2019s workload. Domestic airfares,  adjusted for inflation, have steadily declined over the past 25 years, from  an average of $233 in 1981 to $148 in 2005 (see fig. 6). This reduction  represents an average decline of about 1.9 percent per year. Even though  there have been increases in fares over the past year, FAA projects  average fares will continue to decline over time. In FAA\u2019s most recent  forecast, inflation-adjusted domestic yields\u2014a proxy measure for fares\u2014 are projected to decline approximately 8.5 percent over the next 10 years.", "Trends in the average size of airplanes also suggest that the Trust Fund is  collecting less revenue relative to workload than in the past, and FAA\u2019s  projections suggest that this decline will continue (see fig. 7). Since  smaller planes carry fewer passengers and burn less fuel, reductions in  average plane size mean lower ticket tax, segment tax, and fuel tax  revenue accrues to the Trust Fund relative to FAA\u2019s workload.", "This decline in the average number of seats per aircraft is the result of  airlines\u2019 moving toward a substantially greater reliance on regional and  narrow-body jets. Scheduled capacity (available seat miles) increased 29  percent from 1996 through 2005. During this time, wide-body jet capacity  fell 42 percent, narrow-body jet capacity grew 35 percent, and regional jet  capacity grew over 2900 percent. As a result, regional jets accounted for  nearly 10 percent of scheduled capacity in 2005, up from less than 1  percent in 1995. In addition to projecting growth in commercial flights,  FAA is projecting substantial growth in GA traffic, which will also add to  FAA\u2019s workload."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Stakeholders Have Raised Equity Concerns with the Current Funding System", "paragraphs": ["Some aviation stakeholders have expressed concerns that the current  approach to collecting funds from users through excise taxes creates  inequities because the revenue contributions of different flights are not  directly linked to the costs of the services that these flights receive from  FAA. As noted, factors that influence the revenue contribution that a  commercial flight makes to the Trust Fund are the number of passengers,  the average price of tickets, and the amount of fuel used. None of these  factors, however, are directly related to the cost of the ATC services that a  flight receives from FAA. Table 2 shows FAA\u2019s estimates of the revenue  contributions made by various flights. Since FAA estimates that similar  flights impose similar costs on the agency, the substantial differences in  the revenue contributions of these flights raise issues of fairness. One  equity issue is that similar commercial flights may contribute very  different amounts of revenue. As shown in this example, a 767 flight  contributes more than twice as much as two similar 737 flights. There is  also a difference between the contributions for the two similar 737 flights;  one flight contributes 14 percent more than the other flight.", "Concerns also exist about the fairness of the distribution of the funding  burden between commercial airlines and GA operators. Domestic  commercial passenger flights, and some flights typically considered GA  flights that carry commercial passengers, are subject to, among other  potential excise taxes, the passenger ticket tax, the passenger segment  tax, the cargo/mail tax, and the fuel tax. GA flights (excluding those that  carry commercial passengers) are subject only to a fuel tax. As a result,  the revenue contributions of similar commercial and GA flights may be  substantially different. For example, the taxes that the Trust Fund would  receive from two different types of business jet flights would be  substantially less than the taxes received from similar commercial flights  (see table 2).", "Although the commercial and GA flights might receive the same services  from FAA, raising equity concerns because of the large difference in  revenue contribution, there is debate over whether GA and commercial  flights should be assigned the same costs for similar flights because  parties disagree on how to assign the fixed costs associated with the ATC  system. Representatives of the commercial aviation industry favor  assigning those costs to all system users in proportion to their use of the  system. Representatives of GA, on the other hand, state that the system  exists at its present size to serve the needs of the commercial aviation  industry and that GA should be assigned only the incremental costs of  serving GA (i.e., those costs that would not otherwise exist). Without a  consensus on how to assign ATC costs to users, it is not possible to assess  the extent to which the current approach or any other results in a  distribution of the funding burden between commercial airlines and GA  operators that approximates the distribution of costs attributable to those  groups."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Current Funding System Lacks Strong Incentives to Encourage Efficient Use of the NAS", "paragraphs": ["Some stakeholders have also raised concerns that the current funding  system does not provide aircraft operators with incentives to use FAA  services in the most efficient manner. For users to make efficient  decisions about their use of the NAS, their price for using the system (the  taxes or charges they pay) should accurately reflect the costs their use  imposes on the system. These prices, along with other factors influencing  supply and demand, will influence users\u2019 decisions about the type, size,  and number of aircraft to operate, and when and where to operate them.", "Given the importance of some of these other factors to users\u2019 decisions  about using the NAS, the influence of prices charged for FAA\u2019s services on  these decisions may be comparatively small for some users.", "As discussed previously, FAA states that under the current funding system  the taxes collected from users do not accurately reflect the costs those  users impose on the system; some flights likely pay more than the costs  they impose, while others likely pay less. These price differences suggest  that the current funding structure creates incentives for inefficient use of  the NAS. Users who pay more in taxes than the costs they impose may  make less than optimal use of the system, while those who pay less than  the costs they impose may make more than optimal use of the system.", "An airline\u2019s decision about how many flights to offer in a given market  illustrates how the current system does not provide incentives for efficient  use of the system. In this example (the same one used for the revenue  adequacy discussion), an airline is deciding how many daily flights it  should provide for the Los Angeles to San Francisco market (see table 3).  It estimates that the market demand at the fare it is charging totals 105  passengers per day, and it faces the choice of providing the market with  one daily flight with a narrow-body jet (Boeing 737), or three daily flights  with a regional jet (CRJ-200)\u2014all flight choices are assumed to depart  during peak periods. In this scenario, the revenue collected from the three  regional jet flights\u2014$1,215\u2014is about 3 percent more than the revenue  collected from the one narrow-body jet flight\u2014$1,178. FAA states  however, that each flight would impose similar costs on the agency, so  FAA\u2019s costs would be roughly 3 times more to handle the three regional jet  flights than to handle the one medium jet flight. In this example, however,  there is little financial incentive ($37) for the airline to limit its imposition  of additional costs on FAA by using one flight instead of three flights.", "This situation is made worse during times when the NAS is congested.  There are two issues associated with congestion. The first is plane size; if  all other factors are equal, such as demand for air travel, it is more  efficient to serve congested airspace with larger planes because they can  move more passengers per flight. Second, when congestion is a factor,  efficiency requires consideration of the delay costs imposed on other  system users.

Advocates of reliance on a fuel tax funding system state that  it is appealing compared to the current system because there is a  correlation between the time a plane spends in the system and the amount  of fuel a plane uses. To the extent that time in the system is related to cost,  this relationship creates at least a partial link between revenues and costs,  which could partially address the revenue adequacy, equity, and efficiency  concerns about the current system. In addition, advocates of the fuel tax  state that a fuel tax is inexpensive and simple to administer. Under the  current system the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is responsible for  collecting fuel taxes at the point of sale, and these funds are then  deposited to the Treasury, which then credits the Trust Fund. FAA has no  responsibility for collecting the revenue. Thus, transitioning to an all-fuel- tax funding system would be relatively easy, since the administrative  system is already in place. Furthermore, the tax is easy for consumers to  understand, and compliance is simple and inexpensive.", "From a revenue adequacy perspective, fuel taxes compare favorably with  other existing excise taxes because they are more directly linked to  workload. Thus, all things being equal, increases in workload over time  would likely result in fuel tax revenue increases. Nonetheless, two factors  that lead to lower fuel consumption will erode the ability of a fuel tax to  generate revenue over time. First, while the incentive created through the  tax to conserve fuel will promote more efficient use of the system, it will  lead to lower fuel consumption, which will reduce revenues.

This option  would likely increase the tax differential between passengers traveling on  one-stop (or more than one-stop) flights and those traveling on nonstop  flights on the same route. As a result, there might be a shift in travelers\u2019  demand toward more nonstop service, which might, in turn, lead airlines  to operate more nonstop service. Because there is a partial link between  the number of segments an airline operates and the cost of the services  FAA provides to that carrier, this option might have some advantages over  the present tax structure in terms of revenue adequacy, efficiency and  equity.

One way in which  a passenger segment tax might better correlate to FAA\u2019s workload is that  commercial flights that include a stop require more terminal services from  FAA than nonstop flights, and taxes based on the number of passenger  segments traveled will increase as the number of stops increases. In  addition, the current passenger segment tax is indexed to the Consumer  Price Index so that it is adjusted each year to account for inflation, which  preserves the purchasing power of the revenues collected. However, other  services that FAA provides could increase without any increase in  passenger segment tax revenues. For example, if the average distance of  commercial flights increases, the cost of providing en-route services will  rise, but the passenger segment taxes paid will not rise because they are  not based on distance traveled or time in controlled airspace.  Furthermore, passenger segment taxes apply only to commercial flights,  so they have no advantage over ticket taxes in providing revenue adequate  to fund cost increases associated with providing services to cargo and GA  aircraft. In addition, there would be no improvement in providing adequate  revenue for safety and security expenditures.", "Compared to ticket taxes, higher flight passenger segment taxes have the  potential to increase equity by better aligning revenues with costs, and  they create some additional incentives for efficient use of FAA services.  However, these effects are likely to be limited because the tax revenues  are aligned only to some cost elements and the tax applies only to  commercial aircraft. With increased passenger segment taxes, the  difference in the amount of taxes commercial airlines would have to pay  for one-stop service compared with nonstop service would be greater. This  greater difference in taxes might represent an improvement in equity  compared to the present funding system because one-stop flights require  more terminal and approach services from FAA than nonstop flights. This  greater difference in taxes could also create an incentive to provide more  nonstop service. Substituting nonstop for one-stop service could reduce  the airlines\u2019 need for FAA\u2019s terminal and approach services. However, this  incentive could be quite small relative to other factors that influence  airlines\u2019 service-offering decisions, so the effect on efficiency could also be  quite small. In addition, airlines would have no additional incentive to be  efficient in their use of en-route services because the passenger segment  tax is not linked to time in controlled airspace, and there would be no  change from the current structure in incentives for cargo and GA  operators.", "Administrative and transition issues would be minimal, since this option  would require only a change in the current tax per flight segment and the  elimination of the passenger ticket tax."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Direct Charges", "paragraphs": ["The four funding options we reviewed that would involve more direct  charges to users include weight/distance charges, en-route charges, flight  segment charges, and certification charges."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Weight/Distance Charges", "paragraphs": ["Charges based on weight and distance traveled are used by a number of  foreign air navigation service providers and are supported by the  International Civil Aviation Organization.

Our point is that this capability would be  needed to operate under a cost-based user charge system.", "DOT stated that it believes user fees would provide greater revenue  stability than taxes because user fees could be set up to be adjusted  periodically without changes in the law, thus providing greater flexibility  in aligning revenues to cover costs. Nonetheless, we continue to believe  that revenue stability is not likely to vary much across the funding options.  Significant decreases in the demand for air travel would decrease revenue  regardless of whether the current funding structure is maintained or any of  the options are adopted. Furthermore, increasing direct user charges while  air travel demand was falling would increase costs for aircraft operators at  the same time as their revenues were declining and might be no easier  than increasing excise taxes.", "DOT also provided some clarifying and technical comments, which we  incorporated where appropriate.", "According to Treasury, GAO raised several critical issues, but did not  provide any analysis that would help policymakers judge reform options.  Specifically, Treasury expressed concern that we did not (1) provide a  more comprehensive discussion of FAA costs and cost shares, including  any available cost information that provides insight into the issue, (2)  evaluate FAA\u2019s efforts to implement cost accounting, and (3) state  whether FAA\u2019s cost accounting program is likely, when completed, to  generate cost information that is useful in determining a fair and efficient  distribution of costs among users. We agree with Treasury that a more  detailed analysis of FAA costs and cost shares should be conducted to  inform the FAA reauthorization debate, and that this information would  improve the analysis of specific alternative funding options. FAA\u2019s current  accounting system is not able to provide the information required for a  cost allocation analysis. We believe that using partial cost information, as  suggested by Treasury, would not be appropriate. Moreover, conducting a  comprehensive cost analysis was beyond the scope of this report.", "Treasury also said that our report repeats claims made by interest groups  without evaluating them, giving the sense that each argument is equally  valid, even though policymakers need some way to evaluate them. This  was not the objective of the report. We provided a basis for evaluating the  current and alternative funding options by outlining criteria, including  revenue adequacy, equity, and efficiency, and discussing the implications  of these criteria with respect to specific funding options.", "Treasury raised concerns that a number of statements were attributed to  \u201csome stakeholders,\u201d rather than the specific groups or individuals that  made the statements, noting that attribution helps the reader evaluate the  statements. In response, we added some attribution as appropriate.", "Treasury also noted its long-standing policy that all debt issued by federal  entities, including FAA, should be issued solely to the Treasury, because  centralized Treasury financing of all such debt is the least expensive, most  efficient means of financing this debt. Treasury further maintained that  market discipline would not be applied to FAA debt obligations issued  directly to the private capital market because investors would perceive the  obligations were backed by the federal government. We added language to  the report to clarify Treasury\u2019s position on these issues.", "Treasury also provided some clarifying and technical comments, which we  incorporated where appropriate.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you announce the contents of this  report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the date  of this letter. At that time, we will send copies of this report to interested  congressional committees; the Secretary of Transportation; the  Administrator, FAA; the Secretary of the Treasury; and the Director, OMB.  Copies will also be available to others upon request and at no cost on  GAO\u2019s Web site at www.gao.gov.", "If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact me  at (202) 512-3834 or dillinghamg@gao.gov.

We also interviewed    officials from government agencies, including the Federal Aviation  Administration (FAA), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the  Congressional Budget Office (CBO), and the Department of the Treasury  (Treasury);  representatives of aviation industry groups, including the Air Transport  Association, the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA), and the  National Business Aviation Association; and   academic and financial experts.", "In addition, as discussed in the following paragraphs, we performed  further work to accomplish each objective.", "To assess the advantages and concerns that have been raised about the  current approach to collecting revenues from national airspace system  (NAS) users to fund FAA and the extent to which the available evidence  supports the concerns, we examined FAA budget data, Airport and Airway  Trust Fund (Trust Fund) revenue data, FAA forecasts, data reported to the  Department of Transportation (DOT) on aircraft size and airfares (DOT  Form 41 data), and FAA aviation activity data. We used data on tax  revenues associated with different types of flights to assess the link  between increases in FAA\u2019s workload and increases in Trust Fund  revenue. We obtained the FAA budget, Trust Fund, forecast, and aviation  activity data from FAA. To assess the reliability of these data, we  interviewed knowledgeable officials and reviewed the quality control  procedures FAA applies to these data, and subsequently determined that  the data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. We obtained the DOT  Form 41 data from BACK Aviation Solutions, a private contractor that  provides these data to interested parties. We used these data to examine  trends in aircraft size and airfares because of their impact on the  relationship between Trust Fund revenues and FAA\u2019s workload.", "To identify potential alternative funding options for FAA and criteria for  comparing these options, we obtained information on the experience of  foreign air navigation service providers by reviewing relevant GAO reports  and other literature and interviewing officials at Eurocontrol and France\u2019s  FAA counterpart, la Direction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l\u2019Aviation Civile. We also  interviewed representatives of Air France, AOPA-France, the International  Air Transport Association, the Association of European Airlines, and  A\u00e9roports de Paris. Through our literature review and these interviews, we  identified longer-run revenue adequacy, equity, efficiency, and  administrative considerations as appropriate criteria for assessing the  current and alternative funding options. We considered both modifications  to the current excise tax structure and various forms of direct charges for  FAA services as possible alternatives to the current tax structure. In  selecting options for analysis, we considered whether there was a link  between the option and some element of FAA\u2019s workload.", "To identify the advantages and disadvantages of authorizing FAA to use  debt financing for capital projects, we reviewed the borrowing authorities  of other U.S. governmental entities, including the Tennessee Valley  Authority and the Bonneville Power Administration.", "We conducted our work from May 2005 through August of 2006 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, the following individuals made  key contributions to this report: Ashley Alley, Christine Bonham, Jay  Cherlow, Tammy Conquest, Colin Fallon, Carol Henn, David Hooper,  Maureen Luna-Long, Maren McAvoy, Rich Swayze, and Matt Zisman."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
