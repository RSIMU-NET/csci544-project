Private long-term care insurance was viewed as a possible way to reduce catastrophic financial risk for the elderly needing long-term care and to relieve some of the financing burden now shouldered by public long-term care programs.

These challenges are formidable already, as an estimated 9 million persons age 18 or older receive long- term care assistance, either at home or in institutions such as nursing homes.  While family members provide much care, paying for purchased services presents a significant financial burden for many individuals and for public health care programs. For those needing nursing home or other extensive continuous care, the costs can be substantial. On average, nursing home care currently costs $55,000 annually, with many nursing home residents paying much of that out of their own pockets.", "Providing and financing long-term care will become even more challenging in just over a decade when the 76 million baby boomers begin to turn 65. Over the next 30 years, the number of elderly individuals is expected to double.  Moreover, with baby boomers expected to live longer and greater numbers reaching age 85 and older, this generation is expected to have a dramatic effect on the number of people needing long-term care services, as the prevalence of disabilities and dependencies increases with age. To help alleviate the pressures on public programs and families in meeting the needs of these persons, some advocate a growing role for private long- term care insurance.  Several recent congressional initiatives aim to increase the use of private insurance in financing long-term care needs. These initiatives include establishing a program to make group long-term care insurance available to federal employees, members of the uniformed services, and civilian and military retirees; and proposals to provide additional tax subsidies to individuals purchasing long-term care insurance. who is likely to buy this insurance, its affordability, and the critical need for consumer protections.", "While my focus will be on financing the projected increase in the need for long-term care for the elderly, long-term care needs of younger persons should not be overlooked.  Disability and dependency have no age boundaries, and the long-term care needs of the nonelderly and the burden of satisfying them can be profound.  How to better meet these needs and distribute the burden deserves our attention.  However, the potential for private long-term care insurance to assist those whose disabilities or dependencies begin at younger ages may be very limited.", "In summary, the confluence of the aging baby boom generation, longer life expectancies, and evolving options for providing and financing long-term care services will require substantial public and private investment in long- term care and the development of sufficient capacity to serve this growing population. Spending for long-term care, including post-acute and chronic care in nursing homes and home and community-base care, was about $134 billion in 1999. Medicaid and Medicare paid for nearly 58 percent of these services in 1999, contributing about $59 billion and $18 billion, respectively. Medicaid funds primarily go to nursing homes and other institutional settings of long-term care, but home and community-based services receive a growing share.  Medicare primarily covers acute-care services and thus plays a lesser role in financing nursing home care\u2014by paying only for short-term stays following a hospitalization.  While the Medicare home health benefit had grown to play a significant role in covering long-term care, the new BBA-mandated payment system may reduce the provision of such services.  Medicaid, which is a jointly funded federal-state program, poses a large burden on states\u2019 budgets, creating pressure on their capacity to absorb additional costs associated with the growing need for long-term care services over the coming decades. these fully assure consumer confidence in the reliability of long-term care insurance.

They may have mental impairments, such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease, that necessitate supervision to avoid harm to themselves or others or require assistance with tasks such as taking medications.  Although a chronic physical or mental disability may occur at any age, the older an individual becomes, the more likely a disabling condition will develop or worsen.  Nearly one-seventh of the nation\u2019s current elderly population\u2014an estimated 5.2 million\u2014have a limitation in either ADLs; instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) such as preparing food, doing housekeeping, and handling finances; or both.  More than one-third of these people have limitations in two or more ADLs.", "Long-term care encompasses a wide array of care settings and services, not only institutional care provided by nursing homes for individuals with more extensive care needs but also home and community-based care. Nearly 80 percent of the elderly requiring assistance with ADLs or IADLs live at home or in community-based settings, while more than 20 percent live in nursing homes or other institutions.  The majority of long-term care is provided by unpaid family caregivers to elderly individuals living either in their own homes or with their families. However, a growing minority of the elderly receives paid assistance from various sources. For example, state Medicaid programs have increased significantly the number of beneficiaries receiving in-home or community services.  In addition, alternatives to nursing home care, such as assisted-living arrangements, are developing that have long-term care services available.", "Long-term care needs are an especially significant concern for women. Women represent 7 of 10 unpaid caregivers, three-quarters of nursing home residents 65 years and older, and two-thirds of home health care users.

The Medicaid program, which pays for many health care services for low-income elderly, including nursing home care, will also begin to be affected.

Many baby boomers will have fewer options besides paid long-term care providers because a smaller proportion of this generation may have a spouse or adult children to provide unpaid caregiving.

These amounts, however, do not include the many hidden costs of long-term care.

By 1994, only about one-fourth of home health visits covered by Medicare occurred within 60 days following a hospitalization.  As a result, Medicare, on a de facto basis, financed an increasing amount of long-term care through its home health care benefit.

Premiums for a 65-year-old are typically about $1,000 per year and can be much higher for more generous coverage or for older buyers. The affordability of long-term care insurance determines to a great extent its market and is a key factor in individuals\u2019 decisions to purchase and retain a long-term care insurance policy.  Although assessing whether individuals can afford a policy is subjective, some studies estimate that long-term care insurance is affordable for only 10 to 20 percent of the elderly.  Affordability is even more of an issue for married couples, who must each purchase individual coverage.  While some insurers offer discounts to married couples when both purchase long-term care coverage, elderly couples are still likely to pay at least several thousand dollars annually for long-term care coverage. Those who consider and decide against purchasing long-term care insurance say they are skeptical about whether private policies will give adequate coverage.
