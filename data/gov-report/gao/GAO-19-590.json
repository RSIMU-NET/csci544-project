USAID and State implemented most of these projects, with some supporting more than one sector and objective. For example, USAID implemented projects to address poverty, while State trained prosecutors and police to address governance and security needs.", "State, USAID, and other agencies reported mixed results for the 190 projects in the six sectors GAO reviewed. For example, in fiscal year 2018, USAID assisted 1,376 individuals in workforce development programs in Guatemala, exceeding the target of 1,000, while it assisted 651 individuals in Honduras, falling short of the target of 5,000. State and USAID trained 12,557 justice system personnel in the Northern Triangle, exceeding the target of 2,275. USDA rehabilitated school kitchens in Honduras as part of its school feeding program. DOD helped Guatemala establish a budget system to increase accountability for military funds, but DOD reported persistently low public trust in Northern Triangle militaries.", "Limited information is available about how U.S. assistance improved prosperity, governance, and security in the Northern Triangle. Agencies generally reported more information about progress toward prosperity than toward governance and security, in part because evaluations were conducted unevenly across agencies and sectors. In addition, project implementers did not consistently collect key information needed to evaluate progress, but officials noted improvements. Nevertheless, agency officials described examples of progress through technical assistance, and noted challenges, such as drought. GAO has reported that development of a monitoring and evaluation plan is key to assessing agencies' common goals and objectives, and mutually reinforcing results. While State has a monitoring and evaluation plan for the Strategy, the plan does not include activities by DOD and USDA that support the Strategy's objectives and thus does not establish a comprehensive approach to assessing progress."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that State collaborate with DOD and USDA to develop a comprehensive approach to monitoring and evaluation of projects that support Strategy objectives.

These challenges have serious consequences for  the United States. For example, the region has become a significant  source of migration to the United States due to multiple factors, including  a lack of economic opportunities, high poverty rates and poor living  conditions, gang-related violence and insecurity, and the desire for family  reunification. Transnational criminal organizations have also taken  advantage of weak government institutions and justice systems in the  Northern Triangle to engage in illegal activities. All three Northern  Triangle countries, for example, are major transit countries for illegal  drugs destined for the United States and are vulnerable to the money  laundering activities of organized crime groups, particularly drug and  human trafficking organizations.", "The U.S. government has committed resources and provided assistance  over many years to the Northern Triangle countries to address these  challenges. Specifically, beginning in 2008, the United States established  the M\u00e9rida Initiative to provide foreign assistance to Mexico and Central  America, including the Northern Triangle, to address violence and  criminal activity. In 2010, the United States established the Central  America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI), which created a  collaborative partnership between the United States and Central  American countries, including the Northern Triangle, to improve citizen  security. Multiple U.S. agencies implemented projects intended to  improve prosperity, governance, and security in Central America,  including the Northern Triangle, to support and complement these  initiatives.", "In 2014, the U.S. government introduced the U.S. Strategy for  Engagement in Central America (Strategy) to expand assistance to Central America, including the Northern Triangle countries, by taking a  broader, more comprehensive approach to the immediate and long-term  challenges facing Central American governments. The Strategy aims to  promote prosperity, good governance, and security cooperation in the  region. Multiple U.S. agencies fund foreign assistance projects supporting  each of the three objectives. The Department of State (State) and the  U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) are responsible for  developing a plan for monitoring and evaluating U.S. assistance under  the Strategy and reporting progress toward its objectives. In 2017, State  updated the Strategy to place more emphasis on preventing illegal  immigration, combatting transnational crime, and generating export and  investment opportunities for U.S. businesses, while maintaining the  Strategy\u2019s three objectives.", "On June 17, 2019, State announced that the Department would not  provide new funds for programs in the Northern Triangle until it is satisfied  that governments in the region \u201care taking concrete actions to reduce the  number of illegal migrants coming to the U.S. border.\u201d According to this  announcement, previously awarded grants and contracts would continue  as would certain new assistance to help Northern Triangle governments  \u201ctake actions that will protect the U.S. border and counter transnational  organized crime.\u201d", "You asked us to review U.S. government assistance to the Northern  Triangle.

We analyzed agencies\u2019 project and  funding data to identify the number of projects implemented by agency  and country and the total funding agencies allocated for these projects  from fiscal years 2013 through 2018. We focused our analysis on State,  USAID, DOD, and USDA because they allocated the largest amounts of  funding for the largest number of projects supporting prosperity,  governance, and security objectives in the Northern Triangle during this  period. We assessed the reliability of the data that agencies reported for  these projects by reviewing information from agency officials regarding  the underlying data systems and by checking the data for consistency  and errors. When we found potential duplicate data and discrepancies,  we contacted relevant agency officials to resolve these data issues. As a  result of these steps, we determined that the data were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of reporting the number of projects that  supported prosperity, governance, and security objectives in El Salvador,  Guatemala, and Honduras and allocations for these projects from fiscal  years 2013 through 2018.", "To select a subset of the projects for review, we reviewed agencies\u2019  project information and Strategy documents to categorize all projects into  18 sectors that generally align with the current objectives of the Strategy.  Specifically, we grouped similar projects by sector such as economic  growth, justice reform, and community based violence prevention, and  aligned them according to the Strategy\u2019s three objectives of prosperity,  governance, and security. We then selected a judgmental sample of six of  the 18 sectors for an in-depth review of performance-related  documentation. The six sectors we selected were agricultural  development, economic growth, good government service, justice reform,  community based violence prevention, and professionalize the military  and develop defense capabilities. We selected these six sectors to  achieve a range of projects by agency, funding allocation amount, and  country, and to include projects that align with each of the three  objectives.", "To determine what is known about project results, we reviewed agency  performance reports and data for the 190 projects implemented from  fiscal years 2013 through 2018 in the six selected sectors. We also  examined detailed documentation of results information, including State  and USAID\u2019s Performance Plans and Reports (PPR) for El Salvador,  Guatemala, and Honduras for fiscal years 2013 through 2018; State\u2019s  International Narcotics Control Strategy Reports (INCSR) for fiscal years  2013 through 2018; State and USAID\u2019s Progress Report for the U.S.  Strategy for Central America\u2019s Plan for Monitoring and Evaluation for  fiscal year 2018 and 2019; and State\u2019s quarterly country cables reporting  on agencies\u2019 progress in implementing projects in support of the  prosperity, governance, and security objectives in each of the Northern  Triangle countries for the available quarters of fiscal years 2016 through  2018. We also requested and reviewed all 23 evaluations completed from  fiscal years 2013 through 2018 related to each of the six selected sectors  in each Northern Triangle country. In addition, we examined detailed  project documentation of results information for a non-generalizable  sample of 19 projects within the six sectors, including, among other  things, quarterly, semi-annual, and annual reports from implementing  partners to assess project results. We selected these 19 projects based  on a variety of criteria, including the types of project activities and the  objectives they supported, as well as to obtain a range of funding  allocation amounts, countries, and agencies.", "To examine what is known about progress toward the Strategy\u2019s  objectives, we reviewed Strategy documents, including monitoring and  evaluation plans, to assess if they included key elements of effective  strategies that we have identified as related to assessment of progress  toward strategic goals. In assessing the monitoring and evaluation plan,  we also considered the Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government, which specifies that managers should identify the  information needed to achieve objectives and use such information to  evaluate performance in achieving objectives.", "To support our work on all three objectives, we conducted fieldwork in El  Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras to observe selected project  activities, and to interview agency officials, implementing partners, and  project beneficiaries about project activities and results, and factors that  have affected project results. We also interviewed agency officials in  Washington, D.C. and at the U.S. Southern Command in Doral, Florida  about project activities and results, factors affecting results, and actions to  address these factors, as well as efforts to monitor and evaluate project  results.

In 2008, the United States began a multiyear  assistance package to Central America under the M\u00e9rida Initiative to help  address violence and criminal activity, especially from drug trafficking and  other criminal organizations. In 2010, U.S. assistance continued under  CARSI. CARSI was a collaborative partnership between the United  States and Central American partner countries, including El Salvador,  Guatemala, and Honduras, designed to improve citizen security within the  region by taking a broad approach to security beyond traditional  counternarcotics activities. Multiple U.S. agencies implemented projects  in Central America, particularly in the Northern Triangle, to support and  complement these initiatives. These projects focused on, among other  things, improving law enforcement and criminal justice, promoting the rule  of law and human rights, preventing youth violence in violence-prone  areas, enhancing customs and border control, and encouraging economic  and social development.", "Introduced in 2014, and updated in 2017, the Strategy is the latest U.S.  government initiative in the region.

For example, officials  told us that agencies implemented fewer agricultural development  projects in El Salvador because its agriculture industry is small relative to  Guatemala and Honduras and the majority of its population lives in urban  rather than rural, agricultural areas. Instead, agency officials in El  Salvador said agencies focused their prosperity assistance on projects in  the economic growth sector that targeted more prominent business areas  such as technology or manufacturing. For example, USAID supported a  youth training center in El Salvador where students develop computer  skills to work in the information technology fields (See fig. 3).", "Some agencies funded projects that supported multiple sectors and  objectives, while others focused on a specific sector supporting one of the  three objectives (see fig. 4). For example, USAID and State supported all  three objectives by implementing projects in a variety of sectors.  However, USDA supported only the prosperity objective by implementing  projects primarily in the agricultural development sector and DOD  supported the security objective by implementing projects primarily in the  professionalize the military and develop defense capabilities sector. We  also identified some specific assistance projects that supported more than  one of the three objectives. For example, some of USAID\u2019s workforce  development projects targeted at-risk youth, which supported both the  prosperity and security objectives. Other USAID projects worked with  government officials in the Northern Triangle to improve health,  environment, or economic growth, which supported both the prosperity  and governance objectives. In addition, State\u2019s rule of law projects, which  trained police and other personnel in the judicial sector, supported both  the governance and the security objectives.", "Below is an overview of the agencies\u2019 general roles and responsibilities  for supporting the three objectives:", "Prosperity: USAID, State, and USDA implemented projects supporting  the prosperity objective. USAID implemented projects to assist  populations to meet basic needs, help businesses access markets for  goods and services, build a skilled workforce, and enhance health  systems and education institutions. For example, one USAID  economic growth project in El Salvador provided assistance to small  enterprises through university-affiliated training centers where  representatives of firms received training and advice to improve their  business practices. State also implemented projects to assist  businesses and entrepreneurs develop their capabilities. For example,  State implemented a multi-country project to provide training to small  and medium businesses on e-commerce platforms to access new  markets and increase sales. USDA and USAID both implemented  projects intended to help farmers improve agricultural management  practices and increase their access to markets and capital. For  example, a USAID agricultural development project in Honduras  provided training to local farmers to increase their household incomes,  strengthen access to food markets, and diversify their crops (see fig.  5). A USDA project provided schools in Honduras with food  assistance, infrastructure improvements, and trainings to support  school feeding, sought to improve educational outcomes (see fig. 6).", "Governance: USAID and State were the primary agencies supporting  the governance objective. USAID projects provided technical  assistance to governments to increase accountability, transparency,  revenue collection, and provision of basic services. For example, a  USAID project in Guatemala provided technical assistance to  municipal governments to improve their financial management and  increase the quality of government-provided services such as water  and sanitation systems. State and USAID also supported this  objective by supporting projects to strengthen justice institutions,  combat corruption, improve democratic processes, and advocate for  the protection of human rights. For example, we visited a morgue in  Honduras where USAID and INL collaborated to provide forensic  training and equipment and improve evidence collection and analysis  capabilities, to better prosecute crimes (see fig. 7).", "Security: State, USAID, and DOD implemented projects to support the  security objective. USAID and INL projects supported community  based activities to prevent violence by supporting community youth  centers, strengthening community policing, and implementing  workforce development projects for at-risk youth. For example, a  USAID project in Honduras provided technical training, mentorship,  and job placement support for at-risk youth. INL also provided training  and equipment to law enforcement to improve its capabilities and  reputation in communities and to better identify and prevent crime,  violence, and gang activity. For example, we visited the International  Law Enforcement Academy in El Salvador, where U.S. assistance  provides a variety of training courses to Central American and South  American police, judges, and prosecutors, to increase capacity and  coordination among law enforcement officials (see fig. 8). In addition,  State funded and DOD funded and implemented projects to train and  equip Northern Triangle militaries.

According to the PPRs we  reviewed, USAID achieved 81 of 123 (66 percent) of its targets for  performance indicators related to the economic growth sector for  fiscal years 2013 through 2018. In addition, all nine evaluations in  the sector reported generally positive project results. For example,  according to the PPR, USAID assisted 176 firms to invest in improved  technologies and 329 firms to improve their management practices in  Guatemala in fiscal year 2017, exceeding the targets of 141 and 310,  respectively. In addition, 5,067 individuals completed workforce  development programs with U.S. assistance in the Northern Triangle  countries in fiscal year 2018, according to the PPRs. USAID reported  that 1,376 individuals completed workforce development programs in  Guatemala, which exceeded the target of 1,000. However, USAID  reported that 3,040 individuals in El Salvador and 651 individuals in  Honduras completed such programs, which did not meet the fiscal  year targets of 7,300 and 5,000, respectively. According to an  evaluation of a USAID project in El Salvador that focused on providing  training to individuals to improve their job opportunities, 3,585  individuals completed the training, which was 175 fewer than  expected due, in part, to the project\u2019s focus on training individuals for  existing jobs and the scarcity of job opportunities for some individuals  who completed the training.", "Agricultural Development: USAID and USDA implemented projects  that provided assistance to apply improved agricultural technologies  or management practices, and increase agricultural productivity and  food security. According to the PPRs we reviewed, USAID achieved  58 of 86 (67 percent) of its targets for performance indicators related  to this sector for fiscal years 2013 through 2018, and six of eight  evaluations of agricultural development projects generally reported  positive project results. For example, USAID reported in the PPR that  35,245 individuals in Honduras received short-term training with U.S.  government support on agricultural productivity or food security in  fiscal year 2018, exceeding the fiscal year target of 32,500, but  40,492 individuals received such training in Guatemala, which did not  meet the target of 52,417. According to an implementer progress  report, as of March 2017, an ongoing USDA school feeding project in  Honduras had helped to construct and rehabilitate kitchens and food  storage facilities at five of the 30 schools targeted by the project in  2017. An evaluation of a USDA project in El Salvador reported that  the project issued 307 agricultural loans to improve agricultural  production, which did not meet the target of 345 loans due, in part, to  a delay in implementing the project.", "Good Government Service: USAID implemented projects to help  create accountable and effective government institutions through  improved provision of government services, increased citizen  oversight, and greater ethics and transparency. According to the  PPRs we reviewed, USAID achieved 22 of 30 (73 percent) of its  targets for performance indicators related to this sector for fiscal years  2013 through 2018. Some of the projects achieved mixed results,  according to an evaluation of projects in this sector. For example,  USAID in the PPRs reported that in Honduras it exceeded targets in  fiscal year 2018 by providing assistance to 94 local governments to  improve public service and by training over 2,600 individuals in  Guatemala in fiscal management to strengthen local government and  foster decentralization. USAID met the target for fiscal year 2018 by  having 81 public policies introduced, adopted, repealed, changed, or  implemented with citizen input in Honduras. A USAID project in  Guatemala designed to better manage public resources and  government services reported in its fiscal year 2017 annual report that  it helped 76 percent of the municipalities involved in the project  increase their average monthly revenues following the project\u2019s  financial management training. However, an evaluation of two USAID  projects in Honduras found that one project did not meet 70 percent of  targets and struggled to successfully promote decentralization laws or  increase municipal fiscal autonomy.", "Justice Reform: USAID and State provided technical assistance and  equipment to help improve the efficiency of the courts and forensic  laboratories, and strengthen the capabilities of prosecutors and  judges. According to the PPRs we reviewed, USAID achieved 27 of  41 (66 percent) of its targets for performance indicators related to this  sector for fiscal years 2013 through 2018. For example, according to  the PPRs, 2,298 government officials in El Salvador received anti- corruption training with U.S. assistance in fiscal year 2018, surpassing  the fiscal year target of 1,845. However, according to the PPRs, 150  individuals affiliated with nongovernmental organizations received  such anti-corruption training in Guatemala in fiscal year 2017, which  was below the fiscal year target of 550. The Progress Report for the  Strategy for fiscal year 2019 reported that USAID assisted 244 courts  in Guatemala to improve their case management systems in fiscal  year 2018, which surpassed the target of 220. The Progress Report  for the Strategy also reported that State and USAID trained 12,557  justice system personnel, including prosecutors and criminal  investigators, in the Northern Triangle in fiscal year 2018; which  surpassed the target of 2,275.

According to the PPRs we reviewed, USAID achieved 7  of 18 (39 percent) of its targets for performance indicators related to  this sector for fiscal years 2013 through 2018. For example, in El  Salvador, 13 U.S. government-supported schools or other learning  spaces met the criteria for the safe schools program in fiscal year  2018, surpassing the target of 10 schools. However, according to the  PPR, in Honduras approximately 161,300 individuals participated in  U.S.-funded gang prevention and education in fiscal year 2018, which  did not meet the fiscal year target of 219,600. The Progress Report for  the Strategy for fiscal year 2018 reported that State\u2019s Gang  Resistance Education and Training Program (GREAT) reached tens  of thousands of youth and hundreds of police officers received  instructor certifications to deliver anti-gang and crime prevention  training through the program in the Northern Triangle in fiscal year  2017. However, State did not report targets for the program for the  fiscal year. According to an implementer progress report, as of June  2018, an ongoing USAID project in Honduras that provides workforce  development services for at-risk youth, had enrolled 2,528 of the  project\u2019s target of 6,500 youths for fiscal years 2017 and 2018.

Despite these improvements, the evaluation  reported that the services remained largely unable to satisfy citizen needs  adequately, and there was little evidence that municipalities would have  the capabilities or resources to continue to improve the services without  donor assistance. The evaluation also noted that the project promoted  citizen advocacy by providing training to citizen oversight committees and  establishing well-attended town halls in rural municipalities. However, it  found no evidence such efforts were effective because the organizations  remained too weak to advocate effectively for improved accountability  and service.", "Another evaluation of a USAID project to prevent community based  violence in Honduras reported significant reductions in homicide rates,  ranging from 42 percent to 68 percent, in four of the six targeted  communities, but also noted that these outcomes might not be  attributable to the project\u2019s activities.

An evaluation of a State project in justice  reform in Honduras also found that project indicators were focused on  outputs and not outcomes. The evaluation also noted that the indicators  were established after the project started and thus did not establish a true  baseline or capture results from the beginning.

USAID officials noted that the technical assistance the agency  has provided to small and medium sized firms has helped them access  markets and increase sales. State and USAID officials also described  improvements in the use of forensic evidence through technical  assistance and training provided to judges and prosecutors and  enhanced court management, which contributed to timely criminal  investigations and prosecutions. In addition, State officials explained that  U.S. assistance along with support from other donors and host  governments has contributed to positive results, including the passage of  laws that prevent organized crime from donating to political campaigns,  multiple anti-corruption investigations, as well as reductions in homicide  rates through community based violence prevention projects.

Agencies have reported mixed results from  these projects, relative to targets set, yet little is known about progress on  meeting broader objectives to improve prosperity, governance, and  security in the region. Under the U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central  America, State and USAID developed a monitoring and evaluation plan,  for their own projects, that is an important tool for assessing impact in the  region. A more comprehensive approach to monitoring and evaluation of  projects that may address the Strategy\u2019s objectives to include all relevant  agencies, sectors, and activities would enable the U.S. government to  have a better understanding of progress under the Strategy and how U.S.  assistance is addressing the underlying challenges that confront El  Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.

USAID indicated that while greater interagency  coordination would be appropriate, it does not have the authority to direct  DOD or USDA to monitor and evaluate their projects against objectives  developed for the Strategy. DOD noted that while some of its programs  enable progress toward the Strategy\u2019s objectives, it is not appropriate for  State to specify how to monitor and evaluate DOD-funded programs.  State also asserted that our recommendation is not consistent with the  explanatory statements accompanying the Department of State, Foreign  Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, which directs  State and USAID to develop a monitoring and evaluation plan for the  Strategy for programs funded by appropriations to them, but does not  direct that the plan include monitoring and evaluation of programs funded  by appropriations to DOD and USDA.", "We are not recommending that State and USAID direct DOD and USDA  to monitor and evaluate projects, but rather that State collaborate with  DOD and USDA to develop a more comprehensive approach to  monitoring and evaluating projects that support the Strategy\u2019s objectives  and that State document the results of this collaboration in the Strategy\u2019s  monitoring and evaluation plan. We do not prescribe the format or content  for how the Strategy\u2019s monitoring and evaluation plan might be updated.", "We have modified relevant sections of our report and our  recommendation to make this clearer and eliminated the recommendation  to USAID, since State coordinates implementation of the Strategy by the  various agencies of the U.S. government. We found that DOD and USDA  have designed and implemented programs that directly support the  objectives of the Strategy. While we acknowledge that some coordination  among agencies occurs in Washington and in the Northern Triangle, we  found that such coordination does not formally extend to monitoring and  evaluation. We agree with USAID\u2019s comment that interagency  coordination on a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation plan for the  Strategy would be appropriate. Consistent with USAID\u2019s comment, we  believe that our recommendation encourages greater coordination among  agencies, including DOD and USDA, by ensuring that comprehensive  monitoring and evaluation efforts of the entire U.S. government are in  sync with the monitoring and evaluation plan for the Strategy. Excluding  DOD and USDA projects from the monitoring and evaluation plan for the  Strategy could result in an incomplete or unclear understanding of the  results of U.S. assistance in the Northern Triangle. Without a complete  and clear understanding of the results across all agencies involved,  agencies may miss important lessons about the types of assistance that  are most effective in achieving U.S. objectives in this region, potentially  limiting overall progress. Furthermore, while the explanatory statement  accompanying Pub. L. No. 114-113 directs State, in coordination with  USAID, to develop a monitoring and evaluation plan for funds  appropriated to them, we are recommending that State, as coordinator for  the implementation of the Strategy, work with the other agencies to  develop a more comprehensive approach to monitoring and evaluating  projects that support the Strategy\u2019s objectives. State should update the  monitoring and evaluation plan that was created in response to the  congressional direction to document the comprehensive approach to  monitoring and evaluation.", "State indicated that the credibility of our report was limited by the  following five methodological issues: (1) our inclusion of projects  implemented by DOD and USDA; (2) our inclusion of projects  implemented with funds appropriated prior to fiscal year 2016; (3) our use  of inconsistent reporting methods for funding allocations among the four  State bureaus providing data and among State, USAID, DOD, and USDA;  (4) our classification of program sectors, which was not consistent with  the sub-objectives used by State and USAID as part of the Strategy; and  (5) our exclusion of several \u201cprimary\u201d sectors for our in-depth review, such  as police professionalization, reducing violence at the local level, and  reducing the influence of organized crime and gangs.", "We believe that our methodology enhanced the credibility and reliability of  our report. Overall, we designed our objectives, scope, and methodology,  as outlined in detail in appendix I, to provide a reasonably comprehensive  review of the results of U.S. assistance to the Northern Triangle toward  achieving key U.S. objectives.", "First, we chose to review all agencies that have allocated a  significant amount of funding from their appropriations to  implement projects in the Northern Triangle from fiscal year 2013  through fiscal year 2018 to support prosperity, governance, and  security. DOD and USDA officials confirmed that DOD and USDA  projects support these objectives and we believe that the inclusion  of these agencies significantly enhanced the accuracy and  completeness of our reporting on the results that have been  achieved from U.S. assistance as well as the gaps in the current  monitoring and evaluation approach and implications for State\u2019s  ability to assess results comprehensively.", "Second, we believe our inclusion of projects implemented from  fiscal years 2013 through 2018 provided a reasonable time frame  for our review because it included projects that supported the  objectives of improving prosperity, governance, and security\u2014 long standing objectives that predated appropriations for the  Strategy, and even the Strategy itself. Including projects  implemented between fiscal years 2013 and 2018 increased our  ability to report on the results of agencies\u2019 projects and their  overall progress toward the Strategy\u2019s objectives because projects  funded since fiscal year 2016 were in too early a stage of  implementation to report meaningfully on such results. However,  we considered, as appropriate, any results information we were  able to obtain on such projects.", "Third, we acknowledge that the precision of our estimates for  reporting on funding allocations was limited due to the inconsistent  nature of reporting of financial data by different bureaus and  agencies. However, taking into consideration qualifications noted  throughout our report, we believe that our reporting of funding  allocations provides a reliable description of how agencies used  allocated funding to support prosperity, governance, and security  objectives.", "Fourth, we believe that our classification of projects under different  sectors we identified provides a detailed, comprehensive, and  meaningful analysis of projects and related results. Because some  of the sub-objectives developed by State and USAID, such as  \u201creduce poverty,\u201d were very broad and did not lend themselves to  an analysis of specific project sectors that supported the  Strategy\u2019s objectives, we identified more specific sectors,  including health, economic growth, and agricultural development.  State and USAID officials validated the accuracy of our definitions,  and we revised them as appropriate, given input from agency  officials.", "Fifth, our selection of six sectors for in-depth review of projects  and results limits the generalizability of our findings to all sectors,  which we note. Due to the large number of projects, sectors, and  sub-objectives associated with U.S. assistance to the Northern  Triangle, we determined that a case study approach was the most  effective methodology for our review. We devised selection criteria  to reflect a meaningful selection of projects across sectors,  agencies, and countries. Moreover, two of the sectors we selected  for in-depth review\u2014community based violence prevention, and  justice reform\u2014encompass several projects classified as relating  to \u201creducing violence at the local level,\u201d and \u201creducing the  influence of organized crime and gangs.\u201d Thus our report  addresses results in these sectors. We omitted certain sectors,  such as police professionalization, in part, because we had  ongoing work related to this sector. We acknowledge limitations  with this case study approach and do not attempt to generalize  results beyond the sectors we reviewed. We believe that this  methodological approach provides a reasonable basis for our  overall conclusion that projects in the sectors we reviewed  achieved mixed results.", "USAID also raised several methodological concerns, some of which were  similar to those raised by State. In particular, USAID (1) questioned the  validity of our analysis, since it was based on a case study of six of the 18  sectors we identified, and commented that we did not discuss the  limitation of this approach; (2) questioned the validity of our use of  monitoring information relating to the achievement of annual targets to  analyze results; and (3) asserted that we focused on negative evaluation  findings to assess results and did not mention or analyze planned and  ongoing evaluations or programmatic changes made in response to  monitoring and evaluation information.", "We believe our methodological approach provides a reliable basis for our  findings and conclusions, and concerns USAID raised do not limit the  credibility of our report.", "First, we acknowledge the limitations of our case study approach  and included statements throughout our report to make these  limitations clear.", "Second, we believe that the use of data on the achievement of  annual targets is a valid approach to assessing results, although  the agencies collecting the data may also intend to use it in  making decisions about ongoing projects. Furthermore, these data  provided only one element of our analysis. We also analyzed  State and USAID implementer progress reports, mid-point and  final evaluations, and other performance reports, which provide a  longer-term perspective on results. Collectively, we believe that  this information provides meaningful insight into the successes  and shortcomings of the projects in the sectors we reviewed.", "Third, we sought to present a balanced picture of results within the  sectors we reviewed, highlighting both positive and negative  outcomes described in the reviewed documents. We reviewed  completed evaluations to provide insight into project results, but  excluded ongoing and planned evaluations because conclusions  about project results are not available until such evaluations are  completed. Similarly, our report acknowledges that agency  officials described progress and challenges to achieving the  prosperity, governance, and security objectives, as well as the  steps taken to modify projects to address such challenges.

We  also obtained data from DHS and DOJ concerning projects implemented  through agreements with State, which we included under State\u2019s project  and funding counts.", "Although agencies use different terms to describe agencies\u2019 assistance,  including programs, projects, and activities, we use the term \u201cprojects\u201d to  refer to assistance funded by the key agencies that are implemented  directly by the agencies or through awards made to the implementing  partners. In general, the term project consists of a set of activities that are  designed and executed over a time frame to achieve a specific aim. While  agencies and bureaus typically provided us with project-level data, some  agencies and bureaus were unable to report data at the project level, and  instead provided us with data that combined multiple activities or awards  to implementing partners to accomplish a broader aim. In addition, most  agencies reported project and funding data by country, including  separating funding data for multi-country projects that were implemented  in two or more countries, including at least one Northern Triangle country.  Some agencies were not able to report multi-country projects by country,  which we included in the multi-country project category. Since most  agencies and bureaus provided us with project-level data separated by  country, we use the term \u201cprojects\u201d to encompass all available data on  agencies\u2019 assistance in each of the three countries.", "We analyzed agencies\u2019 data and information to identify the number of  projects implemented by agency and country and the total funding  agencies allocated for these projects from fiscal years 2013 through  2018. We excluded from our analysis those projects that encompassed  solely administrative and monitoring and evaluation activities and costs  that did not provide technical assistance, although we included the funds  allocated for these projects in our analysis of funds allocated by each  agency for projects that supported prosperity, governance, and security.", "We assessed the reliability of the data that agencies reported for these  projects. We requested and reviewed information from agency officials  regarding the underlying data systems and the checks and reviews used  to generate the data and ensure its accuracy and reliability. We also  conducted logical checks and analysis to confirm the accuracy of the  data. When we found potential duplicate data and discrepancies, we  contacted relevant agency officials in Washington, D.C. and obtained  information from them necessary to resolve these data issues. As a result  of these steps, we determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for  the purposes of reporting the number of projects that supported  prosperity, governance, and security in El Salvador, Guatemala, and  Honduras and funding allocations for these projects from fiscal years  2013 through 2018.", "To select a subset of the projects to review, we reviewed agencies\u2019  project information as well as Strategy documents to categorize all  projects into 18 different sectors of assistance that generally aligned with  the current objectives of the Strategy. Specifically, we grouped similar  projects by sector such as economic growth, justice reform, and  community based violence prevention, and aligned them according to the  Strategy\u2019s three objectives of prosperity, governance, and security. We  requested that officials from State, USAID, DOD, and USDA review our  analysis to confirm our alignment of projects to the sectors and the three  objectives. We incorporated revisions from agency officials as  appropriate. We then selected a judgmental, nongeneralizable sample of  six of the 18 sectors for an in-depth review of performance-related  documentation for projects supporting each of the objectives. The six  sectors selected included agricultural development, economic growth,  good government service, justice reform, community based violence  prevention, and professionalize the military and develop defense  capabilities. We selected these six sectors to achieve variation by  agency, funding allocation amount, country, and to include projects  supporting each of the three objectives. Specifically, we selected the six  sectors to include two sectors supporting each objective, a distribution of  projects across the three Northern Triangle countries, and the largest  amounts of allocated funding and number of projects. We excluded from  our sample selection the migration and police reform sectors because of  our ongoing work in those sectors concerning the Northern Triangle.", "To determine what is known about project results, we reviewed agency  performance-related documents corresponding to the 190 projects  implemented from fiscal years 2013 through 2018 in the six sectors we  reviewed. Specifically, we examined State and USAID\u2019s Performance  Plans and Reports for El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras for each of  fiscal years 2013 through 2018; State\u2019s International Narcotics Control  Strategy Reports for fiscal years 2013 through 2018; State and USAID\u2019s  Progress Report for the U.S. Strategy for Central America\u2019s Plan for  Monitoring and Evaluation for fiscal years 2018 and 2019; and State\u2019s  quarterly country cables reporting on agencies\u2019 progress in implementing  projects in support of prosperity, governance, and security objectives in  each of the Northern Triangle countries for the available quarters of fiscal  years 2016 through 2018. We also requested and reviewed all 23  evaluations completed from fiscal years 2013 through 2018 by State,  USAID, and USDA related to the six selected sectors in each Northern  Triangle country. In addition, we selected a nongeneralizable sample of  19 projects within the six selected sectors to gain more in-depth  information and context about project implementation and results. For the  nongeneralizable sample of projects, we reviewed performance-related  documentation, including, among other things, implementing partners\u2019  quarterly, semi-annual, and annual progress reports, to examine project  results. We selected the19 projects based on a variety of criteria,  including the types of project activities and the objectives they supported,  as well as to obtain a range of funding allocation amounts, countries, and  agencies. We excluded from our sample selection those projects that  encompassed solely administrative and monitoring and evaluation  activities and costs, and those that agencies reported as pilot projects not  yet implemented.", "To examine what is known about progress toward the Strategy\u2019s  objectives, we reviewed Strategy documents, including monitoring and  evaluation plans, to assess if they included key elements of effective  strategies that we have identified as related to assessment of progress  toward strategic goals. We developed these elements on the basis of  prior work related to U.S. government strategies and interagency  collaboration as well as prior work on addressing fragmentation, overlap,  and duplication in the federal government. Our prior work suggests that  strategic documents offer an opportunity to consider the roles and  responsibilities of various stakeholders involved in achieving those goals,  and information on how progress toward those goals will be measured.  The Strategy documents were reviewed and rated by two analysts to  determine the extent the planning and reporting procedures aligned with  the key elements for foreign assistance strategies in situations where  multiple agencies work together to deliver foreign assistance. These  elements related to (1) delineation of agencies\u2019 roles and responsibilities  and coordination mechanisms; and (2) assessment of progress toward  strategic goals, including identifying activities to achieve results,  performance indicators, and monitoring and evaluation plans.  Additionally, in assessing the monitoring and evaluation plan, we considered the Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government,  which specify that managers should identify the information needed to  achieve objectives and use such information to evaluate performance in  achieving objectives.", "To determine State and USAID\u2019s rationale for not including other  agencies\u2019 activities that support the objectives of the Strategy, we met  with State and USAID officials in Washington, D.C. We also reviewed  relevant Strategy documents and Congressional legislation, particularly  Public Law 115-31, 131, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017,  which State and USAID cited as the basis for the creation of the  Strategy\u2019s results architecture and monitoring and evaluation plan.", "To support our work on all three objectives, we conducted fieldwork in El  Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. During the fieldwork, we observed  selected project activities, and interviewed agency officials, implementing  partners, and project beneficiaries about the project activities and results,  and factors that affected project results. We also interviewed agency  officials in Washington, D.C. from relevant State bureaus, USAID, DOD,  and USDA Foreign Agricultural Service as well as officials of the U.S.  Southern Command in Doral, Florida about project activities, project  results, factors affecting results and actions to address these factors, as  well as efforts to monitor and evaluate project results.", "We conducted this performance audit from December 2017 to September  2019 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

We are not recommending that State direct DOD and USDA to  monitor and evaluate projects, but rather that State collaborate with  DOD and USDA to develop a more comprehensive approach to  monitoring and evaluating projects that support the Strategy\u2019s  objectives and that State document the results of this collaboration in  the Strategy\u2019s monitoring and evaluation plan. We do not prescribe  the format or content for how the Strategy\u2019s monitoring and evaluation  plan might be updated. We have modified relevant sections of our  report and our recommendation to make this clearer and directed the  recommendation to the Secretary of State, since State coordinates  implementation of the Strategy by the various agencies of the U.S.  government. We found that DOD and USDA have designed and  implemented programs that directly support the objectives of the  Strategy. While we acknowledge that some coordination among  agencies occurs in Washington and in the Northern Triangle, we  found that such coordination does not formally extend to monitoring  and evaluation. We believe that our recommendation encourages  greater coordination among agencies, including DOD and USDA, by  ensuring that monitoring and evaluation efforts by U.S. government  agencies are in sync with the monitoring and evaluation plan for the  Strategy. Excluding DOD and USDA projects from the monitoring and  evaluation plan for the Strategy will continue to result in an incomplete  or unclear understanding of the results of U.S. assistance in the  Northern Triangle. Without a complete and clear understanding of the  results across all agencies involved, agencies may miss important  lessons about the types of assistance that are effective in achieving  U.S. objectives in the region, potentially limiting overall progress.  2.  While the explanatory statement accompanying Pub. L. No. 114-113  directs State, in coordination with USAID, to develop a monitoring and  evaluation plan for funds appropriated to them, we are recommending  that State, as coordinator for the implementation of the Strategy, work  with the other agencies to develop a more comprehensive approach  to monitoring and evaluating projects that support the Strategy\u2019s  objectives, and that they utilize the monitoring and evaluation plan  that they have already created in response to the congressional  direction as a place to document the comprehensive approach to  monitoring and evaluation.  3.  We chose to review all agencies that have allocated a significant  amount of funding from their appropriations to implement projects in  support of prosperity, governance, and security objectives in the  Northern Triangle. State, USAID, DOD, and USDA officials confirmed  that DOD and USDA projects support the objectives of the Strategy,  and we believe that the inclusion of these agencies enhanced the  accuracy and completeness of our reporting on the results that have  been achieved from U.S. assistance as well as the gaps in the current  monitoring and evaluation approach and implications for State\u2019s ability  to assess results comprehensively.  4.  We believe our inclusion of projects implemented from fiscal years  2013 through 2018 provided a reasonable time frame for our review  because it includes projects that supported the objectives of improving  prosperity, governance, and security\u2014long standing objectives of  U.S. assistance to the Northern Triangle that predated appropriations  for the Strategy, and even the Strategy itself. Including projects  implemented between fiscal years 2013 and 2018 increased our  ability to report on the results of agencies\u2019 projects and their overall  progress toward the Strategy\u2019s objectives because projects funded  since fiscal year 2016 were in too early a stage of implementation to  report meaningfully on such results. However, we considered, as  appropriate, any results information we were able to obtain on such  projects.  5.  We acknowledge that the precision of our estimates for reporting on  funding allocations was limited due to the inconsistent nature of  reporting of financial data by different bureaus and agencies.  However, taking into consideration qualifications noted throughout our  report, we believe that our reporting of funding allocations provides a  reliable description of how agencies used allocated funding from fiscal  years 2013 through 2018 to support prosperity, governance, and  security objectives in the Northern Triangle.   6.  We believe that our classification of projects under the different  sectors we identified enabled us to provide a more detailed,  comprehensive, and meaningful analysis of projects and related  results. Because some of the sub-objectives that State and USAID  developed, such as \u201creduce poverty,\u201d were very broad and did not  lend themselves to an analysis of specific project sectors that  supported the Strategy\u2019s objectives, we identified more specific  sectors, including health, economic growth, and agricultural  development. State and USAID officials validated the accuracy of our  definitions, and we revised them as appropriate, given input from  agency officials.  7.  Our selection of six sectors for in-depth review of projects and results  limits the generalizability of our findings to all sectors, which we note.   Due to the large number of projects, sectors, and sub-objectives  associated with U.S. assistance to the Northern Triangle, we  determined that a case study approach was the most effective  methodology for our review. We devised selection criteria for our case  study to reflect a meaningful selection of projects supporting each of  the three objectives across a range of sectors, agencies, and  countries. Moreover, two of the sectors we selected for in-depth  review\u2014community based violence prevention and justice reform\u2014 encompass several projects classified as relating to \u201creducing  violence at the local level,\u201d and \u201creducing the influence of organized  crime and gangs.\u201d Thus our report addresses results in these sectors.  We omitted projects relating to police professionalization, in part,  because we had ongoing work related to this sector. We acknowledge  limitations with this case study approach and do not attempt to  generalize results beyond the sectors we reviewed, but we believe our  methodological approach provided a reasonable basis for our overall  conclusions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: Comments from the U.S. Agency for International Development", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1.  We eliminated the recommendation to USAID because State plays a  coordinating role in the Strategy\u2019s implementation and is well  positioned to work collaboratively with officials of other agencies,  including DOD and USDA. We believe our recommendation to State,  in which we recommend that they work with USAID, encourages  greater coordination among agencies, including DOD and USDA, to  ensure that their efforts are included in a comprehensive monitoring  and evaluation plan for the Strategy.  2.  We believe our inclusion of projects implemented from fiscal years  2013 through 2018 provided a reasonable time frame for our review  because it included projects agencies implemented to support the  long standing objectives of prosperity, governance, and security in the  Northern Triangle\u2014objectives that the U.S. government has  supported under various initiatives that predated the Strategy and  appropriations for the Strategy. Furthermore, including projects  implemented between fiscal years 2013 and 2018 increased our  ability to report on the results of agencies\u2019 projects and their overall  progress toward prosperity, governance, and security because  projects funded since fiscal year 2016 were in too early a stage of  implementation to report meaningfully on results. However, we  considered, as appropriate, any results information we were able to  obtain on such projects.   3.  We requested and reviewed all USAID evaluations completed during  the time frame for our review\u2014from fiscal years 2013 through 2018 or  October 2012 through September 2018\u2014to gain insight into the  results of projects supporting the long standing U.S. assistance  objectives of prosperity, governance, and security in the Northern  Triangle. While we reviewed four evaluations that USAID completed  at the beginning of fiscal year 2013, as shown in appendix III, three of  these were mid-point evaluations of ongoing projects that continued  implementation in fiscal years 2013 and 2014, during the time frame  for our review. Although we reviewed one final evaluation of a project  that had ended prior to the beginning of fiscal year 2013, the  evaluation was a key aspect of the project\u2019s implementation and  lessons learned, which provided information pertinent to future USAID  programming in the areas of justice reform and security. Furthermore,  while our report noted examples of actions that agencies took in  response to challenges to achieving progress toward prosperity,  governance, and security, analysis of actions taken in the design of  specific projects based on the findings and recommendations of the  evaluations we reviewed was outside the scope of our review.    4.  We believe that our classification of projects under different sectors  we identified provides a detailed, comprehensive, and meaningful  analysis of projects and related results. Because some of the sub- objectives developed by State and USAID, such as \u201creduce poverty,\u201d  were very broad and did not lend themselves to an analysis of specific  project sectors that supported the Strategy\u2019s objectives, we identified  more specific sectors, including health, economic growth, and  agricultural development. State and USAID validated the accuracy of  our definitions, and we revised them as appropriate, given input from  agency officials. We acknowledge that our selection of a judgmental  sample of six sectors for in-depth review of projects and results limits  the generalizability of our findings to all sectors, which we noted  throughout our draft report. However, due to the large number of  projects, sectors, and sub-objectives associated with U.S. assistance  to the Northern Triangle and the extensive amount of documentation  to obtain and analyze for each project, we determined that this case  study approach was the most effective methodology for our review.  We devised our selection criteria for our case study to reflect a  meaningful selection of a significant number of projects across  objectives, sectors, agencies, and countries. We do not believe that  omitting some sectors from our in-depth review limited the credibility  of the findings of our report.  5.  We believe that the use of data on the achievement of annual targets  is a valid approach to assessing project results, although the agencies  collecting the data may also intend to use it in making decisions about  the progress of ongoing projects. These data were only one element  of our analysis. We also analyzed data and information from USAID  implementer progress reports, mid-point and final evaluations, and  other performance reports, which provided a longer-term perspective  on results. Collectively, we believe that this information provided  meaningful insight into the successes and shortcomings of the  projects in the sectors we reviewed. Our report acknowledges that  agency officials described progress and challenges to achieving the  prosperity, governance, and security objectives, as well as the steps  taken to modify projects to address such challenges. However, such  modifications fell outside the scope of our analysis of results, absent  documentation of the specific impact of such modifications on the  achievement of objectives.  6.  We reviewed completed evaluations to provide insight into project  results, but excluded ongoing and planned evaluations because  conclusions about project results are not available until such  evaluations are completed. Similarly, our draft report acknowledged  that agency officials described progress and challenges to achieving  the prosperity, governance, and security objectives, as well as the  steps taken to modify projects to address such challenges. However,  such modifications fell outside the scope of our analysis of results,  absent documentation of their specific impact on the achievement of  prosperity, governance, and security objectives."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VII: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comment", "paragraphs": ["1.  We believe that the inclusion of DOD projects significantly enhanced  the accuracy and completeness of our reporting on the projects that  the U.S. government has implemented in the Northern Triangle from  fiscal years 2013 through 2018, and the important lessons learned  from these projects on progress toward the Strategy\u2019s objectives.   State and DOD officials confirmed that DOD has designed and  implemented projects from its appropriation that support the security  objective of the Strategy in the Northern Triangle. Furthermore, we  are not recommending that State and USAID specify how DOD  monitors and evaluates such projects, but rather that State and  USAID collaborate with DOD to specify a comprehensive approach to  the monitoring and evaluation of projects across all agencies that  directly support the Strategy\u2019s objectives. Excluding DOD projects  from the monitoring and evaluation plan for the Strategy could result  in an incomplete or unclear understanding of the results of U.S.  assistance in the Northern Triangle.
