From 1985 through 1994, the number of working-age DI and SSI beneficiaries (aged 18 to 64) increased 59 percent, from 4.0 million to 6.3 million, and cash benefits (adjusted for inflation) increased 66 percent.This magnitude of growth has caused concerns that are compounded by the fact that less than half of 1 percent of DI beneficiaries ever leave the rolls by returning to work.", "In our recent study of SSA\u2019s disability programs, we reported that despite the magnitude of program growth, SSA has not improved its emphasis and efforts in returning disability beneficiaries to the workplace. By contrast, the private sector, in response to growth in disability, has begun developing and implementing strategies to improve return-to-work programs for disabled workers. Moreover, the emphasis on return to work is not limited to the private sector in the United States\u2014disability programs financed by social insurance systems in other countries also focus on return to work and have implemented practices similar to those in the U.S. private sector.", "This report focuses on identifying return-to-work practices in the private sector and other countries that may hold lessons for improving SSA\u2019s return-to-work efforts. Improving SSA\u2019s return-to-work efforts has important implications not only for the individuals who can return to productive activity in the workplace, but also for controlling the costs of federal disability programs. SSA estimates that lifetime cash benefit payments are reduced by about $60,000 when a DI beneficiary leaves the rolls by returning to work and by about $30,000 when an SSI disability beneficiary leaves the rolls by returning to work.", "In comparison with the workers served by private sector programs, many people with disabilities served by SSA have little or no work history or current job skills. SSA also serves a population with a wide range of disabilities that often may be more severe than the disabilities of the average person served by private sector programs. For example, many workers served by private sector programs have short-term disabilities, which SSA\u2019s programs do not cover. SSA serves people with long-term disabilities, many of whom have not been successful in returning to work through private sector programs. Thus, SSA may face greater difficulty in returning some of its clients to the workplace.", "However, the experiences of Germany and Sweden show that return-to-work strategies are applicable to a population with a wide range of work histories, job skills, and disabilities. Moreover, even relatively small gains in return-to-work successes offer the potential for significant savings in program outlays. For example, if an additional 1 percent of the 6.3 million beneficiaries were to leave SSA\u2019s disability rolls by returning to work, lifetime cash benefits would be reduced by an estimated $2.9 billion."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Magnitude of Disability Costs Has Turned Private Sector\u2019s Attention to Improving Return-to-Work Programs", "paragraphs": ["The magnitude of disability costs has caused growing concern in the private sector. Some disability-related costs borne by the private sector are more obvious than others. The most apparent costs include insurance premiums, cash benefits, rehabilitation benefits, and medical benefits paid through workers\u2019 compensation and employer-sponsored disability insurance programs. Workers\u2019 compensation laws require employers to bear the cost of disabilities caused by an individual\u2019s job, and some employers offer short-term or long-term insurance or both for disabilities not caused by the individual\u2019s job. However, in addition to the costs of such programs, there may be other, less obvious costs such as payments to employees who must work overtime, the added expense of training and using temporary workers, and retraining disabled employees when they return to work. Taking such costs into account, studies have estimated that the employer\u2019s full cost of disability ranges from 6 to 12 percent of payroll.", "At one time, the common business practice was to encourage someone with a disability to leave the workforce. In recent years, however, concern has grown about the effect of disability on costs, productivity, competitiveness, and employee and customer relations. As a result, the private sector has begun to develop and implement strategies for helping disabled workers return to work as quickly as possible. These efforts include intervening as soon as possible after a disabling event occurs, helping the worker set return-to-work goals, providing the services the worker needs to return to work, and offering incentives that encourage return to work. Similar approaches have also been implemented in the social insurance disability programs of other countries.", "To develop information on private sector return-to-work practices for this report, we surveyed 21 people from the private sector recognized for their involvement in developing disability management programs that focus on return to work. As well as working to develop return-to-work programs within their own companies, all 21 have been actively involved in efforts by the Washington Business Group on Health or the Health Insurance Association of America to develop and promote such programs. As a group, these 21 individuals represented extensive experience in managing disability under workers\u2019 compensation and disability insurance programs. We conducted in-depth interviews with five respondents to supplement the survey responses. (See app. I for a list of individuals contacted during our review.)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SSA\u2019s Return-to-Work Efforts Have Been Static", "paragraphs": ["Technological, medical, and societal changes have increased the potential for more people with disabilities to work, and some SSA data indicate that as many as 3 out of 10 persons on the disability rolls may be good candidates for return to work. However, few beneficiaries ever leave the rolls by returning to work. For example, less than half of 1 percent of the beneficiaries have left the DI program annually during the last several years because they returned to work, according to SSA data.", "As we recently reported, SSA focuses little attention on returning beneficiaries to the workplace. SSA\u2019s capacity to identify and assist in expanding beneficiaries\u2019 productive capacities have been limited by weaknesses in the design and implementation of the DI and SSI programs. SSA does not have a system for functionally evaluating each individual\u2019s return-to-work potential and identifying the return-to-work services needed by those who have the potential to return to the workplace. Instead, SSA\u2019s primary focus is on processing disability applications to determine whether applicants meet disability criteria and then paying benefits to those found eligible."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DI and SSI Program Structure", "paragraphs": ["The DI and SSI programs pay disability benefits to people who have long-term disabilities. To be eligible for benefits, an adult must have a medically determinable physical or mental impairment that (1) is expected to last at least 1 year or result in death and (2) prevents the individual from engaging in substantial gainful activity. Regulations currently define substantial gainful activity as work that produces countable earnings of more than $500 a month for disabled individuals and $960 a month for individuals who are blind. Furthermore, to qualify, an individual not only must be unable to do his or her previous work, but\u2014considering age, education, and work experience\u2014the individual also must be unable to do any other kind of substantial work that exists in the national economy.", "Although both programs use the same definition of disability, they differ in important ways. Established under title II of the Social Security Act, DI is an insurance program funded by payroll taxes paid by workers and their employers into a Social Security trust fund. Similar to private long-term disability insurance programs, the DI program is for workers who have lost their source of income because of long-term disability. To be insured under DI, an individual must have worked for certain minimum periods with a specified minimum level of earnings in jobs covered by Social Security. Reflecting the program\u2019s long-term disability character, DI benefits generally cannot begin until 5 months after the onset of disability. Medicare coverage is provided to beneficiaries 24 months after entitlement to DI cash benefits commences.", "By contrast, the SSI program, established under title XVI of the Social Security Act, is not an insurance program and has no prior work requirements. Financed from general tax revenues, SSI is a means-tested income assistance program for disabled, blind, or aged individuals who have low income and limited resources, regardless of work history.Unlike the DI program in which benefits generally cannot begin until 5 months after disability onset, SSI benefits begin immediately upon entitlement. In most cases, SSI entitlement makes an individual eligible for Medicaid benefits.", "Because the SSI program is a means-tested income assistance program with no work history requirements, many of the beneficiaries it serves may have different characteristics than those served by private sector programs. By definition, individuals qualify for employer-sponsored disability benefits because they were employed at the time they became disabled. They therefore have recent work histories and current job skills when they apply for benefits. In contrast, many SSI applicants have little or no recent work history or current job skills. An SSA study in 1994 found that 42 percent of SSI applicants reported leaving their last job more than 12 months before applying for benefits, and another 27 percent said they did not know when they left their last job.", "When individuals apply for DI or SSI disability benefits, SSA relies on state Disability Determination Services, agencies that are funded by SSA, to determine the medical eligibility of applicants. If found disabled, the beneficiary receives benefits until he or she dies, converts to Social Security retirement at age 65, or is determined by SSA to be no longer eligible for benefits because of earnings or medical improvement. The law requires SSA to conduct a continuing disability review (CDR) at least once every 3 years to redetermine the eligibility of DI beneficiaries if medical improvement is possible or expected. Otherwise, SSA is required to schedule a CDR at least once every 7 years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Redesign of SSA\u2019s Disability Programs Needed to Encourage Return to Work", "paragraphs": ["SSA\u2019s process for determining disability generally does not directly assess each applicant\u2019s functional capacity to work. The Social Security Act defines disability in terms of the existence of physical or mental impairments that are demonstrable by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques. In implementing the act through its regulations, SSA has developed a Listing of Impairments (generally referred to as \u201cthe listings\u201d) identifying some medical conditions that are presumed to be sufficient in themselves to preclude individuals from engaging in substantial gainful employment. The presumed link between inability to work and presence of such medical conditions establishes the basis for SSA\u2019s award of disability benefits.", "According to SSA, the medical conditions identified in the listings serve as proxies for functional evaluations because such impairments are presumed to be severe enough to impose functional restrictions sufficient to preclude any substantial gainful activity. According to SSA data, about 70 percent of new awardees are found to be eligible because their conditions meet or equal listed impairments that serve as proxies for functional assessments of ability to work. Only the remaining 30 percent of new awardees are eligible because they have been further evaluated on the basis of separately developed nonmedical factors, including residual functional capacity, age, education, and vocational skills.", "Relevant studies, however, indicate that the scientific link between medical condition and work incapacity is weak. While it is reasonable to expect that some medical impairments will completely prevent individuals from engaging in any minimal work activity (for example, those who are quadriplegic with profound mental retardation), it is less clear that some other impairments that qualify individuals for disability benefits completely prevent individuals from engaging in any substantial gainful activity (for example, those who are missing both feet). Moreover, while most medical impairments may have some influence over the extent to which an individual is capable of engaging in gainful activity, other factors\u2014vocational, psychological, economic, environmental, and motivational\u2014are often considered to be more important determinants of work capacity.", "Beyond the issue of whether SSA\u2019s eligibility determination process adequately assesses work capacity, the process itself diverts the applicant\u2019s attention from the possibility of returning to work. Instead, the process focuses the applicant\u2019s attention on proving that he or she is unable to work. From the moment an individual applies for disability benefits, SSA\u2019s eligibility determination process (which can take from a minimum of several months to 18 months or longer for individuals who initially are denied and appeal) focuses on proving or disproving that the individual meets SSA\u2019s disability definition, not on assessing how the individual could be helped to return to work.", "The eligibility determination process itself may erode motivation to work. By the time applicants are approved to receive benefits, they have been through a lengthy process that requires them to prove an inability to work; they have testified about their disabilities before program officials and the health care community; family and friends may have helped to demonstrate their work incapacity; and being out of the workforce may have eroded their marketability. These factors are believed to reduce receptivity to any efforts aimed at returning to work.", "The Social Security Act states that people applying for disability benefits should be promptly referred to state vocational rehabilitation agencies for services to maximize the number of such individuals who could return to productive activity. The Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, authorizes the Department of Education\u2019s vocational rehabilitation program, which provides federal funds to a network of state vocational rehabilitation agencies, to operate the country\u2019s public vocational rehabilitation program. The federal share of funding for these services is about 80 percent; the states pay the balance.", "Under current procedures, the Disability Determination Service in each state decides whether to refer DI and SSI applicants to state vocational rehabilitation agencies, which in turn decide whether to offer them services such as guidance, counseling, and job placement, as well as therapy and training. In practice, the Disability Determination Services refer, on average, only about 8 percent of DI and SSI beneficiaries to state vocational rehabilitation agencies, and we have estimated that less than 10 percent of those referred actually were accepted as clients. In total, these state agencies have little impact on DI and SSI, successfully rehabilitating only about 1 out of every 1,000 beneficiaries, on average, each year.", "State vocational rehabilitation agencies may be cautious about accepting DI beneficiaries because SSA does not contribute to the cost of services these agencies provide unless a beneficiary successfully returns to work.For payment purposes, SSA defines success as returning to work for 9 continuous months with earnings at the substantial gainful activity level; whereas, state vocational rehabilitation agencies, on the basis of Rehabilitation Services Administration regulations, define success for all other clients as placing the individual in suitable employment, paid or unpaid, for 60 days. In early 1996, SSA began collecting information on the number of referrals from Disability Determination Services that the state vocational rehabilitation agencies accept. This step is the starting point of the SSA\u2019s implementation of new regulations allowing it to use vocational rehabilitation service providers other than state agencies.", "Whether beneficiaries receive vocational rehabilitation services when such services would be most effective is also an issue. SSA does not have access to disabled workers until they come to SSA to apply for benefits. SSA survey results indicate that nearly half of DI and SSI applicants with work histories have not worked for more than 6 months immediately before applying to SSA for disability benefits. But even after they apply, vocational rehabilitation services can be delayed for long periods because, generally, SSA does not refer anyone for those services until he or she has been approved as a beneficiary\u2014a process that can take several months and may take 18 months or longer.", "DI and SSI disability beneficiaries may not view returning to work as an attractive option because, by doing so, they risk losing the security of a guaranteed monthly income and medical coverage. To reduce this risk, the Congress has established incentive provisions to safeguard cash and medical benefits while a beneficiary tries to return to work. However, because of weaknesses in design and implementation, these incentives have not encouraged many beneficiaries to attempt to return to work. The work incentives do not appear sufficient to overcome the prospect of a drop in income for many who face low-wage employment or to allay the fear of losing medical coverage and possibly other federal and state assistance."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Private Sector Programs for Disabled Workers", "paragraphs": ["Private sector businesses underwrite all or part of two primary disability benefit programs for disabled workers: workers\u2019 compensation programs and employer-sponsored disability insurance plans.

For example, the threshold amount in 1994 was $17,480 in Pennsylvania and $22,268 in California.", "In Germany and Sweden, loss or retention of health care insurance is not an issue in a worker\u2019s decision on whether to participate in rehabilitation or attempt returning to work.

When asked to rate the importance of including this requirement in a model disability management program, however, the respondents gave it a mean rating of 4.1. This relatively high rating is consistent with one study that found that return-to-work efforts cannot be nurtured in an environment in which, among other things, participation in a vocational rehabilitation program is entirely voluntary.", "Some respondents stated that the ability to require cooperation as a condition of eligibility for benefits is important because it can help motivate an individual with a disability to try to return to work. At the same time, however, some respondents cautioned that such a requirement must be invoked carefully because a company could spend money on return-to-work efforts for individuals who participate because they feel compelled but ultimately do not return to work because of a basic lack of motivation. The Social Security Act provides for withholding benefits if a beneficiary refuses without good cause to accept rehabilitation services.", "In Germany and Sweden, individuals may also be denied benefits for not participating in or cooperating with rehabilitation when it is recommended by one of the insurance offices. For example, the pension insurance funds in Germany can deny an individual rehabilitation benefits or a disability pension if they do not participate in or sufficiently cooperate with the recommended rehabilitation program. Similarly, if someone refuses to participate in training because that person would rather receive an unemployment benefit than undergo rehabilitation, the employment office can stop his or her benefits. The social insurance offices in Sweden may also revoke benefits, including pension benefits, for those who refuse to participate in vocational rehabilitation. We do not have information on the extent to which these provisions are actually invoked in Germany and Sweden."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions, Recommendation, and Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["Disability managers we surveyed spend money on return-to-work efforts because they believe such efforts are good investments that reduce disability-related costs. Social insurance programs in Germany and Sweden also spend money on return-to-work efforts to reduce disability costs, and their goals stress the importance of work in integrating people with disabilities into the broader social community.", "Improving the success of SSA\u2019s return-to-work efforts offers great potential for reducing federal disability program costs while helping people with disabilities return to productive activity in the workplace. If an additional 1 percent of the 6.3 million DI and SSI working-age beneficiaries were to leave the disability rolls by returning to work, lifetime cash benefits would be reduced by an estimated $2.9 billion. With such large potential savings, return-to-work services could be viewed as investments rather than as program outlays.", "In our current study of return-to-work practices, we identified three basic strategies employed in the U.S. private sector as well as in social insurance programs in Germany and Sweden. These strategies, which must be integrated to form a comprehensive return-to-work program, are as follows:", "Provide services and assistance sooner rather than later to promote and facilitate return to work. Identify and provide necessary return-to-work assistance and manage cases to achieve goals.", "Structure cash and medical benefits to encourage return to work.", "Lessons from the private sector and other countries\u2019 social insurance programs argue for SSA placing greater priority on assessing return-to-work potential soon after individuals come to SSA and apply for disability benefits. Currently, when an individual comes to SSA and applies for DI or SSI benefits, SSA\u2019s priority is to determine eligibility for cash benefits. The need for medical and vocational rehabilitation is not addressed until after applicants have been approved to receive cash benefits, which can take up to 18 months or longer from the time an application is filed.", "In conjunction with making an early assessment of return-to-work potential, SSA needs to place greater priority on identifying and providing, at the earliest appropriate time, the medical and vocational rehabilitation services needed to return to work. Currently, SSA bases 70 percent of its awards on whether an individual\u2019s medical symptoms, signs, and diagnostic results match SSA\u2019s Listing of Impairments that are presumed to prevent work. It does not evaluate whether these people could return to work if given appropriate assistance. To improve return-to-work outcomes and to identify the services needed, SSA needs to place greater emphasis on functionally evaluating work capacity.", "Under the current legislative design, SSA provides vocational rehabilitation services too late in the process. In addition, neither DI nor SSI applicants are eligible for medical rehabilitation benefits under Medicare or Medicaid, respectively, until they are approved for cash benefits through the lengthy eligibility determination process. And, in the DI program, the provision of medical rehabilitation is further delayed because Medicare eligibility does not begin until 24 months after applicants are approved to receive cash benefits.", "Finally, cash and medical benefits need to encourage beneficiaries to return to work. The current design of cash and medical benefits in the DI and SSI programs often presents more hindrances than incentives when beneficiaries consider returning to work. The structure of cash benefits can make it financially advantageous to remain on the disability rolls, and studies report that DI and SSI beneficiaries fear losing their premium-free Medicare or Medicaid benefits if they return to work.", "The experiences of the social insurance programs in Germany and Sweden show that the utility of return-to-work strategies is not confined to the private sector. Although SSA faces constraints in applying these strategies, we believe steps should be taken earlier to better identify and provide appropriate return-to-work assistance to those who could return to work. Even relatively small gains in return-to-work successes offer the potential for significant savings in program outlays."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Recommendation to the Commissioner of SSA", "paragraphs": ["Our recent report, SSA Disability: Program Redesign Necessary to Encourage Return to Work, recommended that the Commissioner of SSA place greater priority on return to work, including designing a more effective means to identify and expand beneficiaries\u2019 work capacities and better implementation of existing return-to-work mechanisms. In line with placing greater emphasis on return to work, we recommend that the Commissioner develop a comprehensive return-to-work strategy that integrates, as appropriate, earlier intervention, earlier identification and provision of necessary return-to-work assistance for applicants and beneficiaries, and changes in the structure of cash and medical benefits. The Commissioner should also identify legislative changes needed to implement such a program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["In commenting on a draft of this report, SSA agreed much can be learned from the return-to-work practices of the U.S. private sector and disability programs in Germany and Sweden. SSA stated that it is already placing a high priority on return to work and cited a number of actions SSA has taken to implement its return-to-work initiative, such as expanding the pool of vocational rehabilitation service providers. Although these actions are in the right direction, we believe they do not constitute the fundamental redirection of goals and practices necessary to move the DI and SSI programs to a much greater emphasis on return to work. For example, increasing the number of vocational rehabilitation providers does not address the concern of earlier intervention. Fundamental redesign is needed because SSA\u2019s disability programs are designed to be cash benefits programs, not return-to-work programs.", "Consistent with our recommendation that SSA should identify legislative changes needed to implement a return-to-work program, SSA noted that the law does not provide for, or even allow, many of the return-to-work strategies discussed in our report. Within this context, however, SSA affirmed that it is interested in determining whether the return-to-work practices of other systems could be useful in SSA\u2019s attempts to improve the return-to-work rate of its disability beneficiaries. SSA emphasized that, for such efforts to be fruitful, all players in the complex network of federal disability policy development and program execution would need to be involved, including several federal departments and agencies, state disability and rehabilitation programs, private sector providers, insurance representatives, and employer/union groups as well as the numerous congressional committees that have roles in the development of legislation or in budget approval for the kinds of solutions described in our report. We agree that it is important for all relevant parties to be involved in policy development and program execution. However, as the primary manager of multibillion-dollar programs and as the entity with fiduciary responsibility for the trust funds, SSA must take the lead in forging the partnerships and cooperation that will be needed in redesigning the federal disability programs. SSA also made a number of technical comments, which we incorporated where appropriate.
