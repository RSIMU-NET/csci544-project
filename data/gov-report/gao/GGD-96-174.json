In addition, we agreed to assess ATF\u2019s overall legal interpretation of the data restrictions.

A critical component of ATF\u2019s criminal enforcement mission is the tracing of firearms used in crimes to identify the last known purchaser of a firearm. To accomplish its criminal enforcement responsibilities, ATF has 22 field divisions, headed by special agents in charge, located throughout the United States.", "To efficiently and effectively carry out its enforcement responsibilities, ATF maintains certain computerized information on firearms and firearms purchasers. Over the years, Congress has tried to balance the law enforcement need for this information with the competing interest of protecting the privacy of firearms owners. To achieve this balance, Congress has required federal firearms licensees to provide ATF certain information about firearms transactions and the ownership of firearms while placing restrictions on ATF\u2019s maintenance and use of such data.", "The Gun Control Act of 1968, as amended, established a system requiring federal firearms licensees to record firearms transactions, maintain that information at their business premises, and make these records available to ATF for inspection and search under certain prescribed circumstances.The system was intended to permit law enforcement officials to trace firearms involved in crimes while allowing the records themselves to be maintained by the licensees rather than by a governmental entity. Through the use of these records, ATF provides firearms tracing services to federal, state, local, and foreign law enforcement agencies. To carry out its firearms tracing responsibilities, ATF maintains a firearms tracing operation at the National Tracing Center in Falling Waters, West Virginia. The Center traces firearms suspected of being involved in crimes to the last known purchaser to assist law enforcement in identifying suspects. Appendix II provides a detailed description and flowchart of ATF\u2019s tracing operation.", "Since the passage of the Gun Control Act, Congress has enacted two provisions that place restrictions on ATF\u2019s handling of federal firearms licensee records. Since fiscal year 1979, the annual Treasury appropriation act generally has prohibited ATF from using appropriated funds in connection with consolidating or centralizing the records of acquisition and disposition of firearms maintained by federal firearms licensees.", "In addition, a provision of the Firearms Owners\u2019 Protection Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-308, 100 Stat. 449 (May 19, 1986)), codified at 18 U.S.C. 926(a), prohibits ATF from issuing any rule or regulation, after the date of that act, requiring that (1) firearms licensee records (or any portion of the contents of the records) be recorded at or transferred to a facility owned, managed, or controlled by the United States or any state or any political subdivision thereof or (2) any system of registration of firearms, firearms owners, or firearms transactions or dispositions be established. Further, section 926(a) provides that ATF\u2019s authority to inquire into the disposition of a firearm during a criminal investigation is not restricted or expanded by this section. The act also limited ATF\u2019s authority to require reports from licensees to those specified by statute and codified several reporting requirements that ATF had previously imposed on licensees by regulation, including those related to out-of-business licensee records and reports of multiple handgun (pistols and/or revolvers) sales."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To address our objectives, we reviewed ATF documents and data and discussed ATF policies and operations with agency officials. We obtained from ATF officials descriptions of national data systems that ATF officials determined were related to firearms, including those that contained retail firearms purchaser data. Although we reviewed the descriptive data provided by ATF on the firearms-related data systems, with the exception of the Out-of-Business Records and the Multiple Sales Systems, we did not verify whether these or any other ATF data systems contained retail firearms purchaser data or observe system operations. We reviewed relevant laws and ATF regulations, legal opinions, and documents relating to ATF\u2019s firearms tracing, out-of-business records, and multiple sale reports processing operations. We also observed and conducted some tests of these operations and discussed them with officials at ATF\u2019s National Tracing Center.

ATF has established national data systems to maintain the data it collects from the firearms industry, including federal firearms licensees.", "To identify ATF national data systems that contain retail firearms purchaser data, we requested from ATF a description of its national data systems that relate to firearms. ATF identified and provided documentation on 14 national data systems and 4 subsystems relating to firearms. Appendix III provides a brief description of these systems and subsystems.", "ATF indicated that five systems and one subsystem contain retail firearms purchaser data.

This ensured that ATF had access to these records for its tracing operation. In 1986, the Firearms Owners\u2019 Protection Act codified this regulatory reporting requirement.Accordingly, since the enactment of the Gun Control Act, ATF has maintained the out-of-business records at a central location, currently the National Tracing Center.", "Before fiscal year 1991, ATF maintained these records in hard copy in boxes, with a file number assigned to each firearms licensee. If ATF determined during a trace that a firearm had been sold by a firearms licensee who was out of business and had sent in its records, an ATF employee was to locate the boxes containing the records and manually search them for the appropriate serial number. According to ATF, this was a time-consuming and labor-intensive process, which also created storage problems for ATF.", "In 1991, ATF began a major project to microfilm these records and destroy the originals. In fiscal year 1992, ATF began using a minicomputer to create a computerized index of the microfilm records containing the information necessary to identify whether ATF had a record relating to a firearm being traced. The index contains the following information: (1) the cartridge number of the microfilm; (2) an index number; (3) the serial number of the firearm; (4) the federal firearms licensee number; and (5) the type of document on microfilm, i.e., a Firearms Transaction Record (ATF Form 4473) or acquisition and disposition logbook pages. The index information that is entered into the minicomputer is stored on a database in ATF\u2019s mainframe computer to allow searches of the index information. The other information, including the firearms purchaser\u2019s name or other identifying information and the firearms manufacturer, type, and model, remains stored on microfilm cartridges and is not computerized. Appendix V provides a more detailed description of the Out-of-Business Records System along with pertinent statistical data.", "We believe that ATF\u2019s current Out-of-Business Records System complies with the data restrictions. With regard to 18 U.S.C. 926(a), as discussed earlier, it prohibits ATF from prescribing certain rules or regulations after the date of enactment of the Firearms Owners\u2019 Protection Act. At the same time it added the section 926(a) restriction, Congress codified at 18 U.S.C. 923(g)(4) the then-existing regulatory requirement that licensees who permanently go out of business send their records to ATF. ATF\u2019s current regulatory requirement concerning the out-of-business records predates the Firearms Owners\u2019 Protection Act, and is thus not subject to section 926(a).", "With regard to the annual appropriation rider, in our view, the Out-of-Business Records System does not violate the general prohibition on \u201cconsolidation or centralization\u201d of firearms acquisition and disposition records. The regulatory requirement that licensees send these records to ATF existed before the appropriation rider was first passed for fiscal year 1979, and there is no indication in the legislative history that the rider was intended to overturn ATF\u2019s existing practices concerning the acquisition or use of licensee information. According to ATF, the out-of-business records historically have been maintained at a central location.", "Moreover, the Firearms Owners\u2019 Protection Act provided ATF with specific statutory authority to collect these records. In the legislative history of the act, there is evidence that Congress considered placing constraints on ATF\u2019s maintenance of out-of-business records, but did not do so. The Senate-passed version of the act prohibited the Secretary of the Treasury from maintaining out-of-business records at a centralized location and from entering them into a computer for storage or retrieval. This restrictive provision was dropped from the version of the bill enacted by Congress.", "Lastly, in fiscal year 1992, Congress appropriated $650,000 \u201cfor improvement of information retrieval systems at the National Firearms Tracing Center.\u201d These funds were for the microfilming of the out-of-business records. For fiscal year 1995, Congress appropriated funds for the President\u2019s firearms initiative, which included a request for funding of the Out-of-Business Records System. Congress provided these funds in the same legislation that contained the rider restricting consolidation and centralization of licensee records. According to ATF, the system solved storage and trace timing problems, thereby enhancing ATF\u2019s tracing capabilities. At the same time, the system does not computerize certain key information, such as firearms purchaser information. In conclusion, we believe that the system for maintaining the out-of-business records does not violate either data restriction provision. (Our legal analysis of the Out-of-Business Records System is contained in app. VIII.)", "Furthermore, on the basis of our review of the Out-of-Business Records System documentation provided by ATF, our discussions with ATF officials, and our observation of the out-of-business records process, we believe that ATF was operating the system in a manner consistent with the way it was designed by ATF. During a visit to the Tracing Center, we observed that the Out-of-Business Records System does not permit the operator to enter the name or other identifying information of any firearm purchaser, or the type or model of any firearm. Thus, we found no evidence that ATF captures and stores firearms purchasers\u2019 names or other identifying information from the out-of-business records in an automated file."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Multiple Sales System", "paragraphs": ["Since 1975, federal firearms licensees have been required by regulationand subsequently by law to report all transactions in which an unlicensed person has acquired two or more pistols and/or revolvers at one time or during any 5 consecutive business days (called a multiple sale). The purpose of the multiple sale reporting requirement regulation was to enable ATF to \u201cmonitor and deter illegal interstate commerce in pistols and revolvers by unlicensed persons.\u201d According to ATF, that purpose has remained unchanged since 1975.", "In an August 1993 memorandum on gun dealer licensing, the President listed a number of steps that ATF could take to ensure compliance with federal firearms licensing requirements. These steps included, among other things, increasing scrutiny of licensees\u2019 multiple sale reports and providing automated access to those reports.", "In November 1995, ATF issued a new policy centralizing and computerizing multiple sale reports at its National Tracing Center. Prior to that time, ATF\u2019s criminal enforcement field divisions maintained multiple sale reports locally. To computerize the reports, ATF developed a Multiple Sales Subsystem as part of its Firearms Tracing System so that the reports could be entered directly into the Tracing System and used for tracing purposes. As of June 30, 1996, ATF had computerized about 91,600 multiple sale reports and associated 521 firearms traces with those reports. The head of the National Tracing Center estimated that in the future the Center will receive 130,000 multiple sale reports annually. In addition to using multiple sale reports for tracing purposes, ATF also provides multiple sale report data to its criminal enforcement field divisions through Project Lead for use in developing investigative leads, such as leads on firearms traffickers, straw purchasers, and federal firearms licensees who appear to be engaged in suspicious activity.", "Unlike the Out-of-Business Records System, reports entered into ATF\u2019s computerized Multiple Sales System are retrievable by firearm purchaser name. However, as part of its November 1995 policy, ATF adopted a requirement to purge firearms purchaser data in the system that were over 2 years old if they had not been linked to firearms traces. According to the Chief of the Firearms Enforcement Division, the primary reason for purging purchaser data over 2 years old is to delete data that may not be useful because of its age. In addition, the head of the Tracing Center said that ATF is sensitive for privacy reasons about retaining firearms purchaser data that may no longer be useful. Appendix VI provides a detailed description of the multiple sale reporting requirement and the data system along with pertinent statistical data.", "We believe that ATF\u2019s Multiple Sales System complies with the data restrictions. As discussed earlier, the prohibitions in section 926(a) only apply to certain rules or regulations prescribed after the enactment of the Firearms Owners\u2019 Protection Act. In the same act, Congress codified the then-existing regulatory requirement that federal firearms licensees prepare these multiple sale reports and forward them to ATF. ATF\u2019s current regulatory requirement concerning the multiple sale reports predates the Firearms Owners\u2019 Protection Act and thus is not subject to section 926(a).", "With regard to the annual appropriation rider, in our view, the Multiple Sales System does not violate the general prohibition on the \u201cconsolidation or centralization\u201d of firearms acquisition and disposition records. The requirement that licensees prepare these reports and send them to ATF existed in regulation before the first appropriation rider was passed in fiscal year 1979, and there is no indication in the legislative history that the rider was intended to overturn ATF\u2019s existing practices concerning the acquisition or use of licensee information.", "Although the multiple sale reports historically have been maintained at the field level, the provisions and legislative history of the Firearms Owners\u2019 Protection Act, which gave ATF specific statutory authority to collect these records, indicate that ATF would not be precluded from computerizing the multiple sale reports. The act requires that licensees send the reports \u201cto the office specified\u201d on the ATF form. Under this provision, ATF could specify that licensees forward the multiple sale reports to a central location. In addition, the legislative history of the act indicates that Congress considered placing constraints on ATF\u2019s maintenance of multiple sale reports but did not do so. The Senate-passed version of the Firearms Owners\u2019 Protection Act prohibited the Secretary of the Treasury from maintaining multiple sale reports at a centralized location and from entering them into a computer for storage or retrieval. This restrictive provision was dropped from the version of the bill enacted by Congress.", "Lastly, for fiscal year 1995, Congress appropriated funds to implement the President\u2019s firearms initiative, which included plans to automate multiple sale reports. Congress provided these funds in the same legislation that contained the rider restricting consolidation and centralization of licensee records. In conclusion, we believe that the Multiple Sales System does not violate either data restriction provision. (Our legal analysis of the Multiple Sales System is contained in app. VIII.)", "With regard to the operation of the Multiple Sales System, on the basis of our review and observations and discussions with ATF officials, we believe that ATF was, with one exception, operating the system in a manner consistent with its design. Our test of the Multiple Sales System at the Tracing Center showed that ATF\u2019s requirement to purge firearms purchaser data over 2 years old if not linked to firearms traces had not been fully implemented. At our request, a Tracing Center computer specialist queried the system for multiple sale records with sales dates over 2 years old. The results of this query identified 2,291 records (of the over 86,000 that had been entered) that contained purchaser data for sales over 2 years old. The computer specialist indicated that he thought multiple sale purchaser data over 2 years old had been purged during the last upgrade of the Firearms Tracing System. In July 1996, the Chief of the Firearms Enforcement Division provided us with documentation stating that the affected purchaser data had been purged from the Multiple Sales System and that future purges would be performed weekly. We did not verify whether the affected purchaser data were purged and whether weekly purges were being done.", "In addition, ATF officials also told us that while the 2-year purge requirement pertained to the Multiple Sales System at the Tracing Center, it was not being applied to multiple sale data maintained locally by ATF criminal enforcement field divisions through Project Lead. ATF had no requirement or mechanism for purging multiple sale purchaser data over 2 years old after it was received by field divisions. The Chief of the Firearms Enforcement Division told us that ATF planned to place Project Lead on its mainframe computer in about a year. At that time, ATF plans to apply the 2-year purge requirement to multiple sale data in Project Lead."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "In Response to Our Review, ATF Has Adopted a Broader Interpretation of the Data Restriction in the Annual Appropriation Rider", "paragraphs": ["ATF\u2019s interpretation of the data restrictions in the annual appropriation rider and 18 U.S.C. 926(a) was contained in a number of opinions and correspondence that ATF provided us during our review. Although we agreed with ATF\u2019s interpretation of 18 U.S.C. 926(a), we believed that ATF was interpreting the data restriction contained in the annual appropriation rider too narrowly. As a result, ATF would not have reviewed its data systems and information practices to ensure compliance with the broader interpretation of the rider, as discussed below. Appendix VIII contains our detailed legal analysis.", "In response to a draft of this report, ATF stated it adopted the broader interpretation of the rider, had applied it to a legal review of the systems listed in appendix IV that we did not review, and is committed to applying it to record systems it might establish in the future.", "Previously, ATF maintained that the restrictions in section 926(a) and the appropriation rider had the same effect, and that they were intended only to preclude rules or regulations issued after the enactment of the Firearms Owners\u2019 Protection Act that impose additional reporting requirements upon licensees. Thus, ATF viewed the data restrictions as having no application to the agency\u2019s internal practices, i.e., they did not restrict what ATF did with information it had acquired through reporting requirements in effect before the act or through other means, such as ATF\u2019s criminal enforcement and regulatory activities.", "ATF\u2019s interpretation relied on the language and context of section 926 and related provisions (primarily section 923), as well as the language and context of the 1979 appropriation rider, which was enacted to counter the broad reporting requirements that ATF sought to impose on licensees through the 1978 proposed rulemaking. ATF maintained that the basic effect of the Firearms Owners\u2019 Protection Act\u2014codifying certain former regulatory reporting requirements in section 923 and restricting the agency\u2019s authority to prescribe certain rules and regulations in section 926\u2014was to preempt any additional reporting requirements that the agency might impose on licensees.", "We agreed with ATF\u2019s interpretation of the data restrictions as far as it went; clearly the data restrictions apply to rules or regulations that would impose additional reporting requirements upon licensees. The question was whether they have any effect beyond such reporting requirements, and, in particular, whether they restrict how ATF compiles or otherwise uses firearms transaction records once they have been acquired from licensees through current reporting requirements or other means.", "With regard to the restriction in section 926(a), we agree that it is limited to ATF actions in the form of prescribing rules and regulations. The appropriation rider, however, contains no language that would limit its application either to prescribing rules and regulations or to imposing additional reporting requirements on licensees. Although the original version of the rider did refer to the 1978 proposed rulemaking that would have required new reporting by licensees, it was not limited to that proposal. Furthermore, beginning in fiscal year 1994, the reference to the 1978 proposal was dropped from the appropriation rider, and the language of the restriction was expanded to include \u201cany portion\u201d of these licensee records. In our view, given its structure and language prohibiting the use of appropriations in connection with consolidating or centralizing certain firearms licensee records within the Department of the Treasury, the rider appears to encompass ATF\u2019s internal operations.", "ATF\u2019s prior legal opinions did not analyze the rider, other than to treat it as \u201csimilar to\u201d the section 926(a) restriction. However, we believe that the appropriation rider clearly has legal effect independent of section 926. Congress enacted it for a number of years predating the Firearms Owners\u2019 Protection Act and has continued to enact it for each subsequent year. As referred to above, the language of the appropriation rider was expanded in fiscal year 1994 to include portions of licensee firearms records. Further, there are significant differences in the language of the two provisions\u2014most notably, the absence from the rider of any limitation on its coverage to rules or regulations. There is no indication in the legislative history of the Firearms Owners\u2019 Protection Act that section 926 was intended to subsume or otherwise affect the appropriation rider.", "Therefore, in our view, ATF\u2019s interpretation that the appropriation rider applied only to the issuance of rules and regulations that impose additional reporting requirements on licensees, and did not reach ATF\u2019s internal information practices, was not supported by the statutory language or legislative history of the rider.", "Determining the extent to which the appropriation rider restricts ATF\u2019s internal information practices posed more difficult questions. The appropriation rider applies to \u201cconsolidating or centralizing, within the Department of the Treasury, the records, or any portion thereof, of acquisition and disposition of firearms maintained by Federal firearms licensees.\u201d However, we do not believe that the rider precludes all information practices and data systems that involve an element of \u201cconsolidating or centralizing\u201d licensee records.", "The legislative history of the rider indicates that it was originally enacted in response to an ATF proposal that was viewed as a wholesale aggregation of licensee firearms transaction records that went \u201cbeyond the intent of Congress when it passed the Gun Control Act of 1968.\u201d There is no evidence in the legislative history that the rider was intended to overturn existing ATF information practices or data systems. Indeed, the Firearms Owners\u2019 Protection Act, which amended the Gun Control Act and was enacted 8 years after the original rider was passed, reaffirmed several long-standing ATF information practices. The rider must be interpreted in light of its purpose and in the context of the other statutory provisions governing ATF\u2019s acquisition and use of information contained in the Gun Control Act, as amended.", "Pursuant to the Gun Control Act, ATF is responsible for certain regulatory functions, such as licensing and monitoring firearms licensees, as well as certain law enforcement functions, such as the tracing of firearms. The act, as amended, contains specific statutory authorities that allow ATF to obtain certain firearms transaction data from licensees. Section 923 contains licensee recordkeeping and reporting authorities, as well as the authorities for ATF to conduct inspections and searches of licensee business premises for certain purposes. To implement these responsibilities and authorities, ATF necessarily gathers specific firearms transaction data, and must centralize or consolidate the data to some degree.", "However, as discussed above, section 926(a) precludes ATF from issuing rules or regulations after enactment of the Firearms Owners\u2019 Protection Act that require the establishment of any system of registration of firearms, firearms owners, or firearms transactions or dispositions. The legislative history of the Firearms Owners\u2019 Protection Act indicates a clear congressional concern that such a registry not be established.", "Therefore, to the extent that the centralization or consolidation of records is incident to carrying out a specific ATF responsibility and does not entail the aggregation of data on firearms transactions in a manner that would go beyond the purposes of the Gun Control Act of 1968, as amended, we do not believe that the rider would be violated."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["ATF\u2019s Out-of-Business Records and Multiple Sales Systems comply with the data restrictions, including the restriction in the annual appropriation rider, as discussed above.

ATF\u2019s legal interpretation of the restriction in the appropriation rider was that the restriction had no application to ATF\u2019s internal information practices under any circumstances. Given this, ATF had not reviewed its data systems and information practices to determine whether they involved the type of centralization or consolidation of records that might be affected by the rider, as discussed above. Such a review would help provide assurance that the systems and subsystems we did not review currently comply with the rider.", "In response to a draft of this report, ATF (1) revised its interpretation of the rider to adopt the broader interpretation we believed was appropriate; (2) applied this interpretation to a legal review of the systems, as described in appendix IV, that we did not review; and (3) stated it will apply the new interpretation to future systems.

Nevertheless, ATF agreed with and adopted the broader interpretation of the data restriction in the annual appropriation rider, as discussed in this report, for its existing, as well as future, systems. It also applied its revised interpretation to a legal review of the systems containing retail firearms purchaser data that we did not review and found them to be in compliance. In light of these actions ATF requested that we reconsider our recommendation.", "With regard to the issue of ATF\u2019s interpretation of the data restriction contained in the annual appropriation rider, we concluded in our draft report that given ATF\u2019s legal interpretation that the appropriation rider had no application to its internal information practices, ATF had not analyzed its data systems and information practices to determine whether they involved the type of centralization and consolidation of records that might be affected by the rider. Therefore, we concluded that ATF could not ensure that the systems and subsystems that we did not review complied with the rider; nor could ATF provide Congress with reasonable assurance that, in the future, its data systems, subsystems, and information practices would be in compliance with the rider, assuming that Congress continued to enact it.", "In commenting on our draft report, ATF stated that these assertions were speculative and ranged far beyond the scope of our review. We do not agree that our conclusion and recommendation go beyond the scope of our review.

Rather, our intention was to focus on the lack of assurance that ATF was providing related to its systems\u2019 compliance with the restriction in the rider based on its narrow interpretation.", "Nevertheless, ATF stated that it \u201cwill hereafter apply GAO\u2019s interpretation of the rider to its record systems and any future systems it might establish.\u201d It further stated that it saw \u201cno disadvantage to ATF in changing its position to be in conformity with the reading given by GAO since our record systems actually comply with GAO\u2019s interpretation of the rider.\u201d Also, as part of its written response to our draft report, ATF enclosed an August 23, 1996, opinion of the ATF Chief Counsel, whose Office reviewed those ATF data systems that contain retail firearms purchaser data (with the exception of the two systems that we reviewed) and found them to be in compliance with the rider, under the revised interpretation. The Chief Counsel\u2019s opinion also indicated that if ATF adopted our interpretation of the rider, the Office of the Chief Counsel would, in the future, review any proposed new record system to determine compliance with the rider.", "We believe ATF has taken several important actions toward fulfilling the recommendation. Most notably, ATF has revised its legal analysis of the rider, applied it to the descriptions of the remaining systems that contain retail firearms purchaser information, and stated that future systems will be reviewed under the revised analysis. These actions, in our view, constitute major steps toward providing assurance that ATF is currently complying with the rider and that the agency will continue to comply with it in the future. Accordingly, we have modified our final report to reflect ATF\u2019s actions.", "Although ATF has taken significant steps toward implementing our recommendation, in our view, it has not fully implemented the recommendation. ATF\u2019s legal analysis of the description of the remaining systems that contain retail firearms purchaser information appears to apply appropriate criteria and rationale. In addition, the legal analysis discusses various general controls that ATF had in place and actions it had taken to help ensure that existing, as well as future, records systems and information practices comply with the law. However, it was not clear how these controls specifically applied to the systems discussed in ATF\u2019s legal analysis or whether they were used to help ensure that the systems were in compliance with the data restrictions. To fully respond to our recommendation, ATF needs to provide assurance that the systems are actually operating as they were described. Thus, we believe that ATF should perform an operational review of the systems listed in appendix IV that we did not review.

Instead of in boxes, the out-of-business records were stored on microfilm cartridges, with the firearms licensee numbers assigned to them. Although this system occupied much less space than the hard copies of the records, ATF officials said it was still time consuming to conduct firearms traces because employees had to examine up to 3,000 images on each microfilm cartridge to locate a record.", "In fiscal year 1992, ATF began using a minicomputer to create a computerized index of the out-of-business microfilm records containing the information necessary to identify whether ATF had a record relating to a firearm being traced. The index contains the following key information: (1) the cartridge number of the microfilm; (2) an index number; (3) the serial number of the firearm; (4) the federal firearms licensee number; and (5) the type of document on microfilm, i.e., a Firearms Transaction Record (ATF Form 4473) or acquisition and disposition logbook pages. The index information that is captured by the minicomputer is then stored on a database in ATF\u2019s mainframe computer to allow searches of the index information by an employee.

Rather it queries the Out-of-Business Records System to determine if the firearm being traced is contained in the records of an out-of-business licensee. To perform a query of the system, employees are to enter the serial number of the firearm in question into the mainframe computer\u2019s database. If the serial number is matched with a particular out-of-business licensee record, the query will produce a list of one or more microfilm cartridges indicating the cartridge number and frame where the serial number in question may be found. After locating the appropriate cartridges, the employee is to use the location information in the index to search the microfilm frames to locate the record containing the serial number. Since the index does not associate a firearm\u2019s serial number with the manufacturer and type or model, the employee may need to examine several frames on one or more cartridges to locate a record. After locating the record, the employee is to examine the record to identify the purchaser of the firearm. If the identified purchaser is not another licensee, the trace is considered complete. If the purchaser is another licensee, the Tracing Center is to contact the licensee. If the serial number is not located in the out-of-business records, the Tracing Center is then to contact the manufacturer or importer to determine who purchased the firearm.", "According to ATF officials, the indexed Out-of-Business Records System has (1) greatly reduced the need to contact manufacturers, importers, and other licensees and (2) reduced the time and cost, including storage costs, necessary to conduct firearm traces.", "As shown in table V.1, during fiscal years 1992 through 1995, ATF received out-of-business records from 68,660 firearms licensees. ATF officials estimated that during this period, ATF spent about $9.6 million, including the cost of contract employees (65 as of July 1996), to process and maintain out-of-business records. According to ATF officials, ATF is receiving an increased number of records primarily because the number of licensees going out of business has increased, and more of these licensees have sent in their records. The number of licensees who have gone out of business more than doubled, from 34,663 in fiscal year 1992 to 75,569 in fiscal year 1995. About 43 percent of the licensees who went out of business in fiscal year 1995 sent in their records, compared to about 25 percent in fiscal year 1992\u2014an increase of about 75 percent. ATF officials estimated that during fiscal years 1992 through 1995, ATF microfilmed about 47 million documents contained in about 20,000 boxes.

In June 1995, to provide the capability for computerizing multiple sale reports, ATF upgraded its Firearms Tracing System by developing a Multiple Sales Subsystem. This system allows the entry of multiple sale information directly into the Firearms Tracing System. ATF then tested the system by entering multiple sale reports forwarded by three field divisions. Following successful completion of the test, ATF issued its new policy.", "ATF decided to computerize the handling of multiple sale reports at the Tracing Center for several reasons. First, by computerizing the reports as part of ATF\u2019s Firearms Tracing System, multiple sale information became readily available for firearms traces. When maintained locally by field divisions, multiple sale reports were not readily available for firearms tracing. Second, and most important according to the Chief of the Firearms Enforcement Division, by entering multiple sale information into the Firearms Tracing System, the information would be available to field divisions through Project Lead. ATF, through Project Lead, provides monthly firearms trace information along with multiple sale and other data on computer diskettes to its field divisions to develop investigative leads.", "Once the Tracing Center receives multiple sale reports from field divisions, the information is entered into the Multiple Sales System. The data entered includes (1) purchaser information such as name, address, date of birth, place of birth, race, and sex; (2) firearms identification information, including serial numbers of pistols and/or revolvers purchased; and (3) federal firearms licensee identification information. Multiple sale data in the system are retrievable by purchaser name and firearm serial number. After the information is entered into the system, the multiple sale reports are to be microfilmed, and the original reports are to be destroyed.

Through June 1996, the Tracing Center had entered data on 91,599 multiple sale reports and had 521 firearms traces linked to multiple sale reports. The Special Agent in Charge of the National Tracing Center estimated that in the future the Center will receive 130,000 multiple sale reports annually. This official estimated that each multiple sale report includes an average of 2.3 firearms.

The requirement calls for purging the purchaser data not identified in a trace 2 years after the date of the sale. The remainder of the data entered for each multiple sale, such as firearms descriptive data, is not to be purged and is to remain in the system to be used as investigative intelligence. In contrast, all multiple sale data identified in firearms traces, including purchaser data, is not to be purged from the system. According to the Chief of the Firearms Enforcement Division, the primary reason for purging purchaser data over 2 years old is to delete data that may not be useful.

The proposed regulations, as published in the Federal Register of March 21, 1978 would require: \u201c(1) A unique serial number on each gun manufactured or imported into the United States. \u201c(2) Reporting of all thefts and losses of guns by manufacturers, wholesalers and dealers. \u201c(3) Reporting of all commercial transactions involving guns between manufacturers, wholesalers and dealers. \u201cThe Bureau would establish a centralized computer data bank to store the above information. It is important to note that the proposed regulations would create a central Federal computer record of commercial transactions involving all firearms\u2014whether shotguns, rifles, or handguns. There are approximately 168,000 federally licensed firearms dealers, manufacturers, and importers. It is estimated that the proposed regulations would require submission of 700,000 reports annually involving 25 million to 45 million transactions. \u201cIt is the view of the Committee that the proposed regulations go beyond the intent of Congress when it passed the Gun Control Act of 1968.

On the basis of its interpretation of the two provisions, as set forth below, ATF concluded in each instance that the provisions did not apply to the systems or information collections at issue.", "Essentially, ATF maintained that the restrictions in section 926(a) and the appropriation act rider have the same effect, and that they only were \u201cintended to preclude future [post-FOPA] regulations imposing additional reporting requirements upon licensees.\u201d Thus, ATF viewed the data restrictions as having no application to the agency\u2019s internal information practices\u2014i.e., they did not restrict what ATF did with information it had acquired from licensees through pre-FOPA reporting requirements or other means.", "ATF\u2019s interpretation relied on the language and context of section 926 and related provisions (primarily section 923), as well as the language and context of the 1979 appropriation rider, which was enacted to counter the broad reporting requirements that ATF sought to impose on licensees through the 1978 proposed rulemaking. ATF maintained that the basic effect of FOPA\u2014codifying certain former regulatory reporting requirements in section 923 and restricting the agency\u2019s authority to prescribe rules and regulations in section 926\u2014was to preempt any additional reporting requirements that the agency might impose on licensees.

The question was whether they have any effect beyond such reporting requirements, and, in particular, whether they restrict how ATF compiles or otherwise uses firearms transaction records once they have been acquired from licensees through current reporting requirements or other means.", "With regard to the restriction in section 926(a), we agree with ATF that it is limited to prescribing rules and regulations. The appropriation rider, however, contains no language that would limit its application either to prescribing rules and regulations or to imposing additional reporting requirements on licensees. The original version of the rider did refer to the 1978 proposed rulemaking, but it was not limited to that proposal. The reference to the 1978 proposal was dropped in fiscal year 1994. Moreover, given its structure and language\u2014prohibiting the use of appropriations in connection with consolidating or centralizing certain records within the Department of the Treasury\u2014the rider appears to encompass ATF\u2019s internal operations.", "The ATF opinions we reviewed did not analyze the appropriation rider, other than to treat it as \u201csimilar to\u201d the section 926 restriction. However, we believe that the appropriation rider clearly has legal effect independent of section 926. Congress enacted it for a number of years predating FOPA and has continued to enact it for each subsequent year. In fact, the language of the appropriation rider was expanded in fiscal year 1994 to include portions of licensee firearms records. There also are significant differences in the language of the two provisions\u2014most notably, the absence from the rider of any limitation on its coverage to rules or regulations. Also, there is no indication in the legislative history of FOPA that section 926 was intended to subsume or otherwise affect the appropriation rider. Finally, the appropriation rider was originally intended to prevent ATF from obtaining and computerizing large volumes of information on firearms transactions in a manner that was viewed as \u201caccomplish by regulation that which Congress has declined to legislate.\u201d It would be incongruous to conclude that the appropriation rider would not reach efforts to accomplish the same result through means other than regulatory requirements imposed on licensees.", "Therefore, in our view, ATF\u2019s interpretation that the appropriation rider applied only to the issuance of rules and regulations that impose additional reporting requirements on licensees, and did not reach ATF\u2019s internal information practices, was not supported by the statutory language or legislative history of the rider.", "Determining the extent to which the appropriation rider restricts ATF\u2019s internal information practices poses more difficult questions. The appropriation rider applies to \u201cconsolidating or centralizing, within the Department of the Treasury, the records, or any portion thereof, of acquisition and disposition of firearms maintained by Federal firearms licensees.\u201d However, we do not believe that the rider precludes all information practices and data systems that involve an element of \u201cconsolidating or centralizing\u201d licensee records.", "As discussed above, the legislative history of the rider indicates that it was originally enacted in response to an ATF proposal that was viewed as a wholesale aggregation of licensee firearms transaction records that went \u201cbeyond the intent of Congress when it passed the Gun Control Act of 1968.\u201d There is no evidence in the legislative history that the rider was intended to overturn existing ATF information practices or data systems. Indeed, FOPA, which amended the Gun Control Act and was enacted 8 years after the original rider was passed, reaffirmed several long-standing ATF information practices. The rider must be interpreted in light of its purpose and in the context of the other statutory provisions governing ATF\u2019s acquisition and use of information contained in the Gun Control Act, as amended.", "Pursuant to the Gun Control Act, ATF is responsible for certain regulatory functions, such as licensing and monitoring firearms licensees, as well as certain law enforcement functions, such as the tracing of firearms. The act, as amended, contains specific statutory authorities that allow ATF to obtain certain firearms transaction information from licensees. Section 923 contains licensee recordkeeping and reporting authorities, as well as the authorities for ATF to conduct inspections and searches of licensee business premises for certain purposes. To implement these responsibilities and authorities, ATF necessarily gathers specific firearms transaction data and must centralize or consolidate the data to some degree. \u201cthe Committee wishes to emphasize that, notwithstanding any other provision of law, the authority granted under 18 U.S.C. 923(g)(3), (4) and (5), as well as that contained in paragraph (1), as amended, are not to be construed to authorize the United States or any state or political subdivision thereof, to use the information obtained from any records or forms which are required to be maintained for inspection or submission by licensees under Chapter 44 to establish any system of registration of firearms, firearms owners, or firearms transactions or dispositions.\u201d", "Therefore, to the extent that the centralization or consolidation of records is incident to carrying out a specific ATF responsibility and does not entail the aggregation of data on firearms transactions in a manner that would go beyond the purposes of the Gun Control Act of 1968, as amended, we do not believe that the rider would be violated."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "ATF\u2019s Out-Of-Business Records System and Multiple Sales System Comply With Data Restrictions", "paragraphs": ["We reviewed two ATF data systems, the Out-of-Business Records System and the Multiple Sales System, to determine if they comply with the data restrictions.
