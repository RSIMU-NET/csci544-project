Federal statutes  have also authorized DOT to regulate certain areas affecting passengers.  For example, DOT has the authority to stop airlines from engaging in  unfair or deceptive practices, or unfair methods of competition, and  promulgates consumer protection regulations under its statutory  authorities. Under these authorities, DOT issued three final rules on  Enhancing Airline Passenger Protections from 2009 through 2016.

While  rates of voluntary and involuntary denied boardings and mishandled  baggage generally declined, airlines\u2019 on-time performance stayed about  the same (fig. 1). For example, over the 10-year period of our review, the  lowest rate of involuntary denied boardings occurred in 2017.

Our more recent work on airlines\u2019 denied  boarding practices found that even fewer passengers were denied  boarding involuntarily in 2018. Rates of mishandled baggage also  generally declined in recent years. For example, in 2017 airlines posted a  rate of 2.5 mishandled bags per 1,000 passengers (a rate of .25 percent  of mishandled bags per passenger enplanement), compared to a rate of  5.25 mishandled bags per 1,000 passengers in 2008.", "In 2019, we identified a number of factors that can cause airlines\u2019  operational issues. For example, passengers might be denied boarding  when airlines overbook their flights (i.e., intentionally sell more seats than  are available on a flight) or have to substitute smaller aircraft than what  was originally scheduled due to maintenance issues. We also found that  outages associated with airline IT systems\u2014which are used for flight and  crew planning, passenger reservations or check-in, or for providing flight  information to the Federal Aviation Administration\u2014can cause flight  delays and cancellations. While we found some outages caused  minimal issues, the impact of others was more substantial.

In 2019, we reported that selected  airlines have taken a range of actions, aimed at reducing involuntary  denied boardings. Some of these actions also provide additional  incentives for passengers to volunteer to be denied boarding.

As we reported in 2018, representatives  from almost all airlines we interviewed reported investing resources to  improve baggage-handling efforts and minimize the effects to  passengers whose bags are lost or delayed. Among other actions,  airline representatives told us they upgraded baggage technology;  modernized the claims process, so passengers could complete forms  on-line; and instituted replacement baggage programs, where  passengers can get a replacement bag at the airport.

Airlines are also required  by DOT\u2019s interpretation of the statutory prohibition on unfair and  deceptive practices to provide refunds for canceled and significantly  delayed flights, if a passenger chooses to cancel his or her trip. Beyond  those requirements, DOT officials previously told us that airlines are not  obligated to provide accommodations for flight disruptions, such as  cancellations and delays, unless specified in an airline\u2019s contract of  carriage, although as mentioned above, some voluntarily choose to do so  in certain situations. This may result in significant inconveniences for  passengers, who may incur costs for lodging, meals and transportation.
