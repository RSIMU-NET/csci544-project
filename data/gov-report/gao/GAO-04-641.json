Moreover, because smuggled cigarettes are not taxed, federal and state revenues are lost. Smuggled cigarettes, which include counterfeit and genuine brand cigarettes, also pose a public health risk as all cigarettes do, but no studies have been done to determine whether counterfeit cigarettes pose any additional health risk. ICE and ATF have been conducting more cigarette smuggling investigations in recent years. Their investigations are generally larger, more complex, and longer-term than previous investigations. Also, CBP and ICE have been seizing an increasing number of cigarettes, particularly counterfeit cigarettes, as criminals attempt to smuggle them into the United States. Two proposed legal initiatives are intended to enhance law enforcement efforts to thwart the smuggling of cigarettes into the United States. For example, a bill known as the Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking Act would lower the threshold for a cigarette smuggling violation (a felony) from 60,000 to 10,000 cigarettes, increase ATF's authority to enter premises to enforce federal cigarette laws, and provide ATF the authority to use money generated during undercover sting operations to offset investigative expenses. In addition, the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, a proposed international treaty, includes provisions that seek to eliminate the illicit trade in tobacco products, including cigarette smuggling.

The Commissioner also said it is unrealistic to expect that all  containers warrant such inspection because each container poses a  different level of risk based on a number of factors, including the exporter,  the transportation providers, and the importer. To direct its resources  toward higher-risk cargo and to minimize its impact on the flow of  commerce, CBP has developed a layered approach to inspections. This  approach includes: a targeting system, to assess the risk level of individual  containers and to flag high-risk containers for physical inspection; a  random inspection program; and the selection of containers for physical  inspection based on a review of the shipping manifests and knowledge or  intelligence gathered at the local ports. While most of the inspectors  assigned to seaports perform physical inspections of goods entering the  country, some are \u201ctargeters\u201d \u2013 they review documents and intelligence  reports and determine which cargo containers should undergo additional  documentary reviews and/or physical inspections.", "As part of its layered approach, CBP employs its Automated Targeting  System (ATS) computer model to review documentation on all arriving  containers to help select or \u201ctarget\u201d containers for additional documentary  review and/or physical inspection, such as containers that may contain  cigarettes being smuggled. The ATS was originally designed to help  identify illegal narcotics in cargo containers. ATS automatically matches  its targeting rules against the manifest and other available data for every  arriving container and assigns a level of risk (i.e., low, medium, high) to  each container. At the port level, inspectors use ATS, as well as other data  (e.g., intelligence reports), to determine whether to inspect a particular  container.", "In addition, CBP has a program, called the Supply Chain Stratified  Examination, which supplements ATS by randomly selecting additional  containers to be physically examined. The results of the random  inspection program are to be compared with the results of ATS  inspections to improve targeting. If CBP officials decide to inspect a  particular container, they might first use equipment such as the Vehicle  and Cargo Inspection System that takes a gamma-ray image of the  container so inspectors can see any visual anomalies. With or without this  imaging system, inspectors can open a container and physically examine  its contents.", "At the Los Angeles/Long Beach seaport, we interviewed inspectors  assigned to a unit called the Manifest Review Unit (MRU) that analyzes  manifests, which list in detail the total cargo of vessels.

CBP then determines whether the merchandise merits  examination or immediate release. MRU is to review all manifested cargo  for risk, based on ATS\u2019s rules and criteria, such as shipment from a  country known to be a source of counterfeit cigarettes. MRU inspectors  may also make additional computer queries based on their experience  and/or specific intelligence about a shipper or commodity.", "After  MRU selects cargo for examination, it is sent to a Centralized  Examination Station, which is a privately operated facility at which  imported merchandise identified for physical examination is unloaded and  made available to CBP examination team inspectors. If an examination  results in a finding of smuggled cigarettes, a sample is taken to determine  whether they are counterfeit or genuine, the merchandise is seized and  forfeited, counterfeit cigarettes are destroyed, and genuine cigarettes may  be destroyed or auctioned. After the examination is complete, the  inspectors notify MRU of the results of the examination. MRU inspectors  may then use the information for future targeting of cargo for  examination.", "CBP officials said that although cigarettes are not necessarily being  targeted as a specific imported commodity to be physically inspected at a  port, targeting rules or criteria are constantly being updated from tips  received from many different sources, and consequently many illegally  imported goods, including cigarettes, are discovered through the targeting  process.", "Figures 2, 3, and 4 show a likeness of the container in which recently  seized counterfeit cigarettes were shipped, how they were packaged as  legitimate merchandise, and what they looked like when unloaded and  inspected."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Number of ICE and ATF Investigations into Cigarette Smuggling Have Increased and Become Larger and More Complex", "paragraphs": ["ICE and ATF are responsible for investigating cigarette smuggling.

However, Justice has not formally endorsed  the PACT Act (or its House companion bill, H.R. 2824). If enacted, the  PACT Act would broaden the definition of what constitutes contraband  cigarettes by lowering the CCTA quantity for nontaxed cigarettes to be  considered contraband from 60,000 to 10,000. This is a lower threshold  than Justice suggested. But, according to the bill\u2019s sponsors, lowering the  contraband cigarette threshold would allow ATF to open more  investigations and seek more federal felony prosecutions of cigarette  smugglers.", "Second, the bill would allow ATF to pay expenses of undercover  investigations with money accrued during such operations. Justice  supports this provision. For example, as part of an undercover  investigation, ATF could sell cigarettes to a suspect and use the cash to  pay informants or buy more cigarettes from traffickers in the investigation.  This would make ATF\u2019s powers more comparable to those of other  investigative agencies like the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the  Drug Enforcement Administration, which may use such nonappropriated  funds to make undercover purchases and pay other investigative  expenses.", "Finally, the bill includes a provision that would authorize ATF to enter the  property of any person who delivered, shipped, sold, distributed, or  received more than 10,000 cigarettes a month to inspect cigarettes on the  premises and any legal records or information on the cigarettes required  by law. Justice supports increasing ATF\u2019s authority to enter premises to  enforce federal cigarette laws, but it has not opined its views on whether  the 10,000 cigarette threshold is appropriate. Currently, ATF must obtain  consent to enter a person\u2019s property and conduct an inspection. If denied  entry, ATF must obtain a search warrant by demonstrating probable cause  to a U.S. district court judge to enter a person\u2019s property. Under the bill, if  ATF is denied entry, its right of inspection could be enforced by a district  court order with the submission of an affidavit or other evidence that  entry was denied.

FCTC,  if ratified, would be an additional legal instrument addressing issues as  diverse as tobacco advertising and promotion, agricultural diversification,  smuggling, taxes, and subsidies.", "FCTC was adopted at the World Health Assembly on May 21, 2003, and is  open to all members of the WHO or the United Nations from June 2003 to  June 2004 for ratification. At least 40 countries must ratify FCTC for it to  become law. If FCTC is ratified, those ratifying nations would develop  protocols, which are separate agreements containing specific measures  designed to implement the broad goals called for by the FCTC. As of April  2004, the United States had not ratified FCTC. The State Department,  with interagency and White House input, was reviewing FCTC, including  determining whether joining the convention would require any new  legislation. According to the Director of Health Programs, State  Department, that deliberative review process was moving forward. There  is no set time frame for the review process to be completed.", "As part of its objective, FCTC states that cooperative action is necessary  to eliminate all forms of illicit trade in cigarettes and other tobacco  products, including smuggling, illicit manufacturing and counterfeiting.  Article 15 of FCTC (see app. II) is the only one of 38 Articles that  addresses the illicit trade in tobacco products, including cigarette  smuggling.", "The first of seven measures in Article 15 states that the elimination of all  forms of illicit trade in tobacco products, including smuggling, illicit  manufacturing and counterfeiting, and the development and  implementation of related national law, in addition to subregional, regional  and global agreements, are essential components of tobacco control. The  other measures require each ratifying country to, among other things,  mark packages of tobacco products to control their movement, cooperate  in investigations and prosecutions, periodically report progress made, and  adopt other measures as appropriate to prevent illicit trade.", "The fourth measure requires actions aimed at eliminating illicit trade in  tobacco products. For example, one action that FCTC will require is the  exchange of tax information among governments, as appropriate, and in  accordance with national law and relevant applicable bilateral or  multilateral agreements. Under present law, Section 6103 of the Internal  Revenue Code (IRC) of 1986 in general provides that the government shall  not disclose any taxpayer returns or return information. Section  6103(k)(4) of the IRC, however, permits the government to disclose such  information \u201c. . . to a competent authority of a foreign government which  has an income tax or gift and estate tax convention, or other convention or  bilateral agreement relating to the exchange of tax information, with the  United States but only to the extent provided in, and subject to the terms  and conditions of, such convention or bilateral agreement.\u201d According to  the Assistant Chief Counsel of the Treasury Department\u2019s Alcohol and  Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB), FCTC is a convention that under  Section 6103(k)(4) would allow the government, under the appropriate  circumstances, to share taxpayer returns or return information with  competent authorities of foreign governments who are Parties to FCTC.", "According to TTB, the sharing of cigarette tax information with other  countries could help government agencies determine when cigarette  exports are diverted from legitimate distribution channels. Presently,  when a U.S. company exports cigarettes to another country, the exporter  files a document with TTB disclosing the type and quantity of cigarettes  being exported with no federal cigarette excise taxes due or paid\u2014this is  considered taxpayer information. Currently, IRC does not allow TTB to  provide this information to the country to which the cigarettes are  shipped. The convention would allow the information to be provided and  used to determine whether the quantity of cigarettes declared as imports  matches the quantity of cigarettes exported. If the imported quantity is less  than the exported quantity, this may indicate that some of the cigarettes  were diverted to be smuggled into that or some other country, or back to  the United States, without the payment of cigarette taxes and import  duties."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft copy of this report to DHS and Justice.

We also interviewed an ICE official at a field office in Long Beach,  California, ATF officials at the Los Angeles Field Division, and CBP  officials at the Los Angeles/Long Beach seaport, which was identified as  having the largest number of cigarette seizures in the country.", "To assess the reliability of the ICE and ATF investigation data, we   (1) reviewed existing information about the data and systems that  produced them and (2) interviewed agency officials knowledgeable about  the data as necessary. For the CBP and ICE seizure data, which CBP  maintains in a database, CBP officials updated and provided us with data  on the more significant cigarette seizures with estimated values of   $2,500 or greater. We focused on these seizures because CBP reported that  smaller cigarette seizures are more likely to be instances of individuals  transporting cigarettes intended for personal consumption rather than  organized smuggling. To assess the reliability of the CBP and ICE seizure  data, we (1) performed electronic testing for obvious errors in accuracy  and completeness, (2) reviewed existing information about the data and  systems that produced them, and (3) interviewed agency officials  knowledgeable about the data.
