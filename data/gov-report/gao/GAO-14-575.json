We also reviewed and  analyzed reports and other documents from the agencies, such as the  U.S. Strategy to Address the Linkages Between Human Rights Abuses,  Armed Groups, Mining of Conflict Minerals, and Commercial Products;  the conflict minerals rule; and maps of mineral-rich zones and areas  under control of armed groups in the DRC. In addition, we reviewed and  analyzed press releases, statements, plans, and guidance pertaining to  conflict minerals and responsible sourcing that were issued by U.S.  agencies. We also reviewed notes and agendas of responsible sourcing  forums and other meetings attended by U.S. officials.", "To analyze what is known about the status of, and any information  provided by, initiatives focused on responsible sourcing of conflict  minerals from the DRC and adjoining countries, we interviewed officials  and reviewed and analyzed documents from State, USAID, and the  United Nations Group of Experts on the Democratic Republic of the  Congo (UNGoE); interviewed representatives and reviewed and analyzed  guidance documents, reports, and presentations from foreign  government, industry associations, multilateral organizations, companies,  and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). We selected these  stakeholders based on their expertise on responsible sourcing issues,  because they represented a range of perspectives on conflict minerals,  and because we had established contacts with these entities on our last  review. In addition, some of the stakeholders we talked to have been  working on the ground in the DRC. The stakeholders we spoke with  constitute a nongeneralizable sample, and the information we gathered  from them cannot be used to infer views of other stakeholders cognizant  of conflict minerals issues. To determine which initiatives had expanded  and which were new initiatives in the region, we interviewed U.S. agency  officials and relevant stakeholders and reviewed documentation from  initiatives in the region. This report covers initiatives on which we have  previously reported and new initiatives since our 2013 report, as  described by stakeholders we interviewed. However, it is possible that  the agency officials and stakeholders with whom we spoke may be  unaware of other stakeholders and/or responsible sourcing initiatives  active in the DRC and region. To determine the starting dates of the  initiatives, we interviewed stakeholders and reviewed the websites of the  various initiatives. To demonstrate what information stakeholders have  reported regarding responsible sourcing initiatives, we reviewed and  analyzed information published on the websites associated with the  various responsible sourcing initiatives. When reporting on information  provided by the initiatives and stakeholders, we are referring to  information such as reports published, amount of minerals mined per  region/country, amount of minerals exported, and value of minerals  produced and exported, including data covering 2012 through 2014. The  information gathered cannot be generalized and cannot be used to infer  views of other stakeholders cognizant of conflict minerals issues.", "To demonstrate other sources of publicly available data on conflict  minerals, we collected and analyzed stakeholder and government data  covering 2003 through 2014. Because the data were not used to support  findings, conclusions, or recommendations, we did not assess their  reliability. To demonstrate the output of one of the in-region initiatives, we  collected production and export data for the ITRI Supply Chain Initiative  (iTSCi). We reviewed the production reports for three provinces in the  DRC and for Rwanda published on iTSCi\u2019s website, abbreviated the data  to include those most relevant to this study, and converted the data to  tons and thousands of U.S. dollars. A limitation of the data is that the  disaggregated production data\u2013by mineral and mine\u2013are proprietary to  iSTCi members, so it is not possible to quantify the total amount of any of  the minerals separately. We also collected conflict mineral production and  export data from the websites of the governments of the DRC and  Rwanda and from the International Trade Centre. We are presenting  these data in the appendixes of the report because these are the only  publicly available data we found for sourcing conflict minerals from the  region. There is no distinction in these data between minerals that are  conflict-free and those that have supported armed groups. Moreover,  none of these data can be generalized or be used to infer the total  production or export of conflict minerals from the DRC and the adjoining  countries.", "In response to a mandate in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and  Consumer Protection Act that GAO submit an annual report that  assesses the rate of sexual violence in war-torn areas of the DRC and  adjoining countries, we identified and assessed any additional published  information available on sexual violence in war-torn eastern DRC, as well  as three adjoining countries that border the DRC\u2014Rwanda, Uganda, and  Burundi\u2014since our 2013 report on sexual violence in these areas.  During the course of our review, we interviewed officials from State and  USAID and interviewed NGO representatives and researchers to discuss  the collection of sexual violence-related data\u2014including population-based  surveys and case file data\u2014in the DRC and adjoining countries.  Specifically, we followed up with researchers and representatives from  those groups we interviewed for our prior review on sexual violence rates  in eastern DRC and adjoining countries, including a representative from  the Human Rights Center at the University of California, Berkeley, School  of Law and others officials. The team also traveled to New York City to  meet with officials from the United Nations Population Fund, United  Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and the United Nations Special  Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict.  We also conducted Internet literature searches to identify new academic  articles containing any additional information on sexual violence since our  2013 report.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2013 to June 2014  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
