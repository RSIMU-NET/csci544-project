Treasury eliminated paper savings bonds in January 2012, after a long-term decline in savings bond purchases. It estimated the change would save about $70 million in program costs from 2012 through 2016. Except for the Tax Time Savings Bond program, customers who want to buy savings bonds must use TreasuryDirect\u2014an online system that requires users to have Internet access and a bank account. Customers without both, which likely includes lower-income households, face challenges accessing TreasuryDirect. Treasury is in the early stages of developing a new system, the Treasury Retail Investment Manager (TRIM), to make it easier to buy savings bonds, such as by using a mobile device, which often is the primary means of accessing the Internet for many lower-income households.", "A little more than one-third of the users of Treasury's Tax Time Savings Bond program\u2014the only way to purchase paper bonds\u2014were lower-income tax filers (filers with an adjusted gross income of $25,000 or less), but the program's future is uncertain. Since 2010, tax filers have been able to use a tax form to buy paper savings bonds with their tax refund. For tax years 2010 through 2013, about 142,000 tax filers (less than 1 percent of tax filers receiving refunds) used at least part of their tax refund to buy nearly $72.5 million in savings bonds. Of these filers, about 55,000 had incomes of $25,000 or less and bought about $13.7 million in savings bonds, or about $250, on average, per filer each year. Treasury has been extending the program partly because the amount of bonds purchased and participation levels indicate that the program is providing benefits, but it generally has not considered the program's costs. In May 2015, Treasury officials told GAO that they plan to continue to extend the program until TRIM can provide a suitable electronic alternative. Because TRIM will require Internet access by computer or mobile device, Tax Time program users without such access may no longer be able to save by buying bonds with their refunds after TRIM is implemented. In prior work on agency stewardship of public funds, GAO reported that agencies, as a best practice, should consider both benefits and costs in considering alternatives related to program decisions. Without considering both, Treasury cannot make a fully informed decision on whether to discontinue the Tax Time program when an electronic alternative is available.", "On the basis of GAO's analysis of data from the most recent Survey of Consumer Finances conducted in 2013, the median value of financial assets held by the bottom fifth of income earners (whose median annual income was $14,200) was $550. Given the limited savings of lower-income households and savings challenges faced by such households, a number of federal agencies have developed programs to promote savings. For example, Treasury's my RA\u00ae, which is in a soft-launch phase, promotes retirement savings for individuals without access to employer-sponsored retirement plans. State, local, and nonprofit agencies also have initiated programs that promote savings for retirement, child development, or emergencies and generally target lower-income households. Eligibility requirements and participation vary by program."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that as Treasury implements the TRIM system, it consider the benefits and costs of the Tax Time program in future decisions on whether to extend the program.

Savings  bonds are low risk, backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S.  government, and offered in minimum denominations as low as $25.  Beginning in January 2012, the U.S. Department of the Treasury  (Treasury) discontinued the over-the-counter sale of paper savings bonds  at financial institutions as part of its agency-wide, all-electronic effort  announced in 2010. As a result, savings bonds generally can be  purchased only through Treasury\u2019s Internet-based system, called  TreasuryDirect\u00ae. Treasury stated that its goal in discontinuing sales of  paper savings bonds was to reduce costs and enhance customer service  by increasing electronic transactions. At the same time, some members  of Congress, nonprofit organizations, and others have raised concerns  that the change has reduced access to an important savings product,  particularly for lower-income households who may not have bank  accounts, access to the Internet, or the knowledge or skills needed to use  TreasuryDirect. In 2010, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) provided tax  filers with an alternative method for purchasing paper savings bonds by  enabling them to use their income tax refund to buy them through a  program commonly known as the Tax Time Savings Bond program. This  program is intended, in part, to help lower-income households to save.

We chose these survey years  because they covered more than 10 years before the discontinuation of  the sale of paper savings bonds at financial institutions but also one year  after the change. To identify and describe the government and nonprofit  programs developed to promote savings by lower-income households, we  conducted research on and reviewed select federal, state, local, and  nonprofit programs targeting either long-term (such as retirement or asset  accumulation) or short-term savings goals for lower-income households.

According to Treasury officials, the  agency phased out the issuance of paper savings bonds through  employer-sponsored payroll savings plans in 2010, and the ending of  savings bond sales through over-the-counter channels was the last step  of discontinuing paper savings bonds. Treasury estimated that the  elimination of over-the-counter sales of paper savings bonds would save  nearly $70 million in program costs from 2012 through 2016. Treasury  calculated these savings by estimating how much it would save in costs  associated with issuing new paper bonds and servicing and redeeming  existing paper bonds, which include fees paid to banks, postage, and  printing. For example, Treasury estimated that the change would  eliminate around $14.5 million in fees paid to financial institutions for  issuing and redeeming savings bonds and around $12.7 million in  postage expenses for mailing paper bonds to customers over the 5-year  period. Additionally, Treasury estimated that it would save in personnel  costs because fewer employees would be needed to process customer  service transactions.

Consideration of not only  the Tax Time program\u2019s benefits but also the program\u2019s cost would  provide Treasury with important information in evaluating not only the  resource requirements when deciding whether to allow the program to  expire but also the program\u2019s performance in relation to its benefits and  costs.

First, we used data  issued by the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) on the amount of  U.S. savings bonds purchased from 2001 through 2013 to analyze trends  in savings bond purchases over this period, including the effect of the  Treasury\u2019s elimination of paper savings bonds on savings bond  purchases. Second, we used data from the triennial Survey of Consumer  Finances (SCF) issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve  System for survey years 2001, 2004, 2007, 2010, and 2013 to estimate  the percentage of U.S. households holding financial assets, including  U.S. savings bonds; the median value of such financial assets held by  U.S. households, and the median income of households. The survey data  include information on families\u2019 balance sheets, pensions, income,  investments, and demographic characteristics. We analyzed the U.S.  population data as a whole and also considered the bottom two income  quintiles separately. We chose these survey years because they provide  a period of about 10 years prior to and 1 year after the discontinuation of  the sale of paper savings bonds at financial institutions. We analyzed the  U.S. population data as a whole and also considered the bottom two  income quintiles separately. SCF data are based on probability samples  and estimates are formed using the appropriate estimation weights  provided with the survey\u2019s data. Because each of these samples follows a  probability procedure based on random selections, they represent only  one of a large number of samples that could have been drawn. Since  each sample could have provided different estimates, we express our  confidence in the precision of our particular sample\u2019s results as a 95  percent confidence interval (i.e., plus or minus 2.5 percentage points).  This is the interval that would contain the actual population value for 95  percent of the samples we could have drawn. Unless otherwise noted, all  percentage estimates have 95 percent confidence intervals that are within  5 percentage points of the estimate itself, and all numerical estimates  other than percentages have 95 percent confidence intervals that are  within 5 percent of the estimate itself. We also reviewed documentation  on the SCF, such as codebooks and Federal Reserve bulletins. Third, we  used aggregated data provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on  income tax filers who used at least part of their tax refunds to buy paper  savings bonds from 2010 through 2013 to analyze the number of tax filers  who bought paper savings bonds, including those with adjusted gross  incomes of $25,000 or below\u2014the lowest income category reported in the  data\u2014and the amount of savings bonds they purchased. We also used  the aggregated data to analyze refund options used by the tax filers (such  as paper check and paper savings bond, direct deposit and paper savings  bond, or paper savings bond only) and demographic information about  the filers, such as their age. We assessed the reliability of the data we  used by interviewing knowledgeable officials, and conducting manual  testing on relevant data fields, such as the number of tax filers who  participated in the program and amounts of savings bonds purchased.  We found the data we reviewed to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes  of our analyses.", "To examine the effect of Treasury\u2019s elimination of paper U.S. savings  bond, including on the savings bond program and bond purchases, we  reviewed data on savings bonds purchases from 2001 through 2013, and  analyzed trends in purchases for this time period, including before and  after paper savings bonds were discontinued in January 2012.  Specifically, to analyze long- term trends in savings bond purchases and  more recent trends since the end of paper sales, we estimated two  econometric models. The first model was based on a portfolio choice  model, and modeled purchases as a function of interest rates, inflation,  and economy-wide risk (using the Chicago Board Options Exchange\u2019s  Volatility Index). In other words, consumers may make savings bond  purchase decisions the same way they make other decisions about  financial portfolio allocation, based on risk and return considerations. The  second model was based on linear and quadratic time trends to capture  the long-term reduction in purchases. We included monthly seasonal  effects in both models. The drop in savings bond purchases after the end  of paper sales was consistent with long-term trends and generally not  statistically significant. The drop in purchases after the end of paper sales  also was consistent with the reduction in interest rates at the time (the  coefficient on interest rates was highly statistically significant). As with  any econometric model, our approach is imperfect and is unlikely to  include all factors that influence savings bond purchases. Additional data  over time might provide different or more definitive estimates of the  change in purchases associated with the end of paper sales. We  reviewed Federal Register releases on TreasuryDirect and its  replacement system, the Treasury Retail Investment Manager; Treasury  documentation, including a description of data in the monthly statement of  public debt, estimates of cost savings from eliminating paper savings  bonds, press releases, Bureau of the Fiscal Service\u2019s President\u2019s budgets  and capital investment plans; and TreasuryDirect materials. To assess  the reliability of Treasury\u2019s cost estimates, we interviewed Treasury  officials on how the estimates were determined and reported. We also  interviewed Treasury officials to discuss a range of issues related to its  savings bond program, including the benefits and costs of eliminating  paper savings bonds, concerns raised about TreasuryDirect, and plans  for replacing TreasuryDirect.", "To determine the extent to which Treasury\u2019s Tax Time Savings Bond  program has promoted savings, we analyzed IRS data on the use of the  program by tax filers for tax years 2010 through 2013 (as discussed in  detail above). We also reviewed IRS documentation on the program, such  as descriptions on how the program operates and answers to common  questions about the program, and studies on the Tax Time program  published by academics and nonprofit organizations focusing on social or  economic policy. We interviewed Treasury and IRS officials about the Tax  Time program\u2019s operations, benefits, costs, and future in terms of its  expiration. To better understand the extent to which this program can help  lower-income households to save, we interviewed nonprofit organizations  focusing on social or economic policy, including Doorways to Dreams  Fund, New America, Corporation for Enterprise Development, and  MDRC.", "To examine the extent to which lower-income households are saving  using financial products, we examined SCF data for survey years 2001,  2004, 2007, 2010, and 2013 (as described in greater detail above). Based  on these data, we defined lower-income households as the lower two  distributions (or quintiles) of households in the United States. To  describe some of the government and nonprofit programs developed to  promote savings by lower-income households, we conducted Internet and  literature searches for research, initiatives, testimonies, and studies on  savings programs targeting lower-income households and reviewed  materials on such programs. We specifically reviewed select federal,  state, local, and nonprofit programs targeting either long-term (such as  retirement or asset accumulation) or short-term savings goals for lower- income households. For the purposes of this report, we focused on  programs designed to promote savings using financial assets, such as  bank accounts, bonds, mutual funds, and retirement accounts. We  generally excluded programs designed to promote savings through home  ownership or other nonfinancial assets. For federal programs, we focused  our review on federal agencies involved in promoting financial literacy that  are members of the multiagency Financial Literacy and Education  Commission (FLEC). We interviewed six FLEC member agencies\u2014the  Departments of the Treasury, Housing and Urban Development, Health  and Human Services, and Education; the Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation; and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, also  known as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2014about their  savings programs and reviewed related documentation.", "We also reviewed select state, local, and nonprofit programs targeting  lower-income households. We selected these programs based on our  research of savings programs for lower-income households and  interviews with FLEC members and other stakeholders. For the programs  we selected, we interviewed relevant program officials and reviewed  documentation on the programs, including information on participation in  the programs where available. Finally, we interviewed other relevant  stakeholders, including Doorways to Dreams Fund, New America,  Corporation for Enterprise Development, MDRC, Consumers for Paper  Options, and academics.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2014 to July 2015 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of the Treasury", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Richard Tsuhara (Assistant  Director), Tarek Mahmassani (Analyst-in-Charge), Emily R.
