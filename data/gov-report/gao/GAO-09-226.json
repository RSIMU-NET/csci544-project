Depository institutions have been concerned about the resources required to file SARs and the extent to which SARs are used. GAO was asked to examine (1) factors affecting the number of SARs filed, (2) actions agencies have taken to improve the usefulness of SARs, (3) federal agencies' use of SARs, and (4) the effectiveness of the process used to revise SAR forms. GAO reviewed laws and agency documents; analyzed SAR filings; and interviewed representatives from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), law enforcement agencies, bank regulators, and depository institutions."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In 2000 through 2007, SAR filings by depository institutions increased from about 163,000 to 649,000 per year; representatives from federal regulators, law enforcement, and depository institutions with whom GAO spoke attributed the increase mainly to two factors. First, automated monitoring systems can flag multiple indicators of suspicious activities and identify significantly more unusual activity than manual monitoring. Second, several public enforcement actions against a few depository institutions prompted other institutions to look more closely at client and account activities. Other factors include institutions' greater awareness of and training on BSA requirements after September 11, and more regulator guidance for BSA examinations. FinCEN and law enforcement agencies have taken actions to improve the quality of SAR filings and educate filers about their usefulness. Since 2000, FinCEN has issued written products with the purpose of making SAR filings more useful to law enforcement. FinCEN and federal law enforcement agency representatives regularly participate in outreach on BSA/anti-money laundering, including events focused on SARs. Law enforcement agency representatives said they also establish relationships with depository institutions to communicate with staff about crafting useful SAR narratives. FinCEN, law enforcement agencies, and financial regulators use SARs in investigations and financial institution examinations and have taken steps in recent years to make better use of them. FinCEN uses SARs to provide public and nonpublic analytical products to law enforcement agencies and depository institution regulators. Some federal law enforcement agencies have facilitated complex analyses by using SAR data with their own data sets. Federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies collaborate to review and start investigations based on SARs filed in their areas. Regulators use SARs in their examination process to assess compliance and take action against abuse by depository institution insiders. After revising a SAR form in 2006 that still cannot be used because of information technology limitations, in 2008, FinCEN developed a new process for revising BSA forms, including SARs, that may increase collaboration with some stakeholders, including some law enforcement groups concerned that certain of the 2006 revisions could be detrimental to investigations. However, the limited documentation on the process does not provide details to determine the degree to which the new process will incorporate GAOidentified best practices for enhancing and sustaining federal agency collaboration. For example, it does not specify roles and responsibilities for stakeholders or depict monitoring, evaluating, and reporting mechanisms. By incorporating some of these key collaboration practices and more fully developing and documenting its new process for form revisions, FinCEN could achieve some potential benefits that could come from closer adherence to the practices--such as greater consensus from all stakeholders on proposed SAR form revisions."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In part, to assist law enforcement agencies in their efforts to combat  money laundering, the financing of terrorist activities, and other financial  crimes, the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) requires financial institutions to  inform the federal government of any suspicious transaction related to a  possible violation of law or regulation. BSA\u2014which the U.S. Department  of the Treasury\u2019s (Treasury) Financial Crimes Enforcement Network  (FinCEN) administers\u2014and its implementing regulations provide for the  filing of suspicious activity reports (SAR) by depository institutions when  they detect a known or suspected violation of any law or regulation. Under  the regulations administered by FinCEN, a SAR is required when the  suspicious activity involves a transaction of at least $5,000 conducted or  attempted by, at, or through the institution; involves funds derived from  illegal activities; is designed to evade any reporting requirement under  federal law or other BSA requirement; has no business or apparent lawful  purpose; or the transaction is not the sort in which the customer normally  engages and there is no reasonable explanation known for the transaction.  Suspicious activity reporting is one component of broader anti-money  laundering (AML) programs that depository institutions (banks, thrifts,  and credit unions) and other financial institutions implement to comply  with BSA. A financial institution\u2019s decision to file a SAR may be subjective  and is based on its knowledge of the customer and the customer\u2019s usual  banking activity.", "Federal banking regulators\u2014the Board of Governors of the Federal  Reserve System (Federal Reserve), the Office of the Comptroller of the  Currency (OCC), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the  Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), and the National Credit Union  Administration (NCUA)\u2014and state banking regulators examine depository  institutions for compliance with BSA, generally as part of their regularly  scheduled safety and soundness examinations. Depository institutions  have been required to submit SARs since 1996, longer than any other type  of financial institutions, and they file the majority of these reports. FinCEN  issued regulations subsequent to passage of the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001  that added SAR filing requirements for securities and futures firms, money  services businesses, casinos, and insurance companies, among others.", "Depository institutions have expressed concerns in congressional  testimony about the resource challenges involved in complying with SAR- related requirements and the extent to which law enforcement agencies  use SARs and other reports required under BSA. Federal law enforcement  agency officials have testified they review and use SARs proactively\u2014 separately and in multiagency teams, which often include state and local  agencies\u2014to identify potential money laundering cases and money  laundering trends, in addition to using them in ongoing investigations of  financing of terrorism and other financial crimes. They contend that SARs  can be useful in investigations months or years after they have been filed,  as the actions of subjects or co-conspirators are uncovered. Depository  institution officials have commented they lack clear guidance on what law  enforcement is looking for and finds useful in these reports.", "In this context, you requested that we examine a number of issues related  to suspicious activity reporting, which is part of a larger body of work we  are doing about FinCEN and its administration of BSA.

We assessed the reliability of these data and found  them sufficient for the purposes of this report. We interviewed  representatives of the five largest depository institutions by number of  SAR filings in 2007. We established 3 categories of depository institutions  SAR filing numbers in 2007 and interviewed representatives from 15  depository institutions randomly selected from these categories about  their experiences with SAR filing. We obtained data about SAR review  teams (multiagency teams with federal, state, and local law enforcement  representation) and interviewed staff from 13 teams randomly selected  from these data. Similarly, we interviewed law enforcement  representatives from High Intensity Financial Crime Areas (HIFCA) in  Chicago, Illinois; Los Angeles, California; Miami, Florida; and New York,  New York.

The federal regulators examine an institution\u2019s policies  and procedures for monitoring and detecting suspicious activity as part of  their examination programs. Periodic on-site safety and soundness and  compliance examinations are conducted to assess an institution\u2019s financial  condition, policies and procedures, adherence to BSA regulations (for  example, filing of SARs and other BSA-related reports), and compliance  with other laws and regulations. These examinations generally are  conducted every 12 to 18 months at small-to-midsized depository  institutions (such as community banks, midsize banks, savings  associations, and credit unions) on the basis of the regulator\u2019s rating of the  institution\u2019s risk.

For instance,  federal regulators and FinCEN may assess a CMP against depository  institutions for significant BSA violations, including the failure to file SARs  and establish and implement an AML program that conforms to federal  regulations as required by BSA. Formal enforcement actions generally are  used to address cases involving systemic, repeated noncompliance; failure  to respond to supervisory warnings; and other violations. However, most  cases of BSA noncompliance are corrected within the examination  framework through supervisory actions or letters that document the  institution\u2019s commitment to take correction action.", "Whereas FinCEN and the regulators can take a variety of civil actions  against depository and other financial institutions, DOJ may bring criminal  actions against individuals and corporations, including depository and  other financial institutions, for money laundering offenses and certain BSA  violations. The actions may result in criminal fines, imprisonment, and  forfeiture actions. Institutions and individuals willfully violating BSA and  its implementing regulations, and structuring transactions to evade BSA  reporting requirements, are subject to criminal fines, prison, or both. DOJ  generally identifies institutions violating BSA regulations through criminal  investigations of the institutions\u2019 customers.

The SAR rules require that a SAR be filed no later than 30 calendar  days from the date of the initial detection of the suspicious activity, unless  no suspect can be identified. If no suspect can be identified, the filing  period is extended to 60 days. In addition, banks should report continuing  suspicious activity by filing a report at least every 90 days.

In addition to following  regulations and guidance related to identifying suspicious activities,  depository institutions develop monitoring procedures, which typically  encompass identification or referrals by employees who conducted the  transaction for the customer, manual systems, automated systems, or any  combination thereof. Manual monitoring might consist of staff reviewing  reports generated by the institution\u2019s management information systems.  Large depository institutions that operate in many locations or have a  relatively large number of high-risk customers generally use automated  account-monitoring systems\u2014computer programs that are developed in- house or purchased from vendors for the purpose of identifying individual  transactions, patterns of unusual activity, or deviations from expected  activity. In general, these systems capture a wide range of activity, such as  deposits, withdrawals, funds transfers, automated clearing house  transactions, and automated teller machine transactions directly from the  institution\u2019s core data processing system.

Because of the subjective nature of  these factors, the relative influence of individual factors on SAR filing  increases cannot be determined. One of the most frequently identified  reasons for the increases was the implementation of automated  monitoring systems at depository institutions. According to most users of  such systems at depository institutions and federal regulator  representatives, these systems are capable of identifying significantly  more unusual transactions than could be identified manually by institution  staff. For example, FinCEN representatives said most institutions have  adopted systems that are capable of identifying possible structuring  activity\u2014currency transactions carried out in a manner that would avoid  the $10,000 threshold that would trigger mandatory currency transaction  reporting by depository institutions. Representatives from OCC noted  that more sophisticated systems at larger institutions also are capable of  incorporating demographic information about the customers and their  transaction histories into system alerts of potentially suspicious activity.  Depository institution staff use the information in the alerts to assist in  their investigations and decide whether to file a SAR.", "Representatives from various federal agencies and depository institutions  we interviewed said that highly publicized enforcement actions taken by  the federal banking regulators and FinCEN, and criminal fines by DOJ  against systemic BSA noncompliance\u2014some of which included significant  SAR failures\u2014also have contributed to the increases in SAR filings.  Specifically, they noted that in 2004 FinCEN and OCC concurrently  assessed $25 million in CMPs against Riggs Bank for significant and willful  BSA violations. In 2005, DOJ announced that Riggs Bank pled guilty to  criminal violations of BSA, involving repeated and systemic SAR-related  failures. Similarly, representatives noted the 2004 $40 million forfeiture  and deferred prosecution agreement into which DOJ entered with  AmSouth Bank for SAR failures, and the concurrent assessment by  FinCEN and the Federal Reserve of a $10 million CMP against AmSouth  Bank to address significant BSA reporting failures and serious weaknesses  in BSA compliance policies and procedures. Many of our depository  institution interviewees said that the DOJ action against AmSouth Bank  and other actions raised concerns in the banking industry that institutions  would be targeted routinely for criminal investigation and prosecution for  failure to properly implement BSA requirements, such as the failure to file  a SAR. However, in past work, we noted that DOJ pursued investigations  against a limited number of depository institutions. DOJ officials said that  investigations of depository institutions for criminal violations of BSA  generally have not involved negligence in reporting a limited number of  suspicious transactions. Furthermore, DOJ officials said that depository  institutions that have been cited for \u201cone-off\u201d BSA violations generally  would not face law enforcement investigation or charges of criminal  violation of BSA if they were otherwise had effective BSA compliance  programs.", "Most representatives from depository institutions of varying asset sizes we  interviewed said that SARs filed to avoid potential criticism during  examinations were referred to as \u201cdefensive\u201d filings and also contributed  to the increases in SAR filings. Although representatives from most  institutions said that filed relatively few SARs that they sometimes filed  defensive SARs, representatives from some institutions that filed higher  numbers of SARs said their institutions generally did not. We asked  Federal Reserve, FDIC, and NCUA officials whether defensive filing was  occurring, and they characterized the information as anecdotal.  Additionally, officials at FinCEN and OCC said their agencies separately  conducted analyses of the practice, and those analyses indicated little  evidence of defensive filing. The SAR guidance in the interagency  examination manual that regulators use states the decision to file a SAR is  inherently subjective and directs examiners to focus on whether the  institution has an effective SAR decisionmaking process, rather than on  individual SAR filing decisions. According to the manual, in those  instances where the institution has an established SAR decisionmaking  process; has followed existing policies, procedures, and processes; and  has decided not to file a SAR, examiners generally should not criticize the  institution for not filing a SAR. The federal banking regulators and  FinCEN characterized the issue as less frequently discussed within the  banking industry now than earlier in the decade.", "Furthermore, officials from the federal banking regulators and FinCEN  provided varying perspectives on what could be considered defensive SAR  filing. According to Federal Reserve officials, SARs filed as a result of the  bank\u2019s effort to comply with the 30-day requirement could be considered  defensive if, to meet the deadline, depository institutions filed SARs before  fully investigating anomalous transactions. According to FinCEN officials,  even when the institution is not certain the observed activity is suspicious,  an institution\u2019s decision to file fulfills the obligation to report the activity.  FinCEN officials said they would not consider it to be defensive filing if an  institution erred on the side of caution and filed a complete and accurate  SAR, even when the institution was not certain that the observed activity  was suspicious. Filing the SAR would fulfill the requirement to report.", "Federal regulators and depository institution representatives we  interviewed generally indicated that the passage of the USA PATRIOT Act  in 2001 and issuance of the interagency examination manual likely  contributed to increases in SAR filings. According to Federal Reserve  officials, the act generally increased awareness among depository  institutions of SAR requirements. Representatives from several depository  institutions also said that they used the interagency manual to train staff  on SAR filing and supporting documentation requirements, and that the  manual has helped improve their BSA compliance programs in general.

In the guidance, FinCEN  directed filers, when appropriate, to include the term \u201cforeign corruption\u201d  in their narratives to ensure that law enforcement agencies identify these  transactions as soon as possible. In 2007, FinCEN issued guidance  regarding 10 of the most common SAR filing errors and ways filers could  avoid them. Among other issues, the guidance addressed the importance  of explaining why the reported transaction was suspicious, and said that  not including an explanation would diminish the usefulness of the SAR to  law enforcement and other users. More specifically, FinCEN asserted that  most inadequate SAR narratives repeated information from other fields on  the form and did not sufficiently describe why the transaction was  suspicious in light of the nature and expected activity of the customer.", "In addition to providing guidance on SAR filing and usefulness, FinCEN  representatives regularly participated in outreach events about BSA/AML  issues.

FinCEN also maintains a database of its own proactive casework  and its support of other agencies\u2019 investigations. FinCEN analysts also  have access to commercial databases that contain identifying information  on individuals and businesses. FinCEN has conducted many nonpublic  analyses using SAR data, in response to requests from law enforcement  agencies. For example, in 2007, FinCEN provided a federal law  enforcement agency with a complex, large-scale BSA data analysis about  subjects of interest that were identified in SARs filed by depository  institutions and other entities. In another example, FinCEN provided a  similar analysis to another law enforcement agency on suspicious  currency flows between the United States and foreign governments  targeted by law enforcement. In 2007, FinCEN also began providing  banking departments in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto  Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands with nonpublic analyses of SAR data and  other selected BSA reports in what are called BSA Data Profiles, which are  based on SAR filings throughout the year in their respective state or  territory.

The agencies conduct sophisticated and wide-ranging analyses  more readily with the bulk downloads than is possible by accessing the  BSA database remotely and querying it for specific records. According to  these officials, the analyses they conduct using SAR data and their own  data sets further their investigations by enabling them to make links they  could not make without access to bulk SAR data. For example:    FBI incorporates SARs into its Investigative Data Warehouse, a database  that includes 50 different data sets, which facilitates complex analyses.  FBI identifies financial patterns associated with money laundering, bank  fraud, and other aberrant financial activities. FBI officials told GAO that  FBI uses the results from SAR analyses in cross-program investigations of  criminal, terrorist, and intelligence networks.

They highlight the  difficulties of addressing potentially competing objectives stemming from  PRA requirements\u2014that new federal forms be designed not only to  maximize their usefulness but also minimize burden on filers\u2014and  engaging a wide variety of stakeholders. SARs are a key information  source for federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies, as well as  the federal regulators. Because the information they contain is critical for  investigations of money laundering, terrorist financing, and other financial  crimes, it is important that the SAR form be designed to collect the  information that is most useful for law enforcement. Similarly, federal  regulators use them during examinations of depository institutions\u2019  compliance with BSA. Yet given the potential burden of SAR filings,  especially for depository institutions\u2014the most frequent filers\u2014it is  important the process used to revise the form be a collaborative effort that  helps to ensure all stakeholders\u2019 concerns are considered and potential  problems identified.", "While FinCEN and other agencies worked to create and finalize a new SAR  form for depository institutions through the PRA, data management issues  suspended the implementation of the 2006 revision. Although law  enforcement representatives\u2019 views on the revised form were mixed, we  found that the process FinCEN used may not have addressed some law  enforcement concerns and introduced changes that some law enforcement  representatives said could diminish the utility of the form for their  investigative purposes. In addition, some law enforcement representatives  expressed concerns that they were not involved in the process early. Bank  regulators, on the other hand, were satisfied with the proposed changes.  Many such problems in multiagency efforts could be mitigated with  greater attention to the practices we have outlined for enhancing and  sustaining collaboration among federal agencies. Implementation of such  practices also may enable law enforcement and regulators to reach greater  consensus on proposed changes. However, FinCEN\u2019s documentation for  implementing the forms change management process does not necessarily  include all law enforcement stakeholders, such as federal prosecutors and  multiagency law enforcement teams.", "Although FinCEN may be able to address some of the issues it  encountered in the 2006 revision, FinCEN does not appear to have fully  developed a process detailed enough to help ensure such an outcome. It  does not provide details on some important considerations (such as the  articulation of a common outcome or agreed-upon roles and  responsibilities of individuals and agencies at each stage of the process)  and omits another critical practice entirely\u2014a mechanism for monitoring,  evaluating, and reporting. By better incorporating collaborative practices,  such as detailing individual and agency roles and responsibilities and  documenting the entire process, FinCEN can further develop a strategy  that will improve the SAR form and balance the possibly competing needs  of different stakeholders. And, by incorporating mechanisms to document,  monitor, evaluate, and report on the process, key decisionmakers within  agencies can obtain valuable information and assessments that could  improve both policy and operational effectiveness. Finally, by more fully  documenting its process, FinCEN likely will enhance its communications  and collaboration with stakeholders."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To better ensure that future revisions to the SAR form result in changes  that can be implemented and balance the differing needs of all  stakeholders, we recommend that the Secretary of the Treasury direct the  Director of FinCEN to further develop and document its strategy to fully  incorporate certain GAO-identified practices to help enhance and sustain  collaboration among federal agencies into the form change process and  distribute that documentation to all stakeholders. Such practices could  include defining and articulating the common federal outcome or purpose  they are seeking to achieve; defining and agreeing on their respective roles  and responsibilities; and having processes to monitor, evaluate, and report  on their efforts to enable them to identify areas for improvement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the heads of the Departments of  Homeland Security, Justice, and the Treasury; the Federal Reserve, FDIC,  NCUA, OCC, OTS, and IRS.

In some  instances, we considered, analyzed, and reported on information from  other types of financial institutions. Additionally, our quantitative analyses  were limited to 2004 through 2007 to minimize the likelihood that the  presented information would be out-of-date.", "To examine the increase in depository institutions\u2019 SAR filings, we  reviewed published findings that FinCEN supplied, as well as obtained and  reviewed statistics and related information from the banking regulators.  FinCEN also provided us with SAR data for calendar years 2000 through  2007 so we could conduct independent quantitative analyses. We then  combined that information with another set of information (such as  amount of assets) for specific institutions that we obtained from the  Federal Reserve and the National Credit Union Administration. We took  multiple steps to assess the reliability of the data. We asked bank  regulators\u2019 information technology staff to answer a data reliability  questionnaire (for example, about data cleaning and maintenance  procedures). We found the data to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes  of our report.", "To address the second part of the first objective, we interviewed many  types of stakeholder and obtained agency documents from the  interviewees to identify factors that may have contributed to the increase  in the number of SARs filed from calendar year 2000 through 2007.  Because of the subjective nature of this type of information, we based our  findings on the most frequently cited factors. The types of people  interviewed are identified in table 2. Representatives from depository  institutions constituted another type of interviewee. As part of the process  to select the depository institutions, we grouped the depository  institutions into four categories, depending on the number of SARs filed in  calendar year 2007. We interviewed representatives from all 5 institutions  that had the largest number of SAR filings in 2007 as well as  representatives from 15 randomly selected institutions. The 15 institutions  represented different categories of SAR filings: small (0-5 SARs filed in  2007), medium (6-17), and large (176 or more\u2014excluding the 5 largest).", "To identify the actions that federal agencies have taken to improve the  usefulness of SARs for law enforcement, we interviewed officials from  FinCEN, federal law enforcement agencies, and IRS and reviewed agency  documents, as indicated for objective 2 in table 2. To examine the ways in  which federal agencies use SARs and actions they have taken to make  better use of them, we contacted representatives of the various law  enforcement groups that are indicated for objective 3 in table 2. For  example, federal prosecutors at U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices as well as federal  law enforcement officials involved in the national SAR review team were  some of the types of individuals who provided information. Among the  issues that we discussed with the law enforcement agencies were how  SAR review teams function and the results of their collaborative efforts.  We obtained information from IRS about SAR review teams and  interviewed representatives from 13 randomly selected teams. We  reviewed reports from GAO, FinCEN, and other governmental agencies to  glean additional actions. We obtained information from the IRS that  indicated the frequency with which law enforcement agencies accessed  SAR information and interviewed representatives from 8 randomly  selected state and local law enforcement agencies. All five federal  regulators and some state banking agencies also provided information on  how SARs are used in compliance examinations, and one regulator  provided us with a demonstration of how the system is accessed and the  display of the information in the system.", "To assess whether the process FinCEN uses is effective in assuring that  SAR forms are appropriate for law enforcement needs, we conducted legal  analysis related to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 and reviewed  relevant Federal Register Notices. We also reviewed comment letters  about proposed revisions to the SAR form submitted during the public  comment period. We interviewed FinCEN, federal law enforcement, and  bank regulatory representatives about the process to revise the form.  Finally, we discussed the new forms change management process with  FinCEN representatives.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2007 through February  2009 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
