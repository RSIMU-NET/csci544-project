For example, due to increasing workloads and staff attrition, SSA field office managers in some offices said they sometimes have to perform payee program duties that lower level staff typically handle. SSA has also experienced an increasing number of beneficiaries who may not have a suitable payee available. In an effort to address this challenge, SSA hosted a webinar to recruit additional payees. However, SSA officials said this effort did not result in the addition of any new payees. SSA also faces challenges ensuring that payees who are selected are suitable for the task. To help address this challenge, SSA implemented a pilot program in its Philadelphia region to screen and bar payee applicants who have been convicted of certain crimes. The pilot relies on self-reported information from payee applicants, but SSA plans to screen applicants by accessing a commercial database that contains state-level criminal information. This database, however, does not contain information from every state and it is not clear how SSA will address this limitation. SSA also faces challenges monitoring payees' use of beneficiaries' SSA funds--a time-consuming process. SSA developed an electronic accounting process that allows payees to submit reports online, which saves SSA time on handling the reports and scanning paper reports. However, it does not lessen the need for SSA staff to review some of these reports. SSA has also taken other steps to improve the administration of the program, but the SSA Office of the Inspector General (OIG) nonetheless continues to identify the program as a major SSA management challenge.", "Although changing demographics and resource constraints will challenge the future administration of the Representative Payee Program, SSA has done little to position itself for the long term. The projected growth in the aged population, as well as the incidence of individuals with dementia, will have implications for the program, as SSA will have to spend more resources finding and monitoring payees. These challenges are exacerbated by staff and resource constraints, which could make SSA less able to identify and address payee benefit misuse. Some of the steps SSA has taken align with goals in the agency's Strategic Plan. For example, SSA's piloting of a new payee screening and selection process is an effort to better protect the program from fraud, waste, and abuse--one of the objectives included in the plan. Nonetheless, SSA does not plan to assess whether the pilot actually reduces the incidence of benefit misuse in the long run. Further, SSA has not projected the future need for payees, the likely characteristics of beneficiaries, or the resources needed to administer the program. Others have identified a range of options that could help SSA address its long-term challenges by increasing its pool of payees and better targeting its monitoring practices. Experts and stakeholders we interviewed identified trade-offs for each of these options, citing the need to balance the potential benefit of reducing SSA's workloads with the possible increased risk of benefit misuse by payees. SSA has considered some options, but it has not fully assessed and compared the potential benefits and feasibility of implementing these options."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that SSA (1) evaluate the effectiveness of its criminal bar pilot, (2) estimate long-term program needs, and (3) develop a long-term strategy for addressing challenges that includes assessing options to streamline the program.

SSA  claims representatives determine whether a beneficiary needs a  representative payee by reviewing court determinations of legal  incompetency, medical evidence, or statements of relatives, friends, or  others who know and observe the beneficiary concerning the  beneficiary\u2019s ability to manage or direct the management of his or her  benefits.

According to SSA and NRC officials, the process for administering the program consists of  many time-consuming and often complicated steps, guided largely by  requirements in statute and SSA regulations. These steps are primarily  completed by field office claims representatives who are also responsible  for other work processes, such as interviewing individuals to determine  their eligibility for OASDI and SSI benefits. According to SSA\u2019s  guidance,payee, SSA staff perform the following activities:   once a beneficiary is determined to need a representative  1.  Identify Potential Payees  SSA claims representatives use a variety of approaches to identify  prospective payees, including asking the beneficiary if there is an  individual whom he or she trusts; reviewing beneficiary claims files and  any available medical records; and consulting with local government,  social service, and other providers who can often provide payee contacts.  If no payee is readily available, the claims representative tries to find a  payee by consulting the list of payee sources (e.g., local organizations  with volunteers who can serve as payees) that each field office is required  to maintain.  2.  Screen Potential Payees  After identifying prospective payees, claims representatives interview  them to assess their suitability, considering factors such as the nature of  their relationship to the beneficiary and whether they are knowledgeable  about the beneficiary\u2019s needs. In addition, claims representatives receive  automated messages during the screening process that show whether a  prospective payee is a fugitive felon or otherwise prohibited by law from  serving as a representative payee.  3.  Appoint a Payee  SSA\u2019s guidance includes preference lists to assist claims representatives  in selecting a payee when more than one candidate is available. For  example, the preference list for adults is as follows:  (1) a spouse, parent or other relative with custody or who shows    (2) a legal guardian/conservator with custody or who shows strong   (3) a friend with custody; (4) a public or nonprofit agency or institution;  (5) a federal or state institution; (6) a statutory guardian; (7) a voluntary conservator; (8) a private, for-profit institution with custody and is licensed  (9) a friend without custody, but who shows strong concern for the            beneficiary\u2019s well-being, including persons with power of    attorney;      (10) anyone not listed above who is qualified and able to act as     payee, and who is willing to do so; and  (11) an organization that charges a fee for its service.", "Although claims representatives are generally expected to select payees  in the order in which they are listed, they may deviate from this order  based on their assessment of the beneficiary\u2019s individual circumstances.

In addition, SSA  has experienced an increasing number of beneficiaries, such as persons  suffering from mental health conditions or the elderly, who may not have  a suitable payee readily available. Recognizing the challenges associated  with finding payees for some beneficiaries, SSA attempted to identify and  recruit individuals and organizations who would be willing to serve as  payees. For example, SSA partnered with the National Alliance on Mental  Illness in 2012 to host a webinar to recruit additional payees for  beneficiaries suffering from mental health conditions.

For instance, in  June 2012, SSA initiated a pilot in its Philadelphia region to screen and  block payee applicants who have been convicted of any 1 of 12 types of  felonies. Under the pilot, SSA field staff are required to bar certain  payee applicants who have committed one or more of these crimes.  According to SSA officials, as of January 23, 2013, SSA staff in the  Philadelphia region barred 108 out of 10,291 applicants from serving as  payees as a result of the pilot. SSA said that the pilot primarily relies on  self-reported information from payee applicants. In our past work, we  found that reliance on self-reported information alone can be problematic  because it may not be accurate. In April 2013, SSA published a notice  in the Federal Register that agency officials said would allow them to  collect data necessary to use Lexis/Nexis Accurint, a database that  contains state-level felony and misdemeanor information, to perform  criminal background checks on payee applicants. According to SSA  officials, the agency is currently testing an automated tool to query the  Accurint database as well as developing field office procedures and  training materials. SSA plans to begin using the database to screen  payee applicants in the summer of 2013. Although the database could  help SSA staff in the Philadelphia region better screen payee applicants,  it is limited because it does not contain data from every state. It is not  clear how, if at all, SSA is going to address these limitations. SSA said  the focus of the pilot is to determine how easily these additional controls  can be implemented.

These options, as well as interviewees\u2019  views on them, are described below.", "As noted earlier, SSA\u2019s most recent efforts to recruit more payees have  not been very successful. The lack of additional payee volunteers may be  because local service providers, such as those that serve individuals with  developmental disabilities or the elderly, are facing similar resource  constraints as SSA. Many interviewees said that it might not be cost- effective for SSA to invest its scarce resources on an effort that would  likely yield few volunteers. Two interviewees suggested that, if SSA were  to pursue this option, the agency should pilot it first. Most interviewees  agreed that contracting out responsibility for developing and maintaining a  pool of payees would be more cost-effective for SSA than performing  these activities itself. Using an outside entity would also allow SSA staff to  focus on other tasks, and the agency could hold the contractor  accountable for maintaining a pool of qualified payees. For example, SSA  could require the contractor to find qualified payees who would commit to  serving as payees for a specified amount of time. Additionally, SSA could  structure the contract so that it emphasizes the need to find payees for  certain beneficiary groups such as the elderly or persons with  developmental disabilities.", "Under federal law, a payee can only qualify to collect a fee from a  beneficiary if the payee is (1) a state or local government agency with  fiduciary responsibilities whose mission is to carry out income  maintenance, social service, or health care-related activities or (2) a tax- exempt community-based nonprofit social service organization that is  bonded and licensed (provided licensing is available) in the state where  they serve as a payee. The organization must also regularly provide  payee services concurrently to at least five beneficiaries and generally  may not be a creditor of the beneficiary. In 2013, fee-for-service payees  could collect up to 10 percent of a beneficiary\u2019s benefit up to a maximum  of $39 per month, and up to $76 if they serve as a payee for a person  suffering from drug addiction or alcoholism. Changing the law to allow  more organizations to collect a fee could enable SSA to access a larger  pool of potential payees.

Lastly, this option could negatively  affect beneficiaries since the fee is deducted from their SSA benefit.  Some interviewees suggested that SSA could offset this potentially  negative effect on beneficiaries by paying the fee from SSA funds,  although SSA noted that this would require a statutory change.", "Courts in each state have the authority to appoint a guardian or  conservator for individuals the court determines to be incapacitated.  Generally, guardianships are legal relationships created when a state  court grants one person or entity the authority and responsibility to make  decisions in the best interest of an incapacitated individual concerning his  or her person or property. Automatically selecting a person legally  designated to manage the beneficiary\u2019s assets, such as a guardian, to  serve as a representative payee would not only lessen the time staff  spend on screening payees, but could also reduce potential redundancies  in screening procedures between SSA and state courts. However, the  potential benefit of this option cannot be fully assessed because SSA  officials said they do not have data on the number of guardians who  currently serve as payees. Despite its potential benefits, this option could  also face implementation challenges because some guardians may not  want to serve as payees due to administrative program requirements.  Further, automatically appointing individuals to serve as payees without  screening them could be problematic because screening and eligibility  criteria for guardians vary by state with some states having more stringent  procedures than others.", "In 2009, SSA submitted a legislative proposal to Congress to eliminate  the statutory requirement that payees who are custodial parents of  children who receive benefits, or spouses who live with a beneficiary, file  annual accountings. If enacted, such a change could reduce SSA\u2019s  workload because, as noted earlier, SSA spends a considerable amount  of time obtaining and reviewing accounting reports and family members,  primarily parents and spouses, serve 85 percent of beneficiaries who  have payees. Nonetheless, annual accounting reports serve as an  important reminder that SSA funds should be used for the beneficiary. An  alternative that would lessen SSA\u2019s workload burden while maintaining a  level of accountability would be for SSA to reduce the frequency of  accountings for custodial parents and spouses. To date, Congress has  not enacted SSA\u2019s legislative proposal.", "Eliminating or limiting monitoring practices for payees who already  oversee a beneficiary\u2019s assets by virtue of their status as a guardian or  power of attorney could create many of the same challenges that might  exist if SSA were to automatically appoint these groups without screening  them. For example, although SSA initially might be able to save  resources by not monitoring selected categories of payees, there could  be long-term costs resulting from increased instances of payee fraud,  waste, and abuse. Relying on state court monitoring also replaces a  national framework with a variety of state practices, which could result in  different standards for oversight and potentially make some beneficiaries  more vulnerable to having their funds misused. Further, we previously  reported that states face challenges adequately monitoring guardians and  that persons with power of attorney can easily exploit beneficiaries.", "As previously noted, all payees are generally required by law to submit  annual accounting reports for review by SSA. To better target its  accounting reviews to payees who are most likely to misuse benefits  based on the misuse predictive model described earlier, SSA could seek  legislative changes to this requirement.

SSA also began investigating 13 payees for benefit misuse.  Some experts have suggested that expanding NDRN\u2019s contract to have it  conduct site reviews for other payees, such as individuals, could help  lessen the challenges SSA faces in conducting these reviews. Another  alternative, which is being used by some courts are volunteer  guardianship monitoring programs, would be to identify and train a pool of   As of November 2, 2012, SSA had received 557 payee  volunteers to assist with monitoring. Under such an approach, SSA could  work with volunteer organizations to train and certify individuals to monitor  payees. With both of these options, SSA would still have to devote  some level of staff and resources to addressing any findings identified  during the reviews.", "More than half of all beneficiaries with a payee are under the age of 18  and nearly 90 percent of these beneficiaries had their parent as a payee  in 2011. According to SSA, custodial parents generally serve  appropriately as payees for their children. Allowing custodial parents to  automatically receive benefits on behalf of their children would reduce  SSA staffs\u2019 responsibility to screen and monitor parent payees, thus  potentially freeing up staff and program resources to focus on aspects of  the program SSA considers high need or high risk. This option would also  decrease the burden on parents by not requiring them to apply to be their  child\u2019s payee or file annual accounting reports. According to a  Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 (VA) official, the department does not  require custodial parents to serve as payees for minors who receive  monthly benefits. Nonetheless, eliminating the requirement that parents  be assigned as payees also eliminates any safeguards\u2014screening and  monitoring\u2014that would help to ensure that children\u2019s benefits are being  used on their behalf.", "GAO and various experts have long recognized the need for better  coordination and exchange of information between SSA and other entities  that serve SSA beneficiaries and have made recommendations for SSA  to share information with these entities to the extent permitted by law. For  example, we reported in 2004 that the lack of systematic coordination  weakens the oversight of incapacitated people and may leave them at  risk of not being assigned a payee or guardian despite having been  identified as needing one. We further reported that insufficient  interagency coordination may leave incapacitated people more vulnerable  to abuse or neglect. Interviewees generally agreed that developing  better relationships on payee matters with state and local entities is an  important step toward helping SSA manage the program and leverage its  constrained resources; however, several interviewees said there may be  some challenges to sharing information on payee matters such as privacy  issues and developing a data sharing mechanism. Sharing information  could lessen the time SSA staff spend on screening payees and following  up on delinquent accounting reports. For example, SSA could use  information from state courts to determine whether or not to appoint a  guardian as a payee or to better target its monitoring practices.", "SSA has acknowledged that changes to the Representative Payee  Program are needed to address its growing workloads and effectively  manage the program, but told us that few of the options identified are  currently under consideration by the agency. For example, SSA has  recognized the potential benefits of some of these options, such as  limiting parental accounting requirements and developing a pool of  payees for hard to serve beneficiaries, and has taken steps toward  implementing them. Nonetheless, SSA officials said they cannot  implement several options, such as automatically assigning payees  without screening them or limiting accounting requirements for certain  groups of payees because they are statutorily required to conduct these  activities. They also indicated that some of these options would not help  SSA administer the program more effectively or would be too costly. For  example, SSA said that creating a data sharing mechanism with state  courts would cost too much; however, it has not formally or systematically  estimated the cost of sharing this information. Some experts we spoke  with highlighted the need for SSA to examine alternatives to manage the  payee program. Further, GAO\u2019s internal controls guidance states that  agencies should determine what actions they should take to manage  program risk. GAO has also reported that without effective short- and  long-term planning, which takes into account the changing environment,  federal agencies risk delivering programs and services that may not meet  critical needs.feasibility of these options or begun to explore other alternatives that  could help it address the current and growing demands of the program.  Such an assessment would inform the types of actions that SSA should  take, including whether the agency should pursue developing legislative  proposals for changes."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Given the significant role that payees play in the lives of many SSA  beneficiaries, it is imperative for SSA to take a long-term strategic  approach to position itself to administer the Representative Payee  Program effectively in the future. Over the years, SSA has taken  important steps to improve the program in an effort to prevent misuse of  benefits by payees. However, if SSA fails to evaluate the effectiveness of  these changes, such as those in its Philadelphia pilot, in actually  preventing misuse, SSA runs the risk of wasting its scarce resources on  activities that may be ineffective over the long term.", "SSA\u2019s lack of long-term planning could also render it unable to effectively  administer the program and expose an already vulnerable population to  misuse of their benefits. Without a clearer assessment of the future need  for payees, SSA runs the risk of not being prepared to serve a growing  number of aged beneficiaries whose needs often differ from those of  beneficiaries typically served by SSA staff. In addition, SSA may be  unable to ensure that there are enough payees available and that  beneficiaries\u2019 funds will be adequately protected from misuse. Lastly,  because of its lack of long-term planning, SSA may be limited in its ability  to make effective decisions about how to modify the program going  forward.", "While there are no simple fixes to help SSA manage its growing program  workloads, SSA has demonstrated that it cannot effectively administer the  program within its current resources and structure. Experts have identified  a range of possible options that SSA could consider to meet its goals of  streamlining the program and protecting beneficiaries from misuse.  Nonetheless, if SSA does not assess the potential costs and benefits of  different alternatives and pursue operational and program design  changes the agency deems to be feasible and cost-effective, it will miss  an opportunity to better position itself to meet its service delivery  challenges in the future."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To better position itself to address its growing challenges with  administering the program while protecting individuals\u2019 benefits from  misuse, we recommend that the Commissioner of SSA direct the Deputy  Commissioner, Retirement and Disability Policy, to work with relevant  SSA offices to  1.  systematically evaluate the effectiveness of SSA\u2019s criminal bar pilot to  help ensure that it meets its intended purpose of preventing misuse;  2.  estimate the long-term increase in the number of individuals who will  need a payee and their demographic characteristics, as well as the  resources that will be needed to meet this increase in demand; and  3.  develop a long-term strategy for addressing these challenges that  includes developing and testing a range of alternatives that could  streamline program processing to determine and compare their  feasibility and their potential impact on processing times and risk of  benefit misuse."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Commissioner of SSA for review  and comment.

In addition, SSA said that it is currently working to estimate  the number of beneficiaries who will need a payee and will use this  information to develop long-term strategies for addressing Representative  Payee Program challenges.

We also sought input from experts, members of  organizations familiar with the program, and SSA field office managers  from 6 of the 10 regions (interviewees). These sources offered numerous  options to address long-term challenges facing SSA\u2019s Representative  Payee Program. We selected options that could assist SSA in managing  its growing workload, including options that directly address the growing  need for payees and SSA\u2019s challenges in monitoring these payees. We  combined some options that were similar in nature to reduce the number  of options to a reasonable amount for interviews. We also eliminated  actions that SSA has already implemented.", "We selected a nongeneralizable sample of experts who had conducted  research on the Representative Payee Program (or similar programs  such as guardianship programs), served on Advisory panels, or who are  affiliated with an organization that represents persons who may need  payee services (see table 2 for a list of entities). In addition, we selected a  group of interviewees to help ensure a range of viewpoints. Specifically,  we interviewed persons who work with different beneficiary groups such  as the aged, persons with developmental disabilities, persons with  substance abuse, and others.
