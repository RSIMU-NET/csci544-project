Most of the part B drugs with the highest Medicare payments and billing volume fall into three categories: those that are billed for by physicians and typically provided in a physician office setting (such as chemotherapy drugs), those that are billed for by pharmacy suppliers and administered through a durable medical equipment (DME) item (such as a respiratory drug given in conjunction with a nebulizer), and those that are also billed by pharmacy suppliers but are patient-administered and covered explicitly by statute.  Studies by the Department of Justice, the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) Office of the Inspector General (OIG), and the House Committee on Commerce show that Medicare\u2019s payment for these drugs in some cases is significantly higher than the actual costs to the physicians and other providers who bill Medicare for these products.", "In September 2000, the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA)\u2014 now the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)\u2014took steps to reduce Medicare\u2019s payment for part B-covered drugs by authorizing Medicare carriers, the contractors that pay part B claims, to use prices obtained in the Justice Department investigations of providers\u2019 drug acquisition costs. HCFA retracted this authority in November 2000 following concerns raised by providers. In December 2000, as part of recent Medicare legislation, the Congress asked us to study Medicare\u2019s payments for part B-covered drugs and make recommendations for pricing methodology refinements. We have reported our findings and made recommendations, as mandated, today.", "My remarks today will focus on (1) Medicare payment policies to cover part B-covered drug costs and costs of administering the drugs and (2) key features of other payers\u2019 reimbursement policies that suggest opportunities to improve the appropriateness of Medicare\u2019s payments.

For both physician-billed drugs and pharmacy supplier-billed drugs, Medicare payments often far exceeded widely available prices. Despite concerns about what discounts may be available to smaller-volume purchasers, physicians who billed Medicare for low volumes of drugs reported receiving discounts from AWP, for most drugs, that were similar to or greater than those afforded by the widely available prices we documented.", "Physicians and pharmacy suppliers contend that the excess payments for covered drugs are necessary to offset what they claim to be inappropriately low or no Medicare payments for services related to the administration or delivery of these drugs. For administering physician- billed drugs, Medicare makes explicit payments under the physician fee schedule. Our forthcoming review of practice expense payments under the fee schedule will make several points regarding oncologists\u2019 payments. It will show that Medicare\u2019s payments to these specialists were 8 percent higher than they would have been if the program\u2019s prior payment method had remained in place and will show that oncologists\u2019 payments relative to their estimated practice expenses were close to the average for all specialists. However, we will also show that HCFA made questionable modifications to its basic method of setting practice expense payments, which resulted in lowering the average fees paid for the administration of drugs by physicians\u2019 staffs.", "For delivering pharmacy supplier-billed drugs, Medicare\u2019s payment policies are uneven. Pharmacy suppliers billing Medicare receive a dispensing fee for one drug type\u2014inhalation therapy drugs\u2014but there are no similar payments for other DME-administered or oral drugs. However, Medicare pays DME suppliers for the rental or purchase of equipment and supplies, and long-standing problems in the program\u2019s payments for these items may result in overpayments that implicitly compensate for some service delivery costs not covered.", "Other payers and purchasers, such as health plans and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), employ different approaches in paying for or purchasing drugs that may be instructive for Medicare. In general, they make use of the leverage from their volume and competition to secure better prices. The federal purchasers, furthermore, use that leverage to secure verifiable data on actual market transactions to establish their price schedules. Private payers\u2019 practices\u2014such as negotiating prices that result in selecting certain products or suppliers and arriving at terms without open competition\u2014would not be easily adaptable to Medicare, given the program\u2019s size and need to ensure access for providers and beneficiaries.

Manufacturers periodically report AWPs to publishers of drug pricing data, such as the Medical Economics Company, Inc., which publishes the Red Book, and First Data Bank, which compiles the National Drug Data File. In paying claims, Medicare carriers use published AWPs to determine Medicare\u2019s payment amount, which is 95 percent of AWP.Thus, given the latitude manufacturers have in setting AWP, these payments may be unrelated to market prices that physicians and suppliers actually pay for the products."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Drug Supply Chain Involves Multiple Parties and Arrangements That Influence the Net Price to the End Purchaser", "paragraphs": ["The actual price that providers pay for Medicare part B drugs is often not transparent. Physicians and suppliers may belong to group purchasing organizations (GPO) that pool the purchasing of multiple entities to negotiate prices with wholesalers or manufacturers. GPOs may negotiate different prices for different purchasers, such as physicians, suppliers, or hospitals. In addition, providers can purchase part B-covered drugs from general or specialty pharmaceutical wholesalers or can have direct purchase agreements with manufacturers.", "Certain practices involving these various entities can result in prices paid at the time of sale that do not reflect the final net cost to the purchaser. Manufacturers or wholesalers may offer purchasers rebates based on the volume of products purchased not in a single sale but over a period of time. Manufacturers may also establish \u201cchargeback\u201d arrangements for end purchasers, which result in wholesalers\u2019 prices overstating what those purchasers pay. Under these arrangements, the purchaser negotiates a price with the manufacturer that is lower than the price the wholesaler charges for the product.

The discounts indicate that Medicare\u2019s payments for these drugs were at least $532 million higher than providers\u2019 acquisition costs in 2000. Further, the discounts we report may only be the starting point for additional discounts provided to certain purchasers, as chargebacks, rebates, and other discounts may drive down the final sale price.", "Concerns have been expressed that small providers either could not or do not obtain such favorable prices. Therefore, we surveyed a sample of physicians who billed Medicare for low volumes of chemotherapy drugs to see if they were able to obtain similar discounts. All of the low-volume purchasers who responded to our survey reported obtaining similar or better discounts than the widely available prices we had documented.", "More than one-third of these physicians reported belonging to GPOs and obtained the GPOs\u2019 substantial discounts, while others said they had contracts with manufacturers and wholesalers.", "As with physician-billed drugs, Medicare\u2019s payments for pharmacy supplier-billed drugs generally far exceeded the prices available to these suppliers. For the drugs we examined, Medicare\u2019s payments were at least $483 million more than what the suppliers paid in 2000. Further, the discounts we report were largest for products that could be obtained from more than one source. Inhalation therapy drugs administered through DME and oral immunosuppressive drugs represent most of the high- expenditure, high-volume drugs billed to Medicare by suppliers. Specifically:   Two drugs, albuterol and ipratropium bromide, used with DME for respiratory conditions, account for most of the pharmacy-supplied drugs paid for by Medicare. In 2001, they were available to pharmacy suppliers at prices that averaged, respectively, 85 percent and 78 percent less than AWP.", "Other high-volume DME-administered drugs had prices averaging 69 percent and 72 percent less than AWP. These findings are consistent with prior studies of the prices of similar drugs.", "Two of the four high-volume oral immunosuppressives were available from wholesalers with average discounts of 14 percent and 77 percent.

Physicians are compensated directly for drug administration through the physician fee schedule. Pharmacy suppliers are compensated for dispensing inhalation therapy drugs used with a nebulizer, which make up the majority of their part B drug claims. No explicit payments are made to pharmacy suppliers for dispensing other drugs, but they may receive payments for equipment and supplies associated with DME-administered drugs. Both physicians and pharmacy suppliers contend that the excess in Medicare\u2019s payments for part B-covered drugs compensates for related service costs inadequately reimbursed or not explicitly covered at all.", "In prior work on the Medicare physician fee schedule, we concluded that the agency\u2019s basic method of computing practice expense payments to physicians was sound. The implementation of this fee schedule, however, has been controversial. The Congress required that payments be budget neutral relative to prior spending. Medicare\u2019s physician payments were, in the aggregate, seemingly adequate, as most physicians were participating in Medicare and accepting the program\u2019s fees as payment in full. Because of the budget neutrality requirement, if one specialty\u2019s fees increased on average, some others would have to decline. Such redistributions have occurred and some are significant.", "Oncologists, who represent the majority of physicians billing for drugs, argue that Medicare\u2019s payments for administering chemotherapy are inappropriately low and that the excess Medicare drug payments are needed to offset their losses. Yet oncology is one of the specialties to gain under the resource-based physician fee schedule. In our separate study on physicians\u2019 practice expenses under Medicare\u2019s fee schedule, we will show that payments to oncologists were 8 percent higher than they would have been if the prior charge-based payment method had been maintained; the study will also show that oncologists\u2019 payments relative to their estimated practice expenses, which include chemotherapy administration, were close to the average for all specialties.", "While oncologists do not appear disadvantaged overall under the fee schedule, adjustments HCFA made to the basic method of computing payments reduced fees for some oncologists\u2019 services. In those adjustments, HCFA modified the basic method in computing payments for services delivered without direct physician involvement, like much of chemotherapy administration. The modifications were intended to correct for perceived low payments for these services. While they increased payments for some of these services, they lowered them for many others. Moreover, they increased payments on average for services involving physicians. Oncology payments were particularly affected, as services without physician involvement constitute about one-third of oncologists\u2019 Medicare-billed services, compared to about 5 percent of all physician- billed services. Because of the modifications to the basic method, oncology practice expense payments for nonphysician chemotherapy administration were on average 15 percent lower, while payments for physician-administered services were 1 percent higher, than if HCFA had used the basic method. Across all services, the modifications resulted in oncology practice expense payments that were 6 percent lower. Using the basic method for all services would eliminate these reductions and add about $31 million to oncology payments. Our study will recommend that CMS revert to the use of the basic methodology to determine practice expense payments for all services.", "We will also recommend that CMS address a data adjustment it made that affects oncology payments under the new fee schedule. The agency reduced oncology\u2019s reported supply expenses to keep from paying twice for drugs that are reimbursed separately by Medicare. Oncologists acknowledge that the supply expense estimate needed to be reduced, but argue that the reduction was too large. We have recommended that the agency develop the appropriate data to more accurately estimate oncology supply expenses. Substituting a supply expense estimate based on a methodology developed by the American Society of Clinical Oncology would raise practice expense payments an additional $20 million, if done in conjunction with our recommendation to use the basic method to calculate payments for all services.", "Oncologists have raised concerns about whether the data used to estimate their practice expenses constituted a representative sample of practices surveyed and whether these data reflect current practices in delivering services. How improvements in the data to estimate practice expenses may affect payment levels is uncertain. Payments are based on the differences in expenses of services of one specialty compared to those of others. Some of the data concerns raised by oncologists may apply to other specialties as well, so that additional and more current data may reveal that the relative cost of one service compared to others may have changed only modestly. We are conducting a separate study to determine how CMS can improve and update the information used to estimate specialties\u2019 practice expenses.", "Similar to the physicians who bill for part B drugs, pharmacy suppliers and their representatives contend that the margin on the Medicare drug payment is needed to compensate them for costs not covered by Medicare\u2014that is, the clinical, administrative, and other labor costs associated with delivering the drug. These include costs for billing and collection; facility and employee accreditation; licensing and certifications; and providing printed patient education materials. Medicare pays a dispensing fee of $5.00 for inhalation therapy drugs used with a nebulizer, which are the vast majority of the pharmacy-supplied drugs. This fee was instituted in 1994. It is higher than dispensing fees paid by pharmacy benefit managers, which average around $2.00, and is comparable to many state Medicaid programs, which range from $2.00 to over $6.00. For other pharmacy-supplied drugs, Medicare makes no explicit payment for dispensing the drug.", "Besides the profits on the DME-related drugs, pharmacy suppliers may receive additional compensation through the payment for DME and related supplies. Our prior work suggests that, for two reasons, Medicare DME and supply payments may exceed market prices. First, because of an imprecise coding system, Medicare carriers cannot determine from the DME claims they process which specific products the program is paying for. Medicare pays one fee for all products classified under a single billing code, regardless of whether their market prices are greatly below or above that fee. Second, DME fees are often out of line with current market prices. Until recently, DME fees had generally been adjusted only for inflation because the process required to change the fees was lengthy and cumbersome. As a result, payment levels may not reflect changes in technology and other factors that could significantly change market prices."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Other Purchasers\u2019 Practices Are Instructive for Reforming Medicare\u2019s Method of Paying for Part B-Covered Drugs", "paragraphs": ["Private insurers and federal agencies, such as VA, employ different approaches in paying for or purchasing drugs that may provide useful lessons for Medicare. In general, these payers make use of the leverage of their volume and competition to secure better prices.

Private payers can negotiate with some suppliers to the exclusion of others and arrive at terms without clear criteria or a transparent process. This practice would not be easily adaptable to Medicare, given the program\u2019s size and need to ensure access for providers and beneficiaries. How other federal agencies have exercised their leverage may be more instructive and readily adaptable for Medicare.", "VA and certain other government purchasers buy drugs based on actual prices paid by private purchasers\u2014specifically, on the prices that drug manufacturers charge their \u201cmost-favored\u201d private customers. In exchange for being able to sell their drugs to state Medicaid programs, manufacturers agree to offer VA and other government purchasers drugs at favorable prices, known as Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) prices. So that VA can determine the most-favored customer price, manufacturers provide information on price discounts and rebates offered to domestic customers and the terms and conditions involved, such as length of contract periods and ordering and delivery practices. (Manufacturers must also be willing to supply similar information to CMS to support the data on the average manufacturer\u2019s price, known as AMP, and best price they report for computing any rebates required by the Medicaid program.)", "VA has been successful in using competitive bidding to obtain even more favorable prices for certain drugs. Through these competitive bids, VA has obtained national contracts for selected drugs at prices that are even lower than FSS prices. These contracts seek to concentrate the agency\u2019s purchase on one drug within therapeutically equivalent categories for the agency\u2019s national formulary. In 2000, VA contract prices averaged 33 percent lower than corresponding FSS prices.", "Medicare\u2019s use of competition has been restricted to several limited-scale demonstration projects authorized by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. In one of these demonstrations under way in San Antonio, Texas, suppliers bid to provide nebulizer drugs, such as albuterol, to Medicare beneficiaries. While Medicare normally allows any qualified provider to participate in the program, under the demonstration only 11 bidders for nebulizer drugs were selected to participate. In exchange for restricting their choice of providers to the 11 selected, beneficiaries are not liable for any differences between what suppliers charge and what Medicare allows.
