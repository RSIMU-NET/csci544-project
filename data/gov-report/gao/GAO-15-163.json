However, IRS has not systematically made such a comparison for its telephone service because of budget constraints and difficulty in identifying comparable organizations, according to IRS officials. By not comparing itself to other call center operations, IRS is missing an opportunity to identify and address gaps between actual and desired service, and inform Congress about resources needed to close the gap. More efficient telephone service could help improve correspondence service because the same staff provides those services.", "IRS did not set numerical goals\u2014such as a reduction in wait time\u2014or develop a plan to assess the effects of its 2014 service changes.

Redesign notices to clearly state why the notice was issued; if a  response is required; what action, if any, is required; and inform  taxpayers about online resources and self service tools as an  alternative to calling or writing the IRS.  2.  Expand use of the Oral Statement Authority tool to reduce the amount  of written correspondence to resolve penalty relief requests.3.  Direct taxpayers who meet the Online Payment Agreement  qualifications to use a tool online (and at kiosks where available) to  apply and set up installment payment agreements instead of calling or  visiting IRS.  4.  Reduce the volume of IRS products at TACs and community outlets,  including forms, instructions, and publications that are available online  at IRS.gov, and encourage taxpayers to use available online sources.  5.  More heavily promote electronic payment options, such as IRS Direct  Pay, as an alternative to cash, check, or money order payments made  at a TAC site or by mail.", "These service changes are examples of IRS\u2019s efforts to promote more  technology-based services to serve the maximum number of taxpayers  possible more effectively and efficiently. We have previously reported  that, given the volume of taxpayers calling IRS and sending  correspondence, shifting taxpayers to self-service tools, such as  interactive automated telephone lines or IRS\u2019s website, is key to  improving taxpayer services.then fewer will need to speak to an IRS assistor and IRS\u2019s costs will fall."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS Used its New Enterprise Risk Management Process to Identify Major Risks for the 2015 Filing Season, but Management Plans Lack Specificity", "paragraphs": ["According to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, implementation of  new tax laws such as PPACA combined with a tight budget and the  possibility of Congress passing a late package of tax extenders threatens  to make 2015 \u201cthe most complicated filing season before us in a long  time, if ever.\u201d At the enterprise level, in February 2014, IRS undertook a new approach to risk management in response to management failures  related to applications for tax exempt status. In that effort, IRS  established an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process that  formalizes risk management across the organization.", "As part of the ERM process, IRS created several risk registers, including  an enterprise risk register that consists of 15 broad emerging risk  categories. The top two risks IRS identified were (1) staffing and training  and (2) budget sufficiency. IRS ranked the emerging risk categories by  highest to lowest likelihood and impact. Also as part of ERM, IRS  developed two other enterprise-wide risk registers, one covering PPACA  and the other FATCA. In addition, IRS developed a risk register for its  W&I division, which is responsible for the filing season. The PPACA,  FATCA, and W&I risk registers identify risks and list management  activities that might affect the filing season. IRS plans to expand risk  management procedures at the process level, such as filing season  operations, in the future. IRS\u2019s ERM guidance notes that divisions and  offices should determine appropriate risk management activities.", "Separate from the ERM process, IRS has a long-standing process to  ensure filing season readiness. This process strongly mirrors our  framework for risk management\u2014including identifying risks, developing  management actions, getting management concurrence, and  implementing and monitoring those actions. The FSR Action Plan  contains specific steps to undertake in response to critical tasks, given  the budgetary constraints under which the filing season operates.", "While there is no established universally agreed upon set of requirements  or processes for a risk management framework, we have previously  developed one that can be used to inform agency officials and decision  makers of the basic components of a risk management system or which  can be used as a stand-alone guide. Consistent with our framework, risk  management activities should evaluate alternative countermeasures to  reduce risk being considered along with associated costs. Furthermore,  evaluating alternative countermeasures should include specific  countermeasures to reduce risk.", "Table 2 shows the results of our analysis of IRS enterprise risk  management procedures and filing season procedures.", "As table 2 shows, IRS has made good progress in setting up its risk  management process. In some cases we found it was too early to assess  whether the ERM process meets the criteria. For example, the status of  monitoring efforts is unknown because the risk management effort is still  in the early stages.", "However, in the alternatives evaluation stage, we found IRS has an  opportunity to strengthen the ERM process. The criteria of this stage are  specific countermeasures to reduce risk, use of external sources to  improve decision making, and cost-benefit analysis of countermeasures.", "According to IRS\u2019s own guidance, management plans should be detailed  and contain the following information: all areas that could be impacted if  an adverse event occurred; all activities required to effectively reduce  likelihood, impact, or both; critical or due dates, external dependencies  and activity ownership; and residual risk (risk left after management  activities) and actions taken to address residual risks.", "IRS has not developed specific countermeasures as part of its risk  management activities. Instead, in many cases, the management  activities rely on decision making once the adverse event occurs rather  than providing an explicit course of action (see appendix IX for  examples). IRS\u2019s proposed activities lack specific countermeasures to  address the risk, but rather emphasize opportunities to assess the  adverse event as it unfolds. For example, IRS has identified delays in  creating PPACA forms as a high impact risk that may occur for the 2015  filing season, but has not identified specific countermeasures for  addressing this likely event. Developing specific countermeasures would  allow IRS to better address likely risks by either reducing the probability  an event may occur or by managing the effects of an adverse event.", "Officials in W&I said they have not yet fully developed alternatives  because they have focused on becoming familiar with risk management  processes. An official in IRS\u2019s ERM office stressed the importance of  prioritizing risks so as to most efficiently direct the use of resources to  develop management activities. In April, IRS undertook what officials  described as a \u201ctemperature check\u201d that had the aim of assessing current  risks and indentifying additional risks to provide a high-level overview of  risks within the business units and aggregating them at the enterprise  level. These risks were listed in various risk registers and include  management activities as well as a link to the emerging risk categories.  IRS officials acknowledged that the risk management strategies need  further refinement.", "We have reported on IRS budget cuts and the uncertainty the cuts cause,  but simply ranking perennial concerns such as staffing and budget may  delay the development of management activities on other impending  potential risks and loses sight of why risk management is important. The  reason for risk management is to provide options to tackle risks in a  budget constrained environment.", "As mentioned earlier, many of the management activities listed in the risk  registers envision meetings to discuss a response to an unfolding risk  situation. These types of meetings should be held ahead of time and a  range of scenarios should be considered with appropriate response.  Then, when a risk situation unfolds, specific countermeasures or a  roadmap is already in place to guide the response. Without specific  countermeasures, including a cost-benefit analysis of options, IRS is  unable to provide clear guidance for implementing or prioritizing  countermeasures, which could hamper its ability to respond to adverse  events that could affect filing season operations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS Has Implemented Six Filing Season Recommendations but Some Significant Ones Remain Open", "paragraphs": ["Since 2010, we have issued seven reports on various aspects of IRS\u2019s  filing season activities.

For example, IRS implemented  our 2011 recommendation to offer an automated telephone line that gives  taxpayers the status of their amended tax return. This telephone line  provided taxpayers with faster service because they did not have to wait  for a live person to assist them. The phone line also enabled IRS to  reduce costs and make better use of its available resources because it  lowered taxpayer demand to talk to a live assistor. Table 6 in appendix X  summarizes the filing season recommendations implemented by IRS.", "Tables 7 and 8 in appendices XI and XII summarize the 14  recommendations IRS has yet to implement.

Congress took our  2009 suggestion and provided IRS with MEA so it could automatically  verify taxpayers\u2019 compliance with payback provisions for the 2008 First- Time Homebuyer Credit. With this authority, IRS was able to adjust  taxpayers\u2019 refunds if they had not complied with the payback provision.  As a result, from fiscal years 2010 through 2013, IRS prevented over  $500 million in improper refunds from being sent to taxpayers.

The importance  of providing high quality customer service is driven by the requirements of  GPRA, GPRAMA and executive orders, and OMB guidance and  memorandums which emphasize the relationship of customer service to  agency performance and outcomes. While IRS has taken some steps to  improve telephone service, it has not systematically and periodically  compared its service to the best in business. As a result, IRS is not  benefiting as much as it could from the roughly 7,000 FTEs it is devoting  to telephone service. Further, because IRS uses the same staff for  telephone and correspondence means that it limits IRS\u2019s ability to work  paper correspondence as effectively as possible as well.", "In one effort to more effectively use resources in 2014, IRS made  decisions to reduce or cut services. While its stated goal was to improve  service, IRS did not identify the improvements it hoped to achieve. As a  result, IRS is unable to determine the effectiveness of the changes or  make informed decisions about additional service changes in 2015 and  beyond.", "Another way that IRS is trying to better manage its constrained resources  is through its new process for identifying and managing enterprise-wide  risks. If well executed, IRS\u2019s efforts should help the agency allocate  resources and take actions under conditions of uncertainty when  implementing PPACA. IRS has made good progress in setting up its risk  management process. While it is too early to assess some aspects of the  risk management framework, there is one area where IRS could take  action to better prepare itself for risks. The risk management strategies  IRS identified lack specifics, which could hamper IRS\u2019s ability to respond  in the event a risk occurs.

We disagree that IRS\u2019s telephone  operations cannot be compared to others. IRS notes, and we report, that  the agency has conducted targeted benchmarking against the best in the  business which it believes was helpful in identifying gaps and potentially  improving performance. Specifically, IRS benchmarked one measure of  telephone service\u2014level of service\u2014to both private and public sector  organizations which allowed it to identify options for modifying that  measure. However, IRS uses more than one measure to more fully  evaluate its telephone performance. Benchmarking all of those measures  alongside each other (and potentially others it does not currently use) to  the best in the business could help improve taxpayer service. Further, as  we note in our report, the criteria allow for comparison to private  organizations providing analogous services, not just those that are exactly  comparable. Comparisons of telephone service to the best in business  can help inform Congress about resources needed to improve the level of  service provided to taxpayers. Accordingly, we believe this  recommendation remains valid and should be implemented.", "IRS agreed with our recommendation to develop outcomes that are  measurable and analyze service changes to allow for valid conclusions to  be drawn. To accomplish this, IRS said that it will develop projections to  assess the effect of service changes during the 2015 filing season,  allowing it to determine the amount of resources that are reallocated as a  result of the service changes and to assess the taxpayer experience and  address opportunities for improvement. IRS reported it anticipates  completing this analysis by the end of fiscal year 2015.", "IRS did not state whether it agreed or disagreed with our  recommendation to include specific countermeasures in its risk  management plans. Our report acknowledges the progress that IRS  has made implementing its ERM program.
