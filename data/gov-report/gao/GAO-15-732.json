For example, food-for-assets activities are intended to address beneficiaries' immediate food needs while building assets to improve longer-term food security.

Despite the prevalence of conditional food aid activities, USAID does not regularly collect data on conditional food aid provided through Title II projects and, as a result, could not readily provide data on the use of these activities in USAID's projects. Without the ability to identify all conditional food aid activities, USAID cannot systematically oversee the projects that include them. According to USAID's operational policy, USAID operating units must strive to continuously learn and improve their approach to achieving results in order to meet development goals.

While USAID uses indicators to assess the effectiveness of Title II projects, USAID cannot use these indicators to systematically assess the specific effectiveness of food for assets across its Title II projects. However, during GAO's interviews with 10 implementing partners that implemented 14 projects, partners identified several benefits specific to food-for-assets activities, such as developing needed infrastructure, teaching skills to beneficiaries, and achieving short-term increases in food security.

USAID provided the remainder of the food aid through  emergency projects intended to address the food needs of vulnerable  populations affected by conflicts or natural disasters, such as droughts  and floods. To implement Title II projects, USAID enters into cooperative  agreements with implementing partners that design and implement food  aid activities and distribute the food aid. Title II development projects are  implemented by nongovernmental organizations (NGO) such as Catholic  Relief Services, Mercy Corps, Save the Children, and World Vision.

According to  USAID, its partners, and others, conditional food aid meets immediate  needs for food assistance while also contributing to local economies by,  for instance, teaching skills or constructing assets that may help reduce  food insecurity in the longer term. However, some experts have  expressed concern that attempting to meet beneficiaries\u2019 immediate food  needs in the short term, while also trying to construct assets to help  communities build resilience in the longer term, could make it more  difficult to accomplish either goal. While conditional food aid activities  have been part of food aid programs for decades, USAID\u2019s annual reports  to Congress do not specifically address conditional food aid in Title II  emergency and development projects.", "You asked us to review the amount and use of conditional food aid  provided under Title II.

To examine USAID\u2019s use of conditional food  aid in fiscal years 2013 and 2014, we reviewed USAID and implementing  partner documents, such as annual results reports and WFP standard  project reports. We analyzed these documents to determine the number  of projects that included conditional food aid activities and the types of  conditional food aid activities that were implemented and to estimate the  award amounts, beneficiaries, and metric tons of commodities associated  with these projects. To examine conditional food aid activities in greater  detail, we focused our review on development projects and food-for- assets activities. To determine the factors that implementing partners  considered when designing development food-for-assets activities and  the extent to which USAID assessed the effectiveness of food-for-assets  activities in development projects, we selected 14 of the 22 Title II  development projects implemented in fiscal years 2013 and 2014. We  selected these projects on the basis of whether they (1) contained food  for assets, (2) were active in fiscal year 2014, and (3) were in at least the  second year of implementation. We conducted semistructured interviews  with the 10 implementing partners that implemented these 14 projects,  each of which implemented at least 1 project that met these criteria. To  address all three objectives, we interviewed officials from USAID and  implementing partners. We interviewed USAID officials, as well as  implementing partner officials from NGOs that received USAID Title II  awards to carry out U.S. food assistance programs overseas, in  Washington, D.C. In addition, we interviewed WFP headquarters officials  in Italy and spoke with WFP country officials by telephone.

Such activities are intended to  achieve a variety of objectives. For example, maternal and child health  care and nutrition activities associated with conditional food aid seek to  address major health risks faced by mothers and children by providing  special rations in exchange for their attendance at health-related sessions  focusing on topics such as infant development. Food-for-training activities  provide food in exchange for participation in, for example, agricultural  training sessions intended to help recipients learn the skills necessary to  increase food productivity. Food-for-assets activities provide food in  exchange for participation in activities focused on constructing community  assets, such as roads or irrigation systems. Table 1 lists and describes  the types of conditional food aid activities implemented through Title II  projects.", "Food for assets was one of the most prevalently used types of conditional  food aid in Title II development and emergency projects in fiscal years  2013 and 2014. According to WFP, implementing partners, and subject  matter experts in the field of international food aid, food-for-assets  activities have both advantages and disadvantages. For example,  according to some experts, a major advantage of these activities is that,  by design, the individuals who can benefit the most are those most likely  to participate, for instance, because they may lack other employment  opportunities\u2014that is, those who most need the food are generally the  most willing to perform the required work, while those who do not need  the food are less motivated. According to implementing partners,  including WFP, food-for-assets activities also create community  infrastructure, such as rural roads and irrigation canals, that provides  benefits to the wider community. For instance, irrigation canals can help  increase farm productivity, and rural roads can provide access to markets  where farmers can sell produced goods. According to implementing  partners, including WFP, beneficiaries participating in such activities can  learn building and maintenance skills that can also be used to help their  communities become more resilient when food shortages occur.", "At the same time, some experts have expressed concern that food-for- assets activities can benefit those who are not among the neediest or can  fail to include the neediest, such as the elderly and those who are not  able-bodied. In addition, a critique by WFP questions whether the dual  goal of providing food to help meet beneficiaries\u2019 nutritional needs in the  short term, while also building assets to help communities increase their  resilience in the longer term, could make it difficult to accomplish either  goal. According to experts and WFP officials, conditional food aid  activities come with additional costs, such as the cost of purchasing  concrete and other materials to build irrigation canals. These costs can  reduce the partner\u2019s ability to supply food aid. Finally, expert,  implementing partner, and WFP stakeholders expressed the concern that  the assets created through these activities are not easily sustained over  the long term. For example, in a 2014 synthesis of evaluations of food-for- assets activities in 2002 through 2011, WFP reported that ongoing  operations and maintenance are required to ensure that assets remain  functional and useful. Additionally, the WFP evaluators found that  assets might not be properly constructed or maintained if the technical  expertise and specialized equipment needed for the assets were too  complicated for the community."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USAID Does Not Track Use of Conditional Food Aid, although Most Title II Projects Included It in Fiscal Years 2013-2014", "paragraphs": ["USAID does not track the use of conditional food aid in Title II projects,  although our comprehensive review of USAID data found that most Title II  projects included conditional food aid in fiscal years 2013 and 2014.

As shown in figure 3, all of the partners also  identified the availability of technical expertise as a factor that they  considered when designing food-for-assets activities for the 14 projects  we reviewed. Two of these partners explained that the availability of  expertise in the local market and in their organizations to oversee the  technical design and implementation of assets are among the most  important factors that they consider when designing food-for-assets  activities. Specifically, in Ethiopia, a partner and its subawardee told us  that they had developed a construction plan to secure cement, sand, and  stone for a dam and irrigation canal to be constructed through a food-for- assets activity. The partner spent 4 months training beneficiaries in  construction, irrigation maintenance, and water management and  employed a full-time foreman at the construction site to oversee  construction. As a result, according to the partner, an engineer estimated  that the structure would last 15 to 25 years. In contrast, a partner  implementing a project in Zimbabwe told us that it had tried to recruit  skilled laborers for food-for-assets activities by providing double food  rations but, when this effort proved unsuccessful, had to adjust its budget  and project design to reflect skilled labor as an additional cost.", "In 12 of the 14 development projects we reviewed, partners reported  working with the local community by incorporating beneficiary and  community leader input when designing food-for-assets activities. While  the type of stakeholder input varied across the projects we reviewed, 7  partners noted that community buy-in is one of the most important factors  in the success of food-for-assets activities; some also noted that  communities selected the communal assets that they viewed as high  priority. For example, partner officials implementing a project in Ethiopia  stated that community needs are one of the factors that they consider  most important when selecting food-for-assets activities. According to  partner officials, after their project was approved, they began working  directly with villages to identify potential food-for-assets activities.

Partners  citing this challenge reported varying effects on their projects. For  example, according to a partner implementing a project in the Democratic  Republic of the Congo, ongoing armed conflict affected the design of  food-for-assets activities in that, because of security concerns,  beneficiaries could not travel away from their homes or at night to work on  assets. Officials of this implementing partner cited this as one of the most  challenging factors they experienced in designing food-for-assets  activities. According to officials implementing a program in Ethiopia, the  inability to serve all of the region\u2019s most food-insecure population  because of government restrictions was one of the most challenging  factors they experienced. These officials noted that the Ethiopian  government had determined the number of beneficiaries in each district  almost 10 years ago, resulting in the exclusion of many people who are  newly eligible to participate and also limiting ration size, because there  was no mechanism to increase rations when children were born and  family size increased.", "Ensuring the quality of the assets created through food-for-assets  activities, including determining a plan for community maintenance and  use was cited as a challenge affecting design for 7 of the projects we  reviewed. According to implementing partner officials in Zimbabwe,  community preference and capacity to manage the maintenance of the  asset are essential to achieving the goals of their activities, and the  community must identify and prioritize the assets if they are to be  maintained. Additionally, according to USAID officials, if the community is  engaged in the design process, it is more likely to maintain assets after  the implementing partners\u2019 projects end and the partners leave the area.  One partner also noted that a lack of host country involvement was a  barrier to determining a plan for community maintenance and use of  roads constructed with food-for-assets labor after the project was over.

For example, according to a partner implementing a  project in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, working on food-for- assets activities taught beneficiaries the skills needed to maintain the  rural access roads that had been constructed after the partner\u2019s project  ends. Specifically, the beneficiaries learned how to develop a plan to  maintain the roads as well as community-organizing skills needed to keep  the community engaged in communal projects."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Implementing Partners Cited Numerous Challenges to Implementing Food- for-Assets Activities", "paragraphs": ["While implementing partners identified benefits of food-for-assets  activities, they also noted challenges to implementing these activities.  These challenges include weather or other unforeseen events interrupting  activities, as well as difficulties in ensuring that assets are maintained and  used after projects end. USAID officials noted that achieving long-term  benefits of food-for-assets activities often requires maintenance to ensure  that the assets remain functional and useful. While ensuring quality  control of assets and determining a plan for maintenance were cited as  design challenges for 7 projects we reviewed, these challenges may  affect implementing partners\u2019 ability to ensure that the assets will function  as planned after the food-for-assets activities end. For example, officials  implementing a project in the Democratic Republic of the Congo noted  that, although the project is using food-for-assets activities to construct  feeder roads to improve market access, no local authorities or other  entities are available to take responsibility for maintaining the roads after  the project ends.", "As figure 6 shows, partners most frequently cited interruption of food-for- assets activities by weather or other unforeseen events, such as civil  conflict, as negatively affecting implementation. For example, because  inclement weather can delay or interrupt the construction of assets,  partners must take into consideration the seasonal timing of food-for- assets activities. As one implementing partner official explained,  conducting such activities in the dry season mitigates the challenge of  inclement weather; however, beneficiaries may not need as much food  assistance during this season. In areas with armed conflict, partners  reported experiencing disruptions because of security concerns. For  example, a partner implementing a project in the Democratic Republic of  the Congo stated that it had to stop working in certain areas because of  the presence of rebel forces."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Conditional food aid activities confer benefits, such as creating communal  infrastructure, that serve the wider community, and they have the  potential to make significant contributions to meeting long-term food  security goals. Given that we found most Title II development and  emergency projects include conditional food aid activities, an  understanding of whether and under what circumstances the use of  conditional food aid activities has been effective and appropriate is  essential to USAID\u2019s oversight of Title II projects. However, without the  ability to identify, and systematically collect information about, the  conditional food aid activities being implemented in its Title II program\u2014 particularly food-for-assets activities, which our analysis found to be most  prevalent\u2014USAID is unable to make effective management decisions  about conditional food aid. For example, USAID is not able to determine  whether conditional food aid\u2019s effect on food insecurity warrants the  additional costs of, for instance, providing building materials for asset  construction projects, nor is it able to effectively assess the benefits of  these activities separately from other project activities. Moreover, without  the ability to systematically assess the effectiveness of these activities  across Title II projects, USAID is unable to benefit from lessons learned to  improve these activities in the future and to further reduce dependence on  food aid and increase food security."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To strengthen USAID\u2019s ability to monitor Title II conditional food aid and  evaluate food-for-assets activities\u2019 impact on reducing food insecurity, we  recommend that the USAID Administrator take the following two actions: establish a mechanism to readily identify all Title II projects that  include conditional food aid activities and systematically collect  information about the type of conditional activity included in each  project and  systematically assess the effectiveness of food-for-assets activities in  development projects in achieving project goals and objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to USAID and WFP for their review.

USAID signaled its intention to establish a mechanism to readily identify  all Title II projects that include conditional food aid activities and to collect  information about the type of conditional activity in each project. USAID  stated that it is already collecting such information for another food  assistance program. In addition, USAID agreed that it should assess the  effectiveness of food-for-assets activities in development projects in  achieving project goals and objectives. USAID added that it has  undertaken relevant reviews of the effectiveness and sustainability of Title  II development projects and that it is considering expanding evaluations  of completed Title II development projects to assess sustainability of  results over time. USAID disagreed with statements in our draft report  that, because it has not collected data on conditional food aid activities  systematically, the agency has limited ability to reliably oversee or  monitor programs that use these activities and is not following operation  policy that calls for systematic collection of data for monitoring and  evaluating program performance. USAID noted that its operational policy  also states that collecting more information increases the management  burden and cost to collect and analyze this information. Chapter 203 of  USAID\u2019s Automated Directives System lists efficiency as a key principle  for effective performance monitoring and does not prescribe a specific  level of data collection. We revised our draft accordingly. However, our  observations and analysis do not support USAID\u2019s position that it is able  to reliably oversee or monitor conditional food aid programs. For example,  USAID was unable to provide data on the numbers of beneficiaries,  funds, or commodities associated with conditional food activities.  Moreover, by agreeing to systematically collect data about, and assess  the effectiveness of, conditional food aid activities in Title II development  projects, USAID acknowledges the importance of this information as well  as the feasibility of the recommended actions.", "In its written comments, WFP noted, among other things, that it found  encouraging our findings regarding its capacity to design and implement  food for assets, monitor and report results, and achieve both short- and  longer-term goals.

When  designing its emergency projects, WFP considers projects addressing  long-term crises, chronic poverty, or recurring national disasters to be well  suited for food-for-assets activities, according to WFP officials. If food-for- assets activities are to be part of the project, WFP also meets with  stakeholders at the village level to identify the assets that are most  needed in the community as well as limitations to constructing and  maintaining these assets. At the end of this process, WFP country offices  develop project proposals\u2014either a protracted relief and recovery  operation or an emergency operations project document\u2014outlining the  action that is required and also serving as a funding appeal. After WFP  releases an appeal, donors, including the United States, determine  whether they will provide funding, in-kind commodities, or other resources  for the project. According to WFP officials, once WFP has commitments  from the donors, it further refines the design of the project to reflect the  resources that the donors committed to provide and begins  implementation.", "WFP considers several factors in the design and implementation of food- for-assets activities for emergency projects. WFP officials cited the  importance of considering stakeholder and community input and the  availability and level of technical expertise, and reported factoring gender  considerations into the design and implementation of their food-for-assets  activities. In addition, WFP considers input from a variety of stakeholders  at the national, regional, and local levels to help it assess food security,  and appropriately plan and implement food-for-assets activities. Our  review of documents for 13 WFP emergency operations and protracted  relief and recovery operations projects with food-for-assets activities  found that documents for 10 of the projects noted partnerships with host  governments. Documents for 7 of the projects noted partnerships with  other implementing partners, such as the Food and Agriculture  Organization of the United Nations. During our fieldwork in Djibouti, we  visited a newly constructed water catchment where WFP worked with an  international development agency that provided technical expertise and  machinery and where WFP food-for-assets beneficiaries collected the  rocks that were used to build the dam (see fig. 7). In addition, WFP  beneficiaries later planted a garden close to the catchment to make use  of the collected water, with the Food and Agriculture Organization  providing seeds and WFP providing tools and food rations.", "In addition to considering stakeholder input, WFP considers the  availability and level of technical expertise and capacity when designing  and implementing food-for-assets activities. In 2014, WFP evaluators  found that assets might not be properly constructed or maintained if the  needed technical expertise and specialized equipment for the asset  exceeded the technical capacity of the community. According to WFP  officials, when neither the host government nor the community has the  technical expertise or resources to maintain high-technology assets, WFP  will either recommend against building the assets or recommend a focus  on low-technology assets.", "Further, WFP integrates gender considerations throughout the planning  process for food-for-assets activities, according to WFP officials.  According to WFP, this includes acknowledging the different roles,  community status, and hardships that men and women have experienced  and assessing the potential for exacerbating or addressing these  differences through food-for-assets activities. In WFP\u2019s evaluation of  projects from 2002 to 2011 in six countries, evaluators found that  strategic targeting of assets to women\u2019s needs, creation of gender- sensitive worksites, and consideration for women\u2019s competing demands  all affected women\u2019s participation in, and the benefits they derived from,  food-for-assets\u2019 activities. Our review of documents for 13 WFP  emergency operations projects from fiscal years 2013 and 2014 found  that 11 of these projects included targets for women\u2019s participation and  that 6 of the 11 projects had targets giving special consideration to  gender issues, such as targets for women in leadership roles."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "WFP-Identified Benefits of Food-for-Assets Activities as Well as Risks and Challenges in Designing and Implementing Its Activities", "paragraphs": ["WFP identified many benefits to its food-for-assets activities implemented  in emergency projects, including benefits similar to those observed by  development implementing partners.

WFP also reported challenges in  implementing food-for-assets activities, including challenges similar to  those facing development implementing partners, such as limited  technical capacity within communities. WFP found that its food-for-assets  activities had helped to develop infrastructure and that food-for-assets  activities had built useful assets with both short- and long-term benefits,  which in turn improved the beneficiaries\u2019 food security. In its 2014  synthesis of evaluations, WFP evaluators noted that its projects had  created assets that helped protect communities from floods and also  provided longer term benefits. For example, in Bangladesh, dikes that  provided protection from floods were built, and, building these dikes  increased the productivity of the land. In addition, WFP evaluators found  that in the medium term, assets built in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Nepal,  Senegal, and Uganda had increased land productivity and agricultural  production, which in turn enhanced communities\u2019 ability to generate  income. Additionally, WFP reported that food-for-assets activities had had  a long-term positive impact in creating cohesion among varying  populations in Bangladesh, Guatemala, Nepal, and Uganda, some of  which had experienced prolonged conflict.", "WFP reported in its operational documents and Impact Evaluation  Synthesis that a number of risks could affect projects containing food for  assets, such as a lack of adequate and timely funding, insecure and  unpredictable environments, and limited technical expertise. WFP  reported for all but 1 of the 13 projects we reviewed that reduced,  inadequate, and delayed funding was a key risk to designing and  implementing the projects\u2019 activities. For its projects in the Democratic  Republic of the Congo, Somalia, and Sudan, WFP noted that life-saving  emergency assistance would be prioritized over food for assets when  funding was insufficient. In addition, WFP officials in Djibouti told us that  in 2014 only 15 percent of planned food-for-assets activities were  completed because of a lack of funding.", "WFP also identified numerous challenges when implementing its food-for- work activities in emergency projects. Some of these challenges were  similar to those identified by implementing partners, such as finding  humanitarian workers with appropriate technical skills, maintaining assets  in the long term, and determining appropriate target populations. WFP  evaluators reported on the importance of community and government  technical capacity for the proper maintenance of assets, and WFP cited a  lack of institutional capacity among host country governments,  communities, and other institutions as a risk for 8 of the projects we  reviewed. Additionally, WFP evaluators found that limited technical  capacity can affect whether an asset functions as intended, because  assets are more likely to be maintained when communities and  governments have the capacity to appropriately maintain them than when  they lack the capacity.", "WFP evaluators noted that achieving long-term benefits for food-for- assets activities often requires ongoing operations and maintenance to  ensure that the asset remains functional and useful. WFP\u2019s 2014  synthesis of evaluations of food-for-assets activities in 2002 through 2011  reported that there was confusion about who would be responsible for   maintaining the assets and that plans for maintaining the assets were in  place for only a few of the activities.

We considered the research  design, scope, and methodology of these evaluations and determined  that they were reasonable for the purposes of these studies. For example,  we considered whether the high-level findings in the summary report  represented a fair summary of the individual studies and determined that  they did. For example, we found that key challenges and problems with  the programs were reported in the evaluation synthesis. We also found  that that the benefits in the studies were not overstated in the final  evaluation synthesis. However, we noted that a table on the functionality  of assets did not appear reliable on the basis of the individual evaluations,  and we therefore we did not report on that table.

As table 8 shows, WFP served 40 percent of  beneficiaries in fiscal year 2013 and almost 60 percent of beneficiaries in  fiscal year 2014 through general food distribution in these projects. WFP  served a smaller percentage of beneficiaries through conditional food aid  activities, primarily through school feeding projects, although food for  assets was the most frequently used conditional food aid activity. WFP  served more beneficiaries through school feeding in Afghanistan, the  Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Sudan than in any other countries  where it implemented this activity in fiscal year 2013, and in Pakistan, the  Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Sudan in fiscal year 2014. After  school feeding, WFP served the most beneficiaries through food-for- assets activities. WFP served more beneficiaries through food-for-assets  activities in Ethiopia, Kenya, and the Philippines in fiscal year 2013, and  in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Burkina Faso in fiscal year 2014, than in any  other countries where it implemented this activity. In addition, some  beneficiaries participated in multiple conditional and unconditional  activities and may be counted in more than one category. For this reason,  the sum of the percentages shown in table 8 is greater than 100."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the U.S. Agency for International Development", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO\u2019s Comments", "paragraphs": ["1.

USAID notes that data on conditional food aid activities currently  collected through implementing partners\u2019 narrative reporting, from  implementation plans, and for custom indicators allow for robust  oversight of individual projects. USAID also notes that its operational  policy states that \u201cmore information is not necessarily better because  it markedly increases the management burden and cost to collect and  analyze.\u201d It further notes that the manual compilation of conditional  activities across all food assistance programming does not equate to  a lack of monitoring, assessment or understanding of conditional food  transfers. USAID\u2019s Automated Directives System (ADS) 203.3.2.2 lists  efficiency as a key principle for effective performance monitoring and  does not prescribe a specific level of data collection.", "We have revised our draft to ensure that we do not state that the  agency has failed to adhere to its operational policy. However, our  observations and analysis do not support USAID\u2019s position that its  current data collection practices allow for robust oversight of  conditional food aid activities. In particular, we found a lack of  systematic data that could be used to oversee and learn about these  projects across Title II programs. First, although we were ultimately  able to determine that almost all of USAID\u2019s Title II projects  implemented conditional food aid activities, USAID could not readily  identify these projects or the types of activities they included and  could not provide data on the resources used for these activities. As a  result, USAID officials spent several months manually gathering and  revising the data we requested and did not provide finalized data until  8 weeks before our report\u2019s publication. Second, our initial analysis of  these data, when they became available, showed them to be  incomplete and flawed (for example, including projects that did not  have conditional food aid and excluding projects that did) and  therefore not useful for systematically monitoring conditional food aid  activities in Title II development projects. We were eventually able to  estimate these data for projects that included conditional food aid  activities. However, USAID was not able to provide us with any data  on the numbers of beneficiaries, funds, or commodities associated  with conditional food activities. Finally, in its letter, USAID concurs  with\u2014and indicates its intent to implement\u2014our recommendation to  establish a mechanism to readily identify all Title II development  projects that include conditional food aid activities and to collect  information about the types of conditional activity included. In addition,  USAID notes in its response to this recommendation that it already  systematically collects data on conditional activities in food assistance  projects funded through the Emergency Food Security Program,  suggesting that the agency considers this information important and  that taking these actions does not substantially increase management  burden or cost. By agreeing to systematically collect data on, and  assess the effectiveness of, conditional food aid activities in Title II  development projects, USAID acknowledges both the importance and  the feasibility of taking these actions to enhance its monitoring and  oversight of conditional food aid in its Title II programs. We have  added information to clarify USAID\u2019s position on project oversight,  such as information that is available in implementing partners\u2019  narrative reporting.  3. We agree that the $2.1 billion in Title II awards in fiscal years 2013  and 2014 funded both conditional and unconditional food aid  activities. However, we were not able to identify the amount of funding  that went toward conditional activities, because USAID lacks data that  would allow us to distinguish these activities from unconditional  activities. We agree that the number of beneficiaries served through  U.S.-funded Title II emergency projects, including food-for-assets  activities, represents a small percentage of these projects\u2019 total  beneficiaries. However, this percentage represents emergency  projects and does not reflect beneficiary numbers for development  projects. We were unable to report similar data on the beneficiaries  served through conditional food aid activities in Title II development  projects, because USAID did not provide these data. Therefore we  reported, as the closest reliable proxy, that 87 percent of USAID Title  II funding went toward projects that included conditional food aid  activities and that 111 of 119 USAID-funded Title II development and   emergency projects included these activities. 4. We acknowledge that general food distributions are often provided to those not able to work in communities and have modified our report accordingly. However, to make effective management decisions about food-for-assets activities, including targeting the appropriate beneficiaries, it is necessary to systematically track these activities\u2019 use and assess their effectiveness across Title II projects."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Comments from the World Food Program", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO\u2019s Comments", "paragraphs": ["1.

To encourage open and honest discussions, we offered to treat as  confidential the responses of USAID implementing partner  representatives for Title II development projects to our interview  questions, and our report therefore does not name these partners.
