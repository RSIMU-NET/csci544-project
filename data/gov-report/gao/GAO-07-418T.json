While federal and state governments continue to respond to this disaster, GAO has identified significant control weaknesses--specifically in the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)'s Individuals and Households Program (IHP) and in Department of Homeland Security (DHS)'s purchase card program--resulting in significant fraud, waste, and abuse. In response to the numerous recommendations GAO made, DHS and FEMA have reported on numerous actions taken to address our recommendations. Lessons learned from GAO's prior work can serve as a framework for an effective fraud prevention system for federal and state governments as they consider spending billions more on disaster recovery. These lessons are particularly important because funding that is lost to fraud, waste, and abuse reduces the amount of money that could be delivered to victims in need. Today's testimony will (1) describe key findings from past GAO work and (2) use the results from that work and GAO's other experiences to discuss the importance of an effective fraud, waste and abuse prevention program."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Prior GAO audit and investigative work on FEMA's controls over IHP payments and DHS's controls over purchase cards emphasizes one fundamental concept--that fraud prevention is the most effective and efficient means of minimizing fraud, waste, and abuse. GAO estimates that FEMA made about 16 percent or almost $1 billion dollars in improper and potentially fraudulent IHP payments to registrants who applied using invalid information, illustrating what can happen when fraud prevention controls are ineffective. For example, GAO found that FEMA made payments based on bogus damaged addresses, false identities, and identities belonging to federal and state prisoners. These findings highlight the need for effective controls over all types of recovery disbursements. With effective planning, relief agencies should not have to make a choice between speedy delivery of disaster recovery assistance and effective fraud prevention. Finally, GAO's findings of significant control weaknesses in DHS's purchase card program leading to fraud, waste, and abuse further underline the need for an effective framework for fraud prevention, monitoring, and detection. Our work on disaster assistance programs in particular show that preventive controls should be designed to include, at a minimum, a requirement that data used in decision making is validated against other government or third-party sources to determine accuracy. Inspections and physical validation should also be conducted whenever possible to confirm information prior to payment. System edit checks should also be used to identify problems before payments are made. Finally, providing training on fraud awareness is important in stopping fraud before it gets into any type of recovery program. Fraud detection and monitoring is also critical, although more costly and less effective than preventive controls. Key elements of detection include data mining for fraudulent information and performing reviews to establish the accountability of property and funds. The final element of a fraud prevention program is the collection of identified improper payments and the aggressive investigation and prosecution of individuals who commit fraud as a preventive measure for future disasters. These elements are most costly, and collecting money after it has been disbursed is far less effective than up front prevention--FEMA has collected only $7 million of the estimated $1 billion in potential improper and fraudulent IHP payments."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to discuss the fraud prevention lessons  learned as a result of the fraud, waste, and abuse that occurred as part of  the overall hurricanes Katrina and Rita recovery efforts. Making landfall in  August 2005, Hurricane Katrina was the costliest hurricane, and one of the  deadliest, in U.S. history. In May 2006, this committee reported that  Hurricane Katrina was responsible for over $150 billion in damages and  over 1,500 deaths, with thousands more reported missing. Hurricane  Katrina devastated much of the Gulf Coast; the storm surge caused major  or catastrophic damage along the coastlines of Alabama, Louisiana, and  Mississippi. About 80 percent of New Orleans was flooded when levees  protecting the city broke, and ultimately Hurricane Katrina affected 90,000  square miles. Hurricane Rita caused further devastation, making landfall  on the Gulf Coast in September 2005, causing an estimated $9.4 billion in  damages and killing seven people. These two hurricanes posed numerous,  unprecedented challenges for the federal government and state and local  governments in the Gulf Coast region. For example, the Federal  Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) received far more applications  for housing and \u201cother needs\u201d assistance, and awarded more grant money  in 2005\u20132006 for Hurricanes Katrina and Rita than for all of the hurricanes  that resulted in a disaster declaration in 2004 (Ivan, Charley, Frances, and  Jeanne) and 2003 (Isabel and Claudette) combined.", "The recovery effort in the Gulf Coast region in response to the two  hurricanes is unprecedented and will, over time, require an even more  substantial amount of funding. Testimonies we delivered on February 13,  June 14, and December 6, 2006, identified significant fraud, waste, and  abuse in just one of the programs FEMA uses to provide disaster recovery  assistance\u2014the Individuals and Households Program (IHP). As of October  2006, FEMA reported to Congress that it had delivered approximately   $7 billion in IHP aid for hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Areas we have  highlighted related to FEMA\u2019s IHP program included our estimate of $600  million to $1.4 billion of payments FEMA disbursed based on invalid  registrations made through February of 2006. These improper and  potentially fraudulent payments arose from breakdowns in preventive  controls that failed to identify bogus registrations made using information  such as invalid Social Security numbers and bogus damaged addresses.  Numerous other areas of internal control weaknesses resulted in  additional fraud, waste, and abuse. For example, we have identified  duplicate claims for hurricanes Katrina and Rita, payments to nonqualified  aliens, improper use of the government purchase cards, and missing or  stolen government computers, printers, and other items. Our testimony  before this committee on July 19, 2006, identified additional examples of  fraud, waste and abuse related to the use of Department of Homeland  Security (DHS) purchase cards for response and recovery efforts. Based  on these findings, we have made recommendations to FEMA and DHS to  develop effective systems and controls to minimize fraud, waste, and  abuse. In response to our recommendations FEMA and DHS have  identified numerous actions they have taken to address our  recommendations, and improve internal controls.", "Crucial internal controls and control weaknesses we identified during our  work on the IHP program, and requirements in the Comptroller General\u2019s  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government, are directly  relatable to controls over disaster recovery assistance efforts. Lessons  learned from our findings of fraud, waste, and abuse related to Katrina and  Rita can serve as a lesson for federal and state governments as they  consider spending substantial sums\u2014estimated to be billions of additional  dollars\u2014on Katrina and Rita recovery efforts and for future disaster  recovery spending beyond Katrina and Rita. Identifying and adopting these  lessons are crucial because disaster assistance and recovery funds that is  lost to fraud, waste, and abuse reduce the amount of money that could be  delivered to alleviate the pain, suffering, and needs of legitimate victims of  disasters. Further, fiscal challenges facing federal and state governments  only increase the need for pressure on agencies to best ensure that  available disaster relief funding is spent as efficiently and effectively as  possible. My testimony today will (1) summarize the key findings of fraud,  waste, and abuse from our past work related to hurricanes Katrina and  Rita recovery efforts and (2) use the results from that work and GAO\u2019s  other experiences to discuss the importance of an effective fraud, waste,  and abuse prevention program.", "To address our objectives, we reviewed prior findings from GAO audits of  hurricane Katrina and Rita relief efforts. We also reviewed applicable  guidance on internal control standards from the Comptroller General\u2019s  Standards for Internal Controls in the Federal Government. We  conducted our audit work in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards and conducted investigative work in  accordance with standards prescribed by the President\u2019s Council on  Integrity and Efficiency."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Prior Findings of Fraud, Waste, and Abuse", "paragraphs": ["Audit work we performed on FEMA\u2019s IHP payments and DHS\u2019s purchase  card program identified widespread fraud, waste, and abuse. Findings  from these audits and our related investigations show the result of  ineffective preventive controls. As shown by our IHP work, ineffective  preventive controls can result in hundreds of millions or potentially  billions of dollars in improper and fraudulent payments. In addition, our  work on DHS purchase cards showed that control weaknesses in  government purchasing programs can also result in fraud, waste, and  abuse.", "Between February and December 2006, we testified on three different  occasions that potentially improper and fraudulent activities related to the  IHP program are significant. Our February 2006 testimony focused on  control weaknesses that resulted in FEMA making thousands of Expedited  Assistance (EA) payments that were based on bogus registration data.  Specifically, we found that FEMA made millions of dollars in payments on  registrations containing Social Security numbers that had never been  issued or belonged to deceased individuals. In addition, we also found that  numerous registrations we selected for investigation contained bogus  damaged address. We also successfully submitted fictitious registrations  and received payments using bogus identities and addresses.", "Our second testimony in June 2006 discussed breakdowns in internal  controls, in particular the lack of controls designed to prevent bogus  registrations. These breakdowns resulted in an estimated 16 percent or $1  billion in payments made through February 2006 based on invalid  registrations. The statistical sample testing used to reach this estimate  found payments made on registrations that contained invalid identities,  bogus addresses, addresses which the registrant did not live in at the time  of the disaster, and duplicate registrations. Our data mining also found  that FEMA paid millions of dollars on over 1,000 registrations containing  the names and Social Security numbers of individuals incarcerated in  federal or state prisons during the hurricanes, and paid millions of dollars  in IHP payments to individuals who claimed a Post Office box as their  damaged physical address in order to receive assistance.", "In our December 2006 testimony we found additional instances of IHP  fraud, waste, and abuse, including duplicate housing assistance provided  to thousands of individuals living in FEMA-provided housing. Specifically  FEMA paid registrants rental assistance money while at the same time  providing rent-free housing in apartments and FEMA trailers. We also  found that FEMA provided about $20 million dollars in potentially  duplicate payments to individuals who registered and received assistance  twice using the same Social Security number and damaged address. These  individuals registered once for Hurricane Katrina and then again for  Hurricane Rita using the same Social Security number and damaged  address. FEMA also paid several million more dollars worth of IHP  payments to registrants who were ineligible nonqualified aliens. Based on  data we received from several universities in the area, we identified that  FEMA made IHP payments to more than 500 ineligible foreign students,  despite receiving, in some cases, evidence clearly showing that they were  not eligible for IHP benefits. The December 2006 testimony also pointed to  the small amount of money that FEMA had been able to collect from  improper payments as of November 2006. Specifically, in contrast to the $1  billion in potentially improper and/or fraudulent payments we estimated  through February 2006, FEMA had detected, as of November 2006, about  $290 million in improper payments, and had collected only $7 million.", "Our work on DHS purchase card controls found weak accountability over  FEMA computers, printers, Global Positioning System (GPS) units, and  other items bought for hurricane relief efforts using government purchase  cards. Thirty-four percent of items obtained with purchase cards that we  investigated could not be located and are thus presumed lost or stolen. As  of October 2006, more than 40 computers, 10 printers, 20 GPS units, and 2  flat-bottom boats are missing. In addition, 18 other flat-bottom boats  purchased by FEMA were in its possession, but FEMA did not own title to  any of them. Based on these findings, and the findings on the IHP program,  we have made recommendations to FEMA to develop effective systems  and controls to minimize the opportunity for fraud, waste, and abuse in  the future. FEMA has generally concurred with most of our  recommendations and has reported on actions to improve prevention of  fraud, waste, and abuse for the future."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Framework for Fraud Prevention, Detection, and Prosecution", "paragraphs": ["The results of our work serve to emphasize the overall lesson learned that  fraud prevention is the most effective and efficient means to minimize  fraud, waste, and abuse. It also demonstrates that the establishment of  effective fraud prevention controls over the registration and payment  process, fraud detection and monitoring adherence to those controls, and  the aggressive pursuit and prosecution of individuals committing fraud are  crucial elements of an effective fraud prevention program over any  assistance programs with defined eligibility criteria, including disaster  assistance programs.", "The very nature of the government\u2019s need to quickly provide assistance to  individuals adversely affected by disasters makes assistance payments  more vulnerable to applicants attempting to obtain benefits that they are  not entitled to receive. However, it is because of these known  vulnerabilities that federal and state governments need to have effective  controls in place to minimize the opportunities for individuals to defraud  the government. Figure 1 provides an overview of how preventive controls  help to screen out the majority of fraud, waste, and abuse, and how  detection controls and prosecution can help to further minimize the extent  to which a program is vulnerable to fraud."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Importance of Fraud, Waste, and Abuse Prevention to Katrina and Rita Recovery Efforts", "paragraphs": ["Preventive controls are a key element on an effective fraud prevention  program and are also described in the Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government. The most crucial element of effective fraud  prevention controls is a focus on substantially diminishing the opportunity  for fraudulent access into the system through front-end controls.  Preventive controls should be designed to include, at a minimum, a  requirement for data validation, system edit controls, and fraud awareness  training. Finally, prior to implementing any new preventive controls, and  well in advance of any disaster, agencies must adequately field test the  new controls to ensure that controls are operating as intended and that  legitimate victims are not denied benefits.", "Fraud prevention can be achieved by requiring that registrants provide  information in a uniform format, and validating these data against other  government or third-party sources to determine whether registrants  provided accurate information on their identity and place of residence.  Effective fraud prevention controls require that agencies enter into data- sharing arrangements with organizations to perform validation. In the  current environment, agencies have at their disposal a large number of  data sources that they can use to validate the identity and address of  registrants. However, our work related to FEMA\u2019s management of the IHP  program for hurricanes Katrina and Rita found that its limited\u2014or  sometimes nonexistent\u2014use of a third-party validation process left  disaster assistance programs vulnerable to substantial fraud. For example,  FEMA\u2019s failure to implement preventive controls to validate the identity of  individuals who applied using the telephone resulted in FEMA making  millions of dollars in payments to individuals who used Social Security  numbers that had never been issued or belonged to deceased individuals.  Another method of data validation is through physical inspection of the  disaster damage prior to payment. While physical inspections in a timely  manner may not be possible to prevent all fraudulent and improper  payments, our work found that FEMA continued to make payments  without a valid physical inspection of our undercover registration\u2019s bogus  addresses, months after the hurricanes had occurred.", "System edit checks designed to identify problem registrants and claims  (e.g., duplicates) before payments are made are also a crucial lesson  learned with respect to ensuring that obviously false or duplicate  information is not used to receive disaster relief payments. System edit  checks are most effective if performed before distribution of a payment.  Edit checks should include ensuring that (1) the same Social Security  number was not used on multiple registrations and (2) the registrant  provides a verifiable physical address on which the disaster damage is  based. In the case of FEMA\u2019s IHP program, ineffective edit checks resulted  in millions paid to registrants who claimed the same damages twice, once  for Hurricane Katrina and once for Hurricane Rita, and registrants who  submitted multiple registrations using the same name, Social Security  number, or address. Ineffective edit checks also resulted in payments  being made based on obviously false data, including payments of millions  of dollars to individuals who used a Post Office box as their damaged  physical address in order to receive assistance.", "Beyond validation and edits, lessons learned show that other controls,  including a well-trained work force that is aware of the potential for fraud,  can help prevent fraud. Fraud awareness training with frontline  personnel\u2014specifically on the potential for fraud within the program and  the likely types of fraud they could encounter\u2014is crucial to stopping fraud  before it gains access into the program. In addition, when implementing  any new controls, it is important to field test all systems prior to putting  them in place. On top of reducing the risk of untested controls allowing  substantial fraud, field testing also helps to ensure that new controls do  not improperly deny benefits to valid registrants. A safety net for those  registrants who are wrongly denied disaster relief due to preventive  controls should always be in place to ensure they receive assistance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Detection and Monitoring Help Assure that Funds Are Used for Disaster Recovery", "paragraphs": ["Even with effective preventive controls, there is substantial residual risk  that fraudulent and improper disaster relief payments can occur. Our work  has shown that agencies must continue their efforts to monitor fraud and  improper payment vulnerabilities in the execution of disaster relief  programs, even if these efforts are more costly and less effective than  preventive controls. Detection and monitoring efforts are addressed in the  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government and include  data-mining for fraudulent and suspicious transactions and reviews to  establish the accountability of funds. Also, control weaknesses identified  through detection and monitoring should be used to make improvements  to preventive controls to reduce the risk for fraud, waste, and abuse in the  future.", "The data-mining we performed to search for anomalies in registrant data  and purchase card transactions show how important constant monitoring  and detection can be. Through data-mining, we found rental assistance  payments to individuals who were residing in FEMA-provided hotel  rooms, trailers, and apartments and payments to ineligible, nonqualified  aliens. We found examples of multiple registrations citing the same  address or bank accounts, and numerous residents in a damaged  apartment building all relocating to the same location, which may also  suggest fraud. By comparing applicant data in FEMA\u2019s own databases, we  identified duplicate applications submitted for both Katrina and Rita, but  intended to cover the same damage to the same residence. By comparing  recipient data against federal and state prisoners\u2019 databases, we identified  instances where prisoners had fraudulently registered for and received  disaster relief payments while incarcerated. Our examples illustrate that  data-mining efforts should be done in a manner that uses creative  solutions to search for potential fraud using all available data sources. To  the extent that data-mining identifies systematic fraud, intelligence should  be fed back into the fraud prevention process so that for future disasters  the fraud is detected and prevented before money is disbursed.", "Depending on the type of assistance provided and the means in which the  assistance was distributed, it can be important for an agency to monitor  the use of disaster relief funds. Our review of FEMA\u2019s IHP program found  that while the vast majority of debit card transactions that were not  withdrawn as cash appeared to have been used for disaster-related needs,  we did find a number of purchases for nondisaster items such as football  tickets, alcohol, massage parlor services, and adult videos. In addition, our  review of items bought with DHS purchase cards found that many items  bought for use in disaster relief were lost or stolen. By monitoring these  types of uses, agencies may be able to ensure that disaster funds are used  to help mitigate losses and not used for inappropriate items or services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Collection Efforts, Investigations, and Prosecutions Are Far Less Effective than Up Front Fraud Prevention", "paragraphs": ["Another element of a fraud prevention program is the collection of  improper payments and the aggressive investigation and prosecution of  individuals who committed fraud against the government.

Our experience  is that investigations and prosecutions are a necessary part of an overall  fraud prevention and deterrence program, but should be a last resort when  all other controls have failed. For hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the Justice  Department has set up the Katrina Fraud Task Force, which has  successfully investigated and prosecuted numerous individuals who  received assistance fraudulently from FEMA.", "In December 2006, we testified to the difficulty of collecting on improper  payments after they have been disbursed. Specifically, in contrast to the $1  billion we estimated to be improper and potentially fraudulent payments\u2014 an estimate derived from statistical sampling\u2014FEMA determined that it  had overpaid nearly 60,000 registrants about $290 million as of November  2006. These overpayments, which FEMA refers to as recoupments,  represent the improper payments that FEMA reported it had detected and  for which it had issued collection letters. Although FEMA had identified  about $290 million in overpayments, as of late 2006, FEMA stated that it  had only collected nearly $7 million. The small amount of money that  FEMA had collected on overpayments related to hurricanes Katrina and  Rita further emphasizes the need for preventing fraud, waste, and abuse  prior to payments going out the door.", "Lessons learned from our prior work show that, while investigations and  prosecutions can be the most visible means to deal with individuals intent  on perpetrating fraud schemes, they are also the most costly and should  not be used in place of other more effective preventive controls. Still, by  successfully prosecuting such individuals, agencies can deter others who  are thinking of taking advantage of the inherent vulnerabilities in disaster  relief programs.

With potentially billions of  dollars of additional spending likely for Katrina and Rita recovery, state  and federal agencies should implement lessons learned with respect to the  importance of effective fraud, waste, and abuse prevention programs. With  effective planning, relief agencies should not have to make a choice  between speedy delivery of assistance and effective fraud prevention.
