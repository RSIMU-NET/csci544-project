A key factor that helps tribes use these self-governance mechanisms is tribal government capacity to administer a federal program or manage these resources. Federal efforts that have helped build this capacity have included training, such as that offered by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) in 2014 and 2015 to educate tribes on the benefits of developing tribal leasing regulations under the HEARTH Act. In contrast, GAO found that other factors can hinder tribes' use of these mechanisms including:", "Inadequate Information Sharing. The Department of the Interior's (Interior) policy and guidance states that tribes should be provided necessary information to design programs they would like to self-administer, such as the amount of funding available to the tribes for the programs and the amount retained by Interior for inherently federal functions. However, according to several tribal stakeholders and some BIA regional officials GAO spoke to, some of this information is not made available to the tribes prior to self-determination contract negotiations, such as information on funding calculations and determinations of inherently federal functions. Without this information, according to a tribal stakeholder, tribes may be at a disadvantage when negotiating with BIA and designing programs for self-determination contracts.", "Delays in Disbursing Funds. According to tribal stakeholders, Interior's process does not ensure that funds associated with their self-determination contracts and self-governance compacts are disbursed in a timely manner. These funding delays can therefore be a factor that hinders their use of self-government mechanisms. Some tribal stakeholders said that disbursement delays have ranged from weeks to months. GAO was unable to determine the extent to which Interior disburses funds in accordance with ISDEAA or within agreed-upon time frames with the tribes, because Interior does not systematically track and monitor the disbursement of these funds.", "Lengthy Review of Proposed Tribal Leasing Regulations. Interior does not have a clearly documented process for reviewing proposed tribal leasing regulations submitted under the HEARTH Act with identified time frames associated with each step of the process. As a result, tribal stakeholders told GAO that they are uncertain about how long the process will take and how it aligns with the 120 day requirement in the Act. According to tribal stakeholders and GAO's analysis of proposed regulations submitted from 2012 through 2017, Interior's review process has resulted in lengthy review times\u2014in some cases, multiple years. Some tribal officials told GAO that Interior's lengthy review process had delayed the tribe's ability to make decisions about the use of their resources. By developing a clearly documented process that includes established time frames for each step in the review, Interior can help eliminate uncertainty and improve the transparency of the review process for the tribes."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making four recommendations, including that Interior develop processes to share how it makes funding and inherently federal function determinations with tribes, to track and monitor the disbursement of funds within agreed upon time frames, and for the review of proposed tribal leasing regulations including review time frames.

For example, the Indian Self-Determination and  Education Assistance Act of 1975 (ISDEAA), as amended, authorizes  federally recognized tribes to assume the administration of a variety of  federal programs\u2014or portions thereof\u2014that were previously managed  by the Department of the Interior (Interior). Title I of ISDEAA allows tribes  to enter into agreements with Interior, referred to as self-determination  contracts, and transfers the administration of particular federal programs  from Interior to the tribe. In 1988, Congress amended ISDEAA to  authorize a tribal self-governance demonstration project, giving selected  federally recognized tribes the option of entering into self-governance  compacts. Following the demonstration project, in 1994, Congress  amended ISDEAA again, establishing self-governance compacts as a  permanent option for tribes. Title IV of ISDEAA, as amended, created  self-governance compacts as an option for tribes to negotiate broad  agreements with Interior that could cover multiple programs, allowing  tribes to assume the administration of all programs, functions, services,  activities, and competitive grants or portions thereof. Each federally  recognized tribe voluntarily decides whether, and to what extent, to  pursue the administration of federal programs. According to a recent law  journal article, by 2017, nearly all tribes had used a self-determination  contract or self-governance compact to take over the administration for  one or more federal programs, and nearly all tribes had decided to retain  the administration for one or more programs with Interior\u2019s Bureau of  Indian Affairs (BIA)\u2014the agency with primary responsibility to administer  federal Indian programs.", "Tribal self-government can provide numerous benefits to a tribe. For  instance, a 2004 report commissioned by the Department of Health and  Human Services found that the Citizen Potawatomi Nation experienced a  300 percent increase in revenues after taking over the management of  tribal funds from Interior. The Citizen Potawatomi Nation achieved higher  revenues by investing the funds in money market and other low-risk  instruments that pay higher interest than was earned when the funds  were managed by Interior.", "In addition to ISDEAA, the Helping Expedite and Advance Responsible  Tribal Home Ownership Act of 2012 (HEARTH Act) enables tribal self- government by authorizing federally recognized tribes to issue leases of  restricted Indian lands for residential, business, agriculture, wind, and  solar use without the approval of the Secretary of the Interior if such  leases are executed under tribal regulations that have been approved by  the Secretary. According to BIA, as of June 2018, there were leasing  regulations approved under the HEARTH Act from 42 tribes. According to  BIA, the potential tribal benefits of developing tribal leasing regulations for  approval under the HEARTH Act include more efficient and timely  execution of leases that can encourage investment and economic  development in tribal communities. At a December 2017 webinar one  tribal stakeholder provided an example of such a benefit, stating that  when the tribe took over the review and approval of business leases on  its lands from the federal government, the tribe reduced the review time  from 8 to 9 months to about 1 month, allowing it to more quickly pursue  economic development opportunities.", "According to Cohen\u2019s Handbook of Federal Indian Law, the history of  federal control over the administration of programs that serve tribes and  its management of tribal resources has limited growth for some tribal  economies. In our June 2015 report on energy development, for  example, we found that BIA had mismanaged Indian energy resources  and thereby limited opportunities for tribes and their members to use  those resources to create economic benefits and improve the well-being  of their communities. In February 2017, we added federal management  of programs that serve Indian tribes and their members to our biennial  update of high-risk areas, in part, because of long-standing problems with  Interior\u2019s management of these programs.", "You asked us to review issues related to tribal self-determination  contracts, self-governance compacts, and leasing authority under the  HEARTH Act.

We reviewed federal reports, congressional testimony, and  other articles that provided general background information, historical  perspectives, and examples of factors that can affect tribes\u2019 decisions to  use self-determination contracts, self-governance compacts, and  authority under the HEARTH Act. In addition, we reviewed federal data  that included, among other things, data on tribal participation and key  dates associated with BIA\u2019s review of tribal leasing regulations. To assess  the reliability of the federal data we obtained, we consulted with  knowledgeable officials who are responsible for the programs and  corroborated the data with various sources.

Tribal powers of self-government are recognized by the  Constitution, legislation, treaties, judicial decision, and administrative  practice. Tribal governments have many of the same responsibilities as  state and local governments. However, tribes are generally unable to  establish a strong tax base structured around the property taxes and  income taxes typically available to state and local governments,  according to a 2016 joint report from the Native Nations Institute and the  Harvard Project on American Indian Economic Development and a 2003  report from the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. For example, the  reports found that tribes are unable to levy property taxes on some of  their lands because of the legal status of the land. In addition, most tribes  have a limited land base. Tribes generally do not levy income taxes  because many tribal communities have disproportionately high levels of  unemployment and a lack of employment opportunities. To the degree  that they are able, some tribes use sales and excise taxes, but these do  not generally generate enough revenue to fully support tribal  governments. Therefore, some tribes rely on a combination of federal  funds and economic development initiatives as fundamental sources of  financial support for the government programs and services provided to  their communities.", "According to Cohen\u2019s Handbook of Federal Indian Law, \u201cfederal services  to Indians were never mere gratuities. Instead, they were provided in  exchange for cessions of land and rights, and to achieve distinctly federal  purposes.\u201d Generally, the programs that provide basic tribal services are  supported through tribal priority allocation (TPA) funds that Congress  appropriates.

In some cases, a BIA agency office may serve one  tribe, and in other cases, a BIA agency office may administer programs  on behalf of more than one tribe.

Residual functions are inherently federal  functions that only federal employees\u2019 may perform if all tribes were to  assume responsibilities for all programs that ISDEAA permits.

Moreover, Interior regulations call for  BIA to provide to tribes, for the negotiation of annual funding agreements  for self-governance compacts, a brief justification as to why specific  functions have been determined inherently federal.

A tribal stakeholder told us that without documentation  on funding calculations and methodologies, tribes are at a disadvantage  and have little basis to negotiate during these meetings. A tribal  stakeholder told us that, in practice, the negotiation generally consists of  BIA informing the tribe of the amount of funds to request in its proposal  and what federal functions BIA will retain without any documentation to  support its determination of inherently federal functions or the resources  to be made available to the tribe to administer a program using a self- determination contract.", "BIA\u2019s approach is not consistent with Interior\u2019s policy of sharing  information so tribes can develop programs.

To finalize  these documents, the report estimates that 600 hours of staff time were  spent scanning, uploading, and printing the documents.

The reasons  include the following:  Interior\u2019s financial data management system. Interior officials told us  that the agency\u2019s financial data management system is used for all of  Interior and is not equipped for the unique aspects of self- determination contracts and self-governance compacts\u2014making it  difficult to properly track and monitor key actions.", "Prior use of an inefficient process. An Interior official told us that prior  to fiscal year 2017, BIA used several spreadsheets to coordinate TPA  information for distributions. The official stated that these  spreadsheets were over 15 years old, and they made the process  inefficient and time-consuming. To distribute funds, officials would use  one spreadsheet to gather information and another to summarize the  amounts by functional area and region. The official stated that BIA  updated the process in fiscal year 2018 and does not expect it to  delay funding in the future.", "Staff shortages in key positions. BIA officials in several regions told us  they are experiencing staff shortages in key positions that are  responsible for the transfer of funds from BIA to tribal governments,  such as awarding officials. Interior officials said the Office of Self  Governance also needs additional awarding officials with only one  awarding official for self-governance compacts. Interior officials stated  that the challenges from staff shortages are compounded by  Congress\u2019 use of continuing resolutions that result in BIA repeating its  fund distribution process multiple times in a single year.", "Delays in receiving tribal signatures. Interior officials we interviewed  told us that they have experienced delays disbursing funds to a tribe  because they must wait for tribal officials to sign documents before  funds may be disbursed.", "When funds are not disbursed in a timely manner, a tribal stakeholder told  us that tribes may have to use funds from their general revenue accounts  to cover expenses for federal programs or seek other sources, such as  loans, to cover program expenses. According to several tribal  stakeholders, when a tribe has to use its own funds for the administration  of programs\u2014even temporarily\u2014it can adversely affect the tribe in  various ways, including lost opportunities to use tribal funds for improving  the tribes\u2019 economic conditions, reducing other services provided to tribal  communities, and furloughing tribal government employees. In addition,  several tribal stakeholders told us that the timeliness of disbursements for self-determination contracts is a factor they consider when deciding  whether to take over additional programs under a self-determination  contract. The tribal stakeholders said that the tribe must consider if it is  able to use tribal funds or willing to obtain a loan to fund a program when  the federal government is late disbursing funds. Without establishing a  process for tracking and monitoring the disbursement of funds associated  with self-determination contracts and self-governance compacts, Interior  will not have reasonable assurance it disburses funds in a systematic way  or in accordance with agreed upon time frames."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Interior\u2019s Process for Reviewing Proposed Tribal Leasing Regulations", "paragraphs": ["Interior has not clearly documented its process for reviewing proposed  tribal leasing regulations with timeframes associated with each step of the  process. The process can often be lengthy and time consuming;  according to tribal stakeholders, this can be a factor that hinders the  tribes\u2019 ability to make decisions about the use of tribal resources. Under  the HEARTH Act, tribes are to submit proposed leasing regulations for  Interior\u2019s review and approval before a tribe can approve leases for the  use of tribal lands, and Interior\u2019s review is to be completed within 120  days after the dates on which the tribal regulations are submitted to the  agency. Interior officials told us they interpret the statutory review time  frame requirements of the HEARTH Act as applying only to the agency\u2019s  review to ensure tribes incorporated all changes identified in prior  reviews. Specifically, Interior officials told us the agency does not  consider the statutory time frame to begin until it has received a final  version of the proposed tribal leasing regulations. These officials  described the final version of proposed tribal leasing regulations as  regulations that have already undergone review by BIA and Interior\u2019s  Solicitor\u2019s office, have been revised by the tribe, and have been  resubmitted for additional review by BIA and the Solicitor\u2019s office. This  process can be repeated multiple times before Interior considers the  tribe\u2019s proposed leasing regulations to be final.", "In contrast, a tribal stakeholder told us that Interior\u2019s interpretation of how  to measure the time frame is inconsistent with the tribe\u2019s interpretation of  the statutory time frame. The tribal stakeholder told us that a tribe  considers its leasing regulations initially submitted to Interior as final,  although the tribe understands that BIA and the Solicitor\u2019s office may  request revisions. Some tribal stakeholders told us that because Interior  is not considering the 120 days as a time frame from first submission until  approval, tribes do not know when to expect a final decision on draft tribal  regulations.", "We found that some of this confusion could be attributed to the fact that  Interior has not clearly documented its review process to include  established time frames associated with each step of the process. Under  federal standards for internal control, management should design control  activities, such as clearly documenting internal control in management  directives, administrative policies, or operating manuals. The HEARTH  Act seeks to expand tribal self-government and promote economic  development by shifting the authority for leasing from the Secretary to the  tribes. By developing a clearly documented review process that includes  established time frames for each step in the process for reviewing  proposed tribal leasing regulations submitted under the HEARTH Act,  Interior can better ensure that it is eliminating uncertainty and better  communicating the process for approval to the tribes.", "We also found that the approval process can be lengthy in some cases.  Our review of 42 tribal leasing regulations submitted to Interior for review  from 2012 through 2017 for which BIA provided us with data on the date  the tribe submitted the regulations to Interior and the date of Interior\u2019s  approval found that 4 of the 42 leasing regulations were approved within  120 days. For the other 38 proposed regulations, the time from when the  tribe submitted the regulations to Interior to when the agency approved  the regulations ranged from 134 days to 980 days. Half of the 42  proposed regulations were under review by Interior for a year or longer,  with 5 of the 21 under review for more than 2 years. Interior\u2019s review was  generally not continuous during the entire period; instead, these time  periods included review by BIA and the Solicitor\u2019s office and the time  spent by the tribe revising its leasing regulations in response to Interior\u2019s  review.", "Tribal stakeholders also shared with us several examples that illustrate  Interior\u2019s lengthy review process for tribal governments\u2019 use of the  HEARTH Act. For example, in one case, Interior received a tribe\u2019s leasing  regulations for review and approval in May 2015. Interior approved the  tribe\u2019s leasing regulations and published the decision in the Federal  Register in April 2018\u2014more than 2 years later. Officials representing this tribe told us they considered the leasing regulations initially submitted  on May 18, 2015, as final, though they understood that Interior could  request revisions. These officials explained that the tribe has its own  extensive process and procedures for lawmaking and developed its  leasing regulations consistent with its Constitution, Legislative Procedures  Act, and Administrative Rulemaking Procedure, which take into account  comments from tribal members and tribal agencies and includes a judicial  review, legislative analysis, fiscal impact review, and adoption by the  tribe\u2019s elected business committee.", "Tribal stakeholders told us that after each communication with BIA about  the leasing regulations, they believed the regulations were satisfactory for  approval. For example, the tribe received preliminary approval from BIA in  October 2016. Then, tribal stakeholders said in August 2017\u2014nearly 10  months later\u2014the tribe received correspondence from BIA stating that the  tribe needed to add several additional provisions, including language  regarding Indian irrigation projects and districts even though the tribe  does not have any irrigation projects or districts within its boundaries.  Additional correspondence took place between the tribe and Interior,  resulting in final approval in January 2018. Tribal stakeholders told us that  the lengthy review delayed the tribe\u2019s ability to implement leasing  regulations and delayed the tribe\u2019s ability to make decisions about the use  of tribal resources.", "In another case, Interior received tribal leasing regulations for review and  approval on January 17, 2014. The tribe stated in documentation  submitted to Interior that it was seeking increased decision-making  authority under the HEARTH Act because it had finalized various  construction agreements and needed to approve surface leases for an  economic development project. During the time that the tribe\u2019s leasing  regulations were under review at Interior, BIA asked the tribe to submit  multiple versions of its leasing regulations.", "According to BIA documents, the bureau took approximately 2 months to  transfer the tribe\u2019s regulations from BIA headquarters to a regional office  for its review. Once the regional office received the tribal leasing  regulations, the office conducted its review over a 3-month period and  provided comments to BIA\u2019s headquarters. BIA\u2019s data show that  headquarters sent the tribe\u2019s leasing regulations to the Solicitor\u2019s office  nearly 5 months after it received the tribal leasing regulations. Over the  next couple of years, Interior requested the tribe make changes to its  leasing regulations three more times and resubmit revised versions for  review.", "On March 3, 2016\u2014more than 2 years after receiving the tribe\u2019s leasing  regulations\u2014Interior documented that it had \u201cone small change\u201d it would  like the tribe to make to the regulations. The tribe made the requested  change and resubmitted the leasing regulations to Interior via certified  mail, which showed receipt at Interior on July 1, 2016. Interior approved  the tribal leasing regulations on October 7, 2016\u2014more than 3 months  after the tribe submitted regulations with the \u201csmall change.\u201d Interior  approved the tribe\u2019s leasing regulations and published the decision in the  Federal Register in October 2016\u2014more than 2 years after Interior first  received the tribe\u2019s leasing regulations.", "Interior officials told us there was not a single reason for the lengthy  review times. In some cases, Interior officials said the review times were  long because the BIA official responsible for managing Interior\u2019s review  had left the bureau. In other cases, Interior officials told us they were  short-staffed in the Office of the Solicitor and the legal review took longer  than anticipated. However, they acknowledged that the uncertainty  associated with how long Interior\u2019s review will take can make it difficult for  tribes to plan and execute economic development projects. For example,  a BIA official told us that a tribe was unable to pursue an economic  development opportunity because of the time it took for Interior to  complete the process to review the tribe\u2019s regulations.", "In contrast, a timely review of a tribe\u2019s proposed leasing regulations can  positively affect tribal control and decision making. For example, a tribal  stakeholder said after several months waiting for BIA to approve a  surface lease needed for a tribe to develop a wind farm, the tribe decided  to pursue authority under the HEARTH Act so that it could review and  approve the lease without waiting for BIA\u2019s review of the surface lease.  Interior reviewed and approved the tribe\u2019s leasing regulations submitted  under the HEARTH Act authority in 31 days. According to the tribal  stakeholder, the timely review and approval of the tribe\u2019s leasing  regulations allowed the tribe to review and approve the surface lease  needed for construction of the wind farm to commence before the  expiration of tax credits\u2014a key component that made the project feasible."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "BIA\u2019s Past Management of Federal Programs", "paragraphs": ["Past mismanagement of federal programs under the administration of BIA  is a factor that can affect tribes\u2019 decisions whether to take over federal programs through self-determination contracts, according to several tribal  stakeholders and BIA officials. As documented in a 2003 report by the  U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, decades of general mismanagement of  infrastructure and programs under BIA\u2019s administration can hinder a  tribes\u2019 use of self-determination contracts. In 1999, BIA reported to  Congress that funds provided under self-determination must be used not  only for current operations but also \u201cto repair 150 years of general  neglect\u201d of Indian programs. In these cases, taking over programs with  long-standing neglect is a liability that some tribes are not willing to  assume. For example, a tribal stakeholder told us that its BIA agency  office neglected tribal land records for many years. As a result, the tribe  is reluctant to assume the liability associated with administering a real  estate program without accurate property records.", "In another example, BIA operates an irrigation project that provides  electric utility service to two tribes. Both tribes have taken over certain  functions associated with the utility service provided to their communities  through self-determination contracts, and both tribes have expressed  interest in expanding the functions they administer. However, BIA and  tribal officials said that concerns over infrastructure that needs to be  repaired or replaced and the liability associated with rights-of-way have  deterred both tribes from taking over the remaining functions of the utility.  For example, many utility poles on the project\u2019s transmission lines are  more than 50 years old and are in need of replacement, and the project  has over 1,500 miles of transmission lines and 2,000 miles of distribution  lines. According to a BIA document, these lines might have been  extended without receiving a formal right-of-way. The report states that  \u201cmany of \u2019s rights-of-way are unperfected  and there are no supporting documents evidencing a legal right-of-way.\u201d  According to tribal stakeholders these kinds of uncertainties are  significant factors they must consider in their decisions related to self- governance of BIA programs."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Adequacy of Resources Affects Tribes\u2019 Use of Self- Determination Contracts and Self- Governance Compacts", "paragraphs": ["The adequacy of resources is a long-standing concern that has been a  factor affecting tribal participation in self-determination contracts and self- governance compacts, according to several tribal stakeholders and  federal officials we interviewed, government reports, our prior reports,  and articles we reviewed. Specifically, a lack of adequate resources has  been a long-standing concern that can limit the number of programs  tribes take over using self-determination contracts and self-governance  compacts. For example, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights 2003 report  noted that the authority tribes have to take over the administration of  federal programs is useful to the extent that adequate funds are made  available to the tribes to operate the program. According to Interior  officials, Interior does not have an estimate on the extent to which it can  provide adequate resources to tribes that want to administer federal  programs. For one program, BIA estimated in a report to Congress that  the dollars BIA expended in fiscal year 2013 for BIA and tribes to operate  detention and corrections centers fund about forty percent of the  estimated operating needs.", "Faced with funding shortfalls from the BIA budget to administer federal  programs under federal self-determination contracts or self-governance  compacts, many tribal stakeholders told us that they supplement federal  funding. Officials from one tribe told us that the tribe has supplemented all  the programs it has taken over from BIA. For example, the tribe reported  that the Land Titles and Records Program has a shortfall of about  $300,000 annually; the Law Enforcement program with about $564,000  annually; and the Probate Program with about $129,000 annually.  Officials from the tribe told us that tribes may rely on revenues generated  from economic development or tax revenue to supplement federal dollars  for programs they have taken over from the federal government.", "However, tribal stakeholders we interviewed told us that not all tribes are  in a position to supplement additional federal programs because of limited  economic development opportunities and tax revenue; therefore, those  tribes may not have the option to take over additional federal programs.  According to a tribal stakeholder, dual-taxation\u2014when both a tribe and  state tax the same non-tribal members and businesses on tribal land\u2014 can significantly limit a tribe\u2019s tax revenue because tribes must reduce or  eliminate their taxes to stay competitive and attract business and  enterprise to their lands. Furthermore, the funds tribes may use to  supplement federal programs are needed to fund other governmental  services and activities, which place tribal leaders in the position of  deciding whether to use funds to provide governmental services not  funded by the federal government or to increase self-governance by  administering additional federal programs. As we have previously  reported, when tribes supplement the federal program they take over, it  diverts funds away from other economic development opportunities and  other government functions and services they provide to their  communities and citizens.", "Lastly, several tribal stakeholders told us that not receiving adequate  resources from the federal government to administer federal programs  makes them reluctant to administer additional federal programs because  they believe BIA has a better chance than the tribe to obtain additional  resources that can be used to supplement program shortfalls. This is, in  part, because they believe that BIA agency offices and regional offices  have access to funding sources that are not available to tribes and  because BIA does not always make tribes aware of funds that are  available. For example, the Department of the Interior\u2019s Self-Governance  Advisory Committee reported in 2015 that the distribution of year-end  funds is entirely within the discretion of the local awarding official and that  not all tribes are notified that these funds are available."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Interior has taken steps to assist tribes pursuing tribal self-government by  providing training opportunities focused on self-governance compacts and  the use of the HEARTH Act to help increase tribal capacity.

First, BIA\u2019s approach for sharing key  information with tribes when tribes seek to administer a program using a  self-determination contract does not provide the tribes with the  information they need to understand how the self-determination contract  amounts were calculated. As a result, tribal leaders are at a disadvantage  in making sound decisions regarding the feasibility of taking over the  administration of federal programs.", "Second, BIA does not have a process that results in consistent  determinations of inherently federal functions and does not provide tribes  with information on its prior determinations. By developing a process that  results in consistent determinations of inherently federal functions, BIA  could have greater assurance that such determinations are being made  appropriately across the agency and BIA could increase the transparency  of the process by providing tribes with documentation on activities and  functions previously determined to be inherently federal and the basis for  the determinations.", "Third, Interior does not have an effective process for tracking and  monitoring the disbursement of funds associated with tribes\u2019 self- determination contracts and self-governance compacts or as agreed to  with the tribes.
