However, most stakeholders GAO spoke with said they had no communication with NCD about its campaign, and some said they were unaware of the best practices. Agency officials provided GAO with an original plan for conducting campaign activities through 2014, but most activities were not conducted. During the course of our review, NCD developed a corrective action plan for conducting future campaign activities. However, neither plan assigned responsibilities for conducting these activities nor does the agency have plans to evaluate them, which is inconsistent with federal internal control standards.

However, other stakeholders told us that the types of barriers that  individuals who are blind or visually impaired face have not changed.", "Inability to identify medications independently. Stakeholders told us  that individuals who are blind or visually impaired continue to face barriers  identifying medications independently. Without accessible labels,  individuals who are blind or visually impaired will need to rely on a  pharmacist or caregiver to help them identify medications. For example,  some stakeholders said that pharmacists may offer medication  counseling, such as allowing individuals who are blind or visually impaired  to feel the size, shape, and weight of their medication and answering  questions about dosage or side effects. Pharmacists may also place  rubber bands on some prescription drug containers or use differently  sized containers to help individuals who are blind or visually impaired  identify different medications by their containers. However, according to  some stakeholders, these alternative methods may not be reliable; for  example, a rubber band may be removed from a prescription drug  container or caregivers may not understand medication directions.  Further, stakeholders stated that if accessible labels are not securely  affixed to the prescription drug containers, then they can fall off and get  mixed up, which could increase individuals\u2019 risk for medication errors.", "Inability to identify pharmacies that can provide accessible labels.  Stakeholders told us that individuals who are blind or visually impaired  generally do not know which pharmacies can provide accessible labels.  Many stakeholders stated that the inability to identify pharmacies that can  provide these labels stems from limited or no efforts to advertise  accessible labels in pharmacies and no centralized database that  provides information on pharmacies that can provide these labels. While  officials from the four selected PBMs reported taking steps to inform  individuals who are blind or visually impaired about the accessible labels  that their mail order pharmacies can provide\u2014such as two PBMs  reporting training customer service representatives to ask specific  questions to identify individuals who could benefit from prescriptions with  accessible labels and help them identify the accessible label that would  best fit their needs\u2014other selected stakeholders that operate pharmacies  told us that they do not advertise the accessible labels their pharmacies  can provide. Specifically, officials from 2 of our 9 selected chain  pharmacy companies and 4 of 18 individual retail pharmacy locations that  submitted questionnaire responses reported to us that they generally do  not advertise the accessible labels their pharmacy can provide, or that  customers need to ask pharmacists about these labels in order to have  them included on the prescription containers. Officials from an advocacy  group also reported that individuals who are blind or visually impaired  continue to be unable to identify pharmacies that can provide accessible  labels because there is no centralized database that provides information  on which pharmacies can provide such labels. Officials from the two  technology vendors told us that they compiled information on retail  pharmacies that can provide accessible labels sold by their companies;  however, their databases are limited to locations that can provide their  specific products and do not include retail pharmacy locations that can  provide accessible labels made by other technology vendors.", "Inability to obtain prescriptions with accessible labels on the same  day as requested. Stakeholders told us that individuals who are blind or  visually impaired may be unable to obtain prescriptions with accessible  labels on the same day as requested. For example, officials from two  chain pharmacy companies stated that individuals who are blind or  visually impaired can work with retail pharmacy staff to order prescriptions  with accessible labels through mail order pharmacies and have these  accessible prescriptions sent directly to these individuals at a later date.  Further, officials from these chain pharmacy companies reported that it  may take up to 72 hours from the time an individual requests a  prescription with an accessible label to the time the individual receives  that prescription. Officials from one advocacy group raised concerns that  this delay in obtaining prescriptions through the mail order pharmacy is  unreasonable for certain time-sensitive prescriptions that must be  dispensed immediately, such as antibiotics to treat an infection."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Stakeholders Identified Pharmacy Challenges and Steps for Providing Accessible Labels or Implementing the U.S. Access Board\u2019s Best Practices", "paragraphs": ["Stakeholders most often identified four key challenges that pharmacies  had in providing accessible labels or implementing the best practices and  identified steps that could address some of these challenges.", "Lack of awareness of the best practices. Stakeholders identified lack  of awareness of the best practices by pharmacies and others as a key  challenge:", "Pharmacies (including pharmacists and pharmacy staff). Federal  agencies, advocacy groups, technology vendors, and an accreditation  organization told us that pharmacies were not aware of the best  practices. Further, officials from 7 of 18 individual retail pharmacy  locations stated that they first learned about the best practices when  we contacted them. Additionally, some stakeholders told us that  individuals who are blind or visually impaired are generally unaware of  the best practices and, as a result, may not request accessible labels  at their pharmacies.", "Other stakeholders. Other stakeholders that could affect  pharmacies\u2019 labeling practices or provide medical services to  individuals who are blind or visually impaired were unaware of the  best practices. For example, the four states and an industry group  representing physicians told us that they were unaware of the best  practices prior to our contact with them. After our outreach, one state  published an article about the best practices in its newsletter and  discussed these practices with pharmacists, pharmacy staff, and the  public at two public meetings in May and July 2016.", "Of those stakeholders who identified this challenge, many stated that  greater dissemination of information on the best practices could increase  awareness of the best practices. Additionally, NCD officials told us that  they would continue to disseminate information on the best practices as  long as stakeholders remained unaware of them.", "Low demand and high costs for providing accessible labels. Another  challenge that stakeholders identified is that pharmacies had low demand  and incurred high costs to provide accessible labels. Officials from five  chain pharmacy companies and four individual retail pharmacy locations  told us that they have had relatively few or no customer requests for  accessible labels. Some stakeholders reported that the demand for  these labels does not justify the costs to provide accessible labels. These  costs include staff costs\u2014such as training or the time needed to produce  these labels\u2014as well as the costs associated with the technology  required to produce the labels\u2014such as purchasing software, printers, or  labels. Two stakeholders told us that the initial costs to purchase this  technology may range from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars for  each individual retail pharmacy location. Further, these pharmacy  locations may incur ongoing costs, such as annual fees of up to a few  hundred dollars to cover technical assistance and other services or fees of up to a few dollars to purchase additional accessible labels.  Additionally, many stakeholders stated that it may be costly for larger  chain pharmacy companies to implement technology and train staff in  many locations, while smaller independent pharmacies may have  difficulty absorbing the costs of purchasing the new technology they need  to produce accessible labels.", "Of those stakeholders who identified this challenge, some stated that  financial support for pharmacies, such as third-party reimbursement,  could address high costs that pharmacies incur to provide accessible  labels that meet the best practices. These stakeholders stated that there  is currently no direct financial support for providing these labels and these  labels are provided free of charge to customers. Officials from four chain  pharmacy companies told us that pharmacies may be willing to provide  accessible labels that meet the best practices if third parties, such as  health plans, were willing to reimburse or share in the costs of producing  these labels. Additionally, officials from one industry group representing  pharmacists stated that pharmacies may be more willing to provide  accessible labels that meet the best practices if grant money were  available to cover costs for producing these labels.", "Technical challenges for providing accessible labels. Stakeholders  identified some technical challenges for providing accessible labels that  meet the best practices. For example, officials from one state and four  chain pharmacy companies told us that pharmacies face challenges fitting  all the required prescription label information in large print formats on  small prescription drug containers. Officials from one technology vendor  stated that printing the large print labels in a booklet form, which can then  be affixed to the prescription drug container, could address this challenge.  Additionally, officials from a chain pharmacy company, a state regulating  body, and a federal agency told us that pharmacists typically cannot  independently verify information on braille labels to ensure their  accuracy. Specifically, three stakeholders expressed concern that  pharmacists who cannot read braille cannot determine if the braille  translation is accurate and therefore must rely on the accuracy of the  braille technology to translate prescription label information to braille.", "Absence of requirements to implement the best practices.  Stakeholders told us that some pharmacies are not implementing the best  practices, given an absence of requirements to do so by applicable  corporate policies, contracts, state regulations, or accreditation standards.", "Corporate pharmacy policies. Officials from all four PBMs and four  of the nine chain pharmacy companies told us that they incorporated  some, but not all, of the best practices into their corporate policies that  pharmacies must follow. However, officials from three chain pharmacy  companies told us that their corporate policies do not include any of  the best practices and their retail pharmacies cannot offer any  services for individuals who are blind or visually impaired other than  what has been approved at the corporate level.", "Contracts with retail pharmacies. Officials from all four PBMs and  all three PSAOs told us that their contracts with retail pharmacies in  their networks do not require pharmacies to implement the best  practices.", "Pharmacy accreditation standards. Officials from two accreditation  organizations told us that their pharmacy standards do not incorporate  the best practices.

For example, officials from three chain pharmacy  companies, one advocacy group, one industry group, and one technology  vendor told us that pharmacies could implement the best practices if  corporate pharmacy policies included them. Further, officials from two  individual retail pharmacy locations stated that they require corporate  approval to implement any technologies to produce accessible labels that  meet the best practices.

For example, prior to  the publication of the U.S. Access Board working group\u2019s report, NCD  sent emails to members of the working group to solicit ideas on how the  agency could coordinate with working group members to disseminate  information on the best practices once they were published. From July  2013 through February 2016, NCD issued an agency statement and two  press releases through its website, listserv, and online social media about  the best practices and pharmacies\u2019 agreements with advocacy groups to  provide accessible labels; hosted a conference call with three advocacy  groups to discuss how they could conduct outreach as part of NCD\u2019s  campaign; and published a blog post on accessible labels. However, the  agency did not conduct any campaign activities in 2015. From June  through August 2016, NCD developed a brochure on some of the best  practices, disseminated the brochure through its website, and coordinated  with the U.S. Access Board, one industry group representing  pharmacists, and one chain pharmacy company to disseminate this  brochure. See table 8 for a timeline of NCD\u2019s campaign activities.", "Most of the selected stakeholders we spoke with\u2014including PBMs, chain  pharmacy companies, states, and advocacy groups\u2014have not had any  communication with NCD about its campaign, and, as previously  discussed, some were unaware of the best practices. When we first  interviewed NCD officials in February 2016, they could not provide us with  a fully developed and documented plan for conducting and evaluating the  agency\u2019s campaign nor did they do so in subsequent follow-up we had  with them through August 2016. However, in September 2016 during a  meeting to review NCD\u2019s campaign activities, officials told us they had  developed a plan in December 2013 for conducting campaign activities  that were to occur throughout 2014. These activities consisted of  developing a virtual toolkit for stakeholders to use for planning their own  outreach, according to documentation NCD provided. However, we  determined that NDC did not conduct most of these activities.  Subsequent to our September 2016 meeting, officials provided us with a  corrective action plan with timeframes for conducting future campaign  activities through fiscal year 2017, including some of the activities that  NCD did not conduct in 2014. The development of this corrective action  plan is a positive step to conduct campaign activities. However, neither  the original plan nor the corrective action plan assigned responsibilities  for campaign activities. This is inconsistent with federal internal control  standards, which indicate that an agency should assign responsibilities to  achieve its objectives. Given that most of the activities NDC originally  planned for 2014 never occurred, this lack of specificity regarding  responsibilities is concerning because it does not provide assurance that  the agency will conduct future campaign activities as planned. Further,  officials could not provide us any plans for how they will evaluate the  agency\u2019s campaign activities. NCD officials stated that the agency has not  evaluated nor has any plans to evaluate its campaign activities, other  than tracking the number of likes or retweets on its social media posts.  Federal internal control standards indicate that an agency should design  and execute a plan to evaluate its activities, document evaluation results,  and identify corrective actions to address identified deficiencies.

NCD, the agency charged with conducting a campaign to  inform and educate stakeholders of these practices, has not had an  effective plan to conduct its campaign and, consequently, conducted  limited activities from July 2013 through August 2016. For example, the  agency did not conduct most of its planned campaign activities in 2014  and conducted no activities in 2015.
