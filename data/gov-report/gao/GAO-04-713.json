Four key tests are used to detect the cancer--fecal occult blood test (FOBT), flexible sigmoidoscopy, double-contrast barium enema (DCBE), and colonoscopy. Private health insurance plans generally cover these tests to diagnose cancer; however, the extent to which plans cover the tests for screening purposes--where no symptoms are evident--is less clear. Congress is considering legislation that would require coverage of the tests for screening purposes among all private health insurance plans. GAO was asked to (1) identify the state laws that require private health insurance coverage of these screening tests; and (2) determine the extent to which the tests are covered among small employer, individual, large employer, and federal employee health plans. GAO summarized state laws that require coverage of the tests. GAO examined test coverage among a sample of the largest 19 small employer and 14 individual plans in 10 states without laws requiring the coverage, and among 35 large employer plans nationally. The findings cannot be generalized beyond these plans. GAO also reviewed brochures for 143 federal employee health plans."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Twenty states had laws in place as of May 2004 requiring private insurance coverage of colorectal cancer tests for screening purposes. In 19 of these states, the laws generally applied to insurance sold to small employers and individuals, and required coverage of all four tests--FOBT, flexible sigmoidoscopy, DCBE, and colonoscopy. The law in 1 of the states was more limited in scope, applying to group and managed care plans and not explicitly requiring coverage of each of the four screening tests according to American Cancer Society (ACS) guidelines. Most, but not all, health plans offered by the insurers and employers GAO reviewed covered all four colorectal cancer tests for screening purposes. Over four-fifths of the small employer plans (16 of 19) covered all of the tests, whereas 1 plan covered only FOBT and flexible sigmoidoscopy and 2 plans covered only FOBT. Almost three-quarters of the individual plans (10 of 14), covered all of the tests, and the remaining 4 plans covered none of the tests. Approximately two-thirds of the large employer plans (24 of 35) covered all four of the tests. Among the remaining 11 plans, 5 covered only FOBT, 2 covered only flexible sigmoidoscopy, and 4 covered none of the tests. Over half of the plans offered to federal employees covered each of the four tests. Finally, among all plans that covered at least one but fewer than four tests, DCBE and colonoscopy were least likely to be covered. In commenting on a draft of this report, ACS suggested that the report overstated the extent of coverage and did not sufficiently highlight the methodological limitations of the study. In contrast, America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) commented that the report overstated the lack of coverage. Moreover, AHIP commented that the report did not address the low rate at which Americans actually receive colorectal cancer screening tests regardless of insurance coverage, suggesting that factors other than health insurance coverage are responsible for low screening rates. Recognizing that the findings are subject to varying interpretations, GAO attempted to report them neutrally. Although the draft report disclosed the methodological limitations of the study, in response to ACS comments, GAO more prominently highlighted certain of the limitations. Finally, whereas the draft report noted the screening utilization rates, assessing the factors responsible for them was beyond the scope of this study."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. Over 146,000 new cases of colorectal cancer will be  diagnosed and almost 57,000 people will die from the disease in 2004,  according to the American Cancer Society (ACS). The mortality associated  with colorectal cancer can be reduced through early diagnosis and  treatment. Four key tests\u2014fecal occult blood test (FOBT), flexible sigmoidoscopy, double-contrast barium enema (DCBE), and  colonoscopy\u2014are commonly used to detect colorectal cancer or its  symptoms. ACS recommends that individuals at high risk for developing  the disease and all individuals who reach age 50 receive one or more of these tests on a regular basis for screening purposes, regardless of whether they exhibit symptoms of the disease. Private health insurance  plans generally cover these four tests to diagnose suspected cases of  cancer when symptoms are present; however, the extent to which plans  cover the tests for screening purposes is less clear.", "Private health insurance plans are offered through different market segments\u2014such as the small employer, individual, or large employer  segments, or the health plans offered to federal employees. Some  previous surveys of the extent of colorectal cancer screening coverage  among private health insurance plans have been limited to only certain  health plans or market segments. Moreover, laws that may require  coverage of the screening tests among health plans sold by insurers vary  from state to state. Congress is considering legislation that would require  coverage of colorectal cancer screening tests among all private health  insurance plans. At your request we have examined the extent to which  private health insurance plans cover colorectal cancer screening tests.  Specifically, we determined  1. \t the extent to which state laws require private health insurance plans to  cover the four colorectal cancer tests for screening purposes; and  2. \t the extent to which private health insurance plans cover the four  colorectal cancer tests for screening purposes, specifically health  plans sold by insurers to small employers and individuals in states that do not offered by large employers across the United States, and offered through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program  (FEHBP).", "To identify states that had laws that require private health insurance plans  to cover colorectal cancer screening tests, we reviewed the laws in each  state and the District of Columbia as of May 2004, and consulted with state  officials to clarify the laws as necessary. To examine the extent to which  health insurance plans sold to small employers and individuals by insurers  in the states without laws requiring coverage of the tests actually covered  the tests, we contacted the largest health insurers in 10 states without  such laws. From these insurers we obtained information from plan  representatives about their coverage policies for their health plan with the  most members. We received responses to our questions from 95 percent  (18 of 19) of the small employer insurers we contacted and 82 percent (14  of 17) of the individual insurers we contacted. To examine the extent to  which health plans offered by large employers covered the tests for  screening purposes, we randomly selected 50 large employers from  Fortune 500 companies throughout the United States and received  responses from 71 percent (35 of 49) of the employers we contacted. We  relied on self-reported information from officials of the health plans  reviewed and did not independently verify their responses. Further,  although we achieved relatively high response rates, we may nonetheless  have encountered selection bias. That is, insurers and large employers  with more colorectal cancer screening benefits could have been more  likely to participate in our survey than those with fewer colorectal cancer  screening test benefits. In addition, we surveyed a small number of health  plans, precluding our ability to generalize the findings beyond these plans.  Finally, to examine the extent to which health plans offered through  FEHBP covered the four tests for screening purposes, we reviewed  coverage brochures for 143 plans maintained on the Office of Personnel  Management\u2019s (OPM) Web site.We identified the extent to which each  brochure explicitly indicated coverage of each of the four tests for  screening purposes. In addition, we clarified our understanding of the  brochures with OPM staff and confirmed our interpretations of selected  brochures with plan representatives.", "We conducted our work from October 2003 through June 2004 according  to generally accepted government auditing standards. Appendix I provides  additional details about our scope and methodology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Surviving colorectal cancer is greatly enhanced when the disease is  detected and treated early; however, only 38 percent of colorectal cancer  cases are diagnosed at an early stage, according to ACS. To facilitate  early diagnosis, ACS recommends regular colorectal cancer screening for  certain individuals using at least one of four key tests: FOBT, flexible  sigmoidoscopy, DCBE, and colonoscopy. These tests are used to find  potential signs of colorectal cancer, including polyps\u2014abnormal growths  in a person\u2019s colon\u2014or blood in a person\u2019s stool. FOBT is a laboratory test  used to detect blood (that is otherwise not visible) in stool samples that  are collected by patients at home. Using a flexible sigmoidoscopy, a  physician can find and take samples of polyps in a patient\u2019s lower colon  and rectum. DCBE detects polyps by providing x-ray images of a patient\u2019s  entire rectum and colon. Finally, a colonoscopy allows a physician to find  and take samples of polyps in a patient\u2019s rectum and entire colon as well  as remove most polyps found during the test.", "ACS, medical providers, and others have developed medical guidelines  that outline the frequency at which colorectal cancer screening tests  should be administered depending on an individual\u2019s age and risk for  developing the disease. For example, ACS guidelines recommend that,  beginning at age 50, all average-risk individuals be screened annually using  an FOBT; every 5 years using a flexible sigmoidoscopy or DCBE; or every  10 years using a colonoscopy. ACS guidelines also state that a combination  of both FOBT and flexible sigmoidoscopy at the intervals indicated is the  preferred screening method over either test alone, and that individuals at  high or increased risk for developing the disease should be screened more  frequently. Furthermore, ACS believes that patients and providers should  jointly choose the appropriate tests and testing strategy based on patient  risk factors and the varying accuracy, cost, and discomfort of the tests,  among other factors. ACS\u2019s colorectal cancer screening guidelines are also  similar to those endorsed by the American Gastroenterological  Association and the American Medical Association. The Medicare program  covers all four screening tests following guidelines similar to those  developed by ACS. The United States Preventive Services Task Force  (USPSTF) also strongly recommends that clinicians screen men and  women 50 years of age or older for colorectal cancer. However, it specifies  the frequency with which tests should be administered only for FOBT, for  which annual testing is suggested. Similar to ACS, USPSTF recommends  that the choice of tests and testing strategy be based on a variety of factors  including patient preferences and medical contraindications.", "Fewer than half of individuals age 50 and over surveyed in a 2002 national  study reported receiving a colorectal cancer test for screening or  diagnostic purposes. FOBT was used by approximately 45 percent of  respondents age 50 and over, with less than half of these respondents  having had their last test within the past year. The survey also found that a  sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy test was used by just under 50 percent of  respondents age 50 and over at some point in their lives. Reasons that  individuals do not obtain a colorectal cancer screening test may include a  lack of patient education, a general reluctance to be tested, or a  physician\u2019s lack of time to discuss or educate patients about screening.", "Private health insurance is offered in two primary markets\u2014the group and  individual markets. The group market includes health plans offered by  employers to employees. An employer may provide coverage for its  employees either by purchasing the coverage from a health insurer (fully  insured coverage) or by funding its own health plan (self-funded  coverage). Within the group market, small employers typically purchase  coverage from insurers, while larger employers are more likely to self-fund  their coverage. Although the federal government is a large employer\u2014  with over 2.7 million employees in 2002\u2014it provides health coverage for  its employees through health insurance carriers that participate in  FEHBP. About 161 million individuals received health coverage from the  group market in 2002. The individual market includes health plans sold  by insurers to individuals who do not receive coverage through an  employer. About 16.8 million Americans received health coverage from the  individual market in 2002.", "Private health plans are subject to various state and federal requirements,  depending upon the market segments in which they are offered and the  manner in which the plans are funded. The fully insured health coverage  offered by small employers is subject to state insurance requirements,  which can include mandated coverage for preventive health services and  other benefits. Individual market coverage purchased by individuals from  insurers is also subject to state insurance requirements. The self-funded  coverage typically offered by larger employers is generally not subject to  state insurance regulation, but only to federal requirements, none of which  are related to preventive health services.", "OPM is responsible for regulating, and contracting with, private health  insurers to offer health benefit plans to federal employees, pursuant to the  Federal Employees Health Benefits Act. While private health insurers are  generally subject to the applicable laws in their respective states, by  federal law, the terms of any FEHBP contract negotiated by OPM, which  relate to coverage or benefits, preempt any inconsistent state or local law  or regulation.

In particular, ACS stated that we used small  samples, did not conduct an analysis of nonrespondents, surveyed only the  health plans with the most members where insurers or employers offered  more than one plan, and did not independently verify the responses of the  insurers and employers we contacted. We agree that our study methods  are subject to limitations, which we disclosed in our draft report. We  reviewed samples of health plans that would provide credible evidence of  coverage levels in each market segment, recognizing that the results would  not be generalizable to all health plans. While we believe our relatively  high response rates of between 71 and 95 percent diminished the need for  a detailed analysis of nonrespondents, we acknowledged the possibility of  selection bias in the draft report. Similarly, although we did not examine  every plan offered by each insurer and employer, we focused on those  plans that covered the greatest number of enrollees to best illustrate the  coverage most widely available to consumers. In terms of verifying survey  responses, we did not have ready access to the documents that could have  provided verification of employer and insurer responses to our questions.  Insurer underwriting manuals may provide such verification, but are  considered proprietary by insurers and not shared externally. Documents  readily available to us, such as plan brochures, do not indicate coverage of  every medical test or procedure under every possible circumstance, and  thus could not be used to verify insurer or employer responses to our  questions. Our draft report noted that we did not independently verify  reported responses. In response to ACS\u2019s comments that we did not  sufficiently address our study limitations, we modified the final report to  more prominently highlight certain limitations of our methodology.", "ACS further commented that we did not highlight the differences between  the higher coverage rates we found based on the self-reported data  provided by employers and insurers and the lower coverage rates we  found based on our review of FEHBP brochures, suggesting that the  differences indicate the potential for self-reported data to overstate plan  coverage. As the draft report noted, we found that FEHBP brochures did  not specify every medical test or procedure covered under every  circumstance and thus the brochures may understate coverage actually  available. This fact was confirmed by several plan and OPM officials and is  consistent with our own previous reviews of health plan brochures.  Among the 17 national plans, for which we were able to follow up with  plan officials in each instance where the brochure language was not  exhaustive, most covered tests not mentioned in their brochures.  Moreover, through our follow-up with eight local plans we determined that  each plan covered at least one test in addition to those listed in their  brochures.", "ACS also commented that we did not assess the quality of prior studies of  colorectal cancer screening coverage rates and consider the study results  in our report.
