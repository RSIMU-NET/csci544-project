These funds provided a variety of services and support to children and their families to meet a range of goals, from increasing low-income families\u2019 access to affordable child care to ensuring that children\u2019s educational, health, and social needs are met. Given the large federal investment and the current attention on the importance of early childhood experiences, policymakers are interested in the effectiveness of federally funded early childhood education and care efforts and the types of research designs available for determining whether these programs are meeting their objectives for children.", "Because of your particular interest in the use of impact evaluations as a way of determining program effectiveness, our objectives were to (1) describe the value of conducting impact evaluations, (2) describe their current use in evaluating selected early childhood education and care programs, and (3) discuss the value of other types of early childhood education and care studies the Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Education currently promote and sponsor.", "To understand the use of impact evaluations, we reviewed current government-sponsored studies (both agency-initiated and congressionally mandated) of 11 programs that fund early childhood education and care and report serving 25,000 or more children younger than age 5. Thus, we examined current evaluations and evaluation proposals for two programs focused on early childhood education\u2014Head Start and Even Start\u2014and for the following nine programs: Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Twenty-First Century Community Learning Centers, three special education programs (State, Preschool, and Infant and Toddler Grants), Social Services Block Grant (SSBG), Migrant Education, and Title I. These nine programs provide early childhood education and care though, for most, it is not a primary activity. We conducted our work between October 2000 and March 2001 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The use of impact evaluations to assess the effect of a program or other intervention is an accepted practice in areas as diverse as medicine, economics, and social services. Some frequently cited examples of impact evaluations involve experiments designed to test the efficacy of drugs by randomly assigning participants to a group that will either receive or not receive the experimental drug. Impact evaluations are also used in other areas to assess program effectiveness. One such study is currently under way for the Job Corps. In addition, several state-level impact evaluations are being used to study welfare-to-work programs. The Congress has mandated studies to ensure that agencies conduct the kinds of evaluations it deems necessary. In both authorizing and reauthorizing legislation, the Congress has required evaluations of a program or demonstration program.", "Impact evaluations have been used to evaluate and develop programs in the early childhood education and care arena. For example, HHS sponsored an impact evaluation of a demonstration project called the Comprehensive Child Development program to test the effectiveness of the program for low-income families and their young children. HHS incorporated many of the lessons learned from this study in the Early Head Start program.", "The 11 federal programs that serve 25,000 or more young children in some capacity are administered by either Education or HHS (table 1). The programs differ in a number of ways, including their goals and the portion of funds they devote to young children. For example, Head Start\u2019s goal is school readiness and most of its budget is spent on children younger than age 5. All Head Start grantees provide services that are designed to enhance school readiness. In contrast, SSBG, which devotes only 11 percent of its funds for early childhood education and care, is a flexible source of funds that allows states wide discretion to fund a variety of social services, one of which can be child care. Its goal is primarily to help families achieve self-sufficiency. The other programs we reviewed fund early childhood education and care in various ways but often have primary goals that are only indirectly related to children or school readiness.", "The passage of the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993 influenced how agencies assess the effectiveness of their programs. GPRA shifted the focus of accountability for federal programs from inputs, such as staffing and activity levels, to outcomes. GPRA requires that each federal agency develop a multiyear strategic plan identifying the agency\u2019s mission and long-term goals. To develop the plans, each agency must connect its long-term strategic goals with daily activities. While GPRA requires agencies to measure the outcomes of their programs, it does not require agencies to conduct formal program evaluations such as impact evaluations. However, GPRA requires agencies to summarize the findings of program evaluations in their annual performance reports."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Impact Evaluations Are the Most Definitive Method for Determining a Program\u2019s Effect on Its Participants", "paragraphs": ["Many researchers consider impact evaluations to be the best method for determining a program\u2019s effect on its participants because they isolate a program\u2019s contribution from the effects of other factors that could have influenced participant outcomes. Impact evaluations can be designed in several ways, but most fall into two categories: experimental and quasiexperimental designs.", "Impact evaluations are used to isolate the influences of a program being studied from other influences in an individual\u2019s life. In the case of a child, many influences affect his or her development (fig. 1). As a child grows, he or she acquires new knowledge and new skills. Nutrition, health, family, and community as well as education and care play roles in his or her learning. In light of all these influences, it becomes difficult to distinguish between the effects of the program and the other factors that influence a child\u2019s learning.", "To isolate the program\u2019s influences on a child, an impact evaluation studies two groups of children: those receiving program services and a similar group not receiving program services. Researchers compare the relevant outcomes, such as reading ability, of these two groups of children to determine the program\u2019s effect.", "Most impact evaluations are one of two types\u2014experimental or quasiexperimental\u2014although they can be designed in several ways. The two designs differ primarily in the way that the comparison groups are developed. In an experimental design, the comparison group is referred to as the \u201ccontrol\u201d group. It is composed of individuals randomly selected from possible program participants. In a quasiexperimental impact evaluation, the comparison group is composed of individuals who share characteristics with program participants, but who may or may not have ever sought program services."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Experimental Design", "paragraphs": ["The more rigorous of the two types of impact evaluations is the experimental design (fig. 2). It randomly assigns individuals to either a group that will receive program services or a group that will not receive program services. As applicants apply for program services, each has an equal chance of being placed in a group that will receive program services or a group that will not receive program services. Although individual applicants are different, random assignment distributes those differences equally between the two groups, resulting in two groups that are presumed to have no systematic differences in their characteristics. Although individuals in the control group do not receive services from the program under study, they may receive similar services through other programs.", "At various points during an experimental impact study, researchers measure the relevant outcomes of the members of both groups. The group that is not receiving services demonstrates what would have happened without the program. Thus, when the progress of the two groups is compared, any differences between them can be attributed to the influences of the program. This way, the use of a control group serves to rule out alternative explanations for differences in the outcomes of program participants and nonparticipants. However, because control group members may receive services similar to those provided through the program under study, the differences in outcomes between the two groups may be less than they would have been had the control group not received those similar services."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Denial of Services to Certain Eligible Study Participants Heightens the Complexity and Difficulty of Experimental Impact Evaluations", "paragraphs": ["The denial of the program services under study to eligible individuals in control groups\u2014a necessary aspect of experimental impact evaluations\u2014 raises a number of issues. For example, experimental designs cannot be used when a program must serve all eligible individuals. The denial of services can also raise ethical issues, the result of which can be reluctance on the part of program staff and officials to participate in impact studies. These issues, along with other challenges characteristic of complex evaluations, can make experimental impact evaluations especially difficult, time-consuming, and expensive to perform.", "Ethical issues arise in the selection of an experimental impact evaluation control group. As we stated earlier, a control group consists of participants who are denied services. Several factors may complicate the creation of the control group, and in fact denying services for the purpose of creating a control group may not be possible. For example, a program may be required to serve all eligible individuals, as is the case with Special Education programs. Even when forming a control group does not raise these kinds of issues, program staff and officials may be ethically opposed to denying services to individuals, especially for evaluations requiring several years to complete. To overcome such opposition, an additional investment of time may be necessary to gain the trust of program staff. The organization conducting the evaluation may need to provide training to staff so that they understand the need for random assignment and can collect data if necessary.", "In addition to the possible opposition of staff members, people seeking program services can be reluctant to agree to forego program participation. Researchers must gain the acceptance and informed consent of both participants and control group members (or, in the case of evaluations involving minors, their guardians). In some instances, control group members or their families may require monetary or other incentives to participate. Over the course of the evaluation, incentives may need to be sustained or increased.", "The ethical issues associated with experimental designs, along with other challenges characteristic of complex evaluations, can make them difficult to complete and add to the time and expense they require. Experimental impact evaluations are often complex, multiyear studies awarded through competitive bids to experienced research firms. Considerable attention must be given to both study planning and execution. For example, researchers often prepare detailed plans describing the study, its methodologies, and issues that can affect the study. In many cases, aspects of the study must be pilot tested before the larger study can be undertaken. Then, once evaluations are under way, individuals may need to be tracked over several years. For example, an evaluation that begins well before a child starts school\u2014for example, at age 3 years\u2014may require 3 years or more of data collection to track the child through the beginning of his or her school years. In addition, special efforts must be made to limit the number of study participants who leave the study, especially from within the control group."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Quasiexperimental Design", "paragraphs": ["The other, less rigorous type of impact evaluation is quasiexperimental design. When randomly assigning individuals to a control group is not a feasible option, quasiexperimental impact evaluations can be used to compare the performance of program participants on various measures to individuals not in the program. In a quasiexperimental design, methods other than random assignment are used to create a comparison group. A comparison group can be developed in a variety of ways. One way is to use a set of individuals who have similar characteristics to the group receiving the program services under study. For example, the group might live in the same neighborhood as the group receiving services and have family and income characteristics similar to those receiving serivces.", "The extent to which quasiexperimental comparison groups are actually similar to program participants is not entirely known. For this reason, quasiexperimental evaluations cannot rule out all of the factors that influence participants\u2019 outcomes. Other factors could explain differences between the two groups, making it difficult to conclude, with certainty, the effect of the program being examined.

The evaluation is still in its early stages and data collection has not yet commenced. Before data collection begins in fall 2002, a pilot study will be conducted to test various procedures and measures and to investigate the variations that exist across different communities with respect to Head Start programs and the availability of other care options for low-income children.

It is estimated that this evaluation will take more than 6 years to complete. The Congress mandated this evaluation and specified that it be an impact evaluation by stating that children should be randomly assigned to either a group that will receive Head Start services or one that will not receive Head Start services.", "The study has two primary goals. The first is to determine the national impact of Head Start on children\u2019s school readiness by comparing children in Head Start to children not in Head Start. Data in areas related to school readiness, such as cognition, physical well-being, social and emotional development, and language usage, will be collected from both groups of children. In addition, information on parenting practices, family structure, demographics, and socioeconomics will be collected. The second goal is to determine under which conditions and for which children Head Start works best.", "In crafting the study proposal, Westat noted the difficulties inherent in denying services to eligible children in order to create the control group and suggested ways to soften the ethical objections to random assignment. For example, the proposal allows Head Start staff to provide information to control group families on alternative services in the community, and exempts a small number of children with significant disabilities from the random assignment. The plan also acknowledges the need to make parents comfortable with the process and, in some instances, provides financial incentives for participation. At the same time, Westat noted the need to maintain the integrity of the random assignment over a number of years. To this end, the plan calls for providing information to Head Start staff about the need for random assignment. In addition, Head Start grantees will need to agree to exclude children assigned to the control group from enrolling at other Head Start centers within their jurisdictional control during the study. The final report is due in December 2006.", "The issue of Head Start\u2019s effectiveness was highlighted in 1997 when we reported that the body of research on the Head Start program was insufficient to draw conclusions about its national impact. The report recommended that a study or studies be undertaken to determine the impact of the program nationally. The following year, we reiterated these points in another report and added that the federal government\u2019s significant financial investment in Head Start, including plans to increase the number of children served, warranted definitive evaluation studies, even though they may be costly.", "Based on these recommendations and the testimony of research methodologists and early childhood experts, the Congress mandated that HHS fund and conduct  an evaluation to determine, on a national level, the impact of Head Start on the children it serves. The Congress also called for an expert panel to develop recommendations regarding the study design to determine if, overall, Head Start programs\u2019 impacts are consistent with the primary goal of school readiness. The panel included 30 experts in the areas of program evaluation and research, education, early childhood care and care policy, and economics.

For example, if legislation requires a program to serve a particular population with certain characteristics, researchers conducting an implementation evaluation would examine the demographics of participants to determine if the program is indeed serving this population.", "Implementation evaluations provide information on many aspects of a program. For example, the first Even Start study was largely an implementation study, and its findings were used to improve program design and shape future research. The study was broad in scope, but examined the characteristics of Even Start participants, projects, and services to assess how closely they resembled what had been envisioned for the program.
