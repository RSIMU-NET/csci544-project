To help FDA address shortcomings in its inspection program, the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002 required FDA to accredit third parties to inspect certain establishments. In response, FDA has implemented two such voluntary programs. GAO previously reported on the status of one of these programs, citing concerns regarding its implementation and factors that may influence manufacturers' participation. (Medical Devices: Status of FDA's Program for Inspections by Accredited Organizations, GAO-07-157 , January 2007.) This statement (1) assesses FDA's management of inspections of establishments--particularly those in foreign countries--manufacturing devices for the U.S. market, and (2) provides the status of FDA's programs for third-party inspections of medical device manufacturing establishments. GAO interviewed FDA officials; reviewed pertinent statutes, regulations, guidance, and reports; and analyzed information from FDA databases. GAO also updated its previous work on FDA's programs for inspections by accredited third parties."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["FDA has not met the statutory requirement to inspect certain domestic establishments manufacturing medical devices every 2 years, and the agency faces challenges inspecting foreign establishments. FDA primarily inspected establishments located in the United States. The agency has not met the biennial inspection requirement for domestic establishments manufacturing medical devices that FDA has classified as high risk, such as pacemakers, or medium risk, such as hearing aids. FDA officials estimated that the agency has inspected these establishments every 3 years (for high risk devices) or 5 years (for medium risk devices). There is no comparable requirement to inspect foreign establishments, and agency officials estimate that these establishments have been inspected every 6 years (for high risk devices) or 27 years (for medium risk devices). FDA faces challenges in managing its inspections of foreign medical device establishments. Two databases that provide FDA with information about foreign medical device establishments and the products they manufacture for the U.S. market contain inaccuracies that create disparate estimates of establishments subject to FDA inspection. Although comparing information from these two databases could help FDA determine the number of foreign establishments marketing medical devices in the United States, these databases cannot exchange information and any comparisons must be done manually. Finally, inspections of foreign medical device manufacturing establishments pose unique challenges to FDA in human resources and logistics. Few inspections of medical device manufacturing establishments have been conducted through FDA's two accredited third-party inspection programs--the Accredited Persons Inspection Program and the Pilot Multi-purpose Audit Program (PMAP). From March 11, 2004--the date when FDA first cleared an accredited organization to conduct independent inspections--through January 11, 2008, five inspections have been conducted by accredited organizations through FDA's Accredited Persons Inspection Program. An incentive to participation in the program is the opportunity to reduce the number of inspections conducted to meet FDA and other countries' requirements. Disincentives include bearing the cost for the inspection, particularly when the consequences of an inspection that otherwise might not occur in the near future could involve regulatory action. The Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 made several changes to program eligibility requirements that could result in increased participation by manufacturers. PMAP was established on September 7, 2006, and as of January 11, 2008, two inspections had been conducted by an accredited organization through this program, which is more limited than the Accredited Persons Inspection Program. The small number of inspections completed to date by accredited third-party organizations raises questions about the practicality and effectiveness of establishing similar programs that rely on third parties to quickly help FDA fulfill its responsibilities."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today as you examine how the Food and Drug  Administration (FDA) has been meeting its regulatory responsibilities. One  area of FDA responsibility is the regulation of medical devices\u2014such as  hearing aids and pacemakers\u2014marketed in the United States, whether  manufactured in domestic or foreign establishments. FDA classifies  medical devices into one of three classes based on degree of potential risk  and level of control needed to reasonably ensure safety and effectiveness.  Inspection of establishments is FDA\u2019s primary means of assuring that the  safety and effectiveness of medical devices are not jeopardized by poor  manufacturing practices. Requirements governing domestic and foreign  inspections differ. Specifically, FDA is required to inspect domestic  establishments that manufacture class II (medium risk) or III (high risk)  medical devices every 2 years. There is no comparable requirement to  inspect foreign establishments.", "The Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002 (MDUFMA)  addressed concerns about FDA\u2019s ability to meet its responsibilities for  inspecting medical device manufacturing establishments. MDUFMA  included provisions designed to (1) increase the number of inspected  medical device manufacturing establishments and (2) help manufacturers  meet the inspection requirements of both the United States and foreign  countries in a single inspection. Specifically, MDUFMA required FDA to  accredit third-party organizations to conduct inspections of certain  domestic and foreign establishments. In response, FDA implemented its  Accredited Persons Inspection Program, which permits certain  establishments to voluntarily request inspections from third-party  organizations to meet inspectional requirements. In January 2007, we  reported on the status of this program citing, among other things,  concerns regarding its implementation and potential incentives and  disincentives that may influence manufacturers\u2019 participation.  Additionally, in partnership with Health Canada, FDA has established  another program for inspection by accredited third parties\u2014the Pilot  Multi-purpose Audit Program (PMAP)\u2014that allows accredited  organizations to conduct a single inspection to meet the regulatory  requirements of both countries. A report by the House of Representatives  Committee on Energy and Commerce that accompanied MDUFMA stated  that inspections by accredited third parties would permit FDA to focus the  agency\u2019s inspection resources on manufacturers that have greater  problems and devices that present higher risks.", "In addition to the questions about medical devices that led to the creation  of FDA\u2019s third-party inspection program, questions have also been raised  about how FDA is meeting its regulatory responsibilities in other program  areas, such as drugs. In November 2007, we testified on our preliminary  findings regarding FDA\u2019s program for inspecting foreign drug  manufacturers. Our findings suggested that FDA conducted infrequent  inspections; had weaknesses in its data systems, including conflicting  information on the number of foreign establishments; and faced  challenges unique to foreign inspections, including those involving human  resource issues. (See app. I for a summary of that testimony. We plan to  issue a final report at a later date.) Also in November 2007, a  subcommittee of the FDA Science Board issued a report that identified  growing demands on FDA, including the globalization of the industries  that FDA regulates. The report found that disparities between FDA\u2019s  responsibilities and its available resources\u2014including human resources\u2014 have resulted in serious weaknesses that jeopardize the agency\u2019s ability to  meet current and emerging regulatory responsibilities. The  subcommittee\u2019s report noted that these weaknesses include inadequate  inspections of manufacturers. It also emphasized that FDA\u2019s information  technology infrastructure is obsolete and unstable; provides an insufficient  basis to access, integrate, and analyze data; and is subject to frequent  system failures.", "Third-party organizations have been identified as one mechanism that  could help FDA address shortcomings in inspection programs, beyond the  programs for medical devices. The federal Interagency Working Group on  Import Safety recently suggested that the use of third-party organizations  could provide FDA with information to help the agency target its  inspection resources to those products of greatest risk. In addition, we  recommended that FDA consider developing a third-party inspection  program to help it meet its responsibilities for inspecting foreign firms  importing seafood to the United States.", "Given the recent questions regarding FDA\u2019s inspection programs and  suggestions that third-party organizations could supplement FDA\u2019s  resources, you asked for information on FDA\u2019s management of its medical  device inspection program. My remarks will focus on (1) our assessment  of FDA\u2019s program for inspecting establishments that manufacture medical  devices for the U.S. market, particularly those located in foreign countries  and (2) the status of FDA\u2019s programs for third-party inspections of medical  device manufacturing establishments. Today, in a separate statement, we  are also discussing the federal oversight of food safety as a high-risk area  and ways in which FDA can better leverage its resources. These and  other recent testimonies on drug safety and food safety offer some  observations on FDA\u2019s inspection program capacity.", "To address these issues, we interviewed officials from FDA\u2019s Center for  Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) and Office of Regulatory Affairs  (ORA), which each have responsibilities for managing the medical device  inspection program. We reviewed pertinent statutes and regulations, as  well as agency documents that provide guidance on FDA\u2019s inspection  requirements and programs for inspections by accredited third parties. To  assess FDA\u2019s program for inspecting establishments that manufacture  medical devices, we obtained information from FDA\u2019s Device Registration  and Listing System (DRLS), as of September 19, 2007; Field  Accomplishments and Compliance Tracking System (FACTS) for fiscal  year 2002 through fiscal year 2007; and Operational and Administrative  System for Import Support (OASIS) for fiscal year 2007. We assessed the  reliability of these data by (1) reviewing existing information about the  data and the databases that produced them, (2) interviewing agency  officials knowledgeable about the data, and (3) performing electronic  testing of data elements from DRLS and FACTS. We found the data in the  FACTS database sufficiently reliable for our purposes. We also found that  DRLS was sufficiently reliable, to the extent that it accurately reflects  information provided by domestic and foreign establishments that register  to market medical devices in the United States. However, we determined  that these data do not necessarily reflect the number of establishments  that manufacture medical devices for the U.S. market. In addition, we  found that OASIS is likely to overestimate the number of foreign  establishments whose medical devices have been imported into the United  States, due to uncorrected errors in the data. Therefore, we present  information from both DRLS and OASIS to illustrate the variability in  information that FDA\u2019s databases provide to agency officials on this topic.  These data represent the best information available and are what FDA  relies on to manage its domestic and foreign medical device inspection  activities.", "To examine the status of FDA\u2019s programs for third-party inspections, we  received FDA data on the number of inspections conducted by accredited  third parties from March 11, 2004\u2014the date when FDA first cleared an  accredited organization to conduct inspections\u2014through January 11, 2008.  This updates the data we obtained for our January 2007 report for which  data collection ended on October 31, 2006. We also obtained information  from FDA about other critical aspects of their programs for inspections by  accredited third parties, such as the number of accredited organizations.  To gain perspective on recent changes to FDA\u2019s programs for inspections  by accredited third parties, we contacted representatives of the same 13  affected entities we interviewed for our January 2007 report on this topic.  We received responses from 2 of 4 accredited organizations, 2 of 3  organizations that represent medical device manufacturers, and 1 of 6  manufacturers. We received technical comments on a draft of this  statement from FDA, which we incorporated, as appropriate. We  conducted this performance audit from December 2007 to January 2008, in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives.", "In summary, we found that FDA has not met the requirement to inspect  domestic establishments manufacturing class II or III medical devices  every 2 years and faces challenges in inspecting foreign establishments.  FDA primarily inspected domestic establishments. FDA officials estimated  that the agency has inspected domestic class II manufacturers every   5 years and domestic class III manufacturers every 3 years. There is no  comparable requirement to conduct foreign inspections and FDA has  conducted relatively few. Officials estimated the agency has inspected  foreign class II manufacturers every 27 years and foreign class III  manufacturers every 6 years. In addition, FDA faces challenges in  managing its foreign medical device inspection program. Two databases  that provide FDA with information about foreign medical device  establishments and the products they manufacture for the U.S. market  contain inaccuracies that create divergent estimates of establishments  subject to FDA inspection. Despite the divergent estimates, FDA does not  routinely verify these data. Although comparing information from these  two databases could help FDA determine the number of foreign  establishments marketing medical devices in the United States, these  databases cannot exchange information and any comparisons must be  done manually. While the agency has taken steps to improve these  databases, it is too soon to know if these changes will improve FDA\u2019s data.  Finally, inspections of foreign medical device manufacturing  establishments pose unique challenges to FDA, such as difficulties in  recruiting investigators to voluntarily travel to certain countries and in  extending trips if problems are identified during inspections. Our results  are consistent with our November 2007 testimony on FDA\u2019s foreign drug  inspection program, as well as the findings of the FDA Science Board.", "Few inspections of medical device manufacturing establishments have  been conducted through FDA\u2019s two programs for inspections by  accredited third parties\u2014the Accredited Persons Inspection Program and  PMAP.

As part of its efforts to ensure the safety, effectiveness, and quality  of medical devices, FDA is responsible for inspecting certain domestic and  foreign establishments to ensure that they meet manufacturing standards  established in FDA\u2019s quality system regulation. FDA does not have  authority to require foreign establishments to allow the agency to inspect  their facilities. However, FDA has the authority to prevent the importation  of products manufactured at establishments that refuse to allow an FDA  inspection. Unlike food, for which FDA primarily relies on inspections at  the border, physical inspection of manufacturing establishments is a  critical mechanism in FDA\u2019s process to ensure that medical devices and  drugs are safe and effective and that manufacturers adhere to good  manufacturing practices.", "Within FDA, CDRH assures the safety and effectiveness of medical  devices. Among other things, CDRH works with ORA, which conducts  inspections of both domestic and foreign establishments to ensure that  devices are produced in conformance with federal statutes and  regulations, including the quality system regulation. FDA may conduct  inspections before and after medical devices are approved or otherwise  cleared to be marketed in the United States.", "Premarket inspections are conducted before FDA will approve U.S.  marketing of a new medical device that is not substantially equivalent to  one that is already on the market. Premarket inspections primarily assess  manufacturing facilities, methods, and controls and may verify pertinent  records.", "Postmarket inspections are conducted after a medical device has been  approved or otherwise cleared to be marketed in the United States and  include several types of inspections: (1) Quality system inspections are  conducted to assess compliance with applicable FDA regulations,  including the quality system regulation to ensure good manufacturing  practices and the regulation requiring reporting of adverse events. These  inspections may be comprehensive or abbreviated, which differ in the  scope of inspectional activity. Comprehensive postmarket inspections  assess multiple aspects of the manufacturer\u2019s quality system, including  management controls, design controls, corrective and preventative  actions, and production and process controls. Abbreviated postmarket  inspections assess only some of these aspects, but always assess  corrective and preventative actions. (2) For-cause and compliance follow- up inspections are initiated in response to specific information that raises  questions or problems associated with a particular establishment.   (3) Postmarket audit inspections are conducted within 8 to 12 months of a  premarket application\u2019s approval to examine any changes in the design,  manufacturing process, or quality assurance systems.", "FDA determines which establishments to inspect using a risk-based  strategy. High priority inspections include premarket approval inspections  for class III devices, for-cause inspections, inspections of establishments  that have had a high frequency of device recalls, and other devices and  manufacturers FDA considers high risk. The establishment\u2019s inspection  history may also be considered. A provision in FDAAA may assist FDA in  making decisions about which establishments to inspect because it  authorizes the agency to accept voluntary submissions of audit reports  addressing manufacturers\u2019 conformance with internationally established  standards for the purpose of setting risk-based inspectional priorities.", "FDA\u2019s programs for domestic and foreign inspections by accredited third  parties provide an alternative to the traditional FDA-conducted  comprehensive postmarket quality system inspection for eligible  manufacturers of class II and III medical devices. MDUFMA required FDA  to accredit third persons\u2014which are organizations\u2014to conduct  inspections of certain establishments. In describing this requirement, the  House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce noted that  some manufacturers have faced an increase in the number of inspections  required by foreign countries, and that the number of inspections could be  reduced if the manufacturers could contract with a third-party  organization to conduct a single inspection that would satisfy the  requirements of both FDA and foreign countries. Manufacturers that  meet eligibility requirements may request a postmarket inspection by an  FDA-accredited organization. The eligibility criteria for requesting an  inspection of an establishment by an accredited organization include that  the manufacturer markets (or intends to market) a medical device in a  foreign country and the establishment to be inspected must not have  received warnings for significant deviations from compliance  requirements on its last inspection.", "MDUFMA also established minimum requirements for organizations to be  accredited to conduct third-party inspections, including protecting against  financial conflicts of interest and ensuring the competence of the  organization to conduct inspections. FDA developed a training program  for inspectors from accredited organizations that involves both formal  classroom training and completion of three joint training inspections with  FDA. Each individual inspector from an accredited organization must  complete all training requirements successfully before being cleared to  conduct independent inspections. FDA relies on manufacturers to  volunteer to host these joint inspections, which count as FDA postmarket  quality system inspections.", "A manufacturer that is cleared to have an inspection by an accredited third  party enters an agreement with the approved accredited organization and  schedules an inspection. Once the accredited organization completes its  inspection, it prepares a report and submits it to FDA, which makes the  final assessment of compliance with applicable requirements. FDAAA  added a requirement that accredited organizations notify FDA of any  withdrawal, suspension, restriction, or expiration of certificate of  conformance with quality systems standards (such as those established by  the International Organization for Standardization) for establishments they  inspected for FDA.", "In addition to the Accredited Persons Inspection Program, FDA has a  second program for accredited third-party inspections of medical device  establishments. On September 7, 2006, FDA and Health Canada announced  the establishment of PMAP. This pilot program was designed to allow  qualified third-party organizations to perform a single inspection that  would meet the regulatory requirements of both the United States and  Canada. The third-party organizations eligible to conduct inspections  through PMAP are those that FDA accredited for its Accredited Persons  Inspection Program (and that completed all required training for that  program) and that are also authorized to conduct inspections of medical  device establishments for Health Canada. To be eligible to have a third- party inspection through PMAP, manufacturers must meet all criteria  established for the Accredited Persons Inspection Program.

These representatives  also noted that key incentives and disincentives to manufacturers\u2019  participation remain. FDA officials told us that they are currently revising  their guidance to industry in light of FDAAA and expect to issue the  revised guidance during fiscal year 2008. It is too soon to tell what impact  these changes will have on manufacturers\u2019 participation.", "FDA officials acknowledged that manufacturers\u2019 participation in the  Accredited Persons Inspection Program has been limited. In December  2007, FDA established a working group to assess the successes and  failures of this program and to identify ways to increase participation.  Representatives of the two organizations that represent medical device  manufacturers with whom we recently spoke stated that they believe  manufacturers remain interested in the Accredited Persons Inspection  Program. The representative of one large, global manufacturer of medical  devices told us that it is in the process of arranging to have 20 of its  domestic and foreign device manufacturing establishments inspected by  accredited third parties.", "As of January 11, 2008, two inspections, both of domestic establishments,  had been conducted through PMAP, FDA\u2019s second program for  inspections by accredited third parties. Although it is too soon to tell what  the benefits of PMAP will be, the program is more limited than the  Accredited Persons Inspection Program and may pose additional  disincentives to participation by both manufacturers and accredited  organizations. Specifically, inspections through PMAP would be designed  to meet the requirements of the United States and Canada, whereas  inspections conducted through the Accredited Persons Inspection  Program could be designed to meet the requirements of other countries. In  addition, two of the five representatives of affected entities noted that in  contrast to inspections conducted through the Accredited Persons  Inspection Program, inspections conducted through PMAP could undergo  additional review by Health Canada. Health Canada will review inspection  reports submitted through this pilot program to ensure they meet its  standards. This extra review poses a greater risk of unexpected outcomes  for the manufacturer and the accredited organization, which could be a  disincentive to participation in PMAP that is not present with the  Accredited Persons Inspection Program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["Americans depend on FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of  medical products, including medical devices, manufactured throughout  the world. However, our findings regarding inspections of medical device  manufacturers indicate weaknesses that mirror those presented in our  November 2007 testimony regarding inspections of foreign drug  manufacturers. In addition, they are consistent with the FDA Science  Board\u2019s findings that FDA\u2019s ability to fulfill its regulatory responsibilities is  jeopardized, in part, by information technology and human resources  challenges. We recognize that FDA has expressed the intention to improve  its data management, but it is too early to tell whether the intended  changes will ultimately enhance the agency\u2019s ability to manage its  inspection programs. We and others have suggested that the use of  accredited third parties could improve FDA\u2019s ability to meet its inspection  responsibilities. However, the implementation of its programs for  inspecting medical device manufacturers has resulted in little progress. To  date, its programs for inspections by accredited third parties have not  assisted FDA in meeting its regulatory responsibilities nor have they  provided a rapid or substantial increase in the number of inspections  performed by these organizations, as originally intended. Although recent  statutory changes to the requirements for inspections by accredited third  parties may encourage greater participation in these programs, the lack of  meaningful progress raises questions about the practicality and  effectiveness of establishing similar programs that rely on third parties to  quickly help FDA fulfill other responsibilities.", "Mr. Chairman, this completes my prepared statement, I would be happy to  respond to any questions you or the other Members of the subcommittee  may have at this time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Contacts and Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["For further information about this testimony, please contact Marcia  Crosse at (202) 512-7114 or crossem@gao.gov.

We found that   (1) FDA\u2019s effectiveness in managing the foreign drug inspection program  continued to be hindered by weaknesses in its databases; (2) FDA  inspected relatively few foreign establishments; and (3) the foreign  inspection process involved unique circumstances that were not  encountered domestically.", "Our preliminary findings indicated that more than 9 years after we issued  our last report on FDA\u2019s foreign drug inspection program, FDA\u2019s  effectiveness in managing this program continued to be hindered by  weaknesses in its databases.  FDA did not know how many foreign  establishments were subject to inspection. Instead of maintaining a list of  such establishments, FDA relied on information from several databases  that were not designed for this purpose. One of these databases contained  information on foreign establishments that had registered to market drugs  in the United States, while another contained information on drugs  imported into the United States. One database indicated about 3,000  foreign establishments could have been subject to inspection in fiscal year  2007, while another indicated that about 6,800 foreign establishments  could have been subject to inspection in that year. Despite the divergent  estimates of foreign establishments subject to inspection generated by  these two databases, FDA did not verify the data within each database. For  example, the agency did not routinely confirm that a registered  establishment actually manufactured a drug for the U.S. market. However,  FDA used these data to generate a list of 3,249 foreign establishments from  which it prioritized establishments for inspection.", "Because FDA was not certain how many foreign drug establishments were  actually subject to inspection, the percentage of such establishments that  had been inspected could not be calculated with certainty. We found that  FDA inspected relatively few foreign drug establishments, as shown in  table 2. Using the list of 3,249 foreign drug establishments from which FDA  prioritized establishments for inspection, we found that the agency may  inspect about 7 percent of foreign drug establishments in a given year. At  this rate, it would take FDA more than 13 years to inspect each foreign  drug establishment on this list once, assuming that no additional  establishments are subject to inspection.", "FDA\u2019s data indicated that some foreign drug manufacturers had not  received an inspection, but FDA could not provide the exact number of  foreign drug establishments that had never been inspected. Most of the  foreign drug inspections were conducted as part of processing a new drug  application or an abbreviated new drug application, rather than as current  good manufacturing practices (GMP) surveillance inspections, which are  used to monitor the quality of marketed drugs. FDA used a risk-based  process, based in part on data from its registration and import databases,  to develop a prioritized list of foreign drug establishments for GMP  surveillance inspections in fiscal year 2007. According to FDA, about 30  such inspections were completed in fiscal year 2007, and at least 50 were  targeted for inspection in fiscal year 2008. Further, inaccuracies in the data  on which this risk-based process depended limited its effectiveness.", "Finally, the very nature of the foreign drug inspection process involved  unique circumstances that were not encountered domestically. For  example, FDA did not have a dedicated staff to conduct foreign drug  inspections and relied on those inspecting domestic establishments to  volunteer for foreign inspections. While FDA may conduct unannounced  GMP inspections of domestic establishments, it did not arrive  unannounced at foreign establishments. It also lacked the flexibility to  easily extend foreign inspections if problems were encountered due to the  need to adhere to an itinerary that typically involved multiple inspections  in the same country. Finally, language barriers can make foreign  inspections more difficult to conduct than domestic ones. FDA did not  generally provide translators to its inspection teams. Instead, they may  have had to rely on an English-speaking representative of the foreign  establishment being inspected, rather than an independent translator.", "This is a work of the U.S. government and is not subject to copyright protection in the  United States.
