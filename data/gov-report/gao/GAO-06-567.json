The U.S. Census Bureau (Bureau) used statistical methods to estimate the accuracy of 1990 and 2000 Census data. Because the Bureau considered the estimates unreliable due to methodological uncertainties, they were not used to adjust the census results. Still, a key question is how sensitive are federal formula grants to alternative population estimates, such as those derived from statistical methods? GAO was asked to identify (1) the top 20 formula grant programs based on the amount of funds targeted by any means, and (2) the amount of money allocated for Medicaid and Social Services Block Grant (SSBG), and the prospective impact of estimated population counts from the 1990 and 2000 Censuses on state allocations for these two programs.

Medicaid was the largest formula grant program, with obligations of $183.2 billion, or nearly 40 percent of all grant obligations. The federal government allocated $159.7 billion to states in Medicaid funds (not including administrative costs such as processing and making payments to service providers) and $1.7 billion in SSBG funds. Recalculating these allocations using statistical population estimates from the Accuracy and Coverage Evaluation and the Post Enumeration Survey--independent sample surveys designed to estimate the number of people that were over- and undercounted in the 2000 and 1990 Censuses--would have produced the following results. First, a total of 0.23 percent ($368 million) of federal Medicaid funds would have been shifted overall among the states in fiscal year 2004 and 0.25 percent ($4.2 million) of SSBG funds would have shifted among the states in fiscal year 2005 as a result of the simulations using statistical population estimates from the 2000 Census. Second, with respect to Medicaid, 22 states would have received additional funding, 17 states would have received less funding, and 11 states and the District of Columbia would have received the same amount of funding using statistical population estimates from the 2000 Census. Based on a fiscal year 2004 federal Medicaid allocation to the states of $159.7 billion, Nevada would have been the largest percentage gainer, with an additional 1.47 percent in funding, and Wisconsin would have lost the greatest percentage--1.46 percent. Third, with respect to SSBG, 27 states and the District of Columbia would have gained funding, and 23 states would have lost funding using statistical population estimates from the 2000 Census. Based on a fiscal year 2005 SSBG allocation of $1.7 billion, Washington, D.C. would have been the biggest percentage gainer, receiving an additional 2.05 percent in funding, while Minnesota would have lost the greatest percentage funding--1.17 percent. Fourth, statistical population estimates from the 2000 Census would have shifted a smaller percentage of funding compared to those using the 1990 Census because the difference between the actual and estimated population counts was smaller in 2000 compared to 1990."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Data from the decennial census are used to apportion congressional seats,  redraw congressional districts, and allocate federal assistance to state and  local governments through certain formula grant programs, as well as for a  number of other public- and private-sector purposes.  As a result, it is  essential that census data be as complete and accurate as practicable.   Although the U.S. Census Bureau (Bureau) puts forth tremendous effort to  conduct a complete and accurate population count, some amount of error  is inevitable because of the nation\u2019s size and demographic complexity, and  the inherent limitations of census-taking methods.", "To estimate the accuracy of the 2000 Census and possibly adjust for any  errors, the Bureau conducted the Accuracy and Coverage Evaluation  (A.C.E.), which was an independent sample survey designed to estimate  the number of people that were over- and undercounted in the census, a  problem the Bureau refers to as \u201ccoverage error.\u201d", "In 1999, the Supreme Court ruled that the Census Act prohibited the use of  statistical sampling for purposes of apportioning seats in the House of  Representatives, but the Supreme Court\u2019s decision did not specifically  address the use of statistical sampling for other purposes, including  adjusting the data used to allocate federal assistance via formula grants.   However, after conducting a number of evaluations of the A.C.E. samples  and methodology, the Bureau concluded that the A.C.E. population  estimates were flawed and that all potential uses of these data would be  inappropriate.  As a result, the Bureau\u2019s parent agency, the Department of  Commerce, determined that the A.C.E. estimates should not be used for  any purpose that legally requires data from the decennial census. We have  also stated that the A.C.E. statistical population estimates are unreliable.", "Still, a key question that arises is how sensitive are federal formula grants  to alternative population estimates, such as those derived by statistical  methods?  With that in mind, you asked us to examine how statistical  population estimates might have redistributed federal assistance among  the states had they been used to calculate formula grants rather than the  actual population counts.   In response, and as requested, we recalculated  certain federal assistance to the states using the A.C.E. population  estimates from the 2000 Census, as well as the population estimates  derived from the Post-Enumeration Survey (PES)\u2014the independent  sample survey the Bureau administered to evaluate the accuracy of the  1990 Census.

For the second objective,  we recalculated the amount of federal funding allocated to the states for  Medicaid using the 2005 fiscal year Federal Medical Assistance Percentage  (FMAP) with 2004 state expenditure data, and recalculated the Social  Services Block Grant (SSBG) state allocations using 2005 fiscal year  allocation data.  In both cases we used the most recent year for which data  were available. We based our calculation on the official population counts  from the 1990 and 2000 Censuses. We then recalculated the allocations  using the PES population estimates from the 1990 Census, and the A.C.E.  population estimates from the 2000 Census.", "The federal share of total Medicaid program costs is determined using a  statutory formula that calculates each state\u2019s FMAP.  SSBG receives an  annual appropriation that is distributed in proportion to each state\u2019s  population.

The federal share of total Medicaid  program costs is determined using the FMAP, a statutory formula that  calculates the portion of each state\u2019s Medicaid expenditures that the  federal government will pay. Our Medicaid simulation uses the fiscal year  2005 FMAP, which applies 2001 through 2002 personal income and  population data, and fiscal year 2004 expenditure data. The formula  calculates the federal matching rate for each state on the basis of its per  capita income (PCI) in relation to national PCI. States with a low PCI  receive a higher federal matching rate, and states with a high PCI receive a  lower rate.
