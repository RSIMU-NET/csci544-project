GAO requested OPM plan availability and enrollment data by county for 2000 through 2015, but county-level availability data were only available for 2007 and 2009 through 2015. Therefore, plan availability and market share analysis timeframes differ. GAO also interviewed OPM officials, 11 FEHBP stakeholders, such as carriers and federal employee and retiree organizations, and reviewed relevant documentation and research, such as cost estimates of the potential effects of expanding OPM's authority.", "GAO provided a draft of this product to OPM for comment.

From 2007 to 2015, the median number of plan offerings available in a county increased from 19 to 24. Of the 24 plan offerings in 2015, 19 were available nationwide and 5 were health maintenance organization plans offered in specific geographic areas. Yet despite more available plan offerings in recent years, enrollment has become more concentrated within the largest health insurance carrier in a county. Specifically, the median share of enrollment held by the largest carrier in a county increased from 58 percent in 2000 to 72 percent in 2015. Further, one carrier\u2014the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association\u2014was the largest carrier in 93 percent of counties in 2000 and 98 percent of counties in 2015.", "The stakeholders GAO interviewed and the cost estimates GAO reviewed about the potential effects of expanding the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) authority to contract with more plan types than currently offered in FEHBP did not offer clear consensus about the effects. Most stakeholders supported expanding OPM's authority; those opposed were primarily concerned about OPM adding regional preferred provider organization plans, saying this could cause program instability and higher premiums. Estimates by OPM and others differed significantly on whether the expansion would increase or decrease costs. This is because they used differing assumptions about premiums, enrollment, and other factors, and it is unclear whether the assumptions used in these estimates will be realized."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) is the largest  employer-sponsored health insurance program in the country, providing  coverage to about 8.2 million federal employees, retirees, and their  dependents in 2016. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM)  administers FEHBP in part by entering into contracts with qualified health  insurance carriers, negotiating plan benefits and premiums as part of that  process. The statute that established FEHBP in 1959 authorized OPM to  contract with four specific plan types, each of which must meet different  requirements for their service areas and benefits, among other things.  Today OPM generally groups these plan types into two main categories  of plans\u2014fee-for-service (FFS) plans and health maintenance  organization (HMO) plans. FFS plans are offered nationwide to all  participants, while HMO plans offer coverage in selected geographic  areas. Despite having a number of plans to choose from, about two- thirds of FEHBP participants in 2015 were enrolled in one of the two  options offered as part of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association\u2019s  (BCBSA) nationwide FFS plan.", "OPM has reported that the health insurance marketplace has changed  significantly since the statute establishing FEHBP in 1959 defined the  plan types with which the agency could contract. According to OPM, this  constrains it from responding to this changed marketplace. Specifically, a  Director at OPM has testified that the program needs more competition  between plans and more diverse health plan choices. To enhance  program competition and modernize FEHBP, OPM and some  stakeholders have proposed that OPM\u2019s contracting authority be  expanded to allow a greater variety of health plan types to participate in  FEHBP than are provided for under current law. For example, OPM has  indicated that it does not have authority under current law to allow carriers  to offer regional preferred provider organization (PPO) plans, which would  be an additional kind of FFS plan. According to OPM, unlike the existing  nationwide FFS plans, regional PPO plans would cover smaller regions  and would not have nationwide premiums. However, some stakeholders  have raised concerns with the proposal, noting, for example, that if  regional PPO plans were added to the program they might have a  competitive advantage over the nationwide plans.", "With these issues in mind, you asked us to examine plan participation in  FEHBP and the potential impact of OPM adding new plan types to the  program. This report describes  1.  how plans and market shares of carriers participating in FEHBP  changed in recent years, and how FEHBP market shares compare to  other selected markets; and  2.  what is known about the potential effects of allowing OPM to contract  with a greater variety of health plan types than are currently offered in  FEHBP.", "To describe how plans and market shares of insurers participating in  FEHBP have changed in recent years, and how changes to FEHBP  market shares compare to trends in other selected markets, we analyzed  OPM data on zip code-level plan availability for 2007 and 2009 through  2015. (We requested data for 2000 through 2015, but OPM was not able  to provide zip code-level plan availability data prior to 2007, or for year  2008.) Using a publicly available zip code conversion file, we converted  these data from zip codes to counties. We then cross-referenced plan  codes to other data provided by OPM to classify plans and determine, for  each year, the number of plan offerings available in each county. To  assess the reliability of the data, we reviewed relevant documentation,  interviewed OPM officials involved in compiling the data, compared the  data against FEHBP enrollment records and published plan brochures,  and conducted data checks for reasonableness, outliers, and  completeness. Based on our review of the data and discussions with  OPM, we determined that our summaries and medians accurately  reflected HMO plan availability across counties over time. Therefore, we  determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "To determine FEHBP carrier market share, we analyzed OPM data on  county-level enrollments for active employees and annuitants from 2000  to 2015. We used an OPM-provided crosswalk to identify a parent  company, or carrier, for each plan, allowing us to calculate enrollment  market shares for carriers at the county, state, and national levels. We  calculated county-level carrier market share in three ways: (1) the market  share held by the largest, three largest, and five largest carriers in each  county (regardless of which carriers held that position), (2) the market  share held by certain specific carriers in each county (e.g., BCBSA and  Kaiser Permanente), and (3) the combined market share held by plans  categorized as HMO or FFS plans in each county. We assessed the  reliability of the data by interviewing OPM officials who regularly use the  data, testing for missing data, and reviewing the assignment of plans to  insurance carriers. We determined these data were sufficiently reliable for  our purposes.", "To compare FEHBP market shares to those in other selected markets, we  analyzed 2010 through 2014 data for the large group market and  Medicare Advantage. We selected the years of comparison based on  data available for the large group market from prior GAO reports issued in  2014 and 2016. We selected the large group market (coverage offered  by large employers) as a comparison market because it includes other  large public and private employers offering coverage from private carriers  and plans. In prior GAO reports, we analyzed data reported annually by  carriers and identified the market share held by the largest and three  largest carriers in each state. We relied on reliability testing conducted  for those prior reports and determined that they were sufficiently reliable  for our purposes. We selected the Medicare Advantage program\u2014a  private health plan alternative to the original Medicare program\u2014as a  comparison market because it is another federal program with nationwide  enrollees who can choose a plan from a number of options. To  determine Medicare Advantage carrier market shares, we obtained  enrollment data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services  (CMS) for each year from 2010 through 2014 that provides enrollment by  plan for each state, as of April. Using additional CMS data, we identified  the parent carrier for each plan and calculated the market share held by  the largest and the three largest Medicare Advantage carriers in each  state for each year. We conducted reliability testing of the Medicare  Advantage state level enrollment data, including tests for missing data  and comparisons to previously published information related to market  share, and determined that it was sufficiently reliable for our purposes.  While we present data from these markets as points of comparison with  FEHBP, the markets have substantive differences and do not offer perfect  comparisons. For example, in the large group market data, federal  agencies participating in FEHBP were considered large group employers  and FEHBP\u2019s approximately 8 million enrollments were included in the  data carriers reported for the large group market. In addition, employers  participating in the large group market are providing coverage options for  many fewer employees than FEHBP, while often offering fewer plan  options. Medicare Advantage provides coverage for a larger population of  enrollees (17.6 million) compared to FEHBP. Medicare Advantage  enrollees are typically older and more likely to be on a fixed income than  federal employees and their dependents. Additionally, the 17.6 million  Medicare Advantage enrollees in 2016 represents about one-third of all  Medicare enrollees; the remaining two-thirds are enrolled in traditional  Medicare.", "To describe the potential effects of allowing OPM to contract with a  greater variety of health plan types than are currently offered in FEHBP,  we interviewed OPM officials and reviewed relevant federal laws, FEHBP  policies, and other documents related to the potential effects of expanding  OPM\u2019s contracting authority. We also interviewed 11 FEHBP  stakeholders and experts (stakeholders)\u2014the Association of Federal  Health Organizations, two federal employee and retiree organizations, six  FEHBP carriers, and two FEHBP subject matter experts\u2014and reviewed  supplementary documents the stakeholders provided. For additional  context on the effects of adding new plans to a health care market, we  interviewed members of the American Academy of Actuaries and officials  from the California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System. In addition to  the information obtained from OPM and FEHBP stakeholders, we also  reviewed available estimates of the financial effects of expanding OPM\u2019s  contracting authority, including two studies we identified from Avalere  Health and the Center for Health and Economy on the potential effects if  OPM were to use such authority to add regional PPO plans to FEHBP.  We also reviewed relevant research related to consumer choice and  decision-making in health care.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2016 to October 2017 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["FEHBP was established primarily to help the government compete with  private-sector employers in attracting and retaining talented and qualified  workers. As indicated by the legislative history of the original FEHBP  statute, lawmakers wanted enrollees to exercise choice among various  plan types and, by using their own judgment, select health plans that best  meet their specific needs. While participation in FEHBP is voluntary, in  2015, 85 percent of federal workers and 90 percent of federal retirees  were enrolled in the program.", "Each FEHBP carrier offers one or more plans, and these plans can have  up to three options, or levels of benefits, depending on which type of plan  is being offered. Although they may differ in the specific benefits they  provide, all FEHBP plans cover basic hospital, surgical, physician,  emergency, and mental health care, as well as childhood immunizations  and certain prescription drugs. However, FEHBP plans offer different  levels of benefits, with many plans offering a choice between a more expensive plan option, which offers a higher level of coverage, and a less  expensive plan option, which offers a lower level of coverage. FEHBP  enrollees can purchase individual or family coverage. Beginning in 2016,  enrollees could also purchase coverage for themselves and one eligible  family member, referred to as \u201cself plus one\u201d coverage. FEHBP enrollees  can change health care plans during an annual open enrollment period or  at other times if they experience a qualifying life event, such as a change  in family status. OPM data indicates that between 2005 and 2015, the  annual percentage of FEHBP enrollees who changed their plan  enrollment by choice\u2014rather than because of mergers or plan  terminations\u2014ranged from 5 to 7 percent.", "The FEHBP statute limits the program to four specific plan types: (1) one  service benefit plan\u2014a government-wide plan with two levels of benefits;  (2) one government-wide indemnity benefit plan; (3) employee  organization plans; and (4) and comprehensive medical plans\u2014also  known as HMO plans. OPM generally refers to these plan types as  either FFS plans (the service benefit plan and the employee organization  plans), or HMO plans (comprehensive medical plans). Within the  categories of FFS and HMO plans, there can be significant variation in  the plan designs and enrollee cost sharing. Most FFS plans have PPO  arrangements, which usually have lower out-of-pocket expenses (i.e., a  smaller copayment and/or a reduced or waived deductible) when  enrollees use providers within the plan\u2019s preferred network. Compared  with HMOs, PPOs typically offer their enrollees a greater choice of  providers and have less plan management of the care that enrollees  receive. HMOs provide or arrange for comprehensive health care  services on a prepaid basis through designated plan physicians,  hospitals, and other providers in particular locations. Each HMO sets a  geographic area for which health care services will be available. Some  HMOs offer a point of service product that offers FEHBP enrollees the  choice of using a designated network of providers or using non-network  providers at an additional cost.", "Additionally, in 2003 and 2005 respectively, FEHBP also began offering  consumer-driven health plan (CDHP) and high-deductible health plan  (HDHP) designs that are coupled with a tax-advantaged account to help  enrollees pay for qualified medical expenses. Any of the FEHBP plan  types may be offered with a CDHP or HDHP design, and therefore  CDHPs and HDHPs can be either FFS or HMO plans. Enrollees in  typical CDHPs have responsibility for certain up-front medical costs, an  employer-funded account that enrollees may use to pay these up-front  costs, and catastrophic coverage with a high deductible. CDHP enrollees  receive full coverage of in-network preventive care. HDHPs offer low  premiums but higher deductibles and annual out-of-pockets limits  combined with a tax-advantaged account. HDHPs can have first dollar  coverage (no deductible) for preventive care and higher out-of-pocket  copayments and coinsurance for services received from non-network  providers.", "OPM is responsible for negotiating health benefits and premiums with  FFS and HMO plans. Each year, OPM sends a letter to all approved and  participating FFS and HMO plans\u2014its annual \u201ccall letter\u201d\u2014to solicit  proposed benefit and premium changes for the next calendar year, which  are due by the end of May. The descriptions of both covered and  excluded benefits are incorporated into the final contracts. Each plan  subsequently prints brochures describing the benefits and costs  according to a standard format, as specified by OPM. The brochures are  binding statements of benefits and exclusions that plans must follow as  parties to FEHBP contracts. Those plans meeting the minimum  requirements specified in the statute and regulations may participate in  the program and their contracts may be automatically renewed each year.", "The federal government and FEHBP enrollees generally each bear a  portion of the cost of FEHBP plan premiums. By statute, the  government generally pays 72 percent of the weighted average premium  of all health benefit plans participating in FEHBP, but no more than 75  percent of any particular plan\u2019s premium, while enrollees pay the  balance. Premium prices vary across plans and within plans and  depend on whether an enrollee is enrolled in self-only, family, or self plus  one coverage. The premiums are intended to cover enrollees\u2019 health care  costs, plans\u2019 expenses, reserves, and OPM\u2019s administrative costs.", "Although there has been some minor fluctuation in the number of FEHBP  enrollees over time, total program enrollment has remained around 8  million enrollees since 2000. As the Congressional Research Service has  reported previously, FEHBP enrollment is concentrated among a small  number of carriers and BCBSA has the largest share of total program  enrollment by far.

The  median number of plan offerings available in a county increased from 19  in 2007 to 24 in 2015. Most of these offerings were the nationwide FFS  plans that are available in all counties. There were 17 such plan  offerings in 2007 and 19 in 2015. The remaining plan offerings were  HMOs that were available in more limited areas. While the total number of  HMO plans that participated in FEHBP decreased from 2007 through  2015, the median number of HMO plan offerings in a county increased.  This suggests that those HMO plans in FEHBP in 2015 generally  participated in more counties than was the case in 2007.

Since 2007, however, the number of counties  without any HMO plan offerings available declined from 18 percent to less  than 2 percent in 2015. Most counties had a couple of HMO plan  offerings, and some counties had at least 10 HMO offerings. For  example, in 2015, enrollees in one county in New York had 15 HMO plan  offerings, giving enrollees a total of 34 offerings from which to select  coverage. (See fig. 2 for the range of available HMO plan offerings  among counties across all years.)", "Regarding reasons for the variation in available FFS and HMO plan  offerings, OPM officials told us that plans participating in FEHBP enter  and withdraw based on internal business decisions and often in response  to changing economic conditions. For example, according to OPM  officials, some plans may enter the program with the expectation of  gaining a target market share. OPM officials also noted that decreases in  plan participation in the past may have been a response to premium  increases that impacted plans\u2019 ability to effectively compete. In addition,  a 2012 OPM report noted that many prominent HMO plan carriers have  reduced the number of states in which they participated since 1985."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Market Share Held by the Largest FEHBP Carrier in Each County, Generally BCBSA, Increased from 2000 through 2015", "paragraphs": ["FEHBP enrollment within counties generally became more concentrated  from 2000 through 2015, although most of that growth occurred prior to  2007.

Comparatively, the combined median county market  share held by HMO plans decreased from 6 percent to 2 percent.

According to an OPM report, another factor  contributing to BCBSA\u2019s increased market share was the introduction of  the Basic option to the Service Benefit Plan in 2002.

In terms of positive effects,  one stakeholder said the authority could potentially allow OPM to offer  different types of plans\u2014such as value-based plan designs and  accountable care organizations\u2014that could lead to improved benefit  options and health outcomes for enrollees. One stakeholder also told us  that OPM\u2019s expanded authority would enable the agency to improve  transparency by allowing plans to contract with OPM as the type of plan  they actually are, rather than fitting into outdated statutorily established  categories, which the stakeholder characterized as an \u201cantiquated  labeling system.\u201d Another stakeholder said that participation by new plans  in FEHBP would foster competition and help keep health plan costs  down. One stakeholder also noted that if plan expansion would only be  undertaken when it is in the best interests of FEHBP and its enrollees\u2014 as OPM has indicated would be the case\u2014there was little or no downside  to such expanded authority.

In particular, these stakeholders cited  concerns related to costs associated with FEHBP enrollees who are  Medicare-eligible but who do not enroll in Medicare, and the formula that  determines the government\u2019s contributions to enrollee premiums.  According to these stakeholders, this creates unfair competitive  advantages for the nationwide plans and BCBSA in particular.

For  example, 1 stakeholder said that an increase in plan types offered could  lead to a subsequent increase in OPM\u2019s administrative costs. In addition,  several of these stakeholders said that adding more plans to FEHBP  would exacerbate an existing problem of choice overload for enrollees.  One of the stakeholders said that FEHBP enrollees are already confused  by the number of available plan offerings, and that the current information  provided to enrollees does not allow for easy comparison of their choices.  They noted that additional expansion of offerings will only complicate  enrollees\u2019 plan analysis.", "Consistent with these concerns, studies that we reviewed related to  consumer choice and decision-making processes in health insurance  markets suggest that adding additional plans may not always yield  positive effects or improve competition. For example, a 2016 report by the  RAND Corporation found that health insurance consumers are unlikely to  change plans, even as better choices become available. Additionally, a  2009 study examining the Swiss health insurance market similarly found  that as the number of choices offered to individuals grows their  willingness to switch plans declines. The study found persistently low  rates of plan switching despite high variation in premiums between plans,  and found that more choice inhibited plan switching. It concluded that  having a large number of plans to choose from likely reduces the  effectiveness of consumer decision making, and that simplifying health  plan decision making by reducing the number of choices might result in  more price competition among insurers, and benefit consumers.", "Additionally, 6 of the 10 stakeholders we interviewed and who  commented on OPM\u2019s contracting authority said that there would  potentially be negative effects if OPM were to use the expanded authority  to add regional PPO plans to FEHBP. For example, 5 of these 6  stakeholders said there could be instability and higher premiums in  FEHBP if new regional PPO plans were able to \u201ccherry pick\u201d low cost  areas in which to participate. This was of particular concern to 1 of the 2  stakeholders we spoke to who offer nationwide plans. Because they offer  the same premiums nationally, they said the lower-cost areas of the  country help subsidize the premiums of the higher-cost areas. If these  nationwide plans lost customers in lower-cost areas to regional PPO  plans, then their premiums would likely rise. These 2 stakeholders and a  third said, therefore, that adding regional PPO plans could result in  nationwide carriers discontinuing their coverage due to their inability to  compete with regional plans. According to 1 stakeholder that offers a  nationwide FFS plan, if the nationwide carriers dropped out of the  program, plan offerings would be significantly reduced in certain areas of  the country and some areas could potentially be left with no offerings at  all. Additionally, in 2014 and 2015, six nationwide FEHBP carriers,  including the two we interviewed, sent letters to Congress expressing  their opposition to legislation that would add new plan types in FEHBP. In  the letters, they cited negative effects such as program destabilization,  increased premiums, and fewer consumer choices\u2014all of which were  specifically tied to the proposal to add regional PPO plans to FEHBP.", "Two of the 10 stakeholders we interviewed and who commented on  OPM\u2019s contracting authority, however, said that adding regional PPO  plans to FEHBP would have positive effects. For example, 1 of these  stakeholders that offers HMO plans and referred to FEHBP\u2019s plan type  labels as antiquated noted that this would enable them to promote their  existing FEHBP products\u2014currently categorized as HMO plans\u2014more  appropriately as regional PPO plans. This stakeholder said the current  categorization causes enrollees to erroneously believe their plans are  more restrictive than the plans listed as nationwide FFS plans.", "When we shared these stakeholder concerns about expanding OPM\u2019s  contracting authority with OPM officials, they told us that the agency has  existing strategies and is working towards implementing additional ones,  which officials said should allow it to address many of these concerns.  For example, OPM officials said in January 2017 that the agency was in  the process of building models that would allow it to simulate the impact  that adding new plan types would have on FEHBP, but that the agency is  still years away from being able to make such assessments. The officials  said that the agency would only seek to introduce new plan types that it  determines to be in the best interests of FEHBP enrollees and the federal  government. With regards to enrollee confusion over the number of plan  choices, the OPM officials said that the agency is improving the tools  enrollees can use to learn about the available plans. For open season in  2016, the agency released what it considers to be a new and improved  Plan Comparison Tool on its website that enables enrollees to gain more  knowledge about their health plan options before making a selection.  According to the officials, some of the improved functions of the tool  include more details about the plan benefits and services, clearer  definitions of the health insurance terms, and easier ability to compare the  plans. Officials also told us that they expect to make more improvements  to the tool in future years based on feedback from the FEHBP enrollees  who use it. OPM officials said the agency would continue existing plan  negotiation strategies that, among other things, would prevent plans from  \u201ccherry picking\u201d\u2014that is, offering products in only the most profitable  service areas\u2014by ensuring that new carriers provide services in  contiguous regions that include both low- and high-cost areas.  Additionally, related to the concern that nationwide plans might withdraw  from the program if regional PPO plans were introduced, OPM officials  noted that if, for example, BCBSA were to cancel its nationwide plan  options, another carrier might step up to gain the service benefit plan  designation and provide nationwide service."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Estimates of the Financial Effects of Expanding OPM\u2019s Contracting Authority Differed on Whether Costs Will Increase or Decrease", "paragraphs": ["We identified three significantly differing estimates of the financial effects  on the federal budget that expanding OPM\u2019s FEHBP contracting authority  would have. However, these estimates are based on different  assumptions about a variety of factors such as premium changes,  administrative costs, and enrollment, and only limited information was  available about the methodologies used for each set of estimates. It is  also important to note that the assumptions used in developing these  estimates are subject to professional judgment and have inherent  uncertainty regarding whether the assumed scenarios will be realized.  The three estimates include:", "The President\u2019s Budget for fiscal year 2017 estimated that expanding  FEHBP to a greater variety of plan types would save $88 million from  2017 through 2026. According to information provided by OPM, the  estimate considered the effect of a broad expansion of OPM\u2019s  authority to add new plan types, and OPM did not indicate whether  the agency specifically considered the effect of adding regional PPOs  to FEHBP when developing this estimate. OPM officials told us that  these savings were based on a number of assumptions, including an  estimate of the number of enrollees that will migrate to new plan types  based on previous FEHBP experience and projecting a medical loss  ratio of 90 percent for the new plan types added to FEHBP.  However, in follow-up with the agency, OPM officials were not able to  provide us with more detailed information about how these savings  were calculated. The Congressional Budget Office, in its analysis of  the budget proposal, estimated a range from $50 million in savings to  $50 million in costs over the 10-year period.", "A 2014 study from the Center for Health and Economy that examined  the effects of introducing regional PPOs to FEHBP across three  scenarios estimated cost savings ranging from $1.2 to $2.1 billion  over 7 years (2015 to 2021). The study provided limited information  about the data, assumptions, and methodology the center used to  develop its estimates. The study did explain that the center modeled  the projected impact on enrollment, average premiums, and the  federal budget of adding regional PPOs to FEHBP using three  different sets of assumptions about how expensive the newly  introduced regional PPO plans would be. Under each scenario, the  center estimated shifts over time in enrollment from existing FEHBP  plan designs (FFS, HMO, CDHP, and HDHP) to the new PPO plans\u2014 and assumed that these new plans would achieve 10 percent of the  market share throughout the analysis period. The study also projected  decreases in average FEHBP premiums and a corresponding  reduction in total government contributions in each scenario.", "A December 2013 study conducted by Avalere Health at BCBSA\u2019s  request specifically examined the effect of adding regional PPOs into  FEHBP and estimated an increase in spending of $7.8 billion over 10  years (2014 to 2023). In developing its estimates, the study noted that it  assumed that the BCBSA national plans dissolve and would break into  regional plans in response to new regional plan competition. The study  stated that the $7.8 billion in increased costs was based on an  assumption that both regional PPOs and BCBSA regional plans would  have higher administrative costs as compared to BCBSA\u2019s national plans.  The study estimated that these costs would be offset slightly by an initial  anticipated decrease in premiums resulting from new plans introducing  competition into these regions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this product to OPM for comment.

In particular, stakeholders cited concerns related to:  Medicare-eligible enrollees, the government contribution formula for  FEHBP premiums, and FEHBP\u2019s plan performance assessment system.", "Medicare-eligible enrollees. Six of the 11 stakeholders we interviewed  suggested that problems associated with Medicare-eligible enrollees  negatively affect FEHBP premiums, and 5 of the 6 noted these problems  create an unfair competitive advantage for the nationwide FEHBP plans.  These stakeholders suggested that because certain older, Medicare- eligible FEHBP enrollees tend to incur higher health care costs, they drive  up premiums. Some stakeholders noted that plans\u2014in particular, health  maintenance organizations (HMOs) that offer service in areas with higher  concentrations of older enrollees\u2014experience challenges keeping  premium rates competitive with the nationwide plans like those offered by  the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association (BCBSA). Additionally, 3  stakeholders we interviewed that offer HMO plans pointed specifically to  costly retirees who opt not to enroll in in Medicare coverage of outpatient  services, known as Part B, making it difficult for them to compete. FEHBP  retirees eligible to enroll in Medicare are not required to do so, and some  maintain only their FEHBP coverage instead. While there is no penalty for choosing not to enroll in Medicare, retirees who later decide to enroll  in Part B must pay a penalty. For retirees in FEHBP who choose not to  enroll in Medicare, their FEHBP plan remains the primary payer and they  continue to receive the same level of coverage through that plan as they  did prior to becoming eligible for Medicare. Two stakeholders said that  charging the same rates to the retiree population without Part B and the  active employee population\u2014a scenario that occurs in FEHBP\u2014is not  typical of the private, commercial insurance market.", "In a recent publication, one of the stakeholders we interviewed reported  that these types of issues have been a problem for FEHBP since its  inception, and that it is therefore in the interest of every enrollee to join  plans with the lowest proportion of high-cost retirees. The stakeholder  noted that this distorts plan selection and alters results, noting that while  the Kaiser plans on the West Coast do an outstanding job of keeping  costs low for enrollees, they have a disproportionate number of retirees  who correctly understand that they do not need to enroll in Medicare.  According to the stakeholder, this puts Kaiser at a disadvantage since it  has to cover the age-related costs of these enrollees.", "Stakeholders we interviewed offered a number of potential solutions for  OPM to address these challenges. For example, two stakeholders  suggested that OPM could introduce some form of risk adjustment into  FEHBP to assist plans that have a disproportionate number of Medicare- eligible enrollees. Risk adjustment provides a way to correct for  imbalances that occur when some carriers attract a larger share of  enrollees at low risk for expensive claims and other carriers attract a  larger share of enrollees at high risk for expensive claims. One of the two  stakeholders suggested that FEHBP could introduce a budget-neutral risk  adjustment program that adjusts the amount of a plan\u2019s premium that is  paid by the government based on a plan\u2019s ratio of age-65 retirees with  Medicare (Parts A, B, or both) to those without. The stakeholder said that  this would greatly improve plan competition over time.", "OPM officials agreed with stakeholders that providing nationwide service  is an advantage for carriers like BCBSA in high cost areas, but noted that  it is a disadvantage in low cost areas, and said that, similarly, a lack of  risk adjustment in the program works both in favor of and against BCBSA  and HMOs. OPM officials said, for example, that the BCBSA Standard  option would likely benefit from risk adjustment, while the BCBSA Basic  option would likely be negatively impacted. OPM officials also said that  risk adjustment could be a way for the agency to compensate plans that  have enrollees with higher than average risk and to improve competition  by discouraging plans from avoiding those higher risk enrollees. However,  officials noted that risk adjustment would require the agency to have  reliable claims-level data from each of the plans, which the agency does  not have. In January 2017, OPM officials said that the agency is in the  process of collecting claims data from FEHBP carriers and expects to  have a sufficiently reliable data set by July 2018. OPM officials also noted  that before implementing any form of risk adjustment in FEHBP they  would have to use that data to determine the effects on the program, and  they would also need to determine whether doing so would require any  legislative changes.", "Some stakeholders we interviewed also suggested retirees could be  incentivized to enroll in Medicare Part B (for example, by waiving the  Medicare Part B late enrollment fee for FEHBP retirees, or by having  FEHBP plans subsidize Part B premiums), and two stakeholders went as  far as suggesting that Medicare enrollment should be required for those  eligible. OPM officials said that they already encourage enrollment in  Medicare Part B; in particular, they noted that in their annual call letters  they have encouraged carriers to offer benefits in their plans that  incentivize Medicare enrollment for eligible FEHBP enrollees. However,  OPM officials said that they are open to pursuing additional approaches  that would encourage FEHBP retirees to fully participate in Medicare  coverage.", "The government contribution formula for FEHBP premiums. Five of  the 11 stakeholders we interviewed suggested that the government  contribution formula for FEHBP premiums negatively impacts program  competition. The FEHBP statute establishes the amount the government  contributes towards the costs of FEHBP plan premiums. By statute, the  government pays an amount equal to 72 percent of the weighted average  premium across all FEHBP plans, but no more than 75 percent of any  particular plan\u2019s premium. Enrollees generally pay the remaining  premium. As such, enrollee contributions will generally be 25 percent for  lower-premium plans and can be higher than 28 percent if their plan\u2019s  premiums are significantly higher than the weighted average FEHBP  plan.", "Some stakeholders we interviewed noted that BCBSA has an advantage  under the contribution formula, and that the existing formula does not  incentivize enrollees to choose low cost plans. Two stakeholders noted  that BCBSA\u2019s large program market share\u201466 percent of total program  enrollment in 2015\u2014allows it significant influence over the government  contribution amount. Therefore, several stakeholders suggested that  BCBSA\u2019s enrollees end up paying closer to the minimum of 25 to 28  percent of their premium\u2019s costs. Conversely, other plans\u2014particularly  HMOs operating in high cost areas\u2014may have premiums that are higher  than BCBSA\u2019s and the weighted program average, resulting in their  enrollees having to pay considerably more than 28 percent of their total  premium\u2019s costs. Two stakeholders said that, as a result, carriers may  exit the program once their premiums exceed the weighted program  average. Additionally, two stakeholders we interviewed suggested that  the formula does not incentivize enrollees to choose lower cost plans  because the maximum government contribution amount is 75 percent\u2014 regardless of whether the plan\u2019s premiums are less than the weighted  FEHBP average. See table 5 for examples of how the government  contribution formula affects the share of premiums that enrollees pay.", "Some stakeholders we interviewed proposed solutions to the concerns  they identified with the government contribution formula. For example,  two stakeholders suggested that the formula be changed so that plans  that cost less than 72 percent of the weighted average would be covered  either in full or to a greater extent by the government. They noted that this  would incentivize enrollees to choose lower cost plan options and would  strengthen the competitiveness of lower-cost plans\u2014particularly as  compared to the BCBSA options. One stakeholder also suggested that  the government contribution formula could be varied by metropolitan  regions (i.e., vary government and enrollee premium contributions based  on regional health care costs), which they suggested would lead to more  carriers introducing more plan offerings overall. While the government  contribution formula is set in statute, OPM officials said that they are open  to pursuing changes that would encourage FEHBP enrollees to select the  health plans that meet their current and expected health care needs at  affordable costs.", "FEHBP plan performance assessment system. Five of the 11  stakeholders we interviewed cited concerns with OPM\u2019s system for  assessing FEHBP plan performance, with 2 noting that it discourages  competition and participation in FEHBP. OPM announced a new  methodology for assessing plan performance in a letter to carriers in  2015, noting that the agency would use a discrete set of quantifiable  measures to examine aspects of contract performance and link this  performance assessment to the profit plans receive. OPM reported in  the letter that it implemented performance assessment to move away  from paying for procedures or services and towards paying for value and  prevention of disease. It also noted that the system was intended to  create a more objective performance standard and provide more  transparency for enrollees. Stakeholders we interviewed, however, were  particularly critical of the way in which community-rated plans are  assessed in this new system, noting that plans are penalized rather than  rewarded. Regulations specify a process by which OPM may withhold a  portion of payments to a community-rated carrier based on plan  performance thereby reducing the carrier\u2019s profits.  Two of these  stakeholders said that the only way for a plan to not receive a financial  penalty is to get a perfect score on the assessment and said that it is  impossible to receive such a score. Therefore, one stakeholder noted that  the system is extremely discouraging to carriers, particularly to new  carriers considering joining FEHBP. Additionally, two stakeholders said  that the measures used in the assessment\u2014Healthcare Effectiveness  Data and Information Set (HEDIS) and Consumer Assessment of  Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) measures\u2014favor certain  types of HMOs. For example, one stakeholder noted that some carriers  can have problems meeting the HEDIS measure for breast cancer  screening rates, because they have to get patients to go to a separate  mammography center while carriers that are part of more integrated  health systems can offer mammograms in-house.", "With regard to how the plan performance assessment system could be  improved, stakeholders we interviewed suggested that OPM should  switch to a reward or incentive-based system for community-rated  carriers. Several stakeholders suggested that OPM could implement a  system similar to the Medicare Advantage star ratings system. In  December 2016, OPM officials told us that they were listening to  community-rated plans\u2019 concerns regarding the performance assessment  penalty and would consider adjustments to address these concerns. Then  in March 2017, in response to some of these concerns, OPM issued a  letter to FEHBP carriers proposing an update to the assessment of  community-rated plans that would allow carriers with high-performing  plans to avoid any financial penalties. Regarding the concern about the  use of HEDIS and CAHPS measures, OPM officials said that these  measures are well-established and commonly required by other  commercial and government payers, such as Medicare Advantage.  Nonetheless, OPM officials said that the plan performance system will  continuously be improved through the introduction of new measures and  the retirement of measures on which all FEHBP plans have achieved  satisfactory performance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact:", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, William Hadley (Assistant  Director), Kristi Peterson (Assistant Director), Christina Ritchie (Analyst in  Charge), Leonard Brown, William Garrard, Daniel Ries, and Said  Sariolghalam made key contributions to this report.
