In both completed exchanges, GSA used the value of federal properties it determined were underutilized to acquire new parking garages. The recipients of the federal properties told us that the exchanges took longer than expected (about 3 years for one of the exchanges and 5 years for the other). In response, GSA noted its lack of experience with swap-construct exchanges at the time.", "Since 2012, GSA has proposed six swap-construct exchanges. After reviewing responses to its solicitations, GSA is actively pursuing three, including a potential exchange of the existing Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) headquarters for construction of a new FBI headquarters building. Respondents to the three solicitations that GSA is not actively pursuing noted concerns, including the amount of investment needed in the federal properties and the lack of detail regarding GSA's construction needs in an exchange. Swap-construct can result in an exchange of equally valued assets or services or can result in the government or a property recipient paying for a difference in value.", "The swap-construct approach can help GSA address the challenges of disposing of unneeded property and modernizing or replacing federal buildings, but various factors could affect future use of the approach. For example, swap-construct can require developers to spend large sums on GSA's construction needs before receiving title to the federal property used in the exchanges. GSA's solicitations have not always specified these construction needs. Consequently, developers may be unable to provide meaningful input, and GSA could miss swap-construct opportunities. Further, the viability of swap-construct exchanges may be affected by specific market factors, such as the availability of alternative properties. However, GSA lacks criteria to help determine if the agency should solicit interest in a swap-construct exchange. As a result, GSA could miss opportunities to use swap-construct or select properties and construction projects better suited to traditional disposal and funding processes. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and GAO guidance emphasize the importance of criteria in making capital-planning decisions and providing clarity on construction needs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that GSA (1) include, to the extent possible, details on what GSA is seeking in exchange for federal property in these solicitations and (2) develop criteria for determining when to solicit market interest in swap-construct exchanges.

GSA also faces challenges replacing and maintaining aging  federal properties due to the current fiscal environment of shrinking  budgets throughout the federal government. To help address these  challenges, GSA has proposed expanding its use of \u201cswap-construct\u201d  exchanges, whereby GSA receives either a constructed asset, such as a  new building, or construction services, such as renovation work on an  existing federal building, from a nonfederal entity in return for title to  different federally owned property.

To further  understand these swap-construct exchanges, we conducted site visits to  the locations of the exchanges (Atlanta, GA, and San Antonio, TX),  examined the properties, and interviewed GSA and nonfederal  participants in the exchanges. To determine the status of GSA\u2019s proposed  swap-construct exchanges, we identified and reviewed the six exchanges  proposed by GSA (two in Washington, D.C., and one each in Miami, FL;  Los Angeles, CA; Baltimore, MD, and Lakewood, CO) using GSA  documentation, including solicitations for market interest and ideas for  addressing agency needs, called requests for information (RFI), and  interviews with GSA officials. We visited three of the properties (two in  Washington, D.C., and one in Baltimore, MD), which we selected based  on proximity to GAO, number of RFI responses, and the stage at which  the property was in GSA\u2019s swap-construct process. To understand GSA\u2019s  authority to complete swap-construct exchanges, we reviewed relevant  statutes and related GSA guidance. To further understand these  proposed exchanges, we reviewed responses to the RFIs that GSA  issued and conducted interviews with four of the seven respondents to  two of the three proposed exchanges that GSA was no longer pursuing to  further understand their experience with the proposals. We selected the  sample of respondents to include a variety of respondents, including a  developer, a firm that advises developers, a university, and a company  that provides property management services to the government. To  understand the possible exchange in Lakewood, CO, we analyzed GSA  documents, including agency property descriptions and tentative plans for  the swap-construct exchange, and interviewed GSA officials and a local  government official involved in the negotiations with GSA. To identify the  potential benefits of swap-construct exchanges and factors that can  influence their future use, we evaluated GSA\u2019s approach to identifying  potentially successful swap-construct exchanges to propose for market  interest against guidance from the Office of Management and Budget  (OMB) and GAO\u2019s Executive Guide on leading practices in capital  decision-making, and interviewed GSA officials, nonfederal participants  in the two completed exchanges, affected stakeholders, and  representatives of nongovernmental organizations familiar with GSA\u2019s  real property projects.

Ultimately, the property may be  disposed of by a negotiated sale for public use or public sale based on  GSA\u2019s determination of the property\u2019s highest and best use.", "GSA collects rent from tenant agencies, which is deposited in the Federal  Buildings Fund (FBF) and serves as GSA\u2019s primary source of funding for  operating and capital costs associated with federal real property.  Congress exercises control over the FBF through the appropriations  process, which designates how much of the fund can be obligated for  new construction and maintenance each fiscal year. According to GSA,  capital funding has not kept pace with GSA\u2019s need to replace and  modernize buildings in its federal real property portfolio, which includes  about 1,500 buildings. We have recently found that GSA and other  federal agencies have pursued alternative approaches to address  challenges with funding federal real property projects. One alternative  approach is a swap-construct exchange between the federal government  and a nonfederal entity, such as a private developer. GSA has several  authorities to exchange federal property for constructed assets and, in  2005, was specifically authorized to exchange federal property for  construction services.", "Swap-construct exchanges can be proposed by a nonfederal entity, such  as a private developer or local government, or by GSA. GSA\u2019s process for  proposing and conducting a swap-construct exchange includes either  proposing a swap-construct exchange to a nonfederal entity that has  expressed an interest in acquiring a specific federal property or soliciting  market interest through an initial proposal, often an RFI, followed by more  detailed proposals. These more detailed proposals include requests for  qualifications (RFQ) to identify qualified developers and requests for  proposals (RFP). In a swap-construct exchange, the federal government  transfers the title of the federal property to a developer or other property  recipient after receiving a constructed asset or the completion of  construction services at a different location. Swap-construct exchanges  can involve swapping property and constructed assets or construction  services that are of equal value or can include cash to compensate for a  difference in value between the federal property and the asset or services  to be received by the government. According to GSA, highest priority is  assigned to swap-construct exchanges that involve exchanges of federal  property of equal or greater value than the asset or services provided by  the property recipient because these scenarios do not require  appropriation of federal funding. Figure 1 describes GSA\u2019s decision- making process for proposing swap-construct exchanges and the three  scenarios that can result from an agreement for a swap-construct  exchange.", "According to GSA, once the agency has decided to pursue an exchange  for a newly constructed asset or services, it follows GSA\u2019s 1997 guidance  for real property exchanges of non-excess property. The guidance lays  out a number of steps, including: obtaining a property appraisal; using, if possible, one appraiser for all properties involved in an analysis and documentation of all benefits and costs of the exchange  to show why the exchange is in the best interest of the government.", "In November 2013, the GSA Inspector General issued a memo noting  that GSA\u2019s 1997 guidance is not specifically applicable to exchanges of  real property for services.

E. Butt Store Property Company No. One  (HEBSPC)\u2014that were interested in acquiring specific federal properties in  Atlanta, GA and San Antonio, TX, respectively. A now-retired  representative of Emory University Hospital Midtown and representatives  of HEBSPC told us that they were satisfied with the end result of the  exchanges, but added that there were challenges in the process that may  affect future swap-construct exchanges. Specifically, the representatives  told us that the exchanges took longer than anticipated, about 3 years in  Atlanta and over 5 years in San Antonio, and that, consequently, less  motivated parties may avoid or withdraw from future exchanges. GSA  officials told us that both exchanges were a good value for the  government because the properties and services received by the  government were of equal or greater value than the federal properties  disposed of in the exchanges. GSA officials added that the exchanges  were a good value for the government because both of the assets  disposed of were underutilized. However, these officials noted their lack  of experience with swap-construct exchanges at the time.", "Atlanta Swap-Construct\u2014In 2001, GSA exchanged a federal parking  garage (the Summit Garage) in Atlanta with 1,829 spaces on a 1.53-acre  parcel with Emory University Hospital Midtown for a newly constructed  parking garage (the Pine Street Garage) with 1,150 spaces on .92 acres  (see fig. 2). GSA also received a commitment from the hospital to lease  and manage the operations and maintenance of the Pine Street Garage  for 16 years and to lease spaces in it to federal employees. According to  GSA, at the time of the exchange, the Summit Garage was underutilized  because it included more parking spaces than GSA needed. Although  GSA utilized some of the extra spaces through a lease agreement with  the hospital, which is located nearby, the garage was, GSA added, in  deteriorating condition and was not it compliance with the Americans with  Disabilities Act (ADA). According to GSA, the swap-construct exchange  was in the best interest of the government because GSA received a new  ADA-compliant garage with a direct covered connection to both the  Peachtree Summit Federal building and a Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid  Transit Authority (MARTA) subway station in exchange for a garage that  was underutilized and in deteriorating condition. GSA added that the  exchange was beneficial to the government because it included the  hospital\u2019s commitment to lease spaces not needed by the government for  16 years, with proceeds deposited into the FBF, and to cover operations  and maintenance work typically covered by GSA.", "According to the now-retired representative of Emory University Hospital  Midtown who was involved with the swap-construct exchange, the  acquisition of the Summit Garage was crucial to accommodating a  hospital renovation and expansion project. However, the hospital was  aware that GSA needed parking spaces to accommodate federal tenants  in the Peachtree Summit Federal Building, so it proposed the swap- construct approach to GSA. The representative added that, although the  hospital was pleased with the end result of the transaction, the exchange  took about 3 years to complete, a time that was longer than anticipated  for the hospital and that may lead less motivated parties to avoid or  withdraw from future exchanges. GSA officials noted that the agency had  limited experience with this type of exchange, which may have  contributed to the length of time required to complete it. The  representative added that the exchange was also complicated in that the  appraised value of the new garage and any additional services had to be  equal to the appraised value of the Summit Garage. The now-retired  representative added that to address concern that the new and smaller  garage might appraise for less than the Summit Garage, the hospital  agreed with GSA to continue leasing spaces in the new garage and cover  operations and maintenance costs. As a result, the two parts of the  exchange\u2014the garages and lease agreements\u2014were equally appraised  at $6.6 million. According to GSA, although the hospital\u2019s lease in the new  garage expires in 2017, the size of the garage allows the agency to meet  continued demand for federal parking in the vicinity of the Peachtree  Summit Federal Building.", "San Antonio Swap-Construct\u2014In 2012, GSA exchanged an  approximately 5-acre federal property (the Federal Arsenal site) in San  Antonio, TX, with HEBSPC for construction of a parking garage on  existing federal land for the recently renovated Hipolito F. Garcia Federal  Building and U.S. Courthouse (see fig. 3). According to GSA, at the time  of the exchange, the Federal Arsenal site was an underutilized asset  because of historical covenants limiting the ability to redevelop the land  and its buildings and because it was located on the periphery of the city  away from other federal assets. Although the property was partly utilized  by GSA\u2019s Fleet Management and through a lease agreement with HEB  Grocery Company (HEB) for parking spaces, GSA officials told us that  there was no anticipated long-term government need for it. According to  GSA officials, the swap-construct exchange was in the best interests of  the federal government because the government received a new federal  parking garage for the Hipolito F. Garcia Federal Building and U.S.  Courthouse in exchange for a property that was underutilized.", "HEBSPC representatives told us that the company was interested in  acquiring the Federal Arsenal site to accommodate existing space needs  and potential expansion of HEB\u2019s corporate headquarters, near the site  and expressed this interest to GSA. The representatives added that  although the historic covenants on the property presented some potential  challenges, the company had prior experience renovating and utilizing  historic properties on HEB\u2019s headquarters property. The representatives  also told us that the company had a long-standing interest in acquiring the  Federal Arsenal site prior to 2005, but during that time, the property could  not be sold because it was being partly used by GSA\u2019s Fleet  Management. In 2005, however, GSA told HEBSPC about the need for  an additional parking for the Hipolito Garcia Federal Building and U.S.", "Courthouse and, subsequently, proposed the swap-construct exchange to  HEBSPC, which had experience building parking garages. An official from  one of the tenant agencies in the federal building and courthouse told us  that the increased availability of parking with the new garage (150 new  spaces compared with 35 existing spaces) was one of the reasons the  agency decided to locate in the building. GSA officials told us that the  availability of the new parking spaces is critical to further attracting  tenants to the building, which is not fully occupied.", "HEBSPC representatives told us the company was pleased with the  transaction and GSA\u2019s management of the transaction. However, they  added that they would have preferred it to have been completed quicker  than the 5-plus years between the proposal and exchange of properties,  and noted that the time it took to complete the transaction may lead less  motivated parties to avoid or withdraw from such exchanges. According to  GSA officials, the transaction took longer than anticipated because GSA  did not have significant experience to use as a basis for completing the  transaction and because of fluctuations in real estate values due to the  economic recession that required additional property appraisals to be  completed. After four property appraisals between 2007 and 2009, GSA  and HEBSPC ultimately valued the Federal Arsenal site at $5.6 million.

After reviewing responses to these six proposals,  GSA is actively pursuing three, including: (1) a potential exchange of  undeveloped federal land in Denver with the City of Lakewood for  construction services at the Denver Federal Center; (2) a potential  exchange of the existing FBI headquarters building for a new FBI  headquarters building; and (3) a potential exchange of two federal  buildings in the Federal Triangle South area of Washington, D.C., for  construction services to accommodate federal workers elsewhere in the  city. According to GSA officials, although the agency has had authority to  exchange property for construction services since fiscal year 2005 and  had authority to exchange property for newly constructed assets prior to  that, until recently there has been limited agency interest using non- traditional property disposal and acquisition approaches, such as swap- construct exchanges. The officials added that since 2012 the agency has  more widely pursued swap-construct exchanges to address challenges  such as a rising number of agency needs and limited budgetary  resources. According to GSA officials, although the projects could involve  exchanges of equal value, similar to the Atlanta and San Antonio  exchanges, they could result in the government either receiving a  payment or paying to cover any difference in value between the property  to be exchanged and its construction projects.", "GSA decided to propose a swap-construct exchange to the City of  Lakewood because the city had previously expressed interest in the  undeveloped federal land, totaling about 60 acres, and because GSA had  need for construction services at the nearby Denver Federal Center. A  representative of the City of Lakewood told us that the city was supportive  of the swap-construct approach because the services provided to GSA  would support employment for the local population, whereas if the city  were to purchase the property through a sale, the proceeds would not  necessarily be spent locally. GSA told us that negotiations for a possible  swap-construct exchange are ongoing.", "We found that respondents expressed openness or interest in the swap- construct approach regarding four of the five exchanges for which GSA  solicited market interest, but generally this openness or interest was  limited to the proposed consolidation of the FBI\u2019s headquarters operations  into a new location in exchange for the existing FBI headquarters building  and land. Several responses to GSA\u2019s RFIs did not address swap- construct and instead provided other information, such as the credentials  of a particular developer and statements that GSA should ensure that  affordable housing is included in the redevelopment of federal properties  to be exchanged.

For the proposed swap-construct exchange involving  Federal Triangle South properties, GSA narrowed the scope of its  proposed exchange after reviewing responses to its RFI. Specifically, in  April 2014, the agency issued an RFQ to identify qualified developers for  a potential exchange involving two of the five properties included in the  RFI\u2014the Cotton Annex and the GSA Regional Office Building\u2014for  renovations to GSA\u2019s headquarters building and construction services to  support the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s headquarters  consolidation in Washington, D.C.", "GSA officials told us that there was little or no market interest in potential  swap-construct exchanges in Baltimore, MD (the Metro West building)  and Miami, FL (the David W.

In addition, one of the potential projects\u2014the  consolidation of the FBI headquarters operations into a new location\u2014 benefits from a well defined scope with GSA\u2019s expectations for the  construction priority being sought by the agency in exchange for the  federal property considered for exchange in the proposal\u2014the J.

Specifically, GSA officials  noted that swap-construct exchanges allow GSA to immediately apply the  value of a federal property to be used in the exchange to construction  needs, rather than wait for funds to be made available from the FBF. GSA  officials and a representative of a nongovernmental organization familiar  with GSA\u2019s real property projects added that the exchanges can be  attractive for GSA because the agency can get construction projects  accomplished without having to request full upfront funding for them from  Congress. In addition, because swap-construct exchanges require  developers or other property recipients to address GSA\u2019s construction  projects prior to the transfer of the title to the exchange property, federal  agencies can continue to occupy the federal property during the  construction process, eliminating the need for agencies to lease or  acquire other space to occupy during the construction process. GSA  officials also told us that swap-construct exchanges can help advance a  government-wide goal to consolidate agencies out of leased space into  federally owned space. For example, according to GSA, about half of the  FBI\u2019s headquarters staff are located in the existing headquarters building  and the potential swap-construct exchange for a new FBI headquarters  could allow the agency to consolidate into one federally owned building.", "The retired Emory University Hospital Midtown representative and  HEBSPC representatives added that swap-construct exchanges can help  the private sector acquire federal property that it otherwise may not be  able to acquire.", "While swap-construct can facilitate GSA\u2019s construction needs, it could  come at a greater cost to some stakeholders than the traditional disposal  approach. Specifically, because federal properties disposed of through  swap-construct are not declared excess or surplus (often because they  are still in use by federal tenants when the swap-construct is proposed  and during the exchange process), they do not go through the traditional  disposal process. Thus, the swap-construct approach may limit the  participation of nonfederal entities that would have been interested in  acquiring the properties through public benefit conveyance or other  means. For example, in a typical property disposal, eligible public and  nonprofit entities, such as institutions of higher education or homeless  organizations, can receive the federal property at up to a 100 percent  discount of fair market value when it is used for a variety of qualified  purposes, such as education and assistance for the homeless. Two  institutions of higher education that responded to GSA\u2019s solicitations for a  swap-construct exchange expressed a preference for GSA to use the  traditional disposal process because the universities could then obtain it  by public benefit conveyance.

For  example, the RFIs for the potential Dyer Courthouse and Metro West  swap-construct exchanges did not specify what GSA was seeking as part  of an exchange. Two respondents to the Metro West RFI told us that  additional details regarding what GSA expects in return for the property  would be key to future consideration of a swap-construct exchange.

One of the  four respondents to the Spring Street Courthouse RFI added that  although GSA specified a need for a new building in exchange for the  Spring Street Courthouse, it was not clear that the new building was a  GSA priority.

Three of the four RFI respondents and one of the two  nongovernmental organizations we spoke to noted that the federal  property to be exchanged should have high redevelopment potential to  offset the developers\u2019 risk of delayed access to the property until  providing GSA with its needed asset or construction services. Specifically,  a developer may have to expend significant time and money addressing  GSA\u2019s needs for a new building or renovating an existing federal building  before receiving, redeveloping, and generating revenue from the  swapped federal property. GSA officials told us that it might be possible to  negotiate some early rights of access to the federal property before the  transfer of the property title to conduct activities such as site preparation  and demolition work, but at a developer\u2019s risk. According to  representatives of the two nongovernmental organizations we spoke to,  GSA should also consider local market conditions in deciding if a property  is suitable for swap-construct because developers can often purchase or  lease similar properties they need from the private sector and quickly  access them for redevelopment. For example, a representative of a firm  that advises developers noted that the FBI headquarters building is  located in an area of Washington, D.C., with high potential for profitable  redevelopment and that there are few other similar properties available to  developers. In contrast, a Metro West RFI respondent and a Spring Street  Courthouse RFI respondent expressed concern that the federal  properties included in those exchanges, in Baltimore and Los Angeles,  respectively, may not have sufficient redevelopment potential to offset the  risks associated with delayed transfer of title under a swap-construct  approach.", "Potential complications with exchanging property in one region for a  constructed asset or construction services in another region may also  limit the applicability of swap-construct exchanges. Specifically, GSA  officials told us that the pool of potential bidders is smaller and community  and political opposition can be higher when removing federal assets from  one region for a constructed asset or construction services in another. In  addition, the officials said project management can be more difficult for  GSA when an exchange is executed across different regions.  Consequently, the officials told us they try to locate the desired  constructed asset or construction services in the same region as the  federal property to be exchanged. GSA officials added that many  underutilized federal properties are not suitable for swap-construct  because they are in locations where GSA has limited needs for new  assets or construction services or because the federal properties are not  sufficiently desirable or would require too much investment from a  developer.", "A representative of the firm that advises developers added that while the  swap-construct approach gives GSA greater control over the proceeds  from a property disposal, the federal government may get a better deal for  a new asset or construction services and potentially larger proceeds for  the disposed federal property if it were to use traditional acquisition and  disposal methods. In particular, the representative noted that developers  may be willing to pay more for federal property through a sale because  the developers could gain immediate access to the property for  redevelopment purposes. Similarly, the representative told us that GSA  may get a better deal on a new asset or construction services it if were to  pursue them through a traditional acquisition process because it would  invite more developer competition into the process, unlike in a swap- construct approach where a developer would also need to be willing to  receive federal property as consideration.", "While GSA has guidance for determining if it should continue to pursue  an exchange that has already been proposed, it does not have criteria to  help determine when the agency should solicit interest in a swap- construct exchange. According to GSA officials, the agency considers  possible swap-construct exchanges on a case-by-case basis during its  annual review of its entire federal real property portfolio, but it lacks  guidance on how that case-by-case analysis should be conducted. GSA  officials added that because the agency only recently started using the  swap-construct approach, it does not have screening criteria for  determining when a swap-construct exchange should be proposed.  Moreover, we found that some proposed swap-construct exchanges have  been driven by GSA\u2019s need to dispose of specific federal properties and  that, as previously discussed, GSA has not given the same amount of  consideration to construction projects to include in its proposed  exchanges. For example, in the Metro West and Dyer Courthouse swap- construct proposals, GSA identified federal properties to be exchanged,  but little or no information on construction projects it needed in a potential  exchange.", "GSA has proposed swap-construct exchanges since 2012 to a mixed  reception, as previously noted, with little or no interest in exchanges  involving the Dyer Courthouse in Miami, the Spring Street Courthouse in  Los Angeles, and the Metro West building Baltimore, and high level  interest in an exchange only for the FBI headquarters consolidation  project. Both OMB and GAO guidance emphasize the importance of  using criteria to make capital-planning decisions. By not using screening  criteria to identify potentially successful swap-construct exchanges, the  agency may miss the best opportunities to leverage swap-construct  exchange or select properties for exchange that are better suited to the  traditional property disposal process and construction projects that are  better suited to traditional funding processes. GSA may also waste time  and money pursuing a potential swap-construct exchange that could be  better spent pursuing these traditional approaches."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["GSA faces some key challenges in managing its federal real property  portfolio, especially in disposing of unneeded federal property and  financing the replacement or modernization of aging and underutilized  properties. In some cases, the swap-construct approach discussed in this  report might be a useful means through which GSA can more readily  achieve these property-related goals. However, GSA\u2019s recent solicitations  for market interest in swap-construct have not always been well received  by potential bidders. Specifically, of the five swap-construct exchanges  GSA for which GSA solicited market interest since 2012, only two are  being actively pursued; the others generated little market interest. One  concern for potential bidders was the lack of detail regarding the  construction services that GSA hoped to gain in return for an asset it  would cede to the bidder. We found that in developing initial proposals for  a swap-construct exchange GSA often focused on identifying assets to  dispose of and gave less attention to what it needed in exchange for  those assets. Construction services or a newly constructed asset are fully  half of any swap-construct exchange, yet GSA has not always clearly  identified its needs when requesting feedback from potential bidders. The  agency\u2019s intent may be to provide greater details at later stages of the  proposal process, but this approach may limit the ability of respondents to  provide meaningful input and lead to missed swap-construct opportunities  for GSA.", "At present GSA does not have criteria for identifying viable exchanges in  the sense that both sides of the potential transaction are fully defined and  communicated to potential interested parties. OMB and GAO have  previously identified the importance of criteria in making agency  decisions. By not using screening criteria to make its choices, GSA may  be pursuing swap-construct exchanges with less potential for success,  and potentially delaying time that it could be spending on traditional  disposal and appropriation processes. Similarly, GSA may also miss  opportunities to leverage swap-construct more widely moving forward,  which could be crucial given ongoing budgetary challenges."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["In order to identify potentially successful swap-construct exchanges  during GSA\u2019s review of its federal real property portfolio and reduce  uncertainty for those responding to GSA\u2019s solicitations for possible swap- construct exchanges, we recommend that the Administrator of GSA take  the following two actions:  1.  include, to the extent possible, details on what GSA is seeking in  exchange for federal property in its solicitations, including requests for  information, for potential swap-construct exchanges and  2.  develop criteria for determining when to solicit market interest in a  swap-construct exchange."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report for review and comment to GSA.

We  described GSA\u2019s swap-construct process using information gathered from  GSA guidance and interviews with GSA officials. In addition, we  reviewed related laws that facilitate GSA\u2019s swap-construct exchanges.", "To determine GSA\u2019s experience with swap-construct exchanges, we  identified and reviewed the two swap-construct exchanges (Atlanta, GA,  and San Antonio, TX) completed by GSA since 2000 through GSA  exchange agreement documentation, appraisal reports, and property  descriptions, and through interviews with GSA officials. We conducted  site visits to Atlanta and San Antonio, examined the properties involved in  the exchanges, and interviewed GSA officials and nonfederal  participants\u2014H. E.

We conducted site visits to three of the properties involved in the  proposed exchanges (the Cotton Annex and Regional Office Building in  Washington, D.C and the Metro West building in Baltimore, MD),  examined the properties, and spoke with GSA officials about the RFIs  that included these properties. We selected these properties based on  nearby proximity (within a 50-mile radius) and to include a site visit to  both a location where the property or properties in the RFI generated 10  or more responses and to a location were the property or properties in the  RFI generated fewer than 10 responses. To further identify a property or  properties to visit, we then limited our selection to property or properties  that were furthest along in GSA\u2019s proposed swap-construct process. In  addition, to better understand the status of these proposed exchanges,  we analyzed the responses GSA received to its solicitations for these  swap-construct exchanges and discussed the proposed exchanges with  four of the seven respondents to the Metro West and Spring Street  Courthouse RFIs. We did not interview RFI respondents to the proposed  swap-construct exchanges that involved the FBI headquarters and  Federal Triangle South properties since GSA is actively in discussions or  negotiations with these respondents. We selected our sample of the  respondents to include a variety of respondents, including a development  company, firm that advises developers, a university, and a company that  provides property management services to the government. Because the  RFI respondents were selected as a nonprobability sample, the  information gained in these interviews cannot be generalized to make  conclusions about all of GSA\u2019s swap-construct exchanges. However, they  illustrate the views of a diverse set of respondents with experience related  to these exchanges. To understand the possible exchange in Lakewood,  CO, we analyzed GSA documents, including agency property  descriptions and tentative plans for the swap-construct exchange, and  interviewed GSA officials and a local government official involved with the  negotiations with GSA.", "To identify the potential benefits of swap-construct exchanges and factors  that can influence GSA\u2019s future use these exchanges, we evaluated  GSA\u2019s approach to identifying potentially successful swap-construct  exchanges to propose against the OMB Capital Programming Guide and  the GAO Executive Guide on Leading Practices in Capital Decision- Making, and interviewed GSA officials; nonfederal participants in  completed swap-construct exchanges (HEBSPC and Emory University  Hospital Midtown); stakeholders in federal property acquisition and  disposal processes (the National Capital Planning Commission and the  National Law Center for Homelessness and Poverty, respectively); and  nongovernmental organizations familiar with GSA\u2019s swap-construct  exchanges (the National Council for Public-Private Partnerships and the  Urban Land Institute).
