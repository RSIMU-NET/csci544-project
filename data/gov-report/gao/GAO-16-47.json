However, the Navy did not fully implement certain tasks in its FBWT FIP in accordance with the Department of Defense's (DOD) Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) Guidance.

The Navy did not fully document its FBWT process in system narratives and flowcharts. For example, the Navy's analysis did not explain the complex process that occurs within the Defense Departmental Reporting System - B, including merging data and deleting duplicative transactions. In the Navy's case, the process analysis is particularly important because the Navy's transactions do not follow the typical flow of data used to produce financial statements. Without a complete FBWT process analysis and system narratives, internal controls and risks for each of the systems in the process may not be readily identified and appropriately tested.", "Prioritize audit readiness efforts. The Navy did not prioritize FBWT audit readiness efforts or fully implement its audit readiness prioritization and strategy for key information systems prior to its assertion of audit readiness. The Navy's lack of prioritization of key information technology limits management's ability to focus audit readiness efforts on the systems with the highest risk.", "Assess and test internal controls. Within the FBWT assertion package, the Navy did not document information technology general computer controls for significant systems or the hardware and software interfaces, as required. Also, the Navy did not identify internal controls by assessable units (e.g., information systems supporting financial statement line items or other discrete portions of the program). Identifying controls by assessable unit is important for determining whether assessable units, sub-assessable units, and associated systems are producing reliable information and helps link systems and controls to the transaction flows.", "Evaluate supporting documentation. Although the Navy performed substantive tests for supporting documents, such testing may not provide sufficient evidence of the Navy's ability to produce documentation in a substantive manner for future audits.

The  FIAR Directorate official further noted that quantitative drilldowns by  assessable unit were not necessary in this FIP because assessable units,  such as military pay or contracts, are covered in other FIPs. Although the  Navy and the FIAR Directorate said that a quantitative drilldown was not  applicable, a level I quantitative drilldown for FBWT is critical for  determining all the sources of transactions, including journal vouchers,  comprising the population of transactions, as well as for prioritizing audit  efforts.

These journal vouchers are a source of activity  affecting FBWT that according to FIAR Guidance, should be prioritized for  testing.

This includes the Navy\u2019s collection  and disbursement activity through the financial statement line items,  including FBWT on the balance sheet and outlays on the SBR. For  example, as previously noted, the narratives did not include discussion of  the reversal of general ledger transactions or other entries within   DDRS-B.", "Navy officials told us that some of the missing systems documentation  items might have been included in another audit segment or assertion  package. However, the Navy did not provide evidence to support that  claim, and no reference to another assertion package was made in the  FBWT assertion package. According to the FIAR Guidance,  documentation of performance of the required procedures for each FIP  task must be completed and included in each applicable assertion  package. Once the scope of the FBWT FIP was expanded to include all  systems through the financial statement line item, FBWT audit readiness  officials did not ensure that all required audit readiness procedures within  the expanded scope were performed and the documentation supporting  the procedures was available for auditors. Complete and accurate system  narratives and flowcharts, and documentation of general computer  controls, help to provide management and the auditor with information on  the systems environment and data flow, which they use to prioritize audit  efforts.", "Further, in preparing its April 2013 internal control assessment, the Navy  identified key internal controls in the FBWT process, but it did not identify  those controls by assessable unit as required by FIAR Guidance. The  FIAR Guidance for this task requires (1) preparing an internal control  assessment document for entity-level controls and for each assessable  unit and (2) summarizing control activities that are appropriately designed  and in place. Navy officials told us that several years ago they  assembled a matrix of controls to be assessed. They organized the  controls by the FBWT area that the controls supported or by control  owner, and they thought that this met the FIAR Guidance requirement.  Some of the internal controls the Navy identified and tested may be  related to an assessable unit. However, the Navy did not identify controls  for each assessable unit. Identifying controls by assessable unit is  important for determining whether assessable units, sub-assessable  units, and associated systems are producing reliable information and  helps link systems and controls to the transaction flows. As a result, the  Navy is missing an opportunity to identify and correct control deficiencies  for the key systems that could affect its FBWT audit readiness. For  example, DCAS is the primary subledger used to process the universe of  collection and disbursement transactions for FBWT. Although the Navy  did identify some controls involving DCAS, it did not identify internal  controls by system or assessable unit. Therefore, the Navy does not have  assurance that DCAS is operating as intended and that output from the  system is reliable."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Evaluate Key Supporting Documentation", "paragraphs": ["The Navy\u2019s substantive testing for key supporting documents may not  provide sufficient evidence that its efforts to produce supporting  documentation are sustainable for future audits.

In the second  round of testing, the Navy completed 13 procedures, 3 of which involved  statistical sampling while the other 10 relied on analytic or non-random  sampling procedures.

Further, Navy officials  told us that after they asserted audit readiness, they anticipated that they  would be under audit by an IPA soon thereafter, so time constraints did  not permit further testing. However, lack of supporting documentation has  historically been an issue on DOD audits. This was also the case in the  audit of the Navy\u2019s fiscal year 2015 Schedule of Budgetary Activity, in  which the IPA disclaimed an opinion, in part, because the Navy could not  provide sufficient, appropriate audit evidence to support transactions.  Without performing adequate substantive testing, the Navy does not have  reasonable assurance of the availability of key documentation to support  amounts presented in the financial statements.", "Further, none of the procedures tested the supporting documentation for  supplemental quarterly reconciliations. Supplemental quarterly  reconciliations provide a secondary check on the accuracy of monthly  reconciliations and on other monitoring procedures.

Although  required audit readiness procedures for FBWT were not fully completed,  the Navy decided to go forward with an audit of its Schedule of Budgetary  Activity.

Successful completion  of the FIAR Discovery phase tasks for FBWT may identify additional  deficiencies that affect the auditability of the Navy\u2019s financial statements.

These  systems were modified over time to also provide financial reports and  data for financial statement compilation. As a result, as shown in figure 2,  the flow of the Navy\u2019s transactional data does not follow the typical flow of  data from subsidiary ledger to general ledger to trial balance to financial  statements. The FBWT process relies on subsidiary ledgers to distribute  and record the Navy\u2019s funds and to record collection and disbursement  transaction information to the general ledgers. Data are forwarded from  subsidiary ledgers to the budgetary reporting system for inclusion in the  financial statement system, which ultimately creates the Navy\u2019s  consolidated financial statements.", "This process results in some transactions flowing to the financial  statements that are not posted in any of the general ledgers. This bypass  of the general ledgers for financial statement preparation represents a  significant audit challenge because the general ledgers do not agree with  the Navy\u2019s financial statements for FBWT. General ledgers are typically  an entity\u2019s primary system of record, where all transactions are recorded  and from which financial statements are prepared. In an audit, for  supporting FBWT financial statement line item amounts, it is essential  that the Navy reconcile any differences between the financial statements  and the general ledgers, and between the general ledgers and underlying  transactions, to assure that all transactions in the financial statements are  recorded in the general ledgers. Specifically:", "According to the Navy, the Defense Cash Accountability System  (DCAS) contains the universe of collection and disbursement  transactions, except for timing difference transactions. The Navy\u2019s  FBWT process begins when collection and disbursement transaction  information from the Navy\u2019s multiple disbursement feeder systems is  posted to DCAS. When DCAS edit checks identify a transaction with  missing or incorrect account coding information, the transaction is not  distributed to the general ledgers and remains in DCAS as an  \u201cundistributed\u201d transaction until it can be investigated and the  necessary information obtained. DCAS distributes all other  transactions to one of the Navy\u2019s general ledgers. Each month, DCAS  transmits summary collection and disbursement information, including  undistributed transactions, to the Defense Departmental Reporting  System - Budgetary (DDRS-B). DCAS is also used for the Navy\u2019s fund  balance reconciliation process with the Department of the Treasury\u2019s  (Treasury) Central Accounting Reporting System (CARS).", "DDRS-B has historically been used as a budgetary reporting tool for  numerous Navy commands and Navy headquarters, but it has also  been adapted for financial reporting. It receives budgetary information  from the Program Budgetary Information System and proprietary  information from DCAS. DDRS-B also receives summary information  from the general ledgers. To avoid duplication of transactions,  system-generated journal entries are made within DDRS-B that are  intended to reverse the general ledger transactions, which were also  posted by DCAS. The general ledger is typically the system of record  for an entity\u2019s financial reporting. However, since DCAS is considered  to contain the universe of the Navy\u2019s collection and disbursement  transactions, DCAS transactions\u2014not the summary transaction  information from the general ledgers\u2014flow through DDRS-B to the  financial statements. Also, within DDRS-B, journal entries (forced- balance entries) are prepared and posted to temporarily make the  balances in the Navy\u2019s FBWT equal to the balances in Treasury\u2019s  CARS, until such differences can be reconciled as required by the  Treasury Financial Manual. Navy officials said that forced-balance  journal entries are eventually reconciled to transaction detail and are  reversed in the following period; they are not posted to the Navy\u2019s  general ledgers.

The diverse nature of the numerous feeder systems providing the  transaction information also complicates the FBWT reconciliation  process. The Navy receives transaction information from both centralized  and decentralized disbursement feeder systems, including the  Centralized Automated Disbursing System, Intra-Governmental Payment  and Collections, Mechanization of Contract Administrative Services, and  other component reporting through the Defense Finance and Accounting  Service (DFAS) Disbursing Station Symbol Numbers (DSSN) by Navy  Shore DSSNs and Navy Ship DSSNs.", "The complexity of the overall financial reporting process leads to  difficulties in the FBWT reconciliation process.
