Initially, PRP units were established in IRS district offices. In 1979, IRS expanded PRP to its service centers and created the position of Taxpayer Ombudsman to head PRP. The Ombudsman was appointed by and reported to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. Congress has since renamed the Ombudsman the \u201cNational Taxpayer Advocate\u201d and shifted appointment authority to the Secretary of the Treasury. However, the Advocate continues to report to the Commissioner. To promote the independence of the Advocate, Congress required that the individual not be an IRS employee for 2 years preceding his or her appointment and that the individual not accept a position elsewhere in IRS for 5 years following his or her tenure as the Advocate. The current Advocate was appointed in August 1998, in accordance with these provisions. Additionally, to enhance independence, the Advocate is required to submit annual reports directly to Congress on the objectives and activities of the Advocate\u2019s Office. These reports are to be developed by the Advocate\u2019s Office and are to be submitted directly to Congress without any prior review or comment from the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, the Secretary of the Treasury, or any other officer or employee of the Department of the Treasury.", "The Advocate manages an organization (i.e., the Advocate\u2019s Office) that has advocates in each of IRS\u2019 4 regions, 33 districts, 30 former districts,and 10 service centers and in the Executive Office for Service Center Operations (EOSCO) in Cincinnati, OH, and the Office of the Assistant Commissioner (International) in Washington, D.C. The regional and EOSCO advocates are responsible for providing program oversight and support to advocates in the district, former district, and service center offices (hereafter referred to as \u201clocal advocates\u201d), who manage PRP operations at the local level. This program oversight and support is to include reviewing PRP casework, ensuring the training of PRP staff and staff in the Advocate\u2019s Office, dealing with sensitive individual cases, pursuing advocacy initiatives, and handling potential hardship cases.", "Formerly, the regional and local advocates were selected by and reported to the director of the regional office, district office, or service center where they worked. However, the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 changed that relationship. Now, regional advocates are to be selected by and report to the National Taxpayer Advocate, and local advocates are to be selected by and report to regional advocates.", "At the time we completed our review in May 1999, most PRP casework was being done by district office and service center staff, called caseworkers, who were employees of IRS\u2019 operating functions, such as Customer Service, Collection, and Examination. In addition, each function doing PRP work had a coordinator to ensure that all PRP cases within the function were assigned to caseworkers and placed under PRP control and to provide coordination between the function and the local advocates. PRP caseworkers and coordinators were funded by the operating functions, not the Advocate\u2019s Office.", "Also, each district office and service center had its own PRP structure, which reflected differences in office size and composition and in the way PRP caseworkers were managed.

Because there was no direct funding for PRP, however, functional managers had to carve out resources for PRP from their operating budgets. This arrangement required district and service center directors to shift employees and other resources into or out of PRP as workload demands changed. When functional needs conflicted with PRP needs, there were no assurances that PRP needs would be met. This arrangement also meant that functional managers, not local advocates, determined which employees would do PRP casework\u2014 leaving the local advocates with little, if any, control over the quality of the caseworkers. Local advocates told us that good communication and working relationships with other managers within IRS was imperative to receive the support needed to meet PRP goals.", "Another result of the relationship just described is that local advocates were not responsible for preparing official performance evaluations for most PRP caseworkers. In that regard, our surveys showed that about 80 percent of the PRP caseworkers reported to and were evaluated by functional management. Such a situation could have affected the ability of caseworkers to resolve taxpayers\u2019 problems impartially, because those problems could involve disputes between the taxpayer and the function responsible for evaluating the caseworker. Also, this situation could have led to a perception that PRP was not an independent program. Independence\u2014actual and apparent\u2014is important because, among other things, it helps promote taxpayer confidence in PRP.", "Because the Advocate\u2019s Office did not have direct control over functional employees, PRP caseworkers could sometimes be pulled from PRP duties to do other work. For example, IRS officials said that PRP caseworkers were often required to help the customer service function answer taxpayer telephone calls during the filing season. While caseworkers were helping customer service, they were still responsible for their PRP work.", "Since PRP did not have a direct budget, IRS officials said that it was easy for PRP \u201cto fall through the cracks\u201d in terms of getting other resources, such as equipment and space, for PRP work. When PRP caseworkers told us of their equipment needs, they generally mentioned computers for word processing, ready access to Integrated Data Retrieval System (IDRS) terminals, telephone lines and voice mail, fax machines, and basic office supplies.", "Given the nature of PRP work, caseworker access to IDRS and the availability of such things as word processing equipment, voice mail, and telephone lines would seem essential.

When they did hear about training, it was sometimes too late to sign up. Some staff said that it had been several years since they had received any formal PRP training. Both Advocate Office staff and PRP caseworkers told us that, in addition to the basic training needed to do PRP work, they would like training in other areas, especially tax law changes. Also, many caseworkers wanted cross- functional training so that they could work cases across functional lines. IRS officials said that cross-functional training would broaden caseworker skills and might lead to faster and more accurate service to taxpayers.

In addition, at the time we completed our audit work, IRS was developing an implementation plan to have the remaining 80 percent of the caseworker positions assigned to local advocate offices during fiscal year 1999. To complement the shift to direct reporting of caseworkers and further strengthen the independence of the Advocate\u2019s Office, IRS established for fiscal year 1999 a separate, centralized financial structure for managing all Advocate Office resources. This structure covers the resources allocated to the Advocate\u2019s Office and includes PRP caseworkers who have been transferred from the functions to the Advocate\u2019s Office.

The matrix does not, however, contain any information on what projects were ongoing or planned at the local offices.", "The inventory of legislative recommendations aimed at changing the current tax law is a document that presents potential legislative changes recommended by each region and EOSCO. The list is also presented in matrix format with information on each recommendation, such as whether there is an advocacy project related to the issue, what the proposed action is, and the status of the recommendation. The list is tracked by fiscal year, and those recommendations that the Advocate endorsed are to be included in the Advocate\u2019s Report to Congress. As of April 1999, there were seven legislative recommendations on the list. This listing, however, is limited to proposed changes to legislation and does not contain any information on ongoing, proposed, or completed advocacy projects.", "The Commissioner\u2019s Tracking System is a document that is to contain information on all advocacy memorandums that were sent to functional management. Advocacy memorandums are to be sent from the Advocate to a National Office function when the function resists or does not respond to a recommendation that the Advocate feels will alleviate harm to taxpayers or decrease taxpayer burden. Advocacy memorandums are to be sent only after other inquiries or attempts to resolve the issue have proved unsuccessful. The function is asked to respond in writing to the advocacy memorandum. If the functional area does not provide a satisfactory reason for not implementing a recommendation, the Advocate can compel the function to implement the recommendation by issuing a Taxpayer Advocate Directive, as explained previously. Information on the Commissioner\u2019s Tracking System and information from the directives are to be included in the Advocate\u2019s Annual Report to Congress. As of April 1999, the Advocate had written 12 advocacy memorandums. This document only contains those advocacy recommendations that were not willingly implemented by the functions and is not a complete source of advocacy projects.", "The lack of a comprehensive source of information on all advocacy projects increases the risk of unnecessary duplication of effort. In that regard, staff at several locations said that regional and local offices are often studying similar problems. For example, an IRS regional official said that two of IRS\u2019 regions were studying projects on several similar issues, including (1) the application of taxpayer overpayment credits and (2) waiving the 10 percent additional tax penalty on withdrawals from Individual Retirement Accounts in hardship cases. The official also said that there was even less awareness of ongoing efforts at the district office and service center levels than at the regional level described above.", "A more comprehensive source of information on advocacy projects might also help provide staff with better feedback on project results. Although each IRS region and EOSCO has an advocacy council that is responsible for providing feedback to district and service center staffs, the local advocates and council members with whom we talked said that there was no formal mechanism for providing feedback. In particular, council members said that staff who had worked on projects were not receiving status reports or even an acknowledgment that recommendations from their projects were being considered for possible implementation, even though the councils were responsible for providing this information. In one district, for example, the local advocate said that he had forwarded the same advocacy recommendations to the regional council over the course of several years, but had not received feedback concerning what actions, if any, were taken on these recommendations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Proposed Changes for Strengthening Advocacy Efforts Are Under Consideration", "paragraphs": ["In October 1998, the Advocate established a team to develop recommendations to strengthen advocacy within IRS. The team\u2019s goal was to develop and recommend a national advocacy plan, and the team made several recommendations to the Advocate for initiating and coordinating advocacy projects. For example, in its February 1999 report to the Advocate, the team recommended that a national advocacy database be developed to provide a single source of information on ongoing advocacy projects. The national database would contain information on all advocacy efforts, including those at the national, regional, and local levels. In addition, the database would be accessible to all local advocates. As part of the effort to redesign the Advocate\u2019s Office, the Advocate said that he plans to adopt the recommendations from the team. Also, the redesign plan calls for establishing separate casework and advocacy units, each with its own dedicated staff, thus reducing the possibility that advocacy will suffer in times of high PRP caseloads."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Advocate\u2019s Office Lacked Adequate Measures of Effectiveness", "paragraphs": ["IRS lacked adequate measures of the effectiveness of the Advocate\u2019s Office and PRP. The set of measures used by the Advocate\u2019s Office during our review (1) provided descriptive information about program activities, such as the average amount of time it takes to close a PRP case, rather than information needed to assess effectiveness; (2) did not provide complete data; or (3) were not based on consistent data collection. IRS has efforts under way to improve program measures. Those efforts, at least as they relate to the Advocate\u2019s Office, may be hampered by existing information systems.", "While it is necessary for an organization to measure program activities, such as average case processing time, the more important and more difficult task is to develop measures of effectiveness that focus on the impact of an agency\u2019s programs on its customers. Measures of effectiveness are important because they provide data to improve program performance, increase accountability, and support decisionmaking. We found that the Advocate\u2019s Office had measures to gauge certain aspects of PRP\u2019s performance, but that these measures could not fully assess PRP\u2019s effectiveness. For example, the Advocate\u2019s Office did not have a method for measuring customer satisfaction, and there was no mechanism for determining the effectiveness of advocacy efforts\u2014both of these measures would help the Advocate understand how effective the program is in helping taxpayers."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Existing PRP Measures Are Inadequate", "paragraphs": ["During our review, the Advocate\u2019s Office was using the following four measures to gauge PRP\u2019s performance: (1) average processing time to close PRP cases, (2) currency of PRP case inventory, (3) quality of casework, and (4) case identification rate. Although those measures provided some useful information, they did not provide all of the information needed to assess PRP\u2019s effectiveness. (See app. VI for more information on these measures.)", "The first two measures, average processing time and currency of case inventory, provide descriptive information about program activities. Although these measures are useful for some program management decisions, such as the number of staff needed at a specific office, they do not provide information on PRP\u2019s effectiveness.", "The third measure is designed to determine the quality of PRP casework. Although this measure provides some data on program effectiveness, it provides no information on customer satisfaction. In commenting on a draft of this report, IRS said that it is developing ways to measure PRP customer satisfaction and that it plans to test and refine the measure beginning in October 1999. By helping taxpayers resolve problems that were not resolved elsewhere in IRS, the Advocate\u2019s Office plays a pivotal role in delivering customer service to the taxpayers. Customer satisfaction data from taxpayers who contacted PRP could provide the Advocate\u2019s Office with information on how taxpayers feel about the service they received and whether taxpayers consider their problems solved. Without this information, the Advocate\u2019s Office is not in the best position to improve program operations to better satisfy taxpayer needs.", "The fourth measure, PRP case identification, attempts to determine if service center employees are properly identifying potential PRP cases from incoming correspondence. This measure is an important tool to help the Advocate\u2019s Office know whether PRP actually serves those taxpayers who qualify for help from the program. However, the measure provides an incomplete picture because it is designed for use only at service centers. There is no similar measure to determine how well district offices and toll- free telephone call sites are identifying and referring potential PRP cases.", "Also, a recent review of the PRP case identification measure by IRS\u2019 Office of Internal Audit disclosed, among other things, that inconsistent data collection could affect the integrity and reliability of the measure\u2019s results. For example, Internal Audit found that the test was not always performed the required number of times per month at each service center and that the mail sample was not based on the service center\u2019s incoming mail population. Additionally, when Internal Audit performed a parallel PRP case identification sample\u2014in accordance with national standards\u2014its rates for some service centers were significantly lower\u2014in one case, over 55 percentage points lower\u2014-than rates reported by the service center.", "In addition to the shortcomings of these four measures, IRS lacked a method for determining the effectiveness of its advocacy efforts. Advocacy is a major responsibility of the Advocate\u2019s Office and is aimed at ultimately reducing the number of taxpayers needing help from PRP. Without information on the effectiveness of these efforts, the Advocate\u2019s Office does not know, for example, which efforts provide the greatest benefit to taxpayers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Current Information Systems May Limit IRS\u2019 Ability to Develop Needed Measures", "paragraphs": ["The Advocate is working to improve Advocate Office and PRP measures of effectiveness. In January 1999, as part of its efforts to redesign the Advocate\u2019s Office, IRS established a task force to determine what measures are needed to assess program effectiveness. Specifically, the group is tasked to research, identify, and develop corporate level measures for Advocate Office program results, customer satisfaction, and employee satisfaction. Their ability to develop needed measures of effectiveness, however, may be hampered by existing information systems. The Taxpayer Advocate Management Information System is comprised of the Problem Resolution Office Management Information System (PROMIS), the Customer Feedback System, and the PRP Case Identification and Tracking System. These systems do not provide the Advocate\u2019s Office with the data it needs to assess the effectiveness of PRP operations.", "PROMIS is a computerized inventory control and report system that includes information from individual PRP cases, such as the taxpayer\u2019s name, address, and Social Security number. PROMIS generates reports on cumulative descriptive program data, such as the number of cases worked in PRP and how quickly cases are closed. Although the system also captures data on the types of problems taxpayers are experiencing\u2014such as the \u201clost or stolen refund\u201d example mentioned earlier\u2014there is no mechanism to search for other data that might help advocacy efforts by pointing to agencywide weaknesses. For instance, there is no way to determine if cases were caused by problems with a particular IRS system because the cases are coded only by type of tax problem. In a case history section, PROMIS captures information on the nature of the taxpayer\u2019s problem and what actions were taken to help the taxpayer. However, there is no mechanism to search multiple cases for trend data from the history section.", "The Customer Feedback System is designed to capture taxpayers\u2019 compliments and complaints about IRS employees. The system depends on taxpayers to take the initiative to voluntarily comment about the treatment they received from an IRS employee and on IRS managers to complete the customer feedback form. The voluntary nature of the system means that the data are not statistically representative of program participation, and fluctuations in the data cannot be attributed to changes in program operations. In addition, comments captured on the system could relate to any IRS function, not just PRP, and therefore, are of limited use in assessing PRP\u2019s effectiveness.", "The PRP Case Identification and Tracking System is used to capture information on the PRP case identification measure discussed earlier. As such, it has the same limitations as that measure\u2014it only has information on cases coming into IRS through correspondence at the service centers. Because this system contains no information on cases coming in through district offices and call sites, it provides incomplete data on whether taxpayers who qualify for PRP assistance are being properly identified and referred to PRP.", "In addition to the problems with the Taxpayer Advocate Management Information System, we mentioned earlier that the Advocate\u2019s Office lacked a system to track resources dedicated to the program. Because PRP was implemented through IRS\u2019 functions, the Advocate\u2019s Office had no system to track the resources devoted to PRP.

However, it is too soon to tell how effective these changes will be in addressing the challenges cited in this report.", "Two areas in which changes are being considered are advocacy and performance measures. However, changes in both areas require the development of better information systems than are currently available. For example, without a system or systems that provide (1) information needed to identify and prioritize advocacy projects and (2) comprehensive information on all proposed, ongoing, and completed advocacy projects, IRS has no assurance that the Advocate\u2019s Office is most effectively using the resources available for advocacy.
