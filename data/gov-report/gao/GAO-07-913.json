Fiscal year 2006 marked the third year that agencies were required to report improper payment and recovery audit information in their Performance and Accountability Reports. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) reported limited information during these 3 years. GAO was asked to (1) determine the extent to which DHS has implemented the requirements of IPIA, (2) identify actions DHS has under way to improve IPIA compliance and reporting, and (3) determine what efforts DHS has in place to recover improper payments. To accomplish this, GAO analyzed DHS's internal guidance and action plans, and reviewed information reported in its Performance and Accountability Reports."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DHS has made some progress in implementing IPIA requirements, but much more work remains for the agency to become compliant with IPIA. For example, while DHS has made progress in identifying its programs, for fiscal year 2006, the agency did not perform the required first step--a risk assessment--on approximately $13 billion of its more than $29 billion in disbursements subject to IPIA. Until DHS fully assesses its programs, the potential magnitude of improper payments is unknown. For the remaining $16 billion, DHS determined that two programs-- Individuals and Households Program (IHP) assistance payments and disaster-related vendor payments--were at high risk for issuing improper payments and reported related estimates. For the $13 billion for which no risk assessment was performed, DHS has encountered challenges with IPIA implementation. Of this amount, over $6 billion relates to payments for grant programs. Developing a plan to assess risk and potentially test grant payments is important given that the DHS Office of Inspector General, GAO, and other auditors have identified weaknesses in grant programs. This will allow DHS to gain a better understanding of its risk for improper payments and potentially reduce future improper payments. DHS has actions under way to improve IPIA reporting and compliance, but does not plan to be fully compliant in fiscal year 2007. DHS has prepared a plan to address its noncompliance with IPIA, which included updating its guidance to focus on program identification and risk assessments to build a foundation for a sustainable IPIA program. In addition, DHS has developed plans to reduce improper payments related to its two identified high-risk programs. However, until DHS fully completes the required risk assessments for all of its programs and then estimates for risk-susceptible programs, it is not known whether other programs have significant improper payments that also need to be addressed. In addition, DHS's efforts to recover improper payments could be improved. According to DHS, four of its components meet the criteria for recovery auditing as specified in the Recovery Auditing Act. These four components make at least $4 billion of contractor payments each fiscal year. DHS encountered problems that kept it from reporting on recovery audit efforts during fiscal year 2006 for three of the four components, and did not perform recovery auditing at the fourth component. In March 2007, DHS revised its guidance to clarify what is expected; however, ongoing oversight will be necessary to monitor the components' progress. In addition, DHS has reported limited information on its efforts to recover specific improper payments identified during its testing of high-risk programs. Although DHS is not currently required to do so, reporting this information would provide a more complete picture of the agency's actions to recover payments that it has identified as being improper."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Over the past several years, our work has shown that improper payments  continue to be a substantial problem for federal agencies.

Fiscal year 2004 marked the first year in which agencies were  required to report improper payments information in their Performance  and Accountability Reports (PAR) under the Improper Payments  Information Act of 2002 (IPIA). As a result, federal agencies reported an  estimated $46 billion in improper payments for fiscal year 2004. Although  governmentwide reported amounts of estimated improper payments  decreased between fiscal year 2004 and fiscal year 2006, the reported  amount in fiscal year 2006 included more than $800 million as a result of  improper disaster-related payments made by the Federal Emergency  Management Agency (FEMA) within the Department of Homeland  Security (DHS) in response to the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes. Since its  establishment in March 2003, DHS, whose annual budget generally tops  $30 billion, has yet to comply with IPIA.

DHS\u2019s grant  programs include the NFIP, which had disbursements of over $3 billion  that should have been included in DHS\u2019s IPIA population for review in  fiscal year 2006. As we have previously reported, measuring improper  payments and designing and implementing actions to reduce or eliminate  them are not simple tasks, particularly for grant programs that rely on  quality administration efforts at the state level. DHS has an even greater  challenge in the diversity of recipients for its grants which include state  and local governments, individuals, and other entities.

DHS identified three IPIA programs within GT, including Domestic  Preparedness, State and Local Programs, and Firefighter Assistance  Grants, totaling $3.1 billion of fiscal year 2005 disbursements for fiscal  year 2006 IPIA testing; however, GT did not perform an assessment or  complete statistical sample testing on these grants programs. In its fiscal  year 2006 PAR, DHS reported that one complication that was not  overcome was how to extend statistical sample testing to grant recipients.  DHS also had difficulty testing its grant programs because of the large  number of grant programs identified for testing based on DHS\u2019s guidance  for fiscal year 2006 program identification and risk assessment  methodology, which required that all programs with total disbursements  exceeding $100 million be selected and statistically tested. DHS reported  that one of the problems with its fiscal year 2006 IPIA methodology was  that its risk assessments were based on strictly quantitative factors,  instead of both qualitative and quantitative factors. Although OMB has not  yet provided guidance as we have previously recommended, DHS issued  internal guidance recognizing the need to consider qualitative factors.", "One such qualitative factor that DHS could consider as part of its risk  assessment process are the results of Single Audit Act, as amended,  reports related to its grantees. During fiscal year 2006, DHS\u2019s independent  auditors reported that the agency was not in compliance with the Single  Audit Act. According to the independent auditors\u2019 report, FEMA and TSA  are required to comply with certain provisions of OMB Circular No. A-133,  which requires agencies awarding grants to ensure they receive grantee  reports timely and to follow-up on grantee single audit findings.

In this revised guidance, DHS clarifies how its  components should identify their population of programs. In addition,  DHS requires its components to perform a comprehensive risk assessment  in order to identify programs susceptible to significant improper  payments. DHS has designed a detailed methodology to conduct the IPIA  risk assessment, and this methodology is outlined in the May 2007  guidance. The methodology, which includes qualitative criteria, as we have  previously discussed, involves the creation of a program risk matrix based  upon specific risk elements that affect the likelihood of improper  payments. Further, the guidance states that a program may be selected for  testing even if it does not meet the quantitative or qualitative assessments,  noting that it is entirely possible that the risk assessment process may not  identify a program as high risk, but component management may believe a  program is high risk due to a high-level public profile or known financial  or regulatory issues (such as a high-profile contract). For those programs  found to be at high risk for issuing improper payments, the guidance also  provides instructions for estimating improper payments, implementing a  plan to reduce improper payments, and reporting on this information.  Each of these procedures outlined in the May 2007 guidance includes  instructions to submit information or documentation to the Internal  Controls over Financial Reporting (ICOFR) Program Management Office  (PMO).", "DHS\u2019s May 2007 guidance for fiscal year 2007 also outlines possible  alternative approaches for testing grants. One possible alternative is the  complete documentation of the component\u2019s grant management process  and the testing of internal controls. According to DHS, this approach helps  the component identify specific weaknesses within the grant process,  rather than sampling payments at random to determine potential errors. A  second alternative is to perform a risk assessment on the program\u2019s grant  portfolio. This alternative helps the program identify specific grants that  may be more susceptible to improper payments. The identified grants  would then be subject to improper payment sampling. If a component  wishes to consider alternative approaches to grant sampling, an  explanatory memorandum must be submitted to the ICOFR PMO for  review and approval. If approved by the ICOFR PMO, DHS will submit the  alternative approach request to OMB for review and approval. Also, OMB   has reported that the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Council continues  to play a critical role in efforts to address and reduce improper payments  through its Improper Payments Transformation Team. This group has been  collaborating with nongovernmental entities to consolidate  governmentwide best practices; enumerate legislative and regulatory  barriers that hinder program integrity efforts; and develop forums where  federal and state stakeholders from the program, audit, and financial  communities work together to solve program integrity challenges. These  activities could provide guidance to help DHS determine how to best test  its grant programs.", "DHS also plans to hold workshops for its components on statistical sample  testing and reporting to ensure that they have a consistent understanding  of what is expected with regard to IPIA testing and reporting.

During fiscal year  2007, DHS established the ICOFR PMO as a new office within the DHS  OCFO. The ICOFR PMO is responsible for departmentwide  implementation of OMB Circular No. A-123. In March 2007, DHS issued the  ICOFR Playbook, which outlines the department\u2019s strategy and processes  to resolve material weaknesses and build management assurances and  incorporates the departmentwide corrective action plans, which contain  more detailed information. The ICOFR PMO is responsible for the ICOFR  Playbook and, according to DHS, the agency will update the ICOFR  Playbook each year, establishing milestones and focus areas that will be  tracked during the year. One section of the ICOFR Playbook relates to  IPIA testing, and it discusses the actions taken by DHS in fiscal year 2006  to meet IPIA requirements. This section also states that DHS will develop  policies and procedures to integrate the requirements of OMB\u2019s  implementing guidance for IPIA into annual component management  assurances of compliance with significant laws and regulations, as part of  DHS management\u2019s assertion on internal controls over financial reporting  and in an effort to strengthen internal controls to support DHS\u2019s mission.

While DHS was able to recover  about 55 percent of improper payments identified through its recovery  audit efforts, based on our review of other agencies, we have previously  questioned whether agency amounts identified for recovery should have  been much higher, which would thereby significantly decrease the agency- specific and overall high rate of recovery.", "According to DHS\u2019s fiscal year 2006 PAR reporting, recovery audit  contract work over fiscal year 2005 disbursements began in fiscal year  2005 at CBP and ICE, and DHS extended its recovery audit work to  include USCG in fiscal year 2006. Delays in obtaining security clearances  for contract personnel severely hampered completion of recovery audit  work at CBP and ICE.
