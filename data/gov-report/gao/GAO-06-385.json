Responsibility for creating these policies and processes shifted initially from the White House to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and then to the Department of Homeland Security, but none has yet completed the task. Subsequently, the Intelligence Reform Act called for creation of an Information Sharing Environment, including governing policies and processes for sharing, and a program manager to oversee its development. In December 2005, the President clarified the roles and responsibilities of the program manager, now under the Director of National Intelligence, as well as the new Information Sharing Council and the other agencies in support of creating an Information Sharing Environment by December 2006. At the time of our review, the program manager was in the early stages of addressing this mandate. He issued an interim implementation report with specified tasks and milestones to Congress in January 2006, but soon after announced his resignation. This latest attempt to establish an overall information-sharing road map under the Director of National Intelligence, if it is to succeed once a new manager is appointed, will require the Director's continued vigilance in monitoring progress toward meeting key milestones, identifying any barriers to achieving them, and recommending any necessary changes to the oversight committees. The agencies that GAO reviewed are using 56 different sensitive but unclassified designations (16 of which belong to one agency) to protect information that they deem critical to their missions--for example, sensitive law or drug enforcement information or controlled nuclear information. For most designations there are no governmentwide policies or procedures that describe the basis on which an agency should assign a given designation and ensure that it will be used consistently from one agency to another. Without such policies, each agency determines what designations and associated policies to apply to the sensitive information it develops or shares. More than half the agencies reported challenges in sharing such information. Finally, most of the agencies GAO reviewed have no policies for determining who and how many employees should have authority to make sensitive but unclassified designations, providing them training on how to make these designations, or performing periodic reviews to determine how well their practices are working. The lack of such recommended internal controls increases the risk that the designations will be misapplied. This could result in either unnecessarily restricting materials that could be shared or inadvertently releasing materials that should be restricted."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The government\u2019s single greatest failure in the lead-up to the September  The government\u2019s single greatest failure in the lead-up to the September  11, 2001, attacks was the inability of federal agencies to effectively share  11, 2001, attacks was the inability of federal agencies to effectively share  information about suspected terrorists and their activities, according to  information about suspected terrorists and their activities, according to  the former Vice Chair of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks  the former Vice Chair of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks  Upon the United States (9/11 Commission).

By not providing guidance and monitoring,  there is a probability that the designation will be misapplied, potentially  restricting material unnecessarily or resulting in dissemination of  information that should be restricted."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Agencies Report Using 56 Different Designations for Sensitive but Unclassified Information", "paragraphs": ["As table 2 shows, agencies reported using 56 different designations to  identify categories of sensitive but unclassified information\u2014including,  for example, For Official Use Only (FOUO) and Protected Critical  Infrastructure Information (PCII). Most of these designations are in use by  agencies that account for a large percentage of the homeland security  budget (those shown in bold in the table). However, other agencies in the  list, such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S.  Department of Agriculture (USDA) also have homeland security-related  sensitive but unclassified information. The numerous designations can be  confusing for recipients of this information, such as state and local law  enforcement agencies, which must understand and protect the information  according to each agency\u2019s own rules.", "For most of these designations, there are no governmentwide policies or  procedures to guide agency decision making on using the designations,  explaining what they mean across agencies, and assuring that the  information is protected and shared consistently from one agency to  another. Different agencies and departments currently define sensitive but  unclassified information in many different ways in accordance with their  unique missions and authorities.", "As a result of the lack of standard criteria for sensitive but unclassified  information, multiple agencies often use the same or similar terms to  designate information, but they define these terms differently. For  example, there are at least 13 agencies that use the designation For  Official Use Only, but there are at least five different definitions of FOUO.  At least seven agencies or agency components use the term Law  Enforcement Sensitive (LES), including the U.S. Marshals Service, the  Department of Homeland Security (DHS); the Department of Commerce,  and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). These agencies gave  differing definitions for the term. While DHS does not formally define the  designation, the Department of Commerce defines it to include  information pertaining to the protection of senior government officials,  and OPM defines it as unclassified information used by law enforcement  personnel that requires protection against unauthorized disclosure to  protect the sources and methods of investigative activity, evidence, and  the integrity of pretrial investigative reports.", "Agencies also use different terminology or restrictive phrases for what is  essentially the same type of information. According to a senior official in  the Delaware Department of Homeland Security, the multiple designations  are a problem. He said that often multiple terms or phrases are used by  different agencies for the same material. For example, information about a  narcotics-smuggling ring that was financing terrorism might be considered  sensitive by the DHS Customs and Border Protection component, which  would mark it as FOUO or LES and require it to be kept in a locked file,  cabinet, or desk when not in use. The same information might be marked  DEA-Sensitive by DOJ\u2019s Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), which  under its policy, requires a higher level of protection than normally  afforded sensitive but unclassified information. Additionally, the  Department of Defense, the Department of State, the Environmental  Protection Agency, and the U.S. Agency for International Development all  use the categories under FOIA that exempt information from public  disclosure as basic criteria for designating some of its sensitive  information. However, for FOIA-exempt material, DOD uses the term For  Official Use Only, State uses Sensitive But Unclassified, EPA uses FOIA,  and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) uses Sensitive  But Unclassified. Use of multiple designations such as this can hamper  sharing efforts and confuse end users about the information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Agencies and End Users Reported Challenges in Sharing Sensitive but Unclassified Information", "paragraphs": ["More than half of the agencies reported challenges in sharing sensitive but  unclassified information. For example, 11 of the 26 agencies that we  surveyed said that they had concerns about the ability of other parties to  protect sensitive but unclassified information. These concerns could lead  them to share less information than they could. DHS said that sensitive but  unclassified information disseminated to its state and local partners had,  on occasion, been posted to public Internet sites or otherwise  compromised, potentially revealing possible vulnerabilities to business  competitors. The Department of Transportation (DOT) said that the time it  takes to determine whether other departments\u2019 handling and protection  requirements meet or exceed DOT\u2019s requirements for Sensitive Security  Information represents a challenge. Six agencies said that the lack of  standardized criteria for defining what constitutes sensitive but  unclassified information was a challenge in their efforts to share  information, and DOD said that standardizing the designations and  definitions used by federal agencies for sensitive but unclassified  information might facilitate the handling and safeguarding of the  information, thereby strengthening information-sharing efforts. Four  agencies reported that they struggle with balancing the trade-off between  limited dissemination of sensitive but unclassified information in order to  protect it and broader dissemination to more stakeholders, who could use  it for their efforts. Finally, 3 agencies reported challenges in using their  designations that were not related to identifying, sharing, and safeguarding  sensitive information, and 9 agencies reported no challenges.", "First responders reported that the multiplicity of designations and  definitions not only causes confusion but leads to an alternating feast or  famine of information. Lack of clarity on the dissemination rules and lack  of common standards for controlling sensitive but unclassified  information have led to periods of oversharing of information, often  overwhelming end users with the same or similar information from  multiple sources, according to an Illinois State Police Officer."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most of the Agencies We Surveyed Do Not Determine Which Employees Can Make Sensitive but Unclassified Designations, nor Do They Provide These Employees with Training", "paragraphs": ["Of the 20 agencies that reported on who is authorized to make sensitive  but unclassified designations at their agency, 13 did not limit which  employees could apply at least one of their sensitive but unclassified  designations. For example, DHS does not limit which employees may  decide whether to designate a document For Official Use Only. At the  Department of State, there are no limits on which personnel can designate  information as sensitive but unclassified. At the National Aeronautics and  Space Administration (NASA), approximately 20,000 civil servants and  80,000 contract employees are authorized to designate information as  sensitive but unclassified using the Administratively Controlled  Information designation of the agency.

In  contrast, classified national security information is declassified as  specified by the governing executive order. The U.S. Postal Service (USPS)  set a limit of 5 years, and USDA set a limit of 10 years, after which the  designation would no longer be valid, and the information could become  publicly available. Two agencies, the General Services Administration and  the Department of Commerce, indicated that if it was possible to foresee a  specific event that could remove the need for continued protection of the  information\u2014for example, a document concerning trade negotiations  would be considered sensitive until the negotiations were ended\u2014the  agency marked the document in such a way so that the designation was  removed upon the completion of the event. Documents designated  sensitive but unclassified at the other agencies that did not set time limits  will remain so designated until a review of the document\u2019s status is  triggered by an action such as a FOIA request by a private citizen.  Continued restriction limits access to this information over the long term.", "To address the obstacles to information sharing, the Homeland Security  Act required the President to, among other things, develop policies for  sharing homeland security information, including sensitive but  unclassified information, with appropriate state and local personnel. He  delegated this responsibility to the Secretary of the newly created DHS in  July 2003. Later, in his December 2005 memo, the President gave agencies  90 days to inventory their sensitive but unclassified procedures and report  them to ODNI, which in turn is to provide them to the Secretary of DHS  and the Attorney General. Working in coordination with the Secretaries of  State, Defense, and Energy and with the DNI, they have 90 days from when  they receive the inventories to develop recommended procedures that will  provide a more standardized approach for designating homeland security  information, law enforcement information, and terrorism information as  sensitive but unclassified.

After  the 9/11 Commission\u2019s recommendation that the sharing and uses of  information be guided by a set of practical policy guidelines, Congress  passed the Intelligence Reform Act and mandated the creation of an  Information Sharing Environment (ISE), to be planned for and overseen by  a program manager. While recognizing that creating a fully functioning ISE  will take time, the program manager\u2019s interim implementation plan  includes a schedule for meeting a number of key deadlines. For example,  by June 14, 2006, the program manager and the Director of NCTC are to  have conducted a comprehensive review of all agency missions, roles, and  responsibilities both as producers and users of terrorism information.  Given that the program manager resigned and, at the time of our review, a  new one had not been appointed, meeting this deadline will be difficult.  When a new program manager is appointed, ensuring the success of this  project will require support and vigilance from ODNI as well as the other  agencies mentioned in the President\u2019s memorandum. It will be essential  that the DNI assess progress toward meeting the milestones in the interim  plan, identify and address any barriers to progress, and recommend to the  congressional oversight committees with jurisdiction any changes  necessary to achieve the goals of the mandates.", "The President\u2019s December 2005 memorandum recognizes the need to  standardize procedures for sensitive but unclassified information.  Currently, no governmentwide policies or procedures exist for most  sensitive but unclassified designations. Our work on the policies and  procedures agencies currently use can help validate ODNI\u2019s efforts in this  area. It will be important that the new policies and procedures provide for  consistent application of the designations and consistent handling  requirements. Establishing governmentwide policies and procedures is a  critical first step, but unless agencies, when implementing designations,  ensure employees have the tools they need to use the designations  accurately, and establish a monitoring system for their use, designations  could be misapplied and information might be unnecessarily restricted or  released when it should be protected. In the end, agencies need the  flexibility to use designations that meet their mission needs, but where  feasible using the same designation and handling procedures across  agencies for similar information will provide for more consistent sharing  and protection of sensitive information. Without continued vigilance, there  is danger that there will be further delays in developing a governmentwide  information-sharing policy and in establishing sensitive but unclassified  policies that better enable the sharing of the information critical to the  protection of the homeland."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To ensure effective implementation of the Intelligence Reform Act, we  recommend that the following six actions be taken:  We recommend that the Director of National Intelligence (1) assess  progress toward the milestones set in its Interim Implementation Plan;   (2) identify any barriers to achieving these milestones, such as insufficient  resources and determine ways to resolve them; and (3) recommend to the  oversight committees with jurisdiction any necessary changes to the  organizational structure or approach to creating the ISE.", "In carrying out the President\u2019s December 2005 mandates for standardizing  sensitive but unclassified information, we recommend that the Director of  National Intelligence and the Director of OMB (1) use the results of our  work to validate the inventory of designations that agencies are required  to conduct in accordance with the memo and (2) issue a policy that  consolidates sensitive but unclassified designations where possible and  addresses their consistent application across agencies.", "We recommend that the Director of OMB, in his oversight role with  respect to federal information management, work with other agencies to  develop and issue a directive requiring that agencies have in place internal  controls that meet the standards set forth in GAO\u2019s Standards for Internal  Controls in the Federal Government.

ODNI, however, declined to comment on our draft  report, stating that the review of intelligence activities is beyond GAO\u2019s  purview. We are disappointed by the lack of an ODNI response to our  report on the critical issue of information-sharing efforts in the federal  government. We have placed information sharing for homeland security on  GAO\u2019s high-risk list, in part because federal agencies have not done an  adequate job of sharing critical information in the past and because  success in this area will involve the combined efforts of multiple agencies  and key stakeholders.

In the 1988 opinion, OLC asserted that by  enacting the current intelligence oversight framework, codified at 50  U.S.C. \u00a7 413, Congress intended the intelligence committees to maintain  exclusive oversight with respect to intelligence activities, foreclosing  reviews by GAO. Although we recognize that section 413 codified  practices to simplify the congressional intelligence oversight process, we  do not agree with DOJ\u2019s view that the intelligence oversight framework  precludes GAO reviews in the intelligence arena. Neither section 413 nor  its legislative history states that the procedures established therein  constitute the exclusive mechanism for congressional oversight of  intelligence activities, to the exclusion of other relevant committees or  GAO. GAO has broad statutory authority to evaluate agency programs and  investigate matters related to the receipt, disbursement, and use of public  money. GAO also has broad authority to inspect and obtain agency  information and records, subject to a few limited exceptions.", "In any event, we do not agree with ODNI\u2019s characterization that our review  involved \u201cintelligence activities.\u201d Our review did not involve evaluation of  the conduct of actual intelligence activities. Rather, our review addresses  the procedures in place to facilitate the sharing of a broad range of  information across all levels of government. In our view ODNI\u2019s concept of  \u201cintelligence activities\u201d is overly broad and would extend to  governmentwide information-sharing efforts clearly outside the traditional  intelligence arena\u2014including, for example, procedures for sharing  sensitive but unclassified information unrelated to homeland security.
