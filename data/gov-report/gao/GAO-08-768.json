The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), is responsible for heading the joint effort. In January 2008, DHS released the National Response Framework (NRF), a revision of the 2004 National Response Plan (2004 Plan), the national preparation plan for all hazards. In response to the explanatory statement to the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008 and as discussed with congressional committees, this report evaluates the extent to which (1) DHS collaborated with non-federal stakeholders in revising and updating the 2004 Plan into the 2008 NRF and (2) FEMA has developed policies and procedures for managing future NRF revisions. To accomplish these objectives, GAO reviewed DHS and FEMA documents related to the revision process, analyzed the relevant statutes, and interviewed federal and non-federal officials who held key positions in the revision process."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["While DHS included non-federal stakeholders--state, local, and tribal governments, nongovernmental organizations, and the private sector--in the initial and final stages of revising the 2004 Plan into the NRF, it did not collaborate with these stakeholders as fully as it originally planned or as required by the October 2006 Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act (Post-Katrina Act). As the revision process began in 2006, DHS involved both federal and non-federal stakeholders by soliciting and incorporating their input in determining the key revision issues and developing the first draft in April 2007. However, after this first draft was completed, DHS deviated from its revision work plan by conducting a closed, internal federal review of the draft rather than releasing it for stakeholder comment because the draft required further modifications DHS considered necessary. DHS limited communication with non-federal stakeholders until it released a draft for public comment 5 months later on September 10, 2007. The following day, non-federal stakeholders testified at a congressional hearing that DHS had shut them out during that 5-month period. In addition, the Post-Katrina Act required that DHS establish a National Advisory Council (NAC) for the FEMA Administrator by December 2006 to, among other things, incorporate nonfederal stakeholders' input in the revision process. However, FEMA stated the necessary time to select quality NAC members required additional time, and FEMA did not announce the NAC's membership until June 2007. The NAC did not provide comments on a revision draft until one month before DHS publicly released the final NRF in January 2008. FEMA anticipates that the NRF will be revised in the future; however, FEMA does not have policies or procedures in place to guide this process or ensure a collaborative partnership with stakeholders. FEMA has emphasized the importance of partnering with relevant stakeholders to effectively prepare for and respond to major and catastrophic disasters, and the Congress, through the Post-Katrina Act, requires such partnership. In addition, the Standards for Internal Controls in the Federal Government calls for policies and procedures that establish regular communication with stakeholders and monitor performance over time as essential for achieving desired program goals. Furthermore, previous GAO work on the Department of Defense's civil support plans and the administration's national pandemic influenza implementation plan has shown the need for participation of state and local jurisdictions in emergency planning. Especially in view of a new administration, the experience of the previous revision process illustrates the importance of collaborating with stakeholders in revising a plan that relies on them for its successful implementation. While the NRF is published by DHS, it belongs to the nation's emergency response community. Developing such policies and procedures is essential for ensuring that FEMA attains the Post- Katrina Act's goal of partnering with non-federal stakeholders in building the nation's emergency management system, including the periodic review and revision of the NRF."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["A common axiom in emergency management is that \u201cAll disasters are  local.\u201d But a key lesson Hurricane Katrina dramatically emphasized was  that major disasters can quickly overwhelm the capacity of local  responders. Thus, preparing for, responding to, and recovering from major  disasters requires partnerships between the federal government and non- federal stakeholders, such as state, local, and tribal governments, the  private sector, and nongovernmental organizations. In summarizing the  lessons learned from our nation\u2019s response to Katrina, we reported in  September 2006 that these federal and non-federal partnerships were  critical to improving catastrophic disaster response. The 2006 Post- Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act (Post-Katrina Act)  specifically tasked the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)  within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to partner with these  non-federal stakeholders to build a national system of emergency  management. In outlining his vision for a \u201cNew FEMA\u201d and in testimonies  before the Congress, the FEMA Administrator has acknowledged that  FEMA\u2019s success depends on its ability to establish and maintain robust  partnerships with non-federal stakeholders.", "DHS issued the National Response Plan in December 2004 (2004 Plan) to  provide common principles and structures to align the efforts of  stakeholders at the local, state, and federal level to ensure an effective  national disaster response system. The events surrounding Hurricane  Katrina in August 2005 and the resulting lessons-learned and after-action  reports by the Congress and administration prompted DHS to revise the  just issued 2004 Plan. DHS released an interim revision of elements of the  2004 Plan in May 2006 and developed a work plan for a more  comprehensive revision in September 2006. Shortly thereafter, Congress  passed the October 2006 Post-Katrina Act, which made the FEMA  Administrator, through the National Integration Center, responsible for  ongoing management and maintenance of the 2004 Plan, including  periodic review and revision. In addition, the act required the DHS  Secretary to establish a National Advisory Council of non-federal  stakeholders to advise the FEMA Administrator in revising the 2004 Plan.  During the summer of 2007 in the midst of the revision process, non- federal members of the emergency management community raised  concerns over the extent to which DHS included them in the process. In  September 2007, the House Committee on Transportation and  Infrastructure held a hearing on DHS\u2019s management of the revision  process and the involvement of non-federal stakeholders. DHS completed  its revision efforts with the publication of the National Response  Framework (NRF) on January 22, 2008. The NRF is a guide for how the  federal, state, local, and tribal governments, along with nongovernmental  and private sector entities, will collectively respond to and recover from  all disasters, particularly catastrophic disasters such as Hurricane Katrina,  regardless of their cause. The NRF recognizes the need for collaboration  among the myriad of entities and personnel involved in response efforts at  all levels of government, nonprofit organizations, and the private sector.  See figure 1 depicting the significant events and documents in the revision  of the 2004 Plan into the 2008 NRF.", "In the explanatory statement accompanying the Consolidated  Appropriations Act of 2008, the appropriations committees tasked GAO to  review the process DHS used to update the NRF, including the process for  including key stakeholders. We conducted our review to determine the  extent to which (1) DHS collaborated with non-federal stakeholders in  revising and updating the 2004 Plan into the 2008 NRF and (2) FEMA has  developed policies and procedures for managing future revisions of the  NRF, for which it is statutorily responsible.", "To address our objectives, we reviewed DHS and FEMA documents on the  revision process and applicable statutes to determine the level to which  the revision process was planned. To determine what happened during the  process, we interviewed DHS and FEMA officials as well as non-federal  stakeholders representing state and local levels of government, emergency  management associations, and others who served in key positions in the  revision process, such as the co-leaders of work groups and members of a  steering committee. The statements and views of these stakeholders are  not generalizable to the population of non-federal stakeholders involved in  the revision process. However, we selected these stakeholders because of  their assigned key roles and believe that their views provided us with a  general indication of stakeholder perspectives on their involvement in the  revision process. To address our objectives, we reviewed DHS and FEMA  documents on the revision process and applicable statutes to determine  the level to which the revision process was planned. In assessing DHS and  FEMA actions related to these objectives, we used criteria from our prior  work on results-oriented government as well as best practices for federal  coordination and collaboration with stakeholders. We also used criteria in  GAO\u2019s Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government. These  standards, issued pursuant to the requirements of the Federal Managers\u2019  Financial Integrity Act of 1982 (FMFIA), provide the overall framework for  establishing and maintaining internal control in the federal government.  Also pursuant to FMFIA, the Office of Management and Budget issued  Circular A-123, revised December 21, 2004, to provide the specific  requirements for assessing and reporting on internal controls. Internal  control standards and the definition of internal control in Circular A-123  are based on GAO\u2019s Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government. For more detailed information on our scope and  methodology, see appendix I.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2007 to June 2008,  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency  Assistance Act (Stafford Act) primarily establishes the programs and  processes for the federal government to provide major disaster and  emergency assistance to states, local governments, tribal nations,  individuals, and qualified private nonprofit organizations. FEMA has  responsibility for administering the provisions of the Stafford Act, and the  Act provides the FEMA Administrator with the authority to prepare  federal response plans and programs. In April 1992, FEMA issued a  Federal Response Plan, which outlined how the federal government  implements the Stafford Act. The Federal Response Plan described,  among other things, the response and recovery responsibilities of each  federal department and agency for saving lives and protecting public  health and safety during an emergency or major disaster.", "After the events of September 11, 2001, and with the passage of the  Homeland Security Act in November 2002, FEMA became part of the  newly formed Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Under the Act,  FEMA retained its authority to administer the provisions of the Stafford  Act as well as its designation as the lead agency for the Federal Response  Plan. The Homeland Security Act required DHS to consolidate existing  federal government emergency response plans into a single, integrated,  and coordinated national response plan. In December 2004, DHS issued  the 2004 Plan to integrate the federal government\u2019s domestic prevention,  preparedness, response, and recovery plans into one plan that addressed  all disaster situations, whether due to nature, terrorism, or other man- made activities. The 2004 Plan incorporated or superceded other federal  interagency plans such as the Federal Response Plan and the Federal  Radiological Emergency Response Plan.", "In August 2005, Hurricane Katrina and, shortly after, hurricanes Wilma and  Rita revealed a number of limitations in the 2004 Plan. Beginning in  February 2006, reports by the House Select Bipartisan Committee to  Investigate the Preparation for and Response to Hurricane Katrina, the  Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, the  White House Homeland Security Council, the DHS Inspector General,  and DHS and FEMA all identified a variety of failures and some strengths  in the preparations for, response to, and initial recovery from Hurricane  Katrina. After reviewing these reports, DHS concluded that the 2004 Plan  required revision. In May 2006, DHS released immediate modifications to  the 2004 Plan pending a more comprehensive review. In June 2006,  Congress passed the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for  Defense, the Global War on Terror, and Hurricane Recovery, 2006. In the  conference report accompanying this act, the conferrees recommended  that FEMA apply $3 million of its Preparedness, Mitigation, Response, and  Recovery appropriation to immediately review and revise the 2004 Plan as  well as its companion document, the National Incident Management  System, which provides standard command and management structures  that apply to response activities.", "On October 4, 2006, the Post-Katrina Act was enacted. This act, among  other things, made certain organizational changes within DHS to  consolidate emergency preparedness and emergency response functions  within FEMA, required that DHS maintain FEMA as a distinct entity within  the department, and designated the FEMA Administrator\u2014the new title of  the official who will lead the agency\u2014as the principal advisor to the  President, the Homeland Security Council, and the Secretary for all  matters relating to emergency management. Most of the organizational  changes, such as the transfer of various functions from DHS\u2019s Directorate  of Preparedness to FEMA, became effective as of March 31, 2007. Others,  such as the increase in the organizational autonomy for FEMA and the  establishment of the National Integration Center, became effective upon  enactment. The Post-Katrina Act specified that the FEMA Administrator,  acting through the Center, \u201cshall ensure ongoing management and  maintenance of the\u2026National Response Plan,\u201d including periodic review  and revision. The Post-Katrina Act also directed the Secretary to establish  a National Advisory Council (NAC) by December 2006 to, among other  things, incorporate state, local, and tribal government and private sector  input in the development and revision of the 2004 Plan. As established by  the Post-Katrina Act, the NAC is intended to be an ongoing advisory  council that draws upon individuals with a broad body of expertise and  geographic and substantive diversity. The Act requires the NAC to advise  the Administrator on a variety of emergency management issues across  the national preparedness spectrum, including the 2004 Plan.", "In January 2008, DHS issued the 2008 NRF, the product of the revision of  the 2004 Plan. The NRF became effective in March 2008 and retained the  basic structure of the 2004 Plan. For example, like the 2004 Plan, the  NRF\u2019s core document describes the doctrine that guides national response  actions and the roles and responsibilities of officials and entities involved  in response efforts. Further, the NRF also includes Emergency Support  and Incident Annexes.

In May 2006, DHS issued  an official Notice of Change to the 2004 Plan to incorporate lessons  learned from the response to hurricanes Katrina, Wilma, and Rita as well  as to incorporate organizational changes within DHS. This Notice of  Change\u2014which was distributed to all signatories of the 2004 Plan, DHS  headquarters and regional offices, and state emergency management and  homeland security offices\u2014noted that DHS intended to initiate a  comprehensive stakeholder review of the 2004 Plan in the fall of 2006.  Accordingly, DHS developed a work plan to manage the revision of the  2004 Plan that established (1) the issues that were to be the focus of the  revision process, (2) the entities to be created to implement the process  and the tasks involved, and (3) a timeline for completing the revision  process and issuing the final document. DHS based its work plan for  revising the 2004 Plan on guidance found in the Plan itself. Anticipating  that modifications or updates would arise when needed, the 2004 Plan  included a section specifying how DHS would conduct interim changes  and full revisions, listing the time frames and circumstances\u2014within the  first year and every 4 years, or more frequently if the Secretary deems  necessary, to incorporate new presidential directives, legislative changes,  and procedural changes based on lessons learned from exercises and  actual events. The Domestic Readiness Group, an interagency group that  coordinates preparedness and response policy and is chaired by staff of  the White House Homeland Security Council, approved DHS\u2019s work plan  in September 2006. For the revision process, the Domestic Readiness  Group was to provide strategic policy coordination, be a mechanism for  vetting the revision at the federal level, and was to resolve conflicting  policy issues.", "The work plan contained an initial list of 14 revision issues. According to  FEMA officials, they compiled these issues by reviewing Hurricane Katrina  after-action and lessons-learned reports from the White House, Congress,  GAO, and the DHS Inspector General and identifying common issues that  were raised in multiple reports. According to the work plan, DHS was to  conduct meetings with selected stakeholders to review the initial list and  identify other issues to be considered during the revision process. The  result of these meetings was to be a finalized list of revision issues that  would serve as the starting point for revising the 2004 Plan.", "Based on the 2004 Plan, DHS created three entities to facilitate the  revision process: the Steering Committee, the Writing Team, and 12 Work  Groups. DHS provided a copy of the approved work plan to all  participants. The Steering Committee was to conduct the day-to-day  management and oversight of the 2004 Plan revision process, which  included managing the Work Groups and overseeing the Writing Team.  The work plan assigned overall management of the 2004 Plan rewrite to  the Writing Team, which was to assign issues to the Work Groups and  track the Work Groups\u2019 progress on resolving the assigned issues. The  Work Groups, which were chaired by designated co-leaders, were to  examine the issues received from the Writing Team and determine if  existing language in the 2004 Plan adequately addressed the issues. If the  Work Groups determined that current language in the 2004 Plan did not  adequately address the issue, they were required to provide  recommendations to the Writing Team on how the issues should be  addressed. Figure 2 shows the relationship between the entities involved  in the revision process.", "The revision schedule in the work plan was to begin in December 2006  with a goal to complete the revision process by June 2007.

At this meeting, FEMA  reported that non-federal stakeholders identified the need for  enhancements to the 2004 Plan to further describe coordination processes  with the private sector and volunteer organizations.

According to the FEMA Administrator,  it was more important for the agency to invest the time needed to review  hundreds of applications and create a high quality body of advisors than to  rush the process to meet the 60-day statutory deadline for establishing the  NAC.", "As a result, the NAC\u2019s only involvement in the NRF revision process  occurred when FEMA provided it with a copy of a draft in December 2007,  2 months after the public comment period closed. According to the NAC  chairman, the NAC gathered and consolidated comments from individual  members and provided these comments to the FEMA Administrator  approximately one month before FEMA published the NRF in January  2008. The chairman noted that these comments were from individual  members and did not reflect the official comments of the NAC as a whole.  For the next NRF revision, the chairman stated that he expected the NAC  to be actively involved with FEMA throughout the entire revision process.  For example, he suggested that the NAC could have a role in the  adjudication of public comments by representing non-federal stakeholders  during the adjudication process to ensure FEMA is aware of issues that are  critically important to state and local governments. The NAC is currently  exploring its role in reviewing and implementing the 2008 NRF. For  example, at the NAC\u2019s February 2008 meeting the NAC Chairman  approved a standing committee on the NRF that may focus on actions that  can help FEMA implement and train stakeholders on the NRF. While the  NAC filed a charter on February 6, 2007, the charter reflects the NAC\u2019s  broad array of statutory responsibilities, but does not detail any specific  responsibilities the NAC would undertake relative to the NRF revision  process. See figure 5 for a comparison of DHS\u2019s actual revision process  with its proposed process.", "The late establishment of the NAC also hindered FEMA from fully  collaborating with non-federal stakeholders who were involved in the  revision process established by the approved work plan. In particular, two  non-federal Steering Committee members stated that after the August 2007  leak of the draft NRF, FEMA stopped sharing drafts with non-federal  officials. FEMA officials said that the reason for this decision was because  FEMA had yet to establish the NAC, its official advisory committee. FEMA  officials said that the absence of an official advisory committee raised  fairness concerns about which members of the non-federal community  should be allowed to provide input before the public comment period. As a  result, FEMA stopped sharing pre-decisional drafts with non-federal  members of the Steering Committee because FEMA did not plan to  provide the same opportunity to other non-federal stakeholders until the  public comment period."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FEMA and the Post- Katrina Act Have Recognized the Importance of Including Non-Federal Stakeholders in Developing National Response Doctrine, but FEMA Lacks Guidance and Procedures for Future NRF Revisions", "paragraphs": ["While FEMA has recognized the importance of partnering with non-federal  stakeholders to achieve the nation\u2019s emergency management goals, both in  congressional testimonies as well as in its January 2008 strategic plan,  FEMA has not yet developed guidance and procedures for how future  revisions of the NRF will be managed or how the newly established  National Advisory Council will be integrated into the revision process in  accordance with the Post-Katrina Act.

For example, in November 2006, the FEMA Administrator outlined his  vision for a \u201cNew FEMA,\u201d asserting FEMA\u2019s dedication to partnering with  all states and the private sector because of FEMA\u2019s reliance on its partners  to accomplish the national emergency response objectives. More recently,  in congressional testimonies the FEMA Administrator has reaffirmed the  need for FEMA to partner with both federal and non-federal  stakeholders. In addition, one objective in FEMA\u2019s Strategic Plan for  2008-2013 is to engage public and private stakeholders in developing and  communicating clear national doctrine and policy. To achieve this  objective, the Strategic Plan identifies the need to engage stakeholders  early and often in the process of developing national doctrine. This is in  accordance with internal control standards for the federal government  that state that information should be communicated to those who need it  and in a form and within a time frame that enables them to carry out their  responsibility for an agency to achieve its objectives. For example,  management should ensure there are adequate means of communicating  with and obtaining information from external stakeholders who may have  a significant impact on the agency\u2019s achieving its goals. In October 2005,  we also reported that frequent communication among collaborating  organizations and stakeholders is a means to facilitate working across  boundaries, prevent misunderstanding, and achieve agency objectives.  Frequent communication is one of a number of practices that enhance and  sustain collaboration.", "Recognizing the importance of collaboration, the Post-Katrina Act requires  that the FEMA Administrator partner with non-federal stakeholders from  state, local, and tribal governments, the private sector, and  nongovernmental organizations to build a national system of emergency  management that can effectively and efficiently utilize the full measure of  the nation\u2019s resources to respond to all disasters, including catastrophic  incidents, and acts of terrorism. Specifically, the Post-Katrina Act directs  the FEMA Administrator, through the National Integration Center, to  periodically review and revise the National Response Plan and any  successor to such plan and, as discussed above, to establish the NAC to  incorporate non-federal stakeholder input in the revision and development  of the Plan, among other things. The Post-Katrina Act further directs the  FEMA Administrator to appoint council members who represent a  geographic and substantive cross section of officials, emergency  managers, and emergency response providers from the non-federal  community.", "The FEMA Administrator\u2019s statements, the agency\u2019s latest strategic plan,  and the Post-Katrina Act also reflect a key precept related to government  performance and results\u2014that stakeholders can have a significant effect  in determining whether a federal agency\u2019s program or action will succeed  or fail, and as such, stakeholders need to be involved in major planning  efforts conducted by the agency. Such involvement is important to help  agencies ensure that their efforts and resources are targeted at the highest  priorities and is particularly important in instances where federal agencies  face a complex political environment, such as emergency management in  which FEMA\u2019s successes depend on the actions of non-federal partners at  the state and local levels."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FEMA Has Not Yet Developed Guidance and Procedures for Managing Future Revisions or Integrating the National Advisory Council into the Revision Process", "paragraphs": ["While FEMA officials and the National Response Framework  acknowledge that the NRF will need to be revised in the future, FEMA has  not developed guidance or policies on how it will manage future revisions  or described how the NAC will be incorporated into the next NRF revision  process. FEMA officials said that the agency has not yet developed  guidance and procedures for any future NRF revisions because of the need  to focus federal resources on creating training materials to assist all  stakeholders in implementing the current NRF in anticipation of the  pending 2008 hurricane season. As mentioned earlier in this report, the  2004 Plan included a section specifying the circumstances, such as lessons  learned from exercises and actual events, and time frames under which it  would need to be reviewed and revised. This section is in accordance with  the federal internal control standard of monitoring operations to assess  the quality of performance over time and ensure that the findings of  reviews and evaluations are resolved. The 2008 NRF, while it states that it  merits periodic review and revision, does not contain such language  regarding the circumstances and time frames for its review and revision. In  addition, FEMA officials said that the process established for the last  revision (the 2006-approved work plan) would not be applicable for any  future revisions because it did not consider the role of the NAC. The NAC  has also not yet determined how it would like to be involved in the next  NRF revision process. The NAC\u2019s charter, approved in February 2007, does  not provide specific procedures on how it is to be involved and, according  to the chairman, the NAC\u2019s NRF subcommittee expects to focus its efforts  on helping FEMA train non-federal stakeholders.", "Having such guidance and procedures in place is an important internal  control, and we have identified this need for other agencies in similar  circumstances to FEMA\u2019s management of future NRF revisions. As we  discussed earlier in this report, control activities\u2014such as guidance,  policies, and procedures\u2014are an integral part of an agency\u2019s planning for  and achieving effective results. In addition, while internal controls should  be flexible to meet an agency\u2019s needs, they should also be clearly  documented, readily available, and properly maintained. We have also  previously reported on the need to include state and local jurisdictions in  the development of national response plans because they are key  stakeholders and would be on the front lines if an incident occurs.", "In April 2008, we reported on the need for the Department of Defense\u2019s  Northern Command to collaborate and communicate with non-federal  stakeholders and establish a process to guide such collaboration in  accessing information on state emergency response plans and capabilities,  noting that the absence of effective collaboration could impede  intergovernmental planning for catastrophic incidents and overall  coordination. Specifically, we reported that federal officials involved the  states only minimally in the development of the Department of Defense\u2019s  major homeland defense and civil support plans and that defense officials  were generally not familiar with state emergency response plans and  capabilities and had not established a process for gaining access to this  information. We also reported that each agency\u2019s roles and responsibilities  for planning for homeland defense and civil support during a catastrophic  disaster were not clearly defined. We recommended, among other things,  that the Department of Defense develop a thorough process to guide its  coordination with the states. The department generally agreed with the  recommendation and stated that it was coordinating with DHS to develop  synchronized plans of integrated federal, state, and local operational  capabilities to affect a coordinated national response. It is essential for  both the Department of Defense and DHS to have such guidance in place,  as both DHS\u2019s National Response Framework and the Northern  Command\u2019s Concept of Operations emphasize coordination with non- federal stakeholders in order to prevent, prepare for, respond to, and  recover from catastrophic natural and manmade disasters.  In August 2007, we reported on the administration\u2019s approach to preparing  for a pandemic influenza by issuing, among other things, a National  Strategy for Pandemic Influenza (Strategy) in November 2005, and a  National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza Implementation Plan (Plan)  in May 2006. We reported, among other things, that state and local  jurisdictions were not directly involved in developing the Strategy and  Plan. Neither the Strategy nor Plan described the involvement of key  stakeholders, such as state, local, and tribal entities, in their development,  even though these stakeholders would be on the front lines in a pandemic  and the Plan identifies actions they should complete. Officials told us that  while the drafters of the Plan were generally aware of their concerns,  state, local, and tribal entities were not directly involved in reviewing and  commenting on the Plan. We concluded that opportunities existed to  improve the usefulness of the Plan because it was viewed as an evolving  document and was intended to be updated on a regular basis to reflect  ongoing policy decisions as well as improvements in domestic  preparedness. However, time frames or mechanisms for updating the Plan  were undefined. We recommended that the White House Homeland  Security Council establish a specific process and time frame for updating  the Plan and that the update process should involve key non-federal  stakeholders and incorporate lessons learned from exercises and other  sources, but the Homeland Security Council did not provide comments on  this recommendation.", "Without similar policies and procedures documenting the circumstances  and time frames under which it would review and revise the NRF and its  process for collaborating with non-federal stakeholders, FEMA cannot  ensure that future revision processes will be conducted in accordance  with management\u2019s directives."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["All disasters occur locally, and the initial post-disaster response is local.  However, large-scale disasters usually exceed local response capabilities.  Effective preparation and response for major and catastrophic disasters  require well-planned and well-coordinated actions among all those who  would have a role in the response to such disasters. The 2008 NRF is a  guide for the myriad of entities and personnel involved in response efforts  at all levels. The NRF recognizes the need for collaboration among these  stakeholders to collectively respond to and recover from all disasters,  particularly catastrophic disasters such as Hurricane Katrina, regardless of  their cause.", "To help ensure that the NRF meets the needs of all stakeholders who have  a role in its effective implementation, it is essential that DHS fully  collaborate with non-federal stakeholders in its development and revision.  DHS initially involved non-federal stakeholders in the revision of the 2004  Plan but omitted a key step in its work plan by not obtaining and  incorporating their comments on the first full draft. Instead, DHS  undertook a closed, internal federal review of the draft that lasted about 5  months with little communication with the non-federal partners. The  result was a breach of trust with DHS\u2019s non-federal partners in the drafting  process.", "The Post-Katrina Act gives responsibility for maintaining and updating the  NRF to FEMA and charges the Administrator\u2019s National Advisory Council  with incorporating non-federal stakeholder input into the NRF\u2019s  development and revision.

Especially in view of a new administration, non-federal  stakeholder participation and ownership is essential in any revision of the  NRF, and the lessons learned from the process for revising the 2004 Plan  will apply in the future to FEMA\u2019s and DHS\u2019s efforts to develop and revise  other national plans and policies that make up the national preparedness  system.

(2) To what extent has FEMA developed policies and procedures  for managing future revisions of the NRF?", "To address these questions, we interviewed DHS, FEMA, and non-federal  stakeholders who were directly involved in the revision and update of the  2004 Plan into the 2008 NRF, and we reviewed DHS and FEMA documents  on the revision process. Because there were over 700 federal and non- federal officials who participated in the Steering Committee and Work  Groups, we interviewed those who held key positions. The FEMA officials  and non-federal stakeholders we interviewed held key positions in the  revision process, such as the FEMA Administrator and Deputy  Administrator and the two FEMA co-chairs of the Steering Committee. The  non-federal stakeholders we interviewed included four of the five non- federal officials who served as Steering Committee members and all three  of the non-federal officials who served as co-leaders of Work Groups;  these non-federal stakeholders also held positions in state, county, and  city governments and non-governmental organizations.", "To determine the extent to which DHS collaborated with non-federal  stakeholders, we first determined the revision process that DHS had  planned to follow to revise the 2004 Plan.

We also reviewed applicable statutes, primarily the  October 2006 Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act, for  statutory requirements related to the revision process. To determine what  happened during the revision process and the extent to which DHS  involved non-federal stakeholders in that process, we interviewed FEMA  officials and non-federal stakeholders who served in key positions in the  revision process and the chairman of FEMA\u2019s National Advisory Council  (NAC). Further, we reviewed DHS documentation citing the roles provided  to non-federal stakeholders in the revision process and explaining how the  actual revision process was conducted, FEMA documentation on the  process and time frames related to the NAC\u2019s establishment, NAC  documentation regarding its role in the revision process, and  congressional testimony from non-federal stakeholders on how DHS  conducted and included them in the revision process.

However, because DHS\u2019s inclusion of non-federal members in the  revision process is the focus of this report, we took steps to correctly  determine the number and composition of the 224 non-federal members.   Based on our analysis of FEMA\u2019s data for federal members, we believe the  total of 486 federal members is a reasonable approximation, and therefore,  the grand total of 710 Work Group members is also a reasonable  approximation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: The 17 Key Revision Issues That DHS Identified for the 2004 National Response Plan", "paragraphs": ["In the 2004 National Response Plan revision work plan approved by the  Domestic Readiness Group, a White House Homeland Security Council\u2013 chaired policy committee, in September 2006, DHS identified 14 key issues  that it wanted the revision process to address. According to FEMA  officials, these issues were compiled by reviewing Hurricane Katrina after- action and lessons-learned reports from the White House, Congress, GAO,  and DHS\u2019s Inspector General and identifying common issues that were  raised in multiple reports. The work plan directed DHS to conduct  meetings with stakeholders to review the initial list and identify other  issues to be considered during the revision process. These issues were to  serve as the starting point from which the 2004 Plan revision would be  conducted. DHS held meetings with non-federal stakeholder and federal  stakeholders in October and November 2006 respectively.

The Base  Plan provided an overview of the structure and processes comprising a  national approach to domestic response actions.
