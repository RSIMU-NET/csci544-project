The estimated total investment for JSF now approaches $1 trillion to acquire and maintain 2,458 aircraft. Under congressional mandate, GAO has annually reviewed the JSF program since 2005. GAO's prior reviews have identified a number of issues and recommended actions for reducing risks and improving the program's outcomes. This report, the fourth under the mandate, focuses on the program's progress in meeting cost, schedule, and performance goals; plans and risks in development and test activities; the program's cost-estimating methods; and future challenges facing the program. To conduct its work, GAO identified changes in cost and schedule from prior years and their causes, evaluated development progress and plans, assessed cost-estimating methodologies against best practices, and analyzed future budget requirements."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Since last year's report, the JSF program office estimates that total acquisition costs increased by more than $23 billion, primarily because of higher estimated procurement costs. The JSF development cost estimate stayed about the same. Development costs were held constant by reducing requirements, eliminating the alternate engine program, and spending management reserve faster than budgeted. Facing a probable contract cost overrun, DOD implemented a Mid-Course Risk Reduction Plan to replenish management reserves from about $400 million to about $1 billion by reducing test resources. Progress has been reported in several important areas, including partner agreements, first flights of a JSF prototype and test bed, and a more realistic procurement schedule. The midcourse plan carries the risk of design and performance problems not being discovered until late in the operational testing and production phases, when it is significantly more costly to address such problems. The plan also fails to address the production and schedule concerns that depleted management reserves. Cost and schedule pressures are mounting. Two-thirds of budgeted funding for JSF development has been spent, but only about one-half of the work has been completed. The contractor is on its third, soon to be fourth, manufacturing schedule, but test aircraft in manufacturing are still behind, the continuing impacts of late designs, delayed delivery of parts, and manufacturing inefficiencies. We believe that JSF costs will likely be much higher than reported. The estimates do not include all costs, including about $6.8 billion for the alternate engine program. In addition, some assumptions are overly optimistic and not well documented. Three independent defense offices separately concluded that program cost estimates are understated by as much as $38 billion and that the development schedule is likely to slip from 12 to 27 months. Discrepancies in cost estimates add to program risks and hinder congressional oversight. Even so, DOD does not plan for another fully documented, independent total program life-cycle cost estimate until 2013. As JSF finalizes the three designs, matures manufacturing processes, conducts flight tests, and ramps up production, it faces significant challenges. JSF's goal--to develop and field an affordable, highly common family of strike aircraft--is threatened by rising unit procurement prices and lower commonality than expected. The program also makes unprecedented funding demands--an average of $11 billion annually for two decades--and must compete with other defense and nondefense priorities for the shrinking federal discretionary dollar. Further, expected cost per flight hour now exceeds that of the F-16 legacy fighter, one of the aircraft it is intended to replace. With almost 90 percent (in terms of dollars) of the acquisition program still ahead, it is important to address these challenges, effectively manage future risks, and move forward with a successful program that meets our and our allies' needs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) is Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) most  complex and ambitious aircraft acquisition, seeking to simultaneously  produce and field three aircraft variants for the Air Force, Navy, Marine  Corps, and eight international partners.

Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  2005 requires GAO to review the JSF program annually for five years.  Previous reports identified opportunities for the program to reduce risks  and improve the chance for more successful outcomes. We have  expressed concern about the substantial overlap of development, test, and  production activities and recommended a more evolutionary and  knowledge-based acquisition strategy with limited investment in  production aircraft until each variant demonstrates required capabilities in  flight testing. This is the fourth report under the mandate in which we (1)  determine the JSF program\u2019s progress in meeting cost, schedule, and  performance goals; (2) assess plans and risks in development and test  activities; (3) evaluate program office cost-estimating methodology; and  (4) identify future challenges facing the program.", "The act also requires us to certify whether we had access to sufficient  information to make informed judgments on the matters contained in our  report. While we were provided sufficient information to make the  assessments contained in this report, a continuing concern has been the  currency of cost and schedule data. The data we are reporting here are  from the JSF Selected Acquisition Report (SAR) dated December 2006 that  was released to Congress and us in April 2007. That SAR reflects the  program position at the time of the submission of the fiscal year 2008  President\u2019s Budget. We were not able to review the program office\u2019s  updated estimates associated with the fiscal year 2009 budget, which will  be reported in the new December 2007 SAR to be released in April 2008.  The program office declined to provide updated costs, stating that those  figures are sensitive because the new budget request had not been  finalized at the time of our review. Every year, this timing disconnect  results in us reporting soon-to-be-outdated cost and schedule data. For  example, shortly after our last report was issued on March 15, 2007, DOD  released new cost estimates that disclosed an increase of more than $23  billion in JSF program costs. On the basis of the evidence we do have and  our analysis, we fully expect future cost estimates to be substantially  higher than the program estimates in this report.", "To conduct this work, we tracked and compared current cost and  schedule estimates with those of prior years, identified major changes, and  determined causes.  We obtained earned value data, contractor workload  statistics, performance indicators, and manufacturing results.  We  assessed the program office\u2019s cost estimating methodologies against best  practices prescribed in GAO\u2019s Cost Assessment Guide.  We discussed  results to date, plans, and future challenges with DOD and contractor  officials.  We conducted this performance audit from June 2007 to March  2008 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

The conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL) variant will  primarily be an air-to-ground replacement for the Air Force\u2019s F-16 Falcon  and the A-10 Warthog aircraft, and will complement the F-22A Raptor. The  short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) variant will be a multirole  strike fighter to replace the Marine Corps\u2019 F/A-18C/D and AV-8B Harrier  aircraft. The carrier-suitable (CV) variant will provide the Navy a multi- role, stealthy strike aircraft to complement the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet.  DOD is planning to buy a total of 2,458 JSFs. The F-35 JSF was christened  Lightning II in July 2006.", "Because of the program\u2019s sheer size and the numbers of aircraft it will  replace, the JSF is the linchpin of DOD\u2019s long-term plan to modernize  tactical air forces. It is DOD\u2019s largest acquisition program, with total cost  currently estimated at $300 billion; the longest in planned duration, with  procurement projected through 2034; and the largest cooperative  international development program. Our international partners are  providing about $4.8 billion toward development, and foreign firms are  part of the industrial base producing aircraft. They are expecting to  procure a minimum of 646 CTOL and STOVL JSFs. DOD\u2019s funding  requirements for the JSF assume the benefits in reduced unit costs from  these purchases.", "Figure 1 shows the JSF\u2019s current procurement profile for U.S. and  international partners. Partner purchases begin in 2009 and reach a  maximum of 95 per year in fiscal year 2016. Total expected procurement in  that peak year, including U.S. quantities, is 225 aircraft.", "The JSF is a single-seat, single-engine aircraft, designed to rapidly  transition between air-to-ground and air-to-air missions while still  airborne. To achieve its mission, JSF will incorporate low-observable  technologies, defensive avionics, advanced onboard and offboard sensor  fusion, internal and external weapons, and advanced prognostic  maintenance capability. According to DOD, these technologies represent a  quantum leap over legacy tactical aircraft capabilities. In several ways, JSF  development is also more complex and challenging than the F-22A Raptor  and F/A-18E/F Super Hornet programs, the other two contemporary  aircraft that DOD is acquiring with JSF to recapitalize tactical air forces.  The JSF program is simultaneously developing several airframes and  engines for multiple customers and is projected to have significantly more  lines of operational flight plan software code than the other aircraft.", "The JSF program began in November 1996 with a 5-year competition  between Lockheed Martin and Boeing to determine the most capable and  affordable preliminary aircraft design. Lockheed Martin won the  competition. The program entered system development and demonstration  in October 2001. At that time, officials planned on a 10\u00bd years  development period costing about $34 billion (amount includes costs of  about $4 billion incurred before system development start).  By 2003,  system integration efforts and a preliminary design review revealed  significant airframe weight problems that affected the aircraft\u2019s ability to  meet key performance requirements. Weight reduction efforts were  ultimately successful but added substantially to program cost and  schedule estimates. In March 2004, DOD rebaselined the program (2004  Replan), extending development by 18 months and adding $7.5 billion to  development costs. Program officials also delayed the critical design  reviews, first flights of development aircraft, and the low-rate initial  production decision to allow more time to mitigate risks and mature  designs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Progress Measured against Cost, Schedule, and Performance Goals Was Mixed over the Last Year", "paragraphs": ["The total program acquisition cost estimate by the JSF program office has  increased since our report last year, primarily due to higher projected  procurement unit prices.

Offsetting a portion of the procurement cost increases  were lower estimates for labor rates and subcontractor costs.", "The official development cost estimate has remained relatively constant  since the 2004 Replan. However, there were significant changes in scope  and planned use of funds in order to maintain that estimate as officials  reduced requirements, did not include full funding for the alternate engine  program despite congressional interest in the program, and spent  management reserves much faster than budgeted. Management reserves  are a pool of money set aside\u2014in this case about 10 percent of the  development contract value remaining\u2014to handle unanticipated changes  and other risks encountered as a development program proceeds. Weight  growth early in development and subsequent problems resulting from late  aircraft design changes and subsequent manufacturing inefficiencies  depleted reserve funds to an untenable level by 2007. The program faced a  probable contract overrun. DOD officials opted not to request additional  funding and time to complete development and instead adopted a  controversial plan that reduced budgeted funds for development test  aircraft and flight plans in order to replenish management reserves from  $400 million to about $1 billion, an amount deemed prudent to complete  the development phase on time. This plan, known as the Mid-Course Risk  Reduction plan, is discussed in more detail later in this report.", "Reported schedule slips for key events since last year\u2019s report were minor  for the most part, but schedules could worsen considerably if the delays in  maturing the aircraft and engine designs and manufacturing test aircraft  continue to push work effort into later years. This would further compress  the time available to complete development and test efforts, affecting the  scheduled start of initial operational test and evaluation and the full-rate  production decision, and increasing the risk of further delivery delays. The  CV\u2019s critical design review, the last of three design reviews for the  program, occurred in June 2007, seven months later than had been  expected. The initial operational capability date for this variant was  pushed out two years to March 2015, to provide more time to mature  design and test this variant in the demanding carrier environment. The  carrier variant is the least developed of the three, incorporates larger  wings, is heavier, and has different speed and range performance  requirements than the other two variants.", "On the basis of engineering analyses and computer modeling, the JSF  program projects that the aircraft design will meet seven of the eight key  performance parameters by the end of development.

At development start, JSF budgeted reserves at 10 percent of  contract value and expected to draw on them at about the same rate as  contract execution. However, the program has had to use these funds  much faster than expected to pay for persistent development cost  increases and schedule delays. A combination of factors contributed to  this problem, such as late release of engineering drawings, production  taking longer than planned, and late delivery of parts from suppliers. In  turn, these contributed to continuing cost and schedule impacts in the  manufacture of development test aircraft, including extensive and  inefficient out-of-station work and delays in proving out the production  schedule. Figure 2 shows how management reserves totaling almost $1.4  billion have been depleted since the 2004 Replan.", "By mid-2007, the development program had completed one-half of the  amount of work scheduled, but had expended two-thirds of the budget.  Management reserves had shrunk to about $400 million, less than one-half  the amount officials believed necessary to complete the final 6 years of  development. At the same time, the program faced significant  manufacturing and software integration challenges, costly flight testing,  and $950 million in other known cost risks. This presented the program  with a likely untenable contract overrun sometime in 2008 if no action was  taken. JSF program management identified a continuing persistent cost  variance of $250 million to $300 million in the aircraft development  contract and the associated shortfall in reserves that required near-term  action beyond \u201cbelt tightening.\u201d", "An overarching integrated product team considered several alternative  actions, including doing nothing and adding funds from procurement, but  the team chair concluded that replenishment of the management reserve  was essential to position the JSF program to successfully address its  anticipated future development challenges. This option, dubbed the Mid- Course Risk Reduction Plan, removed two development aircraft (one  CTOL and one CV), eliminated approximately 850 test flights from the  current test plan, revised the verification strategy, increased the use of  ground test labs and the flying test bed, and maximized the number of test  points to be accomplished during test flights. The plan also accelerated  reductions in contractor staff and took other actions. In total, these  planned actions are expected to add between $470 million and $650  million into the reserve to recapitalize it to about $1 billion, an amount  officials believe will be needed to complete development. Officials intend  to use reserves to recover cost and schedule losses in manufacturing and  to cover additional future needs.", "This plan was subsequently approved by OSD, although serious risks were  acknowledged and the team was divided on whether the added risks  outweighed the intended benefit. Those in favor of the plan believed that  actions were urgently needed to fix the funding imbalance and avoid a  contract overrun. In this view, the plan would serve as a stopgap measure  to delay another program restructure until more program knowledge and a  clearer understanding of future cost requirements were gained.", "Officials from several defense offices thought the risks to testing were too  great and that the plan did not address the underlying design and  manufacturing problems. The Director, Operational Test and Evaluation,  identified specific risks associated with the revised test verification  strategy and recommended against deleting the aircraft, citing inadequate  capacity to handle the pace of mission testing, and for ship suitability,  signature testing, and suitability evaluations. This increased the likelihood  of not finding and resolving critical design deficiencies until operational  testing, when it is more costly and disruptive to do so. OSD\u2019s Systems and  Software Engineering office concurred, expressed concerns that the plan  did not treat the root causes of ongoing production problems, and doubted  that the contractor schedule was achievable.  The Cost Analysis  Improvement Group and others agreed that there was too much risk in  reducing test assets at this time since no production representative variant  had started flight tests and no analysis of the management reserve  depletion had been completed.

DOD\u2019s Cost Analysis  Improvement Group found that the assumptions the JSF program office  used for weight growth, staffing head counts, commonality savings for  cousin (similar) parts, and outsourced labor rate savings could be too  optimistic, given the program\u2019s complexity.  With three variants and three  engines (cruise, alternate, and lift) in development, multiple customers,  and more than double the amount of operational flight software than the  F-22A and four times that of the F/A-18E/F, the JSF acquisition program is  substantially more complex than those contemporary systems, and  therefore may not merit assumptions that are even as optimistic as the  historical data for those programs. The following table shows some major  differences in assumptions used by the program office and the CAIG in  estimating JSF costs.", "JSF program officials told us that they use Lockheed Martin earned value  management data in creating their estimate of JSF development costs.  However, DCMA, which reviews contracts and industrial performance for  DOD, identified this data as being of very poor quality, calling into  question the accuracy of any estimate based on these data. In November  2007, DCMA issued a report saying that Lockheed Martin\u2019s tracking of cost  and schedule information at its aerospace unit in Fort Worth, Texas\u2014 where the JSF program is managed\u2014is deficient to the point where the  government is not obtaining useful program performance data to manage  risks.", "DCMA said that Lockheed\u2019s earned value data at the Fort Worth facility  are not sufficient to manage complex, multibillion-dollar weapon systems  acquisition programs. Among other problem areas, DCMA found that  Lockheed had not clearly defined roles and responsibilities, and was using  management reserve funds to alter its own and subcontractor  performance levels and cost overruns. These issues hurt DOD\u2019s ability to  use the Lockheed data to determine product delivery dates and develop  accurate estimates of program costs. DCMA officials who conducted the  review at Lockheed Martin told us that the poor quality of the data  invalidated key performance metrics regarding cost and schedule, as well  as the contractor\u2019s estimate of the cost to complete the contract. NAVAIR  had also raised concerns about Lockheed Martin\u2019s earned value system as  early as June 2005, and these officials told us they were in agreement with  the findings in the November 2007 DCMA report. NAVAIR officials also  said that most deficiencies identified by the DCMA report have the effect  of underreporting costs, and that the official program cost estimates will  increase if the deficiencies are corrected.", "Also in 2007, the prime contractor alerted DOD to a billing error involving  duplicate charges for the portion of the earned award fee paid to  subcontractors. This resulted in $266 million in overcharges. Government  officials became concerned that such a large discrepancy could occur  without the government\u2019s knowledge and questioned the adequacy of the  contractor\u2019s billing system and accounting procedures. DCMA and the  Defense Contract Audit Agency were tasked to conduct an investigation.   Their investigation found that the overbilling resulted from an accounting  system error in the internal handling of award fees on the JSF contract.  According to the investigation report, the error that created the overbilling  has been corrected, and the government has recouped the overbilled  principal and interest."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The JSF Cost Estimate Is Not Well Documented", "paragraphs": ["Cost estimates are well documented when they can be easily repeated or  updated and can be traced to original sources through auditing.

All the steps involved in developing the estimate should be documented so  that a cost analyst unfamiliar with the program can recreate the estimate  with the same result.", "We found that the JSF cost model is highly complex and the level of  documentation is not sufficient for someone unfamiliar with the program  to easily recreate it. Specifically, we found that the program office does  not have formal documentation for the development, production, and  operating support cost models. Instead, it relies on briefing slides that  describe the methodology and the data sources used, but did not provide  detailed documentation such as quantitative analysis to support the  assumptions that were involved in producing the life-cycle cost estimate.   For the development cost estimate, the JSF program office admitted it did  not have a cost model that continually updates with actual costs.  Instead  the program office relies heavily on earned value management data and  analysis from Lockheed Martin to update its development cost estimate,  but provided us no documentation to back up this claim."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The JSF Cost Estimate Is Not Credible", "paragraphs": ["Estimates are credible when they have been cross-checked with an  independent cost estimate and when a level of uncertainty associated with  the estimate has been identified.  An independent cost estimate provides  the estimator with an unbiased test of the reasonableness of the estimate  and reduces the cost risk associated with the project by demonstrating  that alternative methods generate similar results.", "Several independent organizations have reviewed the JSF program and are  predicting much higher costs than the program office.  Table 7 below  provides a summary of these assessments.", "In 2005, the CAIG performed an independent estimate of JSF program  development costs, which include the cost of the Lockheed Martin  contract and fees as well as the government\u2019s in-house costs. The CAIG  expected that the development phase would cost $5.1 billion more than  expected by the program office, measured against the program office\u2019s  most recent data available at that time, from the 2004 Selected Acquisition  Report (SAR). The CAIG official in charge of the estimate told us that  while it has not formally presented an updated estimate to the program  office, the order of magnitude of difference between the CAIG and  program office estimates remains roughly the same as at the time of the  2005 independent estimate.", "The variance between the CAIG and program office estimates grew  significantly as the program encountered problems. The CAIG explained  that some of the $15.2 billion growth in its development cost estimate from  Milestone B in 2001 to the December 2004 SAR was due to initial  assumptions that 5,000 engineers would be available to work on the three  JSF variants.  This assumption turned out to be too optimistic since only  about 3,000 engineers have been working on the program.  Because of  fewer people available to support the JSF design and development, the  CAIG shifted the program schedule to the right, increasing the costs.  The  program office, on the other hand, assumed it could get the same effort  done with fewer people.  In addition, the CAIG used historical data from  the F-22A program, including the costs to design the aircraft, test it, and  redesign any fixes, and adjusted these data to account for differences in  the JSF program, including the three variants.  The program office relies  mostly on contractor data.", "When it was awarded the development contract in 2001, Lockheed Martin  agreed to develop the JSF aircraft for $16.5 billion, excluding fee.  In April  2005, the development program was rebaselined, adding more than $6  billion to reflect funds added to the program due to weight growth issues  in 2003.  This raised the JSF baseline development contract cost estimate  to $23.2 billion, excluding fee.", "Despite the additional funding to cover preexisting cost and schedule  overruns, Lockheed Martin\u2019s JSF development cost and schedule  performance has continued to decline over time.  As shown in figure 6,  cost and schedule variances continued on a downward trend despite the  April 2005 rebaseline.  As of September 2007, Lockheed Martin was  reporting cumulative cost overruns of $305.7 million and was behind  schedule to an extent valued at $251.3 million.", "Key drivers of cost overruns to date have included unfunded requirements  for design changes, loss of commonality savings, critical part shortages,  high change traffic, inefficient productivity due to performing work out of  sequence, constant rework, suppliers\u2019 performance, late release of  engineering requirements, a greater than planned effort for designs of the  short takeoff and landing and the conventional takeoff and landing  variants, and additional radar testing.  Some of this cost variance is due to  optimistic assumptions at the beginning of the program.  For example,  cost estimates assumed that only one design iteration would be needed,  whereas in reality it takes numerous design iterations before the final  designs are determined.", "Despite its poor performance since the rebaseline, Lockheed Martin was  predicting only a $113 million cost overrun at contract completion.  This is  unrealistic given the persistence and size of the $305.7 million overrun  reported in September 2007, at which point the contract was 67 percent  complete.  In order to achieve a $113 million overrun at completion,  Lockheed Martin would have to not only incur no further cost variances  from now until completion of the contract, but it would also have to  significantly improve its performance.  This is unlikely given that studies  of more than 700 defense programs have shown limited opportunity for  getting a program back on track once it is more than 15 percent to 20  percent complete. The true cost to complete the contract may be  significantly greater, as DCMA has expressed its concern to DOD over  Lockheed Martin\u2019s failure to regularly update its estimate of the costs to  complete the JSF contract, stating that Lockheed\u2019s infrequent updates are  insufficient to provide the government with information bearing on  potential cost growth and funding needs.", "Like the CAIG, both DCMA and NAVAIR believe that Lockheed Martin\u2019s  estimate at completion is too optimistic and that the program office will  most likely require significantly more funding to complete the  development program.  NAVAIR provides resources to the JSF program  office cost-estimating function, and it estimated in 2006 that JSF  development costs could be almost $8 billion to $13 billion higher than  estimated by the program office, or else cost billions more in procurement  due to requirements pushed off from development. NAVAIR officials told  us they believe that the 2006 estimate continues to be accurate today, but  explained that since the JSF program is a joint program they do not  control JSF cost-estimating procedures, although their estimates are  briefed to JSF program management. The estimate removed what NAVAIR  views as artificial constraints on the JSF schedule and projected forward,  resulting in an estimate that the schedule would likely slip 19 to 27  months, and combined this with trends in cost performance.  NAVAIR  officials said that their confidence in the achievability of the JSF program  schedule is low, as the master schedule comprises more than 600  individual schedules, making it difficult to accurately assess the  achievability of the overall schedule.", "DCMA estimates that JSF development could cost as much as $4.9 billion  more than program office estimates, accounting for poor cost and  schedule performance to date and assuming further schedule slips of up to  12 months. DCMA confirmed that a schedule risk analysis, which uses  statistical techniques to obtain a measure of confidence in completing a  program, has never been performed on the JSF program. Since historically  state-of-the-art development programs have taken longer than planned, a  schedule risk analysis should be conducted to determine the level of  uncertainty in the schedule. Despite these outside organizations\u2019  predictions of significantly higher costs to complete the JSF contract and  the lack of realism in the contractor\u2019s own estimate, the JSF program  office continues to use the contractor\u2019s estimate as its own.", "In addition to expected cost overruns for JSF development, the CAIG is  predicting significantly higher costs for JSF for the military services to  purchase the aircraft. Using different assumptions about weight growth,  labor rates, avionics and propulsion costs, and contractor fees, the CAIG  calculated significantly higher unit costs for the aircraft variants (see table  6 earlier in this report for comparison of CAIG and program office  assumptions affecting both development and procurement costs  estimates). Multiplying these higher unit costs by the expected  procurement quantities leads to a more than $33 billion (in constant year  2002 dollars) difference from official program office estimates for  procurement costs. The CAIG estimates were briefed in 2006 to the DOD  working group that oversees the JSF program, and top OSD officials were  aware of the discrepancy between the CAIG and JSF program office  estimates.", "The program office has not conducted an uncertainty analysis on its cost  estimates despite the complexity of the program and associated risk and  uncertainty. As shown in table 10, the JSF program is significantly more  complicated than comparable aircraft development programs.", "This complexity makes it all the more necessary to fully account for the  effect various risks can have on the overall cost estimate.  An uncertainty  analysis assesses the extent to which the variability of an outcome  variable is caused by uncertainty in the input parameters.  It should be  performed for every cost estimate in order to inform decision makers  about the likelihood of success.  In performing uncertainty analysis, an  organization varies the effects of multiple elements on costs, and as a  result, can express a level of confidence in the point estimate.", "We found that the JSF program has not conducted an uncertainty analysis.  Such analysis would provide a range of possible values to program  management and an estimate of the likelihood of the various possibilities.  Instead, the program office only offers a single point estimate\u2014one dollar  figure, with no associated range\u2014and no technical analysis of the  likelihood that this estimate is credible. The lead cost estimator for the  program office acknowledged that such a single point estimate is virtually  certain to be wrong, but also stated that the analysis used to develop a  range of values is easily manipulated and therefore not valuable. It is  GAO\u2019s view that a point estimate should be accompanied by an estimated  confidence level to quantify the uncertainty surrounding the estimate in  order for management to make good decisions. Because the JSF program  office has not conducted an uncertainty analysis, it is unable to provide  Congress with any confidence level for its point estimate of approximately  $300 billion for JSF acquisition."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["Joint Strike Fighter: Impact of Recent Decisions on Program Risks.
