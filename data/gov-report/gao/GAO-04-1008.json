While development of a core financial system can never be risk free, effective implementation of disciplined processes can reduce those risks to acceptable levels. The problems that have been identified in such key areas as requirements management, including developing a concept of operations, testing, data conversion, systems interfaces, and risk management, compounded by incomplete IT management practices, information security weaknesses, and problematic human capital practices, significantly increase the risks that UFMS will not fully meet one or more of its cost, schedule, and performance objectives. With initial deployment of UFMS at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) scheduled for October 2004, HHS has not developed sufficient quantitative measures for determining the impact of the many process weaknesses identified by GAO and others to evaluate its project efforts. Without well-defined requirements that are traceable from origin to implementation, HHS cannot be assured that the system will provide the functionality needed and that testing will identify significant defects in a timely manner prior to rollout when they are less costly to correct. The agency has not developed the necessary framework for testing requirements, and its schedule leaves little time for correcting process weaknesses and identified defects. HHS has focused on meeting its predetermined milestones in the project schedule to the detriment of disciplined processes. If HHS continues on this path, it risks not achieving its goal of a common accounting system that produces data for management decision making and financial reporting and risks perpetuating its long-standing accounting system weaknesses with substantial workarounds to address needed capabilities that have not been built into the system. Accordingly, GAO believes these issues need to be addressed prior to deployment at CDC. Beyond the risks associated with this specific system development, HHS has departmental weaknesses in IT investment management, enterprise architecture, and information security. Because of the risks related to operating UFMS in an environment with flawed information security controls, HHS needs to take action to ensure that UFMS benefits from strong information security controls. HHS is modifying its IT investment management policies, developing an enterprise architecture, and responding to security weaknesses with several ongoing activities, but substantial progress in these areas is needed to prevent increased risks to cost, schedule, and performance objectives for UFMS. In human capital, many positions were not filled as planned and strategic workforce planning was not timely. HHS has taken the first steps to address these issues; however, ongoing staff shortages have played a role in several key deliverables being significantly behind schedule."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The ability to produce the information needed to efficiently and effectively  manage the day-to-day operations of the federal government and provide  accountability to taxpayers and the Congress has been a long-standing  challenge for federal agencies.

Although the  implementation of any major system is not a risk-free proposition,  organizations that follow and effectively implement accepted best  practices in systems development and implementation (commonly referred  to as disciplined processes) can reduce these risks to acceptable levels.   The use of the term acceptable levels acknowledges the fact that any  systems acquisition has risks and will suffer the adverse consequences  associated with defects.

Although  there is no standard set of practices that will ever guarantee success,  several organizations, such as SEI and IEEE, as well as individual  experts, have identified and developed the types of policies, procedures,  and practices that have been demonstrated to reduce development time  and enhance effectiveness. The key to having a disciplined system  development effort is to have disciplined processes in multiple areas,  including project planning and management, requirements management,  configuration management, risk management, quality assurance, and  testing. Effective processes should be implemented in each of these areas  throughout the project life cycle because change is constant.  Effectively  implementing the disciplined processes necessary to reduce project risks  to acceptable levels is hard to achieve because a project must effectively  implement several best practices, and inadequate implementation of any  one may significantly reduce or even eliminate the positive benefits of the  others.", "Acquiring and implementing a new financial management system requires a  methodology that starts with a clear definition of the organization's mission  and strategic objectives and ends with a system that meets specific  information needs.  We have seen many system efforts fail because  agencies started with a general need, such as improving financial  management, but did not define in precise terms (1) the specific problems  they were trying to solve, (2) what their operational needs were, and   (3) what specific information requirements flowed from these operational  needs.  Instead, they plunged into the acquisition and implementation  process in the belief that these specifics would somehow be defined along  the way.  The typical result was that systems were delivered well past  anticipated milestones; failed to perform as expected; and, accordingly,  were overbudget because of required costly modifications.", "Figure 2 shows how organizations that do not effectively implement the  disciplined processes lose the productive benefits of their efforts as a  project continues through its development and implementation cycle.   Although undisciplined projects show a great deal of productive work at  the beginning of the project, the rework associated with defects begins to  consume more and more resources.  In response, processes are adopted in  the hopes of managing what later turns out, in reality, to have been  unproductive work.  Generally, these processes are \u201ctoo little, too late\u201d and  rework begins to consume more and more resources because sufficient  foundations for building the systems were not done or not done adequately.

Rework occurs  when the original work has defects or is no longer needed because of  changes in project direction.  Disciplined organizations focus their efforts  on reducing the amount of rework because it is expensive.  Fixing a defect  during the testing phase costs anywhere from 10 to 100 times the cost of  fixing it during the design or requirements phase.  As shown in figure 2,  projects that are unable to successfully address their rework will  eventually only be spending their efforts on rework and the associated  processes rather than on productive work.

Problems with  HHS\u2019 requirements management practices include the lack of  (1) a concept  of operations to guide the development of requirements, (2) traceability of  a requirement from the concept of operations through testing to ensure  requirements were adequately addressed in the system, and (3) specificity  in the requirements to minimize confusion in the implementation.  These  problems with requirements have resulted in a questionable foundation for  the systems\u2019 testing process.  In addition, HHS has provided an extremely  limited amount of time to address defects identified from system testing,  which reflects an optimism not supported by other HHS testing efforts,  including those performed to test the conversion of data from CDC\u2019s legacy  system to UFMS.  This type of short time frame generally indicates that a  project is being driven to meet predetermined milestones in the project  schedule.  While adherence to schedule goals is generally desirable, if  corners are cut and there is not adequate quantitative data to assess the  risks to the project of not implementing disciplined processes in these  areas, the risk of project rework or failure appreciably rises.  Ineffective  implementation of these processes exposes a project to the unnecessary  risk that costly rework will be required, which in turn will adversely affect  the project\u2019s cost and schedule, and can adversely affect the ultimate  performance of the system.", "An effective risk management process can be used by an agency to  understand the risks that it is undertaking when it does not implement an  effective requirements management process.

HHS has agreed to change these  procedures so that the actions needed to address risks remain visible and  at the forefront.  While the executive sponsor for the UFMS project and  other senior HHS officials have demonstrated commitment to the project,  effective project management and oversight are needed to identify and  resolve problems as soon as possible, when it is the cheapest to fix them.   For example, HHS officials have struggled to address problems identified  by the IV&V contractor in a timely manner.

One such  document, issued April 30, 2004, discusses the use of shared service centers to perform financial management functions.  This document  was issued well after implementation efforts were under way and about  5 months before the expected deployment date of UFMS at CDC.  As  discussed in more detail in appendix III, the April 30 document does not  clearly explain who will perform these functions, and where and how  these functions will be performed.", "Requirements were not traceable.  HHS developed a hierarchical  approach to defining its requirements.  HHS defined the high-level  requirements that were used to identify the requirements that could not  be satisfied by the COTS product.  Once these high-level requirements  were defined, a hierarchical requirements management process was  developed which included (1) reviewing and updating the requirements  through process design workshops,(2) establishing the initial baseline  requirements, (3) performing a fit/gap analysis, (4) developing gap  closure alternatives, and (5) creating the final baseline requirements.  The key in using such a hierarchy is that each step of the process builds  upon the previous step.   However, this traceability was not maintained  for the 74 requirements we reviewed.  Therefore, HHS has little  assurance that (1) requirements defined in the lower-level requirements  documents are consistent with and adequately cover the higher-level  requirements and (2) testing efforts based on lower-level requirements  documents will adequately assess whether UFMS can meet the high- level requirements used to define the overall functionality expected  from UFMS.

Many requirements reviewed  were not sufficiently specific to reduce requirements-related defects to  acceptable levels.

For example, system testing on the capabilities for  the CDC implementation was planned to start in August 2004 and to be  completed in a 6-week time frame before the system is expected to become  operational there.  This leaves HHS with little time to address any defects  identified during the system testing process and to ensure that the  corrective actions taken to address the defects do not introduce new  defects.

In fact, testing, based on well-defined requirements,  performed through the system test phase, often catches less than 60  percent of a program\u2019s defects.  In HHS\u2019 case, problems with its poorly  defined requirements make creating test cases more challenging and  increase the likelihood that the systems test phase will identify significant  defects that are often identified by system testing.

Moreover, JFMIP stated that data  conversion is one of the most frequently underestimated tasks.  JFMIP also  noted that if data conversion is done right, the new system has a much  greater opportunity for success. On the other hand, converting data  incorrectly or entering unreliable data from a legacy system has lengthy  and long-term repercussions.

However, according to HHS, more than 8 months  of preparatory activities were completed before beginning the first mock  conversion. They also told us that at least some of these data-cleanup  efforts had started about 3 years ago.  As with other efforts on this project,  the quantitative data necessary to determine whether HHS\u2019 expectations  were realistic, such as the number of issues identified during a mock  conversion, were not produced until late in the implementation cycle.  In  May 2004, HHS performed the first of its two planned mock conversions.   On the basis of the results of this effort, HHS has now decided that it will  need to perform two additional mock conversions before the October 2004  implementation at CDC.

Although the contractor hired by HHS to perform IV&V  services identified the lack of personnel as a major risk factor in June  2003, it took HHS and its system integrator over 6 months to  substantially address this weakness.

As of April 2004, this weakness had not been effectively  addressed.

In August 2003, the IV&V  contractor also noted that an effective earned value management  system had not been implemented. Earned value management attempts  to compare the value of work accomplished during a given period with  the work scheduled for that period. By using the value of completed  work as a basis for estimating the cost and time needed to complete the  program, earned value can alert program managers to potential  problems early in the program.  For example, if a task is expected to  take 100 hours to complete and it is 50 percent complete, the earned  value management system would compare the number of hours actually  spent to complete the task to the number of hours expected for the  amount of work performed.  In this example, if the actual hours spent  equaled 50 percent of the hours expected, the earned value would show  that the project\u2019s resources were consistent with the estimate. As of  April 2004, this weakness had not been effectively addressed.  Without  an effective earned value management system, HHS has little assurance  that it knows the status of the various project deliverables in the  context of progress and associated cost.  In other words, an effective  earned value management system would be able to provide quantitative  data on the status of a given project deliverable, such as a data  conversion program.  On the basis of this information, HHS  management would be able to determine whether the progress of a task  was within the expected parameters for completion.  Management  could then use this information to determine actions to take to mitigate  risk and manage cost and schedule performance.", "The following additional significant issues were considered open by the  IV&V contractor as of April 2004.", "Requirements management.

For example, we noted  in the March/April 2004 conference room pilot that one of the users  identified a process weakness related to grant accounting as a  \u201cshowstopper.\u201d However, this weakness did not appear in the defect  tracking system until about 1 month later.  As a result, during this interval,  the HHS defect tracking system did not accurately reflect the potential  problems identified by the users, and HHS management was unable to  determine (1) how well the system was working and (2) the amount of  work necessary to correct the defects.

For example,  one major milestone was to conduct a conference room pilot in  March/April 2004.  HHS held the conference room pilot in March/April 2004,  and so it considered that the milestone had been met.  However, HHS did  not define what constituted success for this event, such as the users  identifying no significant defects in functionality.  A discussion of the  problems we identified with the March/April 2004 conference room pilot is  included in appendix III and clearly demonstrates that the objective of this  activity, to validate the prototype system and test interfaces, was not  achieved.  Therefore, by measuring progress based on the fact that this  conference room pilot was held, HHS has little assurance that the project is  in fact on schedule and can provide the desired functionality.  This  approach increases the risk that HHS will be surprised by a major  malfunction at a critical juncture in the project, such as when it conducts  system testing or attempts to implement the system at CDC.", "Good metrics would enable HHS to assess the risk of moving forward on  UFMS with a much greater degree of certainty.

As is the case at HHS, Interior\u2019s deficiencies  in requirements management and other disciplined processes meant that  Interior had no assurance that its newly acquired system would meet its  specific performance, security, and data management needs and that it  would be delivered on time and on schedule. To reduce these risks, we  recommended that Interior develop and implement an effective risk  management plan and that Interior ensure that all project decisions were  (1) based on objective data and demonstrated project accomplishments  and (2) driven by events, not the schedule.

These  problems are similar to those encountered by other agencies that have  found themselves under strong pressure to skip steps in their haste to get  systems up and running and produce results.  If HHS continues on this  path, it runs a higher risk than necessary of finding, as many others have  already discovered, that the system may be more costly to operate, take  more time and effort to perform needed functions, be more disruptive to  the work of the agency, and may not achieve the intended improvement.", "Ideally, HHS should not continue with its current approach for UFMS.   However, if HHS decides for operational reasons to continue its plan to  deploy UFMS at CDC in October 2004, then as a precursor to deployment at  CDC, there are several key steps that must be taken to mitigate the  significant risk related to this deployment.  To begin, HHS must determine  the system capabilities that are necessary for the CDC deployment and  identify the relevant requirements related to those capabilities.  The  associated requirements will have to be unambiguous and adequately  express how the system will work, be traceable from their origin through  implementation, and be sufficiently tested to confirm that the system meets  those functional needs.  Validating data conversion efforts and systems  interfaces will also be critical to the successful launch of UFMS.  HHS will  need to ensure that its desire to meet the October 2004 initial deployment  of UFMS is driven by successful completion of at least these key events  based on quantitative data rather than the schedule.  HHS should not  deploy UFMS at CDC until these critical steps are complete.", "Before proceeding further with the UFMS implementation beyond CDC,  HHS should pause to assess whether an appropriate foundation is in place  so that UFMS will achieve its ultimate goals of a unified accounting system  that institutes common business rules, data standards, and accounting  policies and procedures.  From our perspective, HHS does not have a fully  developed view of how UFMS will operate because it moved forward with  the project before ensuring that certain key elements, such as a concept of  operations and an enterprise architecture, were completed.  Without  assurances that it is moving ahead with a solid foundation and a fully  developed and strongly administered plan for bringing the entire UFMS  project under the disciplined processes of requirements management,  testing, risk management, and the use of quantitative measures to manage  the project, HHS risks not achieving its goal of a common accounting  system that produces data for management decision making and financial  reporting and risks perpetuating its long-standing accounting system  weaknesses with substantial workarounds to address any needed  capabilities that have not been built into the system.", "Because we have recently issued reports providing HHS with  recommendations to address weaknesses in IT investment management  processes, we are not making additional recommendations in this report  related to those two disciplines other than to reiterate the importance of  taking action on our prior recommendations.

HHS disagreed with our conclusion that a lack of disciplined  processes is placing the UFMS program at risk, stating that its processes  have been clear and rigorously executed.  HHS characterized the risk in its  approach as the result not of a lack of disciplined process but of an  aggressive project schedule.  HHS stated that it made a decision early in the  program to phase in the deployment of the system to obtain what it  referred to as incremental benefits, and said that a core set of requirements  will be available for the October 2004 release at CDC.  HHS added that if a  system functional capability becomes high risk for the pilot  implementation at CDC, it could be deferred to a subsequent release  without affecting the overall implementation.  HHS did not provide  examples of the functional capabilities that could be deferred under such a  scenario, but we understand that at least some functionality associated  with grant accounting being deployed at CDC is less than that originally  envisioned when we performed our review\u2014less than 6 months before the  scheduled CDC implementation date.  HHS stated that it had reached every  major milestone to date within the planned timeframes and budget for  almost 3 years while managing to mitigate the cost, schedule, and technical  risks.  The agency considers this is a testament to UFMS management  disciplines, notwithstanding known needed improvements.", "From our perspective, this project demonstrates the classic symptoms of a  schedule-driven effort for which key processes have been omitted or  shortcutted, thereby unnecessarily increasing risk.  This is a multiyear  project, and it is important that the project adhere to disciplined processes  that represent best practices.  We have no problem whatsoever with a  phased approach and view it as a sound decision for this project.  There is  no doubt that a phased approach can help reduce risks.  However, we do  not agree that a phased approach adequately mitigates risk in a project of  this magnitude, given the other problems we identified. As discussed in our  report and highlighted in the following sections that further evaluate HHS\u2019  comments on our draft report, we identified a number of problems with  HHS\u2019 methodology, including problems in requirements management,  testing, project management and oversight, and IT management, that are at  the heart of our concern.  Also, we are not saying that HHS is not following  any disciplined processes, and in this report we have recognized certain  HHS actions that we believe represent best practices that reduce risk.  We  are saying that HHS has not reduced its risk to an acceptable level because  a number of key disciplined processes were not yet in place or were not  effectively implemented.  We focused our 34 recommendations on tangible  actions that HHS can take to adequately mitigate risk.  Risk on a project  such as this can never be eliminated, but risk can be much better managed  than what we observed for this project.", "With respect to HHS\u2019 comment that all milestones have been met, as we  discussed in detail in this report, we caution that because HHS has  insufficient quantifiable criteria for assessing the quality of its progress and  the impact of identified defects, it does not have the information it needs to  determine whether the milestones have been substantively accomplished  and the nature and extent of resources needed to resolve remaining  defects.  A best practice is having quantitative metrics and a disciplined  process for continually measuring and monitoring results.", "We stand firmly behind our findings that HHS had not reduced project risk  to an acceptable level because it had not adequately adhered to disciplined  processes called for in its stated implementation methodology.  We are  somewhat encouraged by the planned actions outlined in HHS\u2019 comment  letter and the fact that it has now decided to delay initial implementation by  at least 2 weeks to address known problems and has indicated it may delay  the initial implementation further as needed.  Only time will tell how well  this project turns out, as the initial implementation at CDC represents just  the first phase.  Our hope is that the disciplined processes discussed in our  report and addressed in our recommendations will be followed and that  risks of a project of this magnitude and importance will be reduced to an  acceptable level.  If the past is prologue, taking the time to adhere to  disciplined processes will pay dividends in the long term."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Implementation Methodology", "paragraphs": ["HHS stated that the underlying premise of our report is that there is one  correct way to perform an implementation for a project such as UFMS and  that this methodology, commonly referred to as the waterfall  methodology, is inappropriate for a COTS-based system.  Our report does  not call for the use of this or any other specific methodology.  Instead, we  have emphasized the importance of following disciplined processes in the  development and implementation of large and complex information  management systems, including financial management systems such as  UFMS.  As we have reiterated throughout this report, we view disciplined  processes as the key to successfully carrying out a system development  and implementation program whatever the methodology.", "In the case of HHS\u2019 COTS-based system development program, we did not  question the methodology, but have concerns about HHS\u2019 ability to  successfully implement its methodology.  For example, as explained in our  report and reiterated in HHS\u2019 comments, before a COTS software package  is selected for implementation, requirements need to be more flexible and  less specific than custom-developed software because no off-the-shelf  product is likely to satisfy all of the detailed requirements for a large,  complex organization such as HHS.  Once the product is selected, however,  a disciplined approach to COTS implementation demands that  requirements be defined at a level of specificity that allows the software to  be configured to fit the system under development and to be implemented  to meet the organization\u2019s needs.  In discussing the HHS methodology, our  report is consistent with how HHS described its methodology in its  comments. As we noted in the report, the methodology selected by HHS  requires (1) reviewing and updating the requirements through process  design workshops, (2) establishing the initial baseline requirements,   (3) performing a fit/gap analysis, (4) developing gap closure alternatives,  and (5) creating the final baseline requirements.  However, as noted in our  report, HHS was unable to successfully implement its methodology for the  majority of the requirements we reviewed.  For example, one inadequately  defined requirement was linked to the budget distributions process.   However, this process, which should of provided additional specificity to  understand how the system needed to be configured, stated that the  process was \u201cTo Be Determined.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Requirements Management", "paragraphs": ["In its comments, HHS stated that in July 2002 it had developed a \u201ctarget  business model\u201d that is equivalent to a concept of operations for guiding its  development efforts.

For example, the document  did not address the modes of operation; user classes and how they should  interact; operational policies and constraints; costs of systems operations;  performance characteristics, such as speed, throughput, volume, or  frequency; quality attributes, such as availability, reliability, supportability,  and expandability; and provisions for safety, security, and privacy.  The  document does not address a number of other critical issues associated  with the project such as the use of shared services.  We also noted that  some HHS officials who had reviewed this document stated that it did not  resolve a number of issues that needed to be addressed.  For example, HHS  reviewers raised questions about who was responsible for several core  functions. When we performed our review, these types of questions  remained unanswered, although HHS said in its comments on our draft  report that it is taking steps to address these concerns and has now made  certain decisions regarding shared services.", "In addition, HHS\u2019 comment letter stated that it has developed a  requirements database that could be used to track the requirements and  that its requirements management process used two broad categories -  Program Management Office of JFMIP requirements and agency-specific  requirements.  HHS also stated that the requirements process has fully  defined and documented the expected behavior of UFMS and that the  agency-specific requirements it had identified had been developed in  accordance with industry best practices.  HHS noted that it has also  developed a requirements traceability verification matrix since our review.", "The result, according to HHS, has been a requirements management  process that provides fully traceable requirements that are fully tested by  the implementation team.", "Developing and effectively implementing the kinds of processes described  in HHS\u2019 comments are positive steps that would reduce the risks associated  with requirements related defects.  However, since these key processes,  which were called for in our report and during meetings held with HHS  during our review, were developed and implemented after our work was  complete, we are unable to determine whether HHS has yet fully addressed  the weaknesses we observed.  As noted in our report, we found numerous  requirements that did not contain the necessary specificity to support a  good testing program. We also note that the HHS comments refer to these  processes being used for \u201ctestable\u201d requirements but do not provide  information on how many of the 2,130 requirements contained in its  requirements database were considered testable and, therefore, subject to  this improved process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Testing", "paragraphs": ["While HHS stated in its comment letter that it has implemented a more  disciplined system testing process, its comments also raised concerns  about the thoroughness of the testing.

As  noted in HHS\u2019 comments, its requirements management database contains  2,130 requirements that include requirements issued by the Program  Management Office of JFMIP.  However, according to the Program  Management Office of JFMIP, its testing efforts encompass about 331  requirements, or only about 16 percent of HHS\u2019 stated requirements.", "Compounding this limitation, while the Program Management Office of  JFMIP test results can be helpful, as the Program Management Office of  JFMIP has consistently made it clear to agencies, these tests are not  intended to take the place of agency-level tests. The Program Management  Office of JFMIP tests are in a controlled environment that is not intended to  represent the operating environment of a specific agency.  As the Project  Management Office of JFMIP points out on its Web site, agencies need to  (1) test the installed configured system to ensure continued compliance  with the governmentwide core requirements and any agency-specific  requirements, (2) assess the suitability of an application for the agency\u2019s  operating environment, and (3) assess the COTS computing performance in  the agency\u2019s environment for response time and transaction throughput  capacity.  For example, addressing this last point regarding transaction  throughput capacity has proven problematic to some agencies that  implemented a COTS package.  The system could have properly processed  a type of transaction, which is what the test requires in order to be  certified.  However, the system may require a number of separate  processing steps to accomplish this task.  Those steps may be acceptable at  an agency that has a relatively low volume of this type of transaction, but  may prove problematic for an agency with a high volume of this type of  transaction.", "As noted in the HHS comments, it had not yet developed the test scripts  and other documentation that would have enabled us to assess the  adequacy of its system testing activities at the time of our review.   Therefore, we cannot conclude on whether its system testing activities will  have a reasonable assurance of detecting the majority of the defects.  HHS  noted that it had conducted preliminary testing, referred to as conference  room pilots, in August 2003 and in March and April 2004 and that these  activities were attended by finance, business, and program staff members  from across HHS, who will be the ultimate users of the new system.  As  noted in our report, our review of the conference room pilot conducted in  March and April 2004 found significant weaknesses in the processes being  used. This was the last conference pilot scheduled before the pilot  deployment at CDC.  We found that some of the stated requirements in a  given conference room pilot test script were not tested and defects  identified were not promptly recorded.   This is consistent with  observations made by HHS\u2019 IV&V contractor on the August 2003  conference room pilots.  Furthermore, we observed that when users asked  about needed functionality, they were told that the functionality would be  developed later.  Therefore, we are encouraged by the statement in HHS\u2019  comment letter that it will implement a disciplined system testing process.", "In our report, we also noted that the system testing activities were  scheduled late in the first phase of the UFMS implementation process,  leaving little time for HHS to address any defects identified during system  testing and to ensure that the corrective actions taken to address the  defects do not introduce new defects.  HHS agreed that system testing  would ideally come earlier in the process and noted that although the  testing process is being performed late due to an aggressive time schedule,  it believed, based on its level of scrutiny, its testing plan will identify the  majority of the defects in the system.  We view this as adding to project  risk.  However, we are encouraged that in its comments on our draft report,  HHS said it was analyzing system integration test results prior to deploying  the system at CDC, and that this assessment may result in revising the  current software release strategy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Program Management Oversight", "paragraphs": ["In its comments, HHS stated that its combined use of software tools,  including TeamPlay from Primavera, provides management with  information for monitoring the project\u2019s critical path and the earned value  of completed work and that this action was taken in October 2003 after an  August 2003 report from its IV&V contractor.  As with other process areas,  the key to reducing risks to acceptable levels is not only the tool that is  used but, more importantly, the effective implementation of that tool.  In  other words, simply selecting an industry standard practice or tool does  not guarantee success. As noted in a May 2004 IV&V report, as of April  2004, the IV&V contractor was still raising concerns about HHS\u2019 ability to  perform critical path and earned value analysis. HHS acknowledged in its  comments on our draft report that it continues to work on improving the  information provided in the critical path reports and is executing a plan to  implement the remainder of the IV&V suggestions.  As we discussed  previously in this report, without an effective critical path analysis and an  earned value management system, HHS does not have adequate assurance  that it can understand the impact of various project events, such as delays  in project deliverables, and that it knows the status of the various project  deliverables in the context of progress and associated cost.  We continue to  believe that management needs this information to determine actions to  take to mitigate risk and manage cost and schedule performance.", "HHS also stated that all of the needed improvements in its project  execution were identified and documented prior to and during our review  by its IV&V contractor and that improvements continue to be implemented.

Regardless of who identified the problems, we remain concerned that HHS  has been slow to act upon the weaknesses identified by the IV&V  contractor and has not yet clearly identified actions planned to address our  recommendations.  Our report provides examples where it has taken HHS  months to address the findings made by its IV&V contractor.", "Regarding quantitative measures, HHS agreed that quantitative measures  are crucial to UFMS success and stated that it has struck an adequate  balance between the number of measures used to assess UFMS progress  and the effort and costs required to develop and maintain the measures.   HHS described several measures related to its defect-tracking processes  that are associated with its system testing efforts. We agree with HHS that  the measures listed in its comment letter are critical to assessing system  stability and readiness, but HHS\u2019 comments did not indicate whether it is  also capturing metrics on items that can help it understand the risks  associated with the processes it is implementing, such as with its  requirements management process.  For example, HHS stated that system  testing had not identified any requirements problems, which indicated the  requirements were defined thoroughly.  However, system testing is  normally not designed to capture requirements problems since, as noted in  HHS\u2019 comment letter, testing is structured to determine whether the system  is meeting requirements that have been documented.  Therefore, it is not  clear whether HHS has fully developed a metric process that will address  its needs throughout the phased deployments.", "Regarding human capital, HHS said that it faces its share of challenges in  obtaining full-time federal staff due to the temporary nature of an  implementation project and the agency\u2019s objective to staff a highly  competent program team and not a permanent federal bureaucracy.  We  recognize that HHS and the systems integrator it has under contract to  assist with the project have taken measures to acquire additional staff for  the implementation of UFMS.  We also recognize the challenge in finding  people with the needed skills.  Our concern is that the UFMS project has  experienced staff shortages as high as 40 percent of the federal positions  that HHS believed were needed to implement UFMS.  This shortage of staff  resources led to several key deliverables being significantly behind  schedule.  Also, while HHS said that CDC has the vast majority of its  required positions filled, we found that many of the positions for this  operating division were filled with staff from the program management  office for the project, which affects the work that should be done to  manage and oversee the project.

In our view, we conducted this engagement in a  professional, constructive manner in which we worked proactively with  HHS to provide timely observations on the implementation of UFMS.  The  timing of our review was aimed at providing input early in the process so  that HHS can act to address weaknesses and reduce the risk of  implementing a system that does not meet needs and expectations and  requires costly rework and work-arounds to operate.  We have found in our  reviews of other agencies\u2019 system implementation efforts that effective  implementation of disciplined processes can reduce risks that have an  adverse impact on the cost, timeliness, and performance of a project.

For example, spending the time to adequately  analyze three design alternatives before selecting one results in time spent  analyzing two alternatives that were not selected.  However, discovering  that a design is inadequate after development can result in code that must  be rewritten two times, at a cost greater than analyzing the three  alternatives in the first place.

According to the IEEE Standards, a concept of operations is a user- oriented document that describes the characteristics of a proposed system  from the users\u2019 viewpoint.

Basically, this center  of excellence will perform such UFMS operations and maintenance  functions as maintaining the data tables in the UFMS database, managing  various periodic closings, and performing various user maintenance  functions as well as some security functions.  While HHS officials advised  us that they had selected PSC to operate the operations and maintenance  center of excellence, there is limited time to establish the center before  UFMS\u2019 planned deployment date at CDC.  In addition, HHS has still not  identified (1) who will operate the other centers of excellence and the  location(s) performing these functions and (2) how these functions will be  performed.

Moreover, profiles of user classes describing  each class of user, including responsibilities, education, background, skill  level, activities, and modes of interaction with the current system, have not  been developed.  In fact, as of May 2004, HHS has been unable to get  agreement on all the standard processes that it will use.  For example,  when HHS attempted to develop a standard way of recording grant-related  information, the project team members were unable to get agreement  between the various operating divisions on how to develop crosscutting  codes that would have to be maintained at the departmental level.  Part of  the process of developing a concept of operations for an organization  includes describing how its day-to-day operations will be carried out to  meet mission needs.  The project team tasked with developing and  implementing a UFMS common accounting system attempted to develop  standardized processes that would be used for the UFMS project.

The key  advantage in using such a hierarchy is that each step of the process builds  upon the previous one.

However, once the product is selected,  requirements must be defined at a level that allows the software to be  configured to fit the system under development and implemented to meet  the organization\u2019s needs.  As noted elsewhere, on the basis of the  requirements we reviewed, HHS had not accomplished this objective.   Furthermore, we identified numerous instances in which each documented  requirement used to design and test the system was not traceable forward  to the business processes and therefore could not build upon the next step  in moving through the hierarchy.

The high-level requirement stated that the system \u201cshall define,  generate, and post compound general ledger debit and credit entries for a  single transaction.\u201d The system was also expected to \u201caccommodate at  least 10 debit and credit pairs,\u201d but this information was not included in the  process document for the Create Recurring Journals process, to which the  requirement was tied. Therefore, someone implementing this functionality  from this process document would not know the number of debit and  credit pairs that must be supported. Furthermore, in April 2004, HHS  conducted a demonstration for the users to validate that this functionality  had been implemented. Although the demonstration documentation stated  that this requirement would be covered, none of the steps in the test  scripts actually demonstrated (1) how the system would process a general  ledger entry that consisted of 10 debit and credit pairs or (2) examples of  transactions that would require such entries.

One such issue was the process for handling erroneous transactions  received from other systems.
