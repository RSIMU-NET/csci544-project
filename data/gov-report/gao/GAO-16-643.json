Part B drugs are typically administered by a physician. Coupon programs are prohibited in the Medicare program but are generally available to privately insured patients. GAO obtained data on coupon discounts for 18 drugs. GAO estimated that 19 percent of privately insured patients who received these drugs used coupons in 2013, but coupon use varied widely depending on the drug\u2014from 1 percent to over 90 percent.", "Medicare's methodology for setting Part B payment rates to providers may be less suitable for drugs with coupon programs than for drugs without them. The methodology for most Part B drugs is based on the average sales price (ASP), which is defined by law as the amount physicians and other purchasers pay manufacturers for the drug, net of discounts and rebates to those purchasers. Medicare and its beneficiaries spent $20 billion on Part B drugs paid based on ASP in 2013. As ASP does not account for coupon discounts to patients, the discounts reduce the effective market price that manufacturers receive for drugs with coupon programs. GAO estimated that, for the 18 drugs for which it obtained coupon discount data, the ASP exceeded the effective market price by an estimated 0.7 percent in 2013. Part B spending for these drugs could have been an estimated $69 million lower if ASP equaled the effective market price. ASP exceeded the effective market price by more than 1.0 percent for 5 of the 18 drugs, suggesting that the ASP-based methodology may be even less suitable for these drugs.", "Upward trends in coupon program use and drug prices suggest that these programs could cause the methodology for setting Part B drug payment rates to become less suitable over time for drugs with coupon programs. However, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) lacks the authority to collect coupon discount data from manufacturers and thus lacks important information that could inform its ongoing efforts to evaluate alternatives to this methodology."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["To determine the suitability of the Part B drug payment rate methodology for drugs with coupon programs, Congress should consider (1) granting CMS authority to collect data from drug manufacturers on coupon discounts for Part B drugs paid based on ASP; and (2) requiring CMS to periodically collect these data and report on the implications of coupon programs for this methodology. The Department of Health and Human Services provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which GAO incorporated as appropriate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, the percentage of brand name prescriptions that involved  the use of a drug coupon increased substantially from 3 percent in 2011  to 8 percent in 2014. Under coupon programs, drug manufacturers make  discounts available to privately insured patients to reduce or eliminate  their out-of-pocket costs for specific drugs. The reduction in out-of- pocket costs may improve adherence to drug regimens for patients who  use these programs. However, coupon programs may also increase  overall drug spending by encouraging patients to use more expensive  drugs instead of lower-cost alternatives. In addition, by making drugs  more affordable for patients, coupon programs may allow manufacturers  to increase their sales of these drugs and extract higher prices from  health care providers and other drug purchasers.", "Provision of coupon discounts to induce or reward the use of certain  drugs is prohibited in Medicare and other federal health care programs.  Used in this way, coupon discounts are considered kickbacks that may  induce beneficiaries and their providers to choose certain drugs when  lower-cost but equally effective alternatives are available. According to  the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of Inspector  General (OIG), kickbacks such as these are unlawful in federal health  care programs in part because they could lead to excessive costs to the  programs and their beneficiaries.", "Although prohibited in Medicare, the recent increases in coupon use in  the private sector may have implications for the methodology Medicare  has used since 2005 to set the rates it pays providers for drugs covered  under Part B. Medicare pays for most Part B drugs, which are typically  administered by a physician or under a physician\u2019s supervision, based on  the average amount that purchasers paid to drug manufacturers, net of  discounts and rebates\u2014referred to as the average sales price (ASP).", "Medicare\u2019s ASP is a market-based measure of a drug\u2019s price. However,  this measure, as set forth in section 1847A of the Social Security Act,  does not account for coupon discounts that manufacturers provide to  patients, the ultimate consumers of these drugs. Although these coupon  discounts do not affect the amount that purchasers pay to drug  manufacturers, they do lower the net price\u2014here termed the effective  market price\u2014that manufacturers ultimately receive for drugs with such  coupon discounts. As a result, coupon discounts create a discrepancy  between Medicare\u2019s ASP and the effective market price of a drug. This  discrepancy, coupled with the recent increase in coupon use and  Medicare\u2019s role as an efficient purchaser of health care items and  services, raises questions about how suitable Medicare\u2019s Part B payment  rate methodology is for drugs with coupon programs.", "Given the increasing prevalence of coupon programs in the private sector  and that the Medicare program and its beneficiaries spent approximately  $20 billion in 2013 on Part B drugs paid based on ASP, you asked us to  examine the use of coupon programs and their potential implications for  the Medicare program and its beneficiaries. In this report, we  identify coupon programs associated with high-expenditure Part B  drugs and describe the extent to which privately insured patients use  these programs; and examine, for drugs with coupon programs, the suitability of Medicare\u2019s  Part B drug payment rate methodology.", "To identify coupon programs associated with high-expenditure Medicare  Part B drugs, we developed a list of the 50 highest-expenditure Part B  drugs using data on Medicare claims paid based on ASP in 2013\u2014the  most recent full year of claims data available at the time of our analysis.  In that year, these 50 highest-expenditure drugs accounted for 85 percent  of Part B spending for drugs paid based on ASP. (For the complete list of  these 50 drugs, see app. I.) We then identified which of the 50 Part B  drugs either had coupon programs at the time of our analysis (2015) or in  2013, based on information from manufacturers and their websites, and  collected information from these sources on coupon program  characteristics. To describe the extent to which privately insured  patients used coupon programs, we obtained data for 2013 from (1) drug  manufacturers on coupon use\u2014specifically, the number of patients who  used these programs and on the average annual discounts provided; and  (2) the Truven Health Analytics\u2019 MarketScan\u00ae Commercial Claims and  Encounters Database on the estimated number of privately insured  patients nationally who used drugs with coupon programs and the out-of- pocket costs these patients incurred.", "To examine the suitability of Medicare\u2019s Part B drug payment rate  methodology for drugs with coupon programs, we reviewed relevant  statutes and regulations and also interviewed officials from the Centers  for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), an agency within HHS. To  illustrate the potential effect, if any, of coupon programs on the suitability  of this methodology for Part B drugs with these programs, we estimated  how a drug\u2019s ASP and Part B spending could have changed over a one- year period\u2014from July 2013 through June 2014\u2014if the drug\u2019s ASP  accounted for coupon discounts.

Drug manufacturers provide these  discounts to patients through several mechanisms. For example,  manufacturers may provide patients with debit cards to be activated at the  point of sale. Alternatively, manufacturers may pay the patient\u2019s coupon  discount amount directly to a provider, who would reduce the patient\u2019s  out-of-pocket cost accordingly. Manufacturers inform patients and  providers of coupon programs in a variety of ways, such as distributing  promotional materials, operating program websites and patient hotlines,  and sending field representatives to communicate program information to  providers.", "The effect of coupon programs on patients can differ depending on  whether programs are associated with single-source or multi-source  drugs, and changes in patient behavior may in turn lead to increased drug  sales by manufacturers. For single-source drugs, which are only available  from one manufacturer and may not have lower-cost, pharmaceutically  equivalent alternatives, such programs can help patients afford their  medications and have been shown to improve patient adherence to  specialty drug regimens. For multi-source drugs, which are available  from more than one manufacturer, coupon programs may encourage  patients to request, and providers to prescribe, more expensive drugs  instead of generics and other lower-cost, pharmaceutically equivalent  alternatives. These changes in patient behaviors could benefit drug  manufacturers financially while potentially increasing costs for health  insurers. Specifically, manufacturers gain revenue from the sale of drugs  received by patients who might have quit a drug regimen or chosen a  lower-cost alternative in the absence of a coupon program. Additionally,  manufacturers may be able to charge higher prices to purchasers than  the market could sustain without these programs.", "Although the use of drug coupon programs to induce or reward use of  certain drugs is unlawful in federal health care programs such as  Medicare, beneficiaries who cannot afford their medications may be  eligible to obtain financial assistance from other sources. For example,  Medicare beneficiaries may be able to receive medications or assistance  with out-of-pocket costs from independent charity patient assistance  programs. Medicare beneficiaries with low income may also be eligible  to enroll in Medicaid, the joint federal-state program that finances health  insurance coverage for certain categories of low-income and medically  needy individuals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Medicare Part B Drugs", "paragraphs": ["Medicare Part B covers drugs and biologicals that are generally  administered by a physician or under a physician\u2019s direct supervision,  including drugs administered in a physician\u2019s office or hospital outpatient  department.

Medicare generally pays 80  percent of a set payment rate for a drug, while beneficiaries are  responsible for the remaining 20 percent. For most Part B drugs,  Medicare sets payment rates at a drug\u2019s ASP plus an additional 6  percent. To set these rates, CMS collects quarterly data from drug  manufacturers on the volume of sales and ASP for each drug. Sales  data that manufacturers report must be net of all rebates, discounts, and  other price concessions to purchasers, including physicians, hospitals,  and wholesalers. Manufacturers are not required to report sales net of  coupon discounts or other financial assistance provided by manufacturers  directly to patients.", "CMS, as part of its ongoing efforts to evaluate Medicare\u2019s methodology  for setting Part B drug payment rates, recently issued a proposed rule to  test alternatives to this payment method. Various studies have pointed  out that Medicare\u2019s current methodology for setting Part B drug payment  rates as a fixed percentage above ASP may give providers a financial  incentive to prescribe more expensive drugs. This is among the  shortcomings of the current ASP-based payment method that CMS\u2019s  proposed payment model is designed to address. The first phase of the  proposed payment model would change the payment rate for drugs paid  based on ASP from ASP plus 6 percent to ASP plus 2.5 percent plus a  flat fee. The second phase would implement value-based pricing  strategies, such as varying prices based on drugs\u2019 clinical effectiveness  and decreasing beneficiary coinsurance for drugs deemed high in value."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Most High- Expenditure Part B Drugs Had Coupon Programs in 2015; an Estimated 19 Percent of Privately Insured Patients Taking Such Drugs Used Programs in 2013", "paragraphs": ["In 2015, drug manufacturers offered coupon programs to privately insured  patients for 29 of the 50 high-expenditure Medicare Part B drugs in our  analysis. Coupon programs were typically open to privately insured  patients regardless of income. Programs for 3 of the drugs required  patients to have incomes below a certain amount, with maximum annual  incomes of approximately $100,000.", "Coupon programs varied in the discount amounts that patients could  receive in 2015. Most programs had a maximum annual discount, which  ranged across programs from $400 to $42,000 per year. Until patients  reached that maximum discount, they could pay as low as $0 to $50 per  coupon use. These amounts could represent a small fraction of patients\u2019  full out-of-pocket cost for a prescription. For example, privately insured  patients using the drug Yervoy were required to pay an estimated $571,  on average, per prescription without the drug\u2019s coupon program,  compared to paying $25 under the coupon program. (See table 1 for  examples of drug coupon programs and app. III for more information on  out-of-pocket costs for drugs with coupon programs.)", "Factors that can affect privately insured patients\u2019 use of coupons include  patient out-of-pocket cost requirements and the extent of manufacturer  outreach to patients and providers. For example, whether patients are  required to pay out-of-pocket costs for a drug can affect whether patients  use coupon programs, as patients without such costs do not need these  programs. On average, across drugs in our analysis with coupon  programs in 2013, we estimated that 50 percent of privately insured  patients did not have out-of-pocket costs, and this percentage ranged  from 8 to 76 percent, depending on the drug. The amount of patient out- of-pocket costs can also affect the discount amount patients receive,  because coupon discounts are directly related to patients\u2019 out-of-pocket  costs. Other factors, including manufacturer outreach to providers and  patients, could also explain variation in coupon program use. For  example, some manufacturers told us that they reach out to patients  directly regarding coupon programs, while others told us that they  communicate directly only with providers.", "With respect to patients\u2019 use of available drug coupon programs, we  determined that 21 of the 50 high-expenditure Part B drugs had coupon  programs in 2013, and these drugs accounted for 50 percent of Part B  spending paid based on ASP. We were able to obtain data on coupon  discounts from manufacturers for 18 of these drugs.

Individual patients who used coupon programs for  these drugs received an average annual discount of $2,051.

For  example, in figure 1, the ASP reported by the manufacturer was $1,000;  however, the effective market price the manufacturer received for the  drug\u2014net of the coupon discount the manufacturer provided to the  patient\u2014was actually $300 less, or $700.", "We estimated that, for the 18 drugs for which we obtained coupon  discount data in 2013, ASP exceeded the effective market price by an  average of 0.7 percent. Medicare spending for these 18 drugs could  have been $69 million lower if ASP had been equal to the effective  market price manufacturers received. ASP exceeded the effective  market price for some drugs by much more than the 0.7 percent average,  which suggests that the ASP-based payment method may be even less  suitable for these drugs. For example, for 5 of the 18 drugs, ASP  exceeded the effective market price by an estimated 2.7 percent, on  average, and ranged from 1.4 to 7.8 percent depending on the drug (see  fig. 2). Part B spending for these 5 drugs combined could have been an  estimated $50 million lower if ASP equaled the effective market price.
