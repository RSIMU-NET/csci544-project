State law determines who approves the formation of a charter school, often the board of education. As public schools, charter schools are subject to the performance requirements of the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLBA) as well. In this environment, states' systems for allowing charter schools flexibility and ensuring school performance and financial integrity assume greater importance. GAO examined (1) how states allow charter schools flexibility, (2) how states promote accountability for school performance and financial integrity for charter schools, (3) the implications of NCLBA for charter schools, and (4) the role the Department of Education (Education) plays in charter school accountability. GAO surveyed the 39 states and jurisdictions with operating charter schools in 2002-03 and interviewed charter school experts and Education officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In school year 2002-03, some states reported that they provided charter schools flexibility by allowing them to choose their authorizer. Authorizers--state education agencies, local education agencies, universities, and other nonprofit organizations--oversee the formation and operation of charter schools. Also, nearly all states provided flexibility by releasing charter schools from some traditional public school requirements, such as teacher hiring and termination practices, schedules, and collective bargaining agreements. To promote charter school performance and financial integrity, states reported that they took action to oversee charter schools and to oversee and provide assistance to authorizers. About half of the 39 states reported having primary responsibility for enforcing school improvement actions in charter schools not achieving annual school performance goals under NCLBA. Most states reported that they intervened when authorizers were not performing their responsibilities and conducted or required audits of authorizers' finances. About half of the states assisted authorizers with funding for their charter school oversight responsibilities or gave them fee collection authority. NCLBA requires charter schools to meet the same requirements as other public schools, but the law permits certain flexibilities where allowed by state law. Charter schools must be included in the statewide assessment system, and charter schools that receive NCLBA Title I funds must take school improvement actions if they do not meet state performance goals. However, NCLBA allows state law to determine the entity responsible for charter school oversight. In addition, while NCLBA requires certification for all other teachers to meet the highly qualified teacher requirement, the law exempts charter school teachers from this requirement where state law permits. As it does for all public schools, Education administers grant programs that provide funds to charter schools, monitors grant performance, and sponsors research on accountability for academic performance and financial integrity. Under NCLBA, the department and states must ensure that new and expanding charter schools receive timely payment of federal grant funds for which they are eligible and meet the act's academic achievement goals. However, in its monitoring and data collection, Education gathers little information on the timeliness of charter school grant payments or how well the schools perform. Moreover, Education's Office of the Inspector General (OIG) reported delays in states' Title I payments to charter schools. Education is in the process of developing new systems that are expected to provide both academic performance and financial reports for the department's major grant programs, but the ability of the new systems to provide financial reports for charter schools is uncertain."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In the 2003-04 school year, nearly 3,000 charter schools, representing  about 3 percent of all public schools, were in operation in the United  States. Charter schools are public schools established through agreements  between people or organizations granted permission to establish  schools\u2014charter holders\u2014and the entities that approve and oversee them  \u2014authorizers. The agreement, or charter, specifies certain academic goals  and financial requirements that the charter holders agree to meet in return  for increased autonomy in school management, usually including release  from traditional public school requirements in areas such as teacher  termination practices and student discipline. Since 1994, the federal  government has provided over $1 billion of federal funding to encourage  new and expanding charter schools under the Education\u2019s Public Charter  Schools and Credit Enhancement for Charter School Facilities programs.", "Forty states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico have enacted  charter school laws in an effort to increase school choice and improve  student outcomes, although not all states have operational schools.  Specifics of the laws vary from state to state; for instance, there are  variations in how many charter schools are allowed and what entity or  entities can authorize them. However, in every state, charter schools are  included in the statewide system for assessing school performance and are  expected to achieve the state annual school performance goal  requirements that apply to all public schools under the No Child Left  Behind Act of 2001 (NCLBA).", "Proponents of charter schools believe that the increased autonomy given  charter schools and the expanded opportunities for parents to select their  child\u2019s school can result in improved student achievement. However, there  are many challenges associated with successfully establishing and  operating a charter school. Because of these challenges, state systems for  allowing charter schools flexibility and ensuring accountability for school  performance and financial integrity assume greater importance. Moreover,  NCLBA requirements for assessing the status of annual school  performance goals and the actions schools must take if they do not meet  academic performance goals have the potential to expand or restrict the  flexibilities and performance agreements established in schools\u2019 charters.  This report examines (1) how states allow charter schools flexibility in  design and operation; (2) how states promote accountability for school  performance and financial integrity in their charter school systems; (3) the  implications of NCLBA for charter schools, and (4) the role the  Department of Education (Education) plays in charter school  accountability for school performance and financial integrity.", "To determine how states allow flexibility and promote accountability for  charter school performance, we focused on actions taken by state-level  officials. We surveyed designated charter school points of contact in 37  states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, with operating charter  schools in school year 2002-03. We collected data for school year 2002-03,  rather than 2003-04, to increase the likelihood that final, accurate data  would be available from state test administrations under NCLBA. We  assessed the reliability and validity of questions in our survey by  interviewing knowledgeable agency officials, and pretesting draft versions  of the survey. For selected questions, we confirmed the data with follow- up telephone interviews of respondents and compared data provided with  information available from other sources. We analyzed these data to  identify the flexibility states grant charter schools and the actions states  take directly, and through authorizers, to help hold charter schools  responsible for both their academic results and their fiscal practices. To  examine the effect of NCLBA, we synthesized information obtained from  Education\u2019s charter school guidance on NCLBA, interviews with state and  federal officials and charter school experts, and our survey of states with  operating charter schools. We determined Education\u2019s role by interviewing  officials responsible for federal grant and research programs applicable to  charter schools and by reviewing relevant laws and guidance.

We  conducted our work between September 2003 and December 2004 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["States began adopting charter school laws in the early 1990s, beginning  with Minnesota in 1991. Charter schools are permitted more flexibility in  school operation for agreeing to accomplish specific academic goals  contained in their charters. The specifics of these arrangements vary, as  each state adopting a charter school law sets up its own charter school  structure and guidelines, and states have continued to revise their charter  school laws over time. However, not all states with a charter school law  have operational charter schools, as shown in figure 2. The District of  Columbia and Puerto Rico also have charter school laws. During the 2003- 04 school year, nearly 3,000 charter schools were operating nationwide,  with nearly 700,000 students enrolled.", "Oversight authority for charter schools is established by the state\u2019s charter  school law and may rest with several entities, including state boards of  education, which set educational policy, and state departments of  education, which implement those policies. Some states have also created  independent charter school boards that can authorize charter schools in  the state. In addition, some states have created charter school offices,  housed in the state department of education, that support and advocate  for charter schools. State law also specifies which entities within the state  can authorize the establishment of a charter school, such as state  departments of education, state boards of education, local education  agencies, institutions of higher education, and municipal governments.", "Depending on the state, a wide range of individuals or groups, including  parents, educators, nonprofit organizations, and universities, may apply  for permission to operate a charter school. The agreement that is reached  between the applicants and the authorizer defines specific academic goals  and outlines school finances and other operational considerations. In  some states, including Texas and Arizona, a single charter may cover the  establishment of multiple schools. Once charter schools are in operation,  the authorizer is responsible for monitoring school performance and has  authority to close the school or take other actions if academic goals or  state financial requirements are not met. The schools are governed by a  board of trustees, which is responsible for overseeing school operations.  Requirements for charter school board membership vary across states, but  the responsibilities are similar. Specifically, charter school boards oversee  legal compliance, contracts with external parties, financial management  and policies, and facilities and equipment acquisition and maintenance.", "NCLBA, signed into law in early 2002, increased federal funding for  elementary and secondary education and created new requirements for all  public schools, including charter schools. NCLBA requires states to test  all children against reading and mathematics standards annually in grades  3-8 and once in grades 10-12 by the 2005-06 school year. States also had to  develop performance goals for schools that identify what percentage of  students must be proficient in reading and math each year for the school  to achieve proficiency for all children by 2013-14. Standards for science  proficiency are to be developed by the 2005-06 school year, with testing in  science to begin in 2007-08. Schools are required to measure the  performance of all students in meeting proficiency goals, as well as the  performance of designated groups. These groups are students who   (1) are economically disadvantaged, (2) represent major racial and ethnic  groups, (3) have disabilities, and (4) are limited in English proficiency.", "NCLBA also requires that schools include at least 95 percent of students in  each of these groups in statewide tests and meet at least one other  academic indicator. States must use the graduation rate as the additional  indicator for high schools. NCLBA also generally requires that teachers be  highly qualified by the end of the 2005-06 school year, meaning that  teachers must demonstrate subject matter expertise, have a bachelor\u2019s  degree and have full state certification as a teacher.", "NCLBA also specifies the actions that must be taken if schools receiving  funds for children from low-income families under Title I of the act do not  meet performance goals. Title I provides funds to states for local school  districts to improve the education of low-income students in high-poverty  schools. About half of all public schools nationwide receive a share of the  federal funds\u2014over $12 billion dollars in 2004\u2014this program provides.  NCLBA\u2019s performance requirements specify that if a school receiving Title  I funds does not meet its performance target for 2 consecutive years, it  must provide professional development for the school\u2019s staff and students  must be offered the choice of attending another public school. If the  school misses its performance goal for the third year, it must offer low- income students supplemental educational services, such as tutoring. If  the school continues to miss its performance goal, additional actions are  required, such as replacing the curriculum, hiring a new principal, turning  the school into a charter school, letting a private company operate the  school, or taking other action designed to improve student academic  results.", "As with other public schools, funding for charter schools comes largely  from state and local funds, augmented by federal aid. Eligible charter  schools may receive funds under federal formula and discretionary grant  programs. Formula grant programs, which provide funding to states on a  noncompetitive basis, include    Title I Grants to LEAs. This program is the largest federal program  supporting elementary and secondary education. Title I provides funding  for schools with disadvantaged children and accounts for about 2.5  percent of total education expenditures nationally.", "Impact Aid. This program provides funds to help educate children whose  parents or residences are connected to the federal government through  employment, the military, or federal housing programs.", "Special Education Grants to States. This program funds districts to assist  them to provide special education and related services to children with  disabilities.", "NCLBA continues to require Education and states to ensure that charter  schools receive payment from 18 federal grant programs for which they  are eligible, including Title I and Special Education Grants. New charter  schools and charter schools with expanding enrollments are to receive  these funds within 5 months of opening or expanding enrollment. This  NCLBA requirement for timely payment of federal grant funds originated  with the Charter School Expansion Act of 1998.", "Education has two data systems to support the department\u2019s grant  administration functions. One system, the Grant Administration and  Payment System (GAPS), tracks the payment of federal grant funds to the  grant recipient, frequently the state education agency (SEA) or LEA.  Education is developing the second system, the PBDMI\u2014a data  management initiative for federal grant programs\u2014to streamline the  collection of performance and financial data across Education\u2019s formula  grant programs, including Title I. When fully implemented, this initiative  would replace, in whole or in part, other data collections on the  implementation of NCLBA\u2019s academic performance requirements,  including elements of the Consolidated State Performance Report.", "Education also administers two grant programs targeted to charter  schools, the Charter School Program and the Credit Enhancement for  Charter School Facilities Program. These programs provide funding to  states, charter schools, and other entities on a competitive basis. The  Charter School Program supports the planning, development, and initial  implementation of charter schools. The Congress has appropriated over   $1 billion to the Charter School Program since 1995. The Credit  Enhancement for Charter School Facilities Program helps charter schools  obtain school facilities, one of the greatest challenges faced by new  charter schools. In total, the Congress has appropriated nearly $90 million  for Credit Enhancement for Charter School Facilities since 2001.", "While Education relies on states for the most part to oversee the  implementation of federal grant programs at the individual school level,  Education does sponsor research on schools in areas that support the  department\u2019s strategic goals, such as improving student achievement. A  considerable body of research related to charter school oversight by  authorizers has been conducted since 1991 by a number of policy research  organizations, as well as Education. In addition, to address the  department\u2019s interest in charter schools as an educational reform  initiative, Education has sponsored three studies, focusing on the  evolution of the charter school movement, the characteristics of charter  schools and charter school students, and charter schools\u2019 relationships  with authorizers and their communities. The first evaluation, The State of  Charter Schools, provides descriptive information about charter schools  that were operating in the 1998-99 school year. This study addressed how  charter schools have been implemented, under what conditions they have  improved student achievement, and their impact on public education. The  second evaluation, A Study of Charter School Accountability, by  researchers at the University of Washington, examined charter schools\u2019  relationships with authorizers and with their communities. The study  included the perspectives of both charter schools and authorizers. The  third study, A Decade of Public Charter Schools, evaluated the Public  Charter School Program and documented the evolution of the charter  school movement.

Figure 3, which  is based on responses of charter school state agency officials to our  survey, shows the types of authorizers states with a mix of authorizers  have established as well as those in states that allow only one type of  authorizer.", "A state with a mix of authorizers potentially provides charter school  founders more opportunity to find support for a wider range of  instructional approaches or educational philosophies than might be  possible with a single authorizer, such as the local school district. In  addition, providing more than one type of authorizer may expedite charter  school authorization and insulate the decision to approve a charter school  from the local political environment. The range of authorizers in states  that offered a mix of authorizers included LEAs that are local school  districts, other types of LEAs, state departments or boards of education,  public or private colleges or universities, and nonprofit organizations.  Two states\u2014Ohio and Minnesota\u2014had established more types of  authorizers than other charter school states. In school year 2002-03, Ohio  allowed the board of education, local school districts, an educational  service center, and a private university to authorize. That same year in  Minnesota, the department of education, local school districts and other  types of LEAs, public and private universities, and nonprofit organizations  served as authorizers. Examples of another type of authorizer can be  found in Arizona and the District of Columbia: both created a charter  school board independent of local school districts to authorize.", "In 11 of the 20 states with a mix of authorizers in school year 2002-03,  more than one authorizer was available in at least some geographic areas  that charter school developers could choose.

Most of the 11 states offering choice  emphasized that allowing choice was intended to provide charter school  developers with options, and these states allowed choice among all of the  state\u2019s authorizers. In a few of the 11 states, charter school developers had  choice in some areas of the state but not in other areas. For example, in  Milwaukee, Wisconsin, charter school developers could choose an  authorizer from several options: the LEA, the City of Milwaukee, the  University of Wisconsin or a local technical college. In Racine, charter  school developers could choose between the LEA and the University of  Wisconsin, but the university was limited to overseeing just one charter  school in Racine. However, outside of Milwaukee and Racine, charter  school developers did not have a choice of authorizers.", "In 7 of the 20 states with a mix of authorizers, choice of authorizer was not  available.

In 17 states,  the appeal is made to the state board of education, and in 3 states, the  state department of education hears the appeal. In the other states, a  charter school review panel or state board, the county office of education  or city council, a state or district court, or an independent party hears the  appeal.

As  figure 5 shows, 31 states reported that some or all charter schools in their  states received Title I funds in 2002-03; therefore, these Title I schools  would potentially be subject to NCLBA school improvement actions. In 21  of those states, a majority of charter schools received Title I funds. Table  14 in appendix II provides detailed responses on the percentage of Title I  charter schools by state.", "As mentioned previously in this report, our survey asked state officials  which entity in their state had primary responsibility for NCLBA  requirements, and consistent with Education\u2019s guidance, states reported a  variety of entities assuming these responsibilities. As shown in figure 6,  officials most commonly reported that development of school  improvement strategies is primarily the responsibility of the charter  holder\u2014the entity granted permission to establish the charter school. The  enforcement role was most often seen as the responsibility of the state  education agency, either the state department or board of education and,  less frequently, authorizers. However, in 9 of the 19 states that identified a  state agency as being primarily responsible, the state agency was the only  authorizer in the state. In addition, while 7 states reported that  enforcement is primarily an LEA responsibility, LEAs are the only  authorizers in 4 of these states.", "Among the first of the improvement actions specified for Title I schools  are the school choice transfer option and supplemental services. If a Title I  school does not meet the state\u2019s annual school performance goals for 2  consecutive years, it must be designated as in need of improvement.  Students attending these schools must be given the option to transfer to  another school in the district, and the transfer school offered must not be  designated in need of improvement under NCLBA. If a school does not  meet the target for a third year, students must be offered supplementary  educational services, such as tutoring. Officials in 18 of the 31 states with  Title I charter schools reported that at least one charter school in their  state had been designated in need of improvement in school year 2002- 03\u2014a total of 148 charter schools across the 18 states. Three of the 18  states reported a total of 15 charter schools implementing the school  choice transfer option. An additional 5 of the 18 states reported  implementing supplemental services rather than choice. Ten states  reported that neither choice nor supplemental services was implemented  or that they did not know if any school improvement action had been  taken. Table 14 in appendix II provides this information for each state.", "One of the possible reasons that states reported relatively few charter  schools implementing choice may be that many charter schools are single- school LEAs. In these cases, Education guidance says that to the extent  practicable, arrangements should be made with a neighboring LEA to  accept transferring students. If such arrangements cannot be made,  supplemental services may be offered as an alternative. Officials in 8 of the  39 states we surveyed reported that charter schools were considered  LEAs, and in 15 other states, some charter schools were LEAs. (See fig. 7.)  However, when charter schools are parts of LEAs under state law, as  reported by 16 states, and there are other eligible schools in the LEA to  which students could transfer, LEAs are required to offer transfers.  Charter school students who accept transfers under these conditions must  be provided transportation to the offered school, even if a state\u2019s charter  law does not require that transportation funds be made available for  charter schools.", "Those schools, including charter schools, that meet state performance  goals may serve as schools of choice for students transferring under  NCLBA or may provide supplemental services to students attending  schools that did not meet state goals. Officials in 4 states reported on our  survey that at least one charter school in their state received students  transferring under the NCLBA school choice provision, and officials in 3  states reported charter schools serving as providers of supplemental  services.", "A few states reported other reasons that school improvement actions,  including school choice transfer, were not implemented in charter schools.  In 1 state, timing was reported as a possible reason\u2014that is, school  improvement actions may have been planned but not yet taken by the end  of school year 2002-03. In 2 states, officials said that charter schools are  schools of choice and students may transfer at any time. In another state,  officials said they believed that in most charter schools needing  improvement, parents might have declined to transfer their children\u2014or  might not have been offered the transfer option because of a  misunderstanding of the law. However, some states did not know what  actions were taken in charter schools needing improvement. For example,  officials in 3 states, with a total of 78 charter schools needing  improvement in 2002-03, were unable to provide information about any  school improvement actions that may have been taken in those schools."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NCLBA Allows Certain Flexibilities for Charter Schools", "paragraphs": ["While most accountability provisions of NCLBA are applied in the same  way to charter and traditional schools, the law makes a distinction in  several areas. For one thing, NCLBA requirements for highly qualified  teachers make an exception in the certification requirement for charter  school teachers. In general, to be highly qualified under NCLBA, teachers  in core academic subjects must have obtained state teacher certification,  hold a bachelor\u2019s degree, and have demonstrated subject matter  knowledge. However, the law provides that teachers of core academic  subjects in charter schools meet the certification requirement if they meet  the requirements set forth in their state\u2019s charter school law regarding  certification or licensure. Officials in 13 of the 39 states in our survey  reported that their state law exempted charter school teachers from  certification requirements.", "In addition, Education\u2019s NCLBA guidance for charter schools modifies the  instructions regarding lotteries to give preference to students seeking to  transfer to the charter school under the choice provision of NCLBA.  Charter schools receiving funds under Education\u2019s Charter School  Program must use a lottery if they have more applicants than can be  served by the school. The NCLBA guidance permits such charter schools  to weight the lottery to increase the chances of admitting students seeking  to change schools under the law\u2019s choice provisions.", "Other areas where charter schools have had flexibility do not appear to be  affected by NCLBA, such as having additional, unique academic goals and  using additional assessments to measure progress for those goals. Officials  in 30 of the 39 charter school states we surveyed reported that all charter  schools included unique academic goals, not related to the state\u2019s annual  school performance goals, in their charters. Officials in 4 other states  reported that at least some of the charter schools in their states included  their own academic goals in their charters.

Although Education  monitors states\u2019 oversight systems and visits some school districts and  schools, the data collected during these site visits can only be used to  determine the timeliness of funds disbursed at the locations visited.  Therefore, Education has little information to use in ensuring that charter  schools receive their federal funds promptly or to know how well the  schools perform.

In the case of  the larger grant programs, Title I and the Individuals with Disabilities  Education Act (IDEA), Education makes grants to the states, which then  distribute the money to local education agencies. In such cases, Education  monitors state programs, including state systems for monitoring local  programs, by reviewing annual performance reports and conducting site  visits. As part of its monitoring process, Education visits a selected  number of school districts and schools. However, the data collected  during these site visits could be used to determine the timeliness only of  funds disbursed to the districts and schools visited. These data cannot be  used to check timeliness of funds dispersed to all of a state\u2019s charter  schools.", "NCLBA charges both Education and states with ensuring that new and  expanding charter schools receive all federal formula grant funds for  which they are eligible within 5 months of opening or expanding.  However, Education\u2019s OIG reported problems with the timeliness of Title I  grant payments to charter schools. In 2003 and 2004, the OIG examined the  timeliness of states\u2019 Title I payments to charter schools in Arizona,  California, and New York and found delays as long as 13 months in New  York and 6 months in Arizona. In reporting these findings, the OIG  included suggestions for improving Education\u2019s monitoring of payment  timeliness for charter schools. Education has generally accepted the  OIG\u2019s recommendations and proposes to take certain steps to improve its  monitoring of these payments.", "Responses to our survey suggested that states varied in their ability to  track federal funds flowing to charter schools in their states. For instance,  according to our survey, although officials in 36 states reported that they  monitored the federal funding that individual charter schools received,  just 13 states were able to report the proportion. However, according to  officials in at least two of these 13 states\u2014Ohio and Texas\u2014their states  have developed the capability to track the flow of state and federal funds  to charter schools through their automated financial information systems.  The information on funding flows and the timeliness of payments these  systems provide can assist state education agencies in Ohio and Texas in  ensuring that charter schools receive federal grant funds.", "For most grant programs, Education\u2019s financial data system does not  identify individual schools, nor does it distinguish between charter schools  and other schools. Instead, for most programs, funding is provided to, and  data are collected on, the grant recipient, which is usually an SEA or LEA.  The management information system that Education\u2019s grant managers use  to track funds and oversee their programs, GAPS, follows the payment and  timing of grants according to the fiscal agent, frequently an SEA or LEA.", "Only when schools are single-school LEAs can they serve as fiscal agents  in some programs. Even then, however, single-school charter school LEAs  are not separately identified as charter schools in GAPS. For the programs  shown in table 6, GAPS cannot be used to obtain complete information on  grant receipt at the charter school level. Furthermore, although there are  plans to develop a new management information system to improve grant  monitoring, it is unlikely that the new system will have the capability to  track Education\u2019s grant funds to the school level. Without the capability in  its financial information system to track federal funds to charter schools,  Education must rely on states for information to perform its responsibility  under NCLBA to ensure prompt payment of federal funds to individual  charter schools. According to Education\u2019s OIG, Education\u2019s current  monitoring of states does not systematically obtain information about  timeliness. While monitoring team members sometimes asked about  timely payment on their own initiative, Education\u2019s monitoring procedures  for Title I funds did not instruct team members to inquire about timely  payment of funds to charter schools.", "At present, a similar lack of charter school-level information exists for  school performance data. Education did not collect information on  NCLBA-related annual school performance goal status for any public  schools in school year 2002-03, and the performance data Education  collected about school improvement status did not allow the department  to distinguish charter schools from other public schools without additional  analysis and reporting. Education required states to submit a Consolidated  State Performance Report by December 2003 on specific aspects of  NCLBA implementation for the 2002-03 school year. Of the Consolidated  State Performance Report\u2019s three main sections\u2014student performance,  schools needing improvement, and school choice and supplemental  educational services\u2014none requested separate data on charter schools.", "Education also administers the Charter School Program, a grant program  designed specifically to encourage the development and expansion of  charter schools. The Charter School Program obligated about $199 million  in grants in fiscal year 2003. Typically, grants are awarded to state  agencies, although other entities, including schools, can apply directly if  their state does not have an approved application on file. The grant is  competitive; that is, applications are ranked and awards are made on the  basis of the applicant\u2019s ability to meet program goals. To monitor this  program, Education has collected information on how well the program is  meeting its goal of developing and expanding charter schools, using the  standard performance report used by most Education programs. This  report does not require that states receiving Charter School Program  grants provide this information in a standardized, uniform way. States  provided information about how they are meeting the goal in formats of  their own choosing, resulting in data that are not readily aggregated and  making determination of overall program success difficult. For example, at  least one state reported the number of grant applications received and  awarded but did not report on the number of schools actually opened and  operated that were funded by those grants, a piece of information critical  to assessing the program\u2019s goal of developing and expanding charter  schools.", "In 2003, federal program officials developed a supplementary form that  requested more specific indicators of performance; for instance, the form  asks specifically for the number of charter schools opened each year.  According to an Education official, the information provided on this form  has been useful in monitoring the grant, but completing it is voluntary on  the part of the states, and not all states choose to provide the information.  Having the data from all states on the number of new charter schools  started with Charter School Program funds would allow program officials  to monitor the program\u2019s goal of encouraging the development of charter  schools more precisely than the standard performance report permits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Data System Holds Promise for Tracking School-Level Performance Data; Financial Data Are More Problematic", "paragraphs": ["To support Education\u2019s grant management functions and to streamline  collection of performance reports across grant programs, Education is in  the process of developing the PBDMI. The PBDMI is designed to be a  comprehensive system that will integrate information from numerous data  sources. The design calls for the system to include both financial and  academic performance information. For the academic performance  information component, the PBDMI is expected to provide school-level  academic performance information for the department\u2019s major grant  programs, including information on NCLBA implementation. Education  officials also hope to use PBDMI\u2019s financial information to examine the  link between federal grant program resources and program results.", "Moreover, the system is designed to produce reports that break out  charter schools, but this capability is contingent upon receiving data from  states that identify charter schools. Education officials expect to  implement the academic performance information component in spring  2005, and the PBDMI\u2019s financial information component is in an early  stage of implementation.", "For academic performance information, the system\u2019s school-level data  categories will include whether schools have achieved annual state school  performance goals under NCLBA, whether or not students from the school  have transferred to other schools under school choice, and the number of  students receiving supplemental services. Reports covering these  categories would allow Education to monitor and analyze charter schools\u2019  NCLBA results. In fact, once the PBDMI is fully implemented, according to  an Education official, elements of the Consolidated State Performance  Report will be replaced, since the new system will allow Education to  monitor implementation of NCLBA in all public schools.", "Although the academic performance information component is fully  developed, the extent to which the PBDMI will provide school-level  financial information, including information that could be used to track  the timeliness of payments, still is unclear. The PBDMI is expected to draw  on the new grant tracking and monitoring system that will replace GAPS,  but that system is unlikely to have the capability to track Education\u2019s grant  funds to the school level, according to Education officials. Consequently,  on the basis of our discussions with Education officials, it appears  questionable that the PBDMI will be able to track federal funds to schools,  either traditional public schools or charter schools, unless other school- level data sources are available, such as information states may be able to  provide. However, according to Education officials, states and school  districts in some cases may not maintain complete school-level records on  federal grant fund disbursements. For instance, Education officials  explained that because for some grant programs, federal funds bypass the  states and go directly to school districts, states may not record the  disbursements. States\u2019 records also are incomplete in some cases because  states may redistribute the funds for federal grant programs, such as Title  I, and record those disbursements, but have no records of the  disbursements made by school districts or schools. Thus, Education\u2019s plan  for collecting school-level financial information for the PBDMI is not yet  complete.", "Through a separate process, the PBDMI also will make possible the  collection of specialized data, which could provide useful information in  understanding the performance of charter schools. Surveys will be used to  obtain information on schools or subpopulations of schools that is not  reported annually by state agencies. For charter schools, the specialized  information could include data such as authorizer type. Researchers then  would be able to use the PBDMI\u2019s information on characteristics of  charter school and the type of authorizer that oversees each charter  school in the design of charter school studies, such as Education\u2019s charter  school impact evaluation of the effectiveness of charter schools.  Collecting information on the entire charter school population, storing it in  the PBDMI, and updating it periodically would avoid the need for  researchers to collect basic descriptive information each time a charter  school study is conducted. The first survey\u2014which is not currently  focused on charter schools\u2014is planned for spring 2005.

Appendix  III shows selected charter school research projects sponsored by  Education. For example, the department has conducted a series of studies  based on national surveys, published as The State of Charter Schools and  A Decade of Public Charter Schools. These studies provided useful  information on the methods authorizers use to hold charter schools  responsible for academic performance and financial integrity, but they did  not examine states\u2019 oversight actions. These studies also have produced  valuable information on the flexibilities available to and preferred by  charter schools. Although they provided descriptive information on  authorizers\u2019 oversight methods, these studies were not designed to focus  on states\u2019 oversight actions and charter school performance.

It will  compare the achievement on standardized tests over 3 years for a cohort  of students accepted into the 50 charter schools and students who applied  to those schools but were not accepted. This approach should result in a  methodologically rigorous study design because acceptance into an  oversubscribed charter school is supposed to be based on a lottery.   Assignment by a lottery would yield a study group and a comparison group  that are created from randomly selected students. In order to identify the  conditions under which charter schools are most effective in improving  student achievement, the study is likely to include a measure of the  flexibility states offer charter schools, according to an Education official.  As originally designed, the study did not include plans to examine states\u2019  approaches to oversight or to associate these approaches with school  performance. According to department officials, subsequent revisions  were made to the study design to allow Education to examine how various  aspects of state and authorizer policy may contribute to student  achievement.

However, charter schools, as a group, are of  particular interest to policy makers because they hold promise as an  education reform. Education\u2019s inability to disaggregate charter schools in  its routine monitoring and analysis activities has limited its ability to  provide policy makers information on the academic performance of  charter schools, although the department\u2019s planned comprehensive data  system, PBDMI, is expected to improve this situation soon. However, the  department\u2019s plans for the financial component of PBDMI are much less  developed. Although it appears that the system has the potential to assist  the department in its responsibility to ensure timely grant payments to  charter schools, critical questions remain about the capability of states to  provide complete information on the timing and disbursements of federal  funds.

In Arizona, although we initially contacted the  state education agency, that agency and the independent charter school  board agreed that the independent board would take the lead in  completing the survey. However, both entities worked together to provide  a completed survey. In the District of Columbia, the Board of Education  opted to answer the survey only for the charter schools it authorized. To  obtain complete information, we asked the District of Columbia\u2019s  independent charter school board to complete a separate survey for its  charter schools. Where appropriate, we have provided the additional  information we obtained from the independent charter school board.", "The survey relied on state agency officials\u2019 self-reporting of flexibility,  accountability, and NCLBA implementation information. To ensure the  reliability of the data collected, responses from the follow-up interviews  were used to verify survey responses and to make corrections.
