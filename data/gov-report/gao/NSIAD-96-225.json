Such a system would aim to protect the United States from limited ballistic missile attacks, whether accidental, unauthorized, or deliberate.", "Ballistic missiles are self-propelled missiles guided in the ascent of a high-arch trajectory and freely falling in the descent.

Estimative judgments are to be defended by fully laying out the evidence and carefully explaining the analytic logic used, according to a former Deputy Director for Intelligence, CIA. Writing about NIEs, a former Vice Chairman of the NIC agreed. As a general rule, the more complex and controversial an issue, the more analytic effort is required to ensure that critical assumptions are precisely stated and well defended, according to the CIA. Good analysis will clearly identify its key assumptions so that policymakers are aware of the \u201cfoundations\u201d of the estimate and can therefore judge for themselves the appropriateness of the assumptions and the desirability of initiating actions to hedge against a failure of one or more assumptions.", "From our reading of NIE 95-19, we identified what appear to be its implicit critical assumptions. Most of these assumptions first appear in the NIE\u2019s Key Judgments section, leading the reader to believe that the IC considers these assumptions to be fact-based judgments. However, we did not find a body of evidence in NIE 95-19 that would allow us to consider these statements as judgments, rather than assumptions.

NIE 95-19 did, however, specify payload weights for the Taepo Dong 1 missile. NIE 93-19 explicitly analyzed the effects of changes in payload weight on the estimated range of ballistic missiles. The payload weight directly affects the range of a missile\u2014that is, a lighter payload allows any given missile to travel farther.

The NIE provided very little evidence to support its position that membership in the MTCR  (or pledges to abide by the MTCR in China\u2019s case) would necessarily prevent a country from selling missiles.
