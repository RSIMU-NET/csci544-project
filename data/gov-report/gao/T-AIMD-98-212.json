As you know, the year 2000 presents a particularly sweeping and urgent challenge for entities in this country. For this reason, in February 1997 we designated the Year 2000 problem as a high-risk area for the federal government, and have published guidanceto help organizations successfully address the issue. Since that time we have issued over 45 reports and testimony statements detailing specific findings and recommendations related to the Year 2000 compliance of a wide range of federal agency systems. The common theme has been that serious vulnerabilities remain in addressing the federal government\u2019s Year 2000 readiness, and that much more action is needed to ensure that agencies satisfactorily mitigate Year 2000 risks to avoid debilitating consequences.", "We have made many recommendations to the executive branch to reduce the risk of Year 2000-induced disruptions of critical services. Among these, we recommended that the Chair of the President\u2019s Council on Year 2000 Conversion develop a comprehensive picture of the nation\u2019s Year 2000 readiness. This effort would include identifying and assessing the risk of the nation\u2019s key economic sectors, including those posed by telecommunications. . As a result, if not modified, computer systems or applications that use dates or perform date- or time-sensitive calculations may generate incorrect results beyond 1999. and telecommunications technologies. In particular, such technologies have helped fuel the growth of the U.S. economy and have enabled major improvements in the nation\u2019s infrastructure. As a result, telecommunications service providers and their public- and private-sector customers have a lot at stake; the potential losses and disruptions that could accrue from noncompliant telecommunications systems could be staggering.", "My testimony today will (1) describe our nation\u2019s telecommunications infrastructure, (2) discuss the risks we face if critical components of that infrastructure are not Year 2000 compliant by the turn of the century, (3) describe federal government actions relating to national, international, and governmental telecommunications infrastructure, and (4) present issues that must be addressed."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Telecommunications Infrastructure", "paragraphs": ["The telecommunications infrastructure comprises the public telecommunications network; the Internet; and the millions of computer systems for government, defense, commercial, and personal use.

The Internet is a global network of networks interconnected by routers using a common set of protocols. Significant portions of the Internet rely on services provided by the public telecommunications networks.", "The rich array of reliable telecommunications services is made possible by a complex web of highly interconnected networks supported by switchesand other telecommunications devices. Along with national and local carriers and service providers, other important links in the chain are the equipment manufacturers and suppliers and customers, some of whom have specific telecommunications devices installed on their premises, such as private branch exchanges (PBX), and voice mail systems. The key is connectivity: all of the pieces must work together."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Services Vital to the Nation Depend Upon Reliable Telecommunications", "paragraphs": ["Telecommunications are critical to the operations of nearly every public- and private-sector organization. All other major sectors rely on it: banking and finance; health, safety, and emergency services; transportation; utilities; and manufacturing and small business. For example, it (1) enables the electronic transfer of funds, (2) is essential to the service economy, manufacturing, and efficient delivery of raw materials and finished goods, and (3) is basic to responsive emergency services.", "The federal government depends on the telecommunications infrastructure to deliver a wide range of services. Many agencies, including those in the Department of the Treasury and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), rely on both their private networks and on the public telecommunications network to conduct mission-critical business. For example, the route of an electronic Medicare payment may traverse several networks\u2014those operated by the HHS, Treasury\u2019s computer systems and networks, and the Federal Reserve\u2019s Fedwire electronic funds transfer system. Seamless connectivity among a wide range of networks and carriers is essential nationally and internationally.", "Recent nationwide telecommunications failures remind us of our dependence on telecommunications\u2014and the fragility of complex communications systems. On April 13, 1998, a software error in a single switch caused a major carrier to fail nationwide. According to press reports, during the 24-hour outage, the carrier\u2019s corporate customers were unable to complete critical network-based business; retailers were unable to authorize credit card payments; and financial institutions could not complete electronic transactions.", "Another failure occurred on May 19, 1998, when a communications satellite went into an uncontrolled spin after failure of a control system. The satellite\u2019s failure disrupted the operations of credit card authorization services, paging services for 80 to 90 percent of all pagers in the United States, and the distribution of television programs. While these failures were not caused by a Year 2000 problem, they illustrate the degree to which we depend upon reliable, available, interoperable telecommunications.", "Major disruption in the service provided by the public telecommunications network can affect millions of users and cause massive financial losses. The cost of disruptions and outages caused by noncompliant computer or telecommunications systems was discussed in a recent study of the potential impact of Year 2000-related foreign exchange settlement failures. According to the study, the market costs of a single major bank\u2019s inability to settle its trades could reach $3.3 billion in a single week. Business dependence on the public telecommunications infrastructure is particularly evident in the retail and financial sectors, where financial transactions with a combined value in the billions of dollars are made every day. Businesses and financial institutions rely heavily on telecommunications networks to participate in the global payments system, to exchange information with trading partners and regulatory agencies, and to manage their internal control systems and sophisticated computer equipment.", "The consequences of not resolving Year 2000 problems in the telecommunications infrastructure are broad-based and potentially disastrous.
