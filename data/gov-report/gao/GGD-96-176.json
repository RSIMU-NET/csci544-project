Many of these interactions have the potential to make taxpayers feel as if they have been mistreated or abused by IRS employees with whom they have dealt or by the \u201ctax system\u201d in general.", "IRS has several offices that are involved in handling taxpayers\u2019 concerns about how they have been treated, including those alleging taxpayer abuse, which are not resolved through normal daily operations. IRS\u2019 Inspection Service (Inspection), which includes the Internal Audit and Internal Security Divisions, is to investigate taxpayer allegations involving potential criminal misconduct by IRS employees. Problem Resolution Offices in IRS\u2019 district offices and service centers are to help taxpayers who have been unable to resolve their problems through normal IRS channels with other IRS staff. IRS\u2019 Office of Legislative Affairs is to track responses to congressional inquiries, often on behalf of constituents, as well as direct correspondence with the Commissioner or other IRS executives involving the tax system or IRS\u2019 administration of it.", "OIG and DOJ may also get involved with taxpayer abuse allegations. OIG may investigate allegations involving senior IRS officials, those who serve in General Schedule (GS) grade-15 positions or higher, as well as IRS Inspection employees. IRS employees accused of criminal misconduct may be prosecuted by a DOJ U. S. Attorney. IRS employees who are sued by taxpayers for actions taken within the employees\u2019 official duties may be defended by attorneys with the DOJ Tax Division.", "In our 1994 report on IRS\u2019 controls to protect against taxpayer abuse, we were unable to determine the overall adequacy of IRS\u2019 controls and made several recommendations to improve them. Foremost among our recommendations was that IRS define taxpayer abuse and collect relevant management information to systematically track its nature and extent. At that time, in the absence of an IRS definition, we defined taxpayer abuse to include instances when (1) an IRS employee violated a law, regulation, or the IRS Rules of Conduct; (2) an IRS employee was unnecessarily aggressive in applying discretionary enforcement power; or (3) IRS\u2019 information systems broke down, e.g. when taxpayers repeatedly received tax deficiency notices and payment demands despite continual contacts with IRS to resolve problems with their accounts. Other recommendations in our 1994 report addressed such concerns as unauthorized access to computerized taxpayer information, improper use and processing of taxpayer cash payments, and the need for IRS notification of potential employee liability for trust fund recovery penalties. IRS did not agree with the need to define taxpayer abuse\u2014a term it found objectionable\u2014nor to track its nature and extent; but IRS agreed to take corrective action on many of our other recommendations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To determine the adequacy of IRS\u2019 current controls over taxpayer abuse, we identified and documented actions taken by IRS in response to the recommendations in our 1994 report.

Finally, we discussed with IRS officials a recent commitment they made to define and establish a taxpayer complaints tracking system and the current status of this effort.", "To determine the extent of information available concerning the number and outcomes of abuse allegations received and investigated by IRS, OIG, and DOJ, we interviewed officials from the respective organizations and reviewed documentation relative to their information systems. We were told that the information systems maintained by these organizations do not include specific data elements for alleged taxpayer abuse. However, these officials said they believed that examples of alleged taxpayer abuse may be found within other general data categories in five IRS systems, two DOJ systems, and an OIG system. For example, IRS officials indicated that alleged taxpayer abuse might be found in a system used to track disciplinary actions against employees. This information is captured under the general data categories of \u201ctaxpayer charge or complaint\u201d and \u201cmisuse of position or authority.\u201d Similar examples were provided by officials from each organization as described in appendix II.", "We discussed the general objectives and uses of the relevant information systems with officials from the respective agencies. We also reviewed examples of the data produced by these systems under the suggested general data categories to ascertain if it was possible from these examples to determine whether taxpayer abuse may have occurred. We did not attempt to verify the accuracy of the data we received, because to do so would require an extensive, time-consuming review of related case files. This was beyond the scope and time available for this study.", "To determine OIG\u2019s role in investigating allegations of taxpayer abuse, we obtained and reviewed Treasury orders and directives establishing and delineating the responsibilities of OIG, as well as a 1994 Memorandum of Understanding between OIG and IRS outlining specific procedures to be followed by each staff for reporting and investigating allegations of misconduct and fraud, waste, and abuse. We also obtained statistics from OIG staff concerning the number of allegations they received and investigations they conducted involving IRS employees for fiscal year 1995\u2014the latest year for which data were available. In addition, we discussed OIG\u2019s role and the relationship between OIG and IRS staffs with senior officials from both OIG and IRS.", "We requested comments on a draft of this report from the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, the Treasury Inspector General, and the Attorney General. On August 9, 1996, we received written comments from IRS, which are summarized on page 15 and are reprinted in appendix III. We also received written comments, which were technical in nature, from both the Treasury\u2019s OIG and DOJ.

We cannot determine the adequacy of these controls because IRS officials have not yet established a capability to capture management information, which is needed to ensure that abuse is identified and addressed and to prevent its recurrence. We are, however, encouraged by a recent commitment on the part of IRS\u2019 Deputy Commissioner to establish a tracking system for taxpayer complaints. Such a system has the potential to greatly improve IRS\u2019 controls to protect against taxpayer abuse and better ensure that taxpayers are treated properly."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "IRS Officials Have Expressed Commitment to Establishing a Complaints Tracking System", "paragraphs": ["In exploring how IRS could satisfy a mandate included in the recently enacted Taxpayer Bill of Rights 2 to report annually to Congress on employee misconduct and taxpayer complaints, IRS recognized and acknowledged that such a mandate could not be satisfied with its existing information systems and that a definition for \u201ctaxpayer complaints\u201d would be necessary, along with sufficient related management information to ensure that complaints are identified, addressed, and analyzed to prevent their recurrence.", "Although IRS said it still believes the term \u201ctaxpayer abuse\u201d is misleading, inaccurate, and inflammatory, IRS decided to use the basic elements that we used in our 1994 report definition for taxpayer abuse as a starting point to develop a definition for taxpayer complaints. The basic elements from our report included when (1) an IRS employee violated a law, regulation, or the IRS Rules of Conduct; (2) an IRS employee was unnecessarily aggressive in applying discretionary enforcement power; or (3) IRS\u2019 information systems broke down, e.g. when taxpayers repeatedly received tax deficiency notices and payment demands despite continual contacts with IRS to resolve problems with their accounts.", "With input from members of IRS\u2019 Executive Committee, an IRS task group decided upon the following definition for taxpayer complaints: an allegation by a taxpayer or taxpayer representative that (1) an IRS employee violated a law, regulation, or the IRS Rules of Conduct; (2) an IRS employee used inappropriate behavior in the treatment of taxpayers while conducting official business, such as rudeness, overzealousness, excessive aggressiveness, discriminatory treatment, intimidation, and the like; or (3) an IRS system failed to function properly or within prescribed time frames. This definition was endorsed by the IRS Deputy Commissioner in a June 17, 1996, memorandum.", "IRS has decided to use the Problem Resolution Office Management Information System (PROMIS), with modifications, as a platform for compiling information about taxpayer complaints involving inappropriate employee behavior and systemic breakdowns. However, numerous decisions remain concerning how to track and assess the handling of all taxpayer complaints. For example, IRS already has two systems that are designed to capture data relevant to alleged employee misconduct. PROMIS is currently designed to capture data relevant to possible systemic breakdowns. The two systems capturing misconduct information, however, do not capture data in a manner that is comparable to one another or to PROMIS. IRS officials readily concede that at present, there is no IRS information system designed to capture data relevant to complaints of inappropriate employee behavior. They realize that to capture and compile information relevant to all three elements of the taxpayer complaints definition in a comparable and uniform manner will be a considerable challenge, especially for the highly subjective element involving inappropriate employee behavior. However, the officials assured us that they are now committed to rising to that challenge.", "While we are encouraged by IRS\u2019 commitment, we recognize the formidable challenge IRS faces to capture complete, consistent, and accurate information about the IRS definition for taxpayer complaints. Rising to the challenge, however, is critical for IRS to have adequate controls to protect against taxpayer abuse as well as being able to satisfy its new requirement to annually report to Congress on employee misconduct and taxpayer complaints."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other IRS Initiatives Should Improve Related Controls", "paragraphs": ["Since our 1994 study, IRS has initiated various actions to implement our recommendations, as described in appendix I. For example, among other actions, IRS has initiated the following :", "Regarding unauthorized employee access to computerized taxpayer accounts, IRS (1) issued a 12-point Information Security Policy to all employees in January 1995, stressing the importance of taxpayer privacy and the security of tax data and (2) has begun development of an Information System Target Security Architecture to include management, operational, and technical controls for incorporation in the Tax System Modernization Program\u2014a long-term effort to modernize IRS\u2019 computer and telecommunications systems.", "Regarding the improper use and processing of taxpayer cash payments, IRS (1) included statements in its 1995 forms and instructions encouraging taxpayers to make payments with either a check or money order rather than cash and (2) is instructing its managers to conduct periodic unannounced reconciliations of cash receipts used by the IRS staff who collect taxes from taxpayers.", "Regarding the need for IRS to notify employers of the potential liability of their officers and employees for a trust fund recovery penalty when businesses fail to collect or pay withheld income, employment, or excise taxes, IRS has included notices of this liability in both Publication 334, \u201cTax Guide for Small Businesses\u201d and Circular E, \u201cEmployer\u2019s Tax Guide.\u201d", "In addition to these actions, IRS has recently undertaken other initiatives in anticipation of some provisions included in the recently enacted Taxpayer Bill of Rights 2. In January 1996, IRS announced a series of initiatives designed to reduce taxpayer burden and make it easier for taxpayers to understand and exercise their rights. These initiatives included (1) enhanced powers for the Taxpayer Ombudsman, such as explicit authority to issue a refund to a taxpayer to relieve a severe financial hardship; (2) notification of a spouse regarding any collection action taken against a divorced or separated spouse for a joint tax liability; (3) increased computerized record storage and electronic filing options for businesses; (4) expedited appeals procedures for employment tax issues; and (5) a test of an appeals mediation procedure.", "IRS has also started to use information on taxpayer problems captured in PROMIS. IRS recently used this system to identify the volume of taxpayer problems categorized by various major issues, such as refund inquiries, collection actions, penalties, and the earned income tax credit. The Ombudsman has requested IRS\u2019 top executives to review the major issues identified for their respective offices or regions in an effort to devise cost-effective ways to reduce these problems.", "While we did not test the implementation of these various initiatives, they appear to be conceptually sound and thus we believe that, if effectively implemented, they should help to strengthen IRS\u2019 overall controls and procedures to identify, address, and prevent the recurrence of taxpayer abuse."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Extent of Taxpayer Abuse Not Distinguishable in IRS, OIG, and DOJ Information Systems", "paragraphs": ["It is not possible to readily determine the extent to which allegations of taxpayer abuse are received and investigated from the information systems maintained by IRS, OIG, and DOJ. These systems were designed as case tracking and resource management systems intended to serve the management information needs of particular functions, such as IRS\u2019 Internal Security Division. None of these systems include specific data elements for \u201ctaxpayer abuse;\u201d however, they contain data elements that encompass broad categories of misconduct, taxpayer problems, or legal actions. Without reviewing specific case files, information contained in these systems related to allegations and investigations of taxpayer abuse is not easily distinguishable from information on allegations and investigations that do not involve taxpayers. Consequently, as currently designed, these systems cannot be used individually or collectively to account for IRS\u2019 handling of all instances of alleged taxpayer abuse.", "Officials of the respective organizations indicated that several information systems might include information related to taxpayer abuse allegations\u2014five maintained by IRS, two by DOJ, and one by OIG\u2014as described in appendix II.

ISMIS is used to determine the status and outcome of Internal Security investigations of alleged employee misconduct; ALERTS is used to track disciplinary actions taken against employees. While ISMIS and ALERTS both track aspects of alleged employee misconduct, these systems do not share common data elements or otherwise capture information in a consistent manner.", "IRS also has three systems that include information on concerns raised by taxpayers. These systems include two maintained by the Office of Legislative Affairs\u2014the Congressional Correspondence Tracking System and the Commissioner\u2019s Mail Tracking System\u2014as well as PROMIS, which we described earlier. The two Legislative Affairs systems basically track taxpayers\u2019 inquiries, including those made through congressional offices, to ensure that responses are provided by appropriate IRS officials. PROMIS tracks similar information to ensure that taxpayers\u2019 problems are resolved and to determine whether the problems are recurring in nature.", "OIG has an information system known as the OIG Office of Investigations Management Information System (OIG/OIMIS) that is used to track the status and outcomes of OIG investigations as well as the status and outcomes of actions taken by IRS in response to OIG investigations and referrals. As discussed further in the next section of this report, most OIG investigations do not involve allegations of taxpayer abuse because those IRS employees that OIG typically investigates\u2014primarily senior-level officials\u2014usually do not interact directly with taxpayers.", "DOJ has two information systems that include data that may be related to taxpayer abuse allegations and investigations. The Executive Office of the U. S. Attorneys maintains a Centralized Caseload System that is used to consolidate the status and results of civil and criminal prosecutions conducted by offices of the U. S. Attorney throughout the country. Cases involving criminal misconduct by IRS employees would be referred to and may be prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney in the particular jurisdiction in which the alleged misconduct occurred. The Tax Division also maintains a Case Management System that is used for case tracking, time reporting, and statistical analysis of litigation cases conducted by the Tax Division. Lawsuits against either IRS or IRS employees are litigated by the Tax Division, with representation provided to IRS employees if the Tax Division determines that the actions taken by the employees were within the scope of employment.", "The officials familiar with these systems stated that, while the systems include data elements in which potential taxpayer abuse may have occurred, they do not include a specific data element for taxpayer abuse, which could be used to easily distinguish abuse allegations from others not involving taxpayers. For example, officials from the Executive Office for the U. S. Attorneys stated that the public corruption and tort categories of their Case Management System may include instances of taxpayer abuse, but the system could not be used to identify such instances without a review of individual case files.", "From our review of data from these systems, we concluded that none of them, either individually or collectively, have common or comparable data elements that can be used to identify the number or outcomes of taxpayer abuse allegations or related investigations and actions. Rather, each system was developed to provide information for a particular organizational function, usually for case tracking, inventory, or other managerial purposes relative to the mission of that particular function. While each system has data elements that could reflect how taxpayers have been treated, as described in appendix II, the data elements vary and may relate to the same allegation and same IRS employee. Without common or comparable data elements and unique allegation and employee identifiers, these systems do not collect information in a consistent manner that could be used to accurately account for all allegations of taxpayer abuse."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Role of the Treasury OIG in Investigating Taxpayer Abuse Allegations", "paragraphs": ["OIG is responsible for investigating allegations of misconduct and waste, fraud, and abuse involving senior IRS officials, GS-15s and above, as well as IRS Inspection employees. OIG also has oversight responsibility for the overall operations of Inspection. Since November 1994, OIG has had increased flexibility for referring allegations involving GS-15s to IRS for investigation or administrative action. This was due to resource constraints and an increased emphasis by OIG on investigations involving criminal misconduct and procurement fraud across all Treasury bureaus. In fiscal year 1995, OIG conducted 44 investigations\u201414 percent of the 321 allegations it received\u2014for the most part, implicating senior IRS officials. OIG officials stated that these investigations rarely involved allegations of taxpayer abuse because senior IRS officials and Inspection employees usually do not interact directly with taxpayers.", "OIG and Inspection have a unique relationship, relative to that of OIG and other Treasury bureau audit and investigative authorities. The IRS Chief Inspector, who reports directly to the IRS Commissioner, is responsible for IRS internal audits and investigations as well as coordinating Inspection activities with OIG. Inspection is to work closely with OIG in planning and performing its duties, and is to provide information on its activities and results to OIG for incorporation into OIG\u2019s semiannual report to Congress. Disputes the IRS Chief Inspector may have with the Commissioner can be resolved through OIG and the Secretary of the Treasury, to whom OIG reports.", "The Department of the Treasury established the Office of the Inspector General (IG) consistent with the authority provided in the \u201cInspector General Act of 1978,\u201d although Treasury already had internal audit and investigation capabilities for the Department as well as its bureaus. The existing capabilities included Inspection, which was responsible for all audits and investigations of IRS operations. Among OIG\u2019s express authorities were the investigation of allegations implicating senior IRS officials and the oversight of Inspection\u2019s audit and investigative activities.", "OIG resources to discharge these responsibilities were augmented in fiscal year 1990, by the transfer of 21 staff years from IRS\u2019 appropriations to that of OIG. The IG Act was amended in 1988 with special provisions included to, among other things, ensure the privacy of tax-related information. These provisions did not limit OIG\u2019s authority but required an explicit accounting of OIG\u2019s access to tax-related information in performing audits or investigations of IRS operations. The OIG\u2019s authorities were also articulated in Treasury Order 114-01 signed by the Secretary of the Treasury in May 1989.", "Specifically related to OIG investigative authorities, in September 1992, the Treasury IG issued Treasury Directive 40-01 summarizing the authority vested in OIG and the reporting responsibilities of various Treasury bureaus. Among the responsibilities of law enforcement bureaus, including IRS, are to (1) provide a monthly report to OIG concerning significant internal investigative and audit activities, (2) notify OIG immediately upon receiving allegations involving senior officials or internal affairs or inspection employees, and (3) submit written responses to OIG detailing actions taken or planned in response to OIG investigative reports and OIG referrals for agency management action.", "Under procedures established in a Memorandum of Understanding between OIG and IRS in November 1994, the requirement for immediate referrals to OIG of all misconduct allegations was reiterated and supplemented. OIG has the discretion to refer any allegation to IRS for appropriate action, i.e., either investigation by Inspection or administrative action by IRS management. If IRS officials believe that an allegation referred by OIG warrants OIG attention, they may refer the case back to OIG requesting that OIG conduct an investigation.", "OIG officials advised us that under the original 1992 directive, they generally handled most allegations implicating Senior Executive Service (SES) and Inspection employees, while reserving the right of first refusal on GS-15 employees. Under the procedures adopted in 1994, which were driven in part by resource constraints and OIG\u2019s need to do more criminal misconduct and procurement fraud investigations across all Treasury bureaus, OIG officials stated they have generally referred allegations involving GS-15s and below to IRS for investigation or management action. The same is true for allegations against any employees, including those in SES, involving administrative matters and allegations dealing primarily with tax disputes. OIG officials said that a determination is made by OIG after a preliminary review of the merits of the allegations whether to investigate, refer to IRS to either investigate or take administrative action, or to take no action at all. Table 1 summarizes the number and disposition of allegations received by OIG involving IRS in fiscal year 1995.", "In fiscal year 1995, OIG received 321 allegations, many of which involved senior IRS officials. After a preliminary review, OIG decided no action was warranted on 71 of the allegations, referred 201 to IRS\u2014either for investigation or administrative action\u2014investigated 44, and closed 5 others for various administrative reasons.", "OIG officials stated that, based on their investigative experience, most allegations of wrongdoing by IRS staff that involve taxpayers do not involve senior level IRS officials or Inspection employees. Rather, these allegations typically involve those IRS Examination and Collection employees who most often interact directly with taxpayers.", "OIG officials are to assess the adequacy of IRS\u2019 actions in response to OIG investigations and referrals as follows: (1) IRS is required to make written responses on actions taken within 90 days and 120 days, respectively, on OIG investigative reports of completed investigations and OIG referrals for investigations or management action; (2) OIG investigators are to assess the adequacy of IRS\u2019 responses before closing the OIG case; and (3) OIG Office of Oversight is to assess the overall effectiveness of IRS Inspection capabilities and systems through periodic operational reviews. In addition to assessing IRS\u2019 responses to OIG investigations and referrals, each quarter the IG, Deputy IG, and Assistant IG for Investigations meet to brief the IRS Commissioner, Deputy Commissioner, and Chief Inspector on the status of allegations involving senior IRS officials, including those being investigated by OIG and those awaiting IRS action.", "While officials from both agencies agree that the arrangement is working well to ensure allegations involving senior IRS officials and Inspection employees are being handled properly, OIG officials expressed some concern with the amount of time IRS typically takes to respond with actions on OIG investigations and referrals. IRS officials acknowledged that responses are not always within OIG time frames because, among other reasons, determinations about taking disciplinary actions and imposing such actions may take a considerable amount of time. Also, they said some cases must be returned for additional development by OIG, which may prolong the time for completion. The IRS officials, however, also suggested that actions on OIG referrals are closely monitored as evidenced by their inclusion in discussions during quarterly IG briefings with the Commissioner.
