The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for ensuring that imported seafood is safe and produced under sanitation and safety systems comparable to those of the United States. Since GAO reported in 2001 that FDA's seafood inspection program did not sufficiently protect consumers, additional concerns have arisen about imported seafood containing banned substances, such as certain antibiotics. In this review, GAO was asked to evaluate (1) FDA's progress in implementing the recommendations in the 2001 report and (2) other options to enhance FDA's oversight."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Since GAO's January 2001 report, FDA's imported seafood safety program has shown some improvement. FDA inspects more foreign firms, and its inspections show that more U.S. seafood importers are complying with its requirements. FDA also slightly increased the number of seafood products it tests at U.S. ports of entry to just over 1 percent. However, FDA still has not established equivalence agreements with seafood exporting countries as GAO recommended in its 2001 report. Equivalence agreements that commit U.S. trading partners to maintain comparable food safety systems are an efficient way to ensure imported seafood safety. Unlike the U.S. Department of Agriculture, FDA is not legally required to certify that countries exporting food products to the United States have equivalent food safety systems. According to a panel of nationally recognized experts that GAO convened to address this and other issues, establishing these types of agreements would shift some of FDA's burden for ensuring seafood safety to foreign governments. This shift, in turn, would allow FDA to focus its limited resources on seafood products from countries with less advanced food safety systems. FDA also made little progress regarding the recommendation GAO made in 2001 that FDA communicate to U.S. port-of-entry personnel serious deficiencies identified during inspections so that potentially contaminated imported seafood is examined before it enters the United States. GAO found that FDA continues to experience long delays between finding deficiencies and taking action. For example, GAO's review of foreign firm inspection records found that it took an average of 348 days for FDA to alert port-ofentry personnel about serious safety problems identified at six foreign firms. Moreover, GAO found that FDA does not prioritize enforcement actions when violations that pose the most serious public health risk occur or have an automated system to track the time involved in documenting, reviewing, and processing enforcement actions. FDA officials acknowledged some of the problems that GAO identified regarding FDA's current imported seafood inspection program, but they also raised concerns about limited inspection resources and competing priorities, such as the recent need to implement provisions of the Bioterrorism Act of 2002. GAO identified several options that FDA could consider to augment its resources and enhance its current program, including (1) commissioning seafood inspectors from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Seafood Inspection Program, (2) using state regulatory laboratories and/or private laboratories to augment FDA's testing of imported seafood, and (3) developing a program to use third-party inspectors to augment its program."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["More than 80 percent of the seafood that Americans consume is imported  from an estimated 13,000 foreign suppliers in about 160 nations. If  contaminated, imported and domestic seafood can cause foodborne  illnesses, with problems ranging from mild gastrointestinal discomfort to  neurological damage. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  (CDC) estimates that contaminated seafood (finfish and crustaceans)  accounted for about 15 percent of the documented foodborne illness  outbreaks in the United States\u2014a greater percentage than either meat or  poultry, even though meat and poultry are consumed at 8 and 6 times the  rate of seafood, respectively.", "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for ensuring the  safety of domestic and imported seafood. It implements the Hazard  Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) system\u2014a science-based,  food safety program introduced for seafood in 1997. The HACCP system is  designed to improve food safety by having industry identify and control  biological, chemical, and physical hazards in products before they enter the  market. Under FDA\u2019s food safety regulations, seafood-processing firms  must identify hazards that are reasonably likely to occur and must develop  and implement plans to control those hazards.", "To ensure compliance with its food safety regulations, FDA requires that  importers meet one of two conditions. First, importers may obtain seafood  from countries that have entered into voluntary agreements with FDA.  These agreements may document that foreign countries\u2019 seafood safety  systems are equivalent to or in compliance with that of the United States.  Second, if these agreements do not exist, importers must have records  demonstrating that foreign firms\u2019 products offered for entry into the United  States have been processed in accordance with U.S. HACCP requirements.  Such records may include, for example, a copy of the foreign firms\u2019 HACCP  plan. FDA inspects some U.S. importers and some foreign firms to  determine their compliance with HACCP regulations. It also examines and  tests selected samples of imported seafood products at U.S. ports of entry  to verify their safety. FDA has the authority to hold imported seafood  products while it determines if the product is adulterated. FDA also has  the authority to detain imported seafood products and require importers to  demonstrate that the products are not adulterated, a process called  detention without physical examination (DWPE).", "The Department of Commerce also has a role in promoting seafood safety  and quality. The department has statutory authority for providing voluntary  inspection services to assist in marketing seafood products. These  inspection services are provided through its Seafood Inspection Program,  which is located in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  (NOAA). The Seafood Inspection Program provides fee-for-service safety,  sanitation, and/or product inspections for approximately 2,500 foreign and  domestic firms annually. Program services include inspections for safety,  wholesomeness, and proper handling as well as grading seafood,  laboratory analysis, training, and product inspection and certification. The  Seafood Inspection Program\u2019s services affect 17 percent of the imported  and domestic seafood consumed in the United States.", "In 2001, we reported that FDA\u2019s oversight of domestic and imported  seafood provided insufficient assurance that the seafood is safe. With  regard to imported seafood, we found that FDA relied on reviews of  importers\u2019 records, inspections of selected foreign firms, and product  examination and testing at the port of entry to ensure seafood safety\u2014but  that FDA reviewed records or performed inspections for a very small  percentage of products. For example, FDA tested less than 1 percent of all  seafood products imported into the United States in fiscal year 1999.  To  better ensure the safety of imported seafood, we recommended that FDA  develop specific goals and time frames for establishing agreements with  other countries to document that their seafood safety systems are  equivalent to that of the United States. Without such equivalence  agreements, FDA must rely principally on its reviews of importers\u2019 records  to ascertain that imported seafood products are processed under an  acceptable food safety system. Many importers did not have the required  documentation, and, when they did, the documentation often did not  adequately demonstrate compliance. We also recommended that FDA  communicate to agency personnel at U.S. ports of entry deficiencies  identified during its importer and foreign firm inspections because FDA  was not scrutinizing products from problem firms at these ports.", "Since our 2001 report, questions have persisted about the effectiveness of  FDA\u2019s seafood safety program and about the adequacy of the agency\u2019s  inspection and laboratory resources. You asked us to (1) reevaluate FDA\u2019s  program for ensuring the safety of imported seafood and determine the  status of FDA\u2019s efforts to implement our recommendations and (2) explore  other options for enhancing FDA\u2019s imported seafood inspection program,  such as using the inspection programs and laboratories of other entities.", "In response to your request, we reexamined FDA\u2019s program for ensuring  the safety of imported seafood, including the status of equivalence  agreements, inspections of importers and foreign firms, and product  examination and testing at ports of entry. To determine FDA\u2019s progress in  establishing equivalence agreements with countries that export seafood to  the United States, we interviewed FDA officials who are responsible for  evaluating other countries\u2019 food safety systems. To evaluate FDA\u2019s actions  to enforce compliance with its food safety requirements, we analyzed  FDA\u2019s records of inspections for a random sample of U.S. importers and for  all of the foreign firm inspections conducted in fiscal year 2002. To explore  other options for enhancing FDA\u2019s current imported seafood inspection  program, we convened a panel of nationally recognized food safety experts.  The panel, selected with assistance from the National Academies,  discussed the effectiveness of FDA\u2019s current approach for ensuring the  safety of imported seafood and provided advice on ways to strengthen it. In  addition, the panel (1) discussed several other options, such as using  NOAA\u2019s Seafood Inspection Program and laboratories, as well as those of  other entities, to enhance FDA\u2019s program and (2) deliberated the  advantages and disadvantages of the various options. Appendix I contains  additional details of our scope and methodology, and appendix II contains  a summer of the expert panel\u2019s observations on the safety of imported  seafood."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["CDC estimates that contaminated food causes 76 million illnesses, 325,000  hospitalizations, and 5,000 deaths in the United States each year. On the  basis of the number of confirmed outbreaks of foodborne disease in 1997,  the latest year for which CDC\u2019s data are available, seafood is one of the  leading causes of foodborne illness outbreaks in the United States.  Seafood products represented about 15 percent, or 26, of the 169 foodborne  illness outbreaks from a confirmed source\u2014a level greater than that  associated with meat or poultry products, which are consumed at 8 and 6  times the rate of seafood, respectively. However, as we reported in 2001,  CDC officials said that foodborne illness outbreaks are generally  underreported and that it is easier to identify the source of some  diagnosable illnesses, such as scombroid poisoning from seafood, than  illnesses that result from nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms caused by  other foods. Moreover, the actual number of individual cases of illnesses  resulting from traced outbreaks were higher for meat and poultry (619 and  353 cases, respectively) compared with 108 cases for seafood. FDA stated  that seafood outbreaks may have involved fewer individual cases of illness  because seafood has much lower consumption rates than meat and poultry.  FDA also noted that some seafood-related illnesses may be caused by  recreational or subsistence fishing over which the federal government has  little or no control. The Center for Science in the Public Interest, a  consumer interest group that works on nutrition and food safety issues, has  used CDC data and other sources to track the number of reported food- poisoning outbreaks in the United States and estimates that seafood was  responsible for 18 percent of the outbreaks of foodborne illnesses that the  center tracked between 1990 and 2002.", "Several types of hazards can cause seafood-related illnesses. Specifically:   Biological hazards\u2014include pathogens, such as Clostridium  botulinum, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella species, and  Staphylococcus aureus, and parasites such as roundworms and  tapeworms.", "Chemical hazards\u2014include compounds such as methylmercury, which  can cause illness from long-term exposure; residues from drugs  unapproved for use in food animals, such as chloramphenicol and  nitrofurans, or overuse of approved drugs that are sometimes used in  aquaculture production, which may be carcinogenic, allergenic, and/or  cause antibiotic resistance in humans; and marine toxins. According to  FDA officials, two marine toxins with potentially serious health  effects\u2014scombrotoxin and ciguatoxin\u2014cause most of the reported  seafood-related illnesses, including gastrointestinal and neurological  problems. These toxins are heat resistant and cannot be inactivated by  cooking.", "Physical hazards\u2014include foreign objects in food that can cause harm  when eaten, such as glass or metal fragments.", "Figure 1 shows the steady growth in U.S. consumption and imports of  seafood between 1993 and 2002. According to data from the NOAA\u2019s  National Marine Fisheries Service, the United States imported about 4.2  billion pounds, or more than 80 percent, of its seafood in 2002, as shown in  the figure.", "In addition, U.S. seafood consumption rose about 25 percent between 1980  and 2002, from 12.5 pounds per person to 15.6 pounds per person. Most  seafood consumed in the United States is imported from an estimated 160  countries and 13,000 foreign processors. In 2002, the top 6 seafood  exporting countries\u2014Canada, China, Thailand, Chile, Ecuador, and  Vietnam\u2014accounted for approximately 63 percent of imported seafood.  Imported products include fresh and frozen tuna and salmon as well as  crustaceans, such as shrimp and lobsters. Figure 2 shows the proportion of  imports to the United States from the 6 leading exporting countries.", "A large and rapidly growing proportion of worldwide seafood production,  including U.S. imports, is produced by aquaculture. In 2000, aquaculture  represented about 27 percent of global seafood production, and has  increased by an average of 9.2 percent annually since 1970, compared with  only an average 1.4 percent increase for captured seafood, according to the  Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. As in other  animal production systems, aquaculture producers may use antibiotics and  other chemicals to prevent or treat disease. Some producers have been  found to misuse approved drugs or to use unapproved drugs or chemicals  that pose potential human health hazards, such as antibiotic resistance,  allergic reactions, or cancer. In recent years, food safety authorities in  Europe, Canada, and the United States have begun to detect these  substances and are taking steps to control their illegal use.", "FDA is responsible for ensuring the safety of both domestic and imported  seafood under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. In 1997,  following recommendations by the National Academy of Sciences and  others, FDA adopted a program of preventative controls that are designed  to identify hazards during the seafood-production process and minimize  the risk of contamination. The HACCP regulations made seafood- processing firms responsible for identifying harmful microbiological,  chemical, and physical hazards that are reasonably likely to occur and for  establishing critical control points (CCP) to prevent and reduce  contamination. The HACCP system is based on the following seven  principles that each seafood firm must address:   Conduct a hazard analysis. Identify hazards that are reasonably likely  to occur.", "Identify the CCP. Identify a point, step, or procedure in the production  process where controls can be applied to prevent, eliminate, or reduce  to an acceptable level a food safety hazard that is reasonably likely to  occur.", "Establish critical limits for each CCP. Set the maximum or minimum  value at which parameters, such as cooking time and temperature, must  be controlled at each CCP to prevent, eliminate, or reduce the hazard to  an acceptable level.", "Monitor each CCP. Establish monitoring activities that will ensure that  the process is under control at each CCP.", "Establish corrective actions. Define actions to be taken when  monitoring discloses a deviation from established critical limits.", "Establish verification procedures. Establish verification procedures to  ensure that HACCP plans accomplish their intended goal\u2014that is,  ensuring the production of safe products.", "Establish record-keeping and documentation procedures. Maintain  documentation, including the HACCP plan; CCP monitoring; corrective  actions; and verification activities.", "Under the HACCP regulations, seafood-processing firms are responsible  for conducting a hazard analysis and for developing and implementing  HACCP plans for hazards that are determined to be reasonably likely to  occur. These hazards may include marine toxins, microbiological  contamination, chemical contamination, pesticides, drug residues,  decomposition in certain species, parasites, the unapproved use of food or  color additives, and physical hazards. For each hazard identified, the firms  must establish CCPs to prevent or reduce contamination. Firms also must  establish and monitor sanitation procedures to ensure, among other things,  the (1) general cleanliness of food contact surfaces, including utensils,  gloves, and outer garments, and (2) control of employee health conditions.", "As we reported in 2001, FDA has four approaches to verify compliance with  HACCP regulations and ensure the safety of imported seafood. FDA has the  authority to enter into voluntary agreements with individual countries on  the basis of a determination of equivalence of their seafood safety systems  with U.S. HACCP requirements. First, under the provisions of the World  Trade Organization Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and  Phytosanitary Measures, to which the United States is a signatory, FDA is  obligated to enter into consultations with the aim of achieving equivalence  agreements upon the request of other World Trade Organization member  nations. FDA considers other systems to be equivalent when it finds one  or more of an exporting country\u2019s food safety measures\u2014such as laws,  regulations, guidance, and procedures\u2014to be equivalent to our own. U.S.  importers can demonstrate HACCP compliance by acquiring seafood from  countries with these agreements. Second, in the absence of such  agreements, importers are responsible for demonstrating, through  documentation, that the seafood they import into the United States is  produced under systems that are compliant with U.S. HACCP  requirements. During its periodic inspections, FDA reviews this  documentation to determine whether importers have met their  responsibilities under the HACCP regulations. Third, FDA also inspects a  limited number of foreign seafood firms to determine the firms\u2019 compliance  with HACCP. Lastly, FDA selects a small number of individual shipments at  U.S. ports of entry to conduct visual examinations and/or collect and test  samples to determine if the seafood is misbranded or adulterated. FDA  commented that detaining suspect imported seafood for physical or  laboratory examination by the importer is also part of its import control  strategy.", "If FDA observes HACCP violations during its inspections and testing, it can  take several regulatory actions. For example, FDA issues warning letters in  cases where violations raise safety concerns that may lead to enforcement  action, such as detention, seizure, or injunction\u2014which is a court order to  refrain from distributing a product. In the case of foreign firms, a warning  letter could advise them of a forthcoming detention, the only enforcement  action that is available. Firms that receive warning letters are asked to  respond to FDA in writing to indicate what actions they will take to correct  the identified problems.", "To fund FDA\u2019s food safety programs, Congress provided $393 million for  fiscal year 2002. This amount represents a $106 million increase over FDA\u2019s  budget for fiscal year 2001, including a $93 million supplemental  appropriation for counterterrorism activities, including those in the  Bioterrorism Act of 2002. FDA used some of this increase to enhance its  coverage of imported foods, including hiring over 600 new food safety  investigators and laboratory personnel; increasing the number of port-of- entry examinations and laboratory testing; and conducting foreign  inspections that focused on high-risk foods, including seafood."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FDA\u2019s Imported Seafood Safety Program Shows Some Improvement, but Deficiencies Persist", "paragraphs": ["Since our January 2001 report, FDA has made improvements to three of the  four approaches it uses for ensuring the safety of imported seafood\u2014 importer inspections, foreign inspections, and port-of-entry inspections.  FDA has not implemented either of the recommendations we made in our  2001 report regarding establishing equivalence agreements with exporting  countries or communicating deficiencies found during inspections to FDA\u2019s  port-of-entry personnel. Additionally, FDA continues to experience long  delays in issuing warning letters or detaining imported seafood at U.S.  ports of entry after investigators find serious deficiencies. By not taking  timely regulatory action, FDA increases the likelihood that unsafe seafood  will enter the U.S. market."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FDA\u2019s Program Shows Some Improvement Since Our Last Report", "paragraphs": ["We found that FDA has made some progress in strengthening the efficacy  of three approaches for ensuring the safety of imported seafood.  However, the agency has made no progress regarding the development of  equivalence agreements with seafood exporting countries. Figure 3  summarizes the changes that have taken place in FDA\u2019s seafood safety  program.", "As we reported in 2001, in the absence of equivalence agreements, U.S.  seafood importers are required to maintain written product specifications  and take at least one of six affirmative steps to document foreign firms\u2019  compliance with U.S. requirements. Figure 4 shows the regulatory  requirements for importers and the documentation that importers can use  to demonstrate compliance.", "While importers have made some progress in maintaining the required  documentation, they are still far from full compliance, according to our  analysis of FDA\u2019s inspection forms for fiscal year 2002. Specifically, on the  basis of our random sample of inspections, we estimate that importers had  the required documentation for 48 percent of the products they imported,  which is up from the 27 percent noted in our 2001 review. That is, an  estimated 48 percent of imported seafood products listed in the FDA  inspection forms contained (1) a written product specification document  and (2) documentation for at least one of the six possible affirmative steps  required by the regulations. In fiscal year 2002, FDA inspected fewer  domestic importers\u2014402 (of an estimated 8,500) compared with 644 that  the agency reports it inspected in fiscal year 1999. Our analysis shows that  FDA investigators made some errors when documenting these 2002  inspections. On the basis of our survey, we estimated that in about 4  percent of the inspection forms, FDA investigators erroneously indicated  that the exporting country had an equivalence agreement in place for  seafood. Therefore, they did not require the importer to produce the  additional documentation required in the absence of an equivalence  agreement (written product specifications and at least one affirmative  step). FDA officials said the oversight occurred because the investigators  had correctly determined that the importers received products from firms  on a list of preferred providers developed by the Canadian Food Inspection  Agency (CFIA), but the investigators erred in assuming that having the  preferred provider list meant that Canada has an equivalence agreement  with the United States. FDA officials said they will take steps to clarify the  requirement with field personnel to avoid confusion in the future.", "FDA also increased the number of foreign countries visited and seafood  firms inspected since we last reported in 2001. FDA visited 13 of an  estimated 160 countries in fiscal year 2002 to provide education on the U.S.  HACCP requirements and to inspect 108 of about 13,000 seafood firms  compared with 4 countries and 37 firms inspected in fiscal year 1999. FDA  selects the countries for inspection on the basis of previous compliance  problems, the volume of seafood exported to the United States, and the  type of product and associated risk. Once it selects a country, FDA selects  foreign firms that have a problematic compliance history and works with  the country\u2019s inspection authority to identify other firms for inspection.  According to the Director, FDA\u2019s Office of Seafood, FDA plans to inspect  about 100 seafood firms in 10 or more foreign countries annually in the  future. Although this number represents fewer firms and countries than  FDA inspected in 2002, it represents more than FDA inspected in fiscal year  1999. These inspections tend to be targeted on developing countries that  are major exporters to the United States.", "FDA officials also said they have begun to increase laboratory testing of  imported seafood, in particular for aquaculture drug residues, as a result of  the increase in staff resources the agency received from the Bioterrorism  Act of 2002. According to these officials, in fiscal year 2002, FDA had 310  full-time-equivalent positions for inspections and laboratory testing of all  food, with 70 allocated for imported seafood; by fiscal year 2004, FDA  estimates that it will have 681 positions, with at least 103 allocated for  imported seafood. Furthermore, the proportion of foreign seafood  products detained for laboratory testing increased slightly, from less than  1.0 percent in fiscal year 1999 to about 1.2 percent in fiscal year 2002, while  imported seafood products increased by 13 percent (from 3.7 to 4.4 billion  pounds) over the same period. FDA officials expect laboratory testing to  increase to about 1.4 percent of imported seafood products in fiscal year  2004, after the newly hired investigators and laboratory personnel are fully  trained."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FDA Still Lacks Equivalence or Other Agreements with Seafood Exporting Countries", "paragraphs": ["Although FDA stated in January 2001 that it planned to make progress  toward accomplishing foreign equivalence assessments and had listed this  goal as one of its priorities, the agency has not made progress in this  regard. As a result, FDA still has no equivalence or other agreements with  any seafood exporting country. At the time of our 2001 report, FDA had not  established any equivalence agreements with countries that export seafood  to the United States. However, the agency was discussing equivalence  agreements with Australia, Canada, and New Zealand and a compliance  agreement with Japan. To expedite development of these agreements, we  recommended that FDA develop specific goals and time frames for  completing them. FDA did not agree with this recommendation, but it  stated that accomplishing foreign equivalence assessments would be one of  its priorities for fiscal year 2001.", "FDA officials now state that developing these agreements is no longer a  priority because of several factors. First, they point out that equivalence  agreements, as such, do not necessarily contribute to the enhanced safety  of imported seafood. Foreign producers are already required to produce  seafood products under a HACCP-based system that provides for a high  level of assurance of safety, and therefore, an FDA finding of equivalence of  a foreign seafood regulatory program or individual seafood safety  measures would be unlikely to substantially improve the safety of imported  seafood. Second, FDA officials said that the United States does not require  a finding of equivalence as a condition for exporting seafood to the United  States. Third, the procedures and criteria that are necessary to conduct  equivalence assessments have only recently been agreed upon at the  international level by the Codex Alimentarius Commission. FDA is  working with other U.S. agencies in considering how best to incorporate  these international guidelines in situations where equivalence assessments  might be helpful for either public health protection or trade facilitation.  The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), the cabinet agency  responsible for developing and coordinating U.S. international trade policy,  generally agreed with this view and also said that even with equivalence  agreements, FDA would still be required to conduct compliance reviews  and audits in these countries. Finally, both FDA and USTR said the time  and resources required to develop equivalence agreements for seafood may  outweigh the benefits.", "We agree that establishing equivalence agreements would not  automatically result in improved seafood safety. However, by establishing  agreements with countries that are able to demonstrate that their safety  systems are comparable to ours, FDA could free inspection resources and  allow more extensive examination of seafood products from countries with  less advanced systems. Because FDA does not have equivalence  agreements with countries that are exporters of seafood to the United  States, FDA principally relies on a review of documentation at importers\u2019  offices to attempt to determine whether importers have met their  responsibilities and requirements under the seafood HACCP regulations.  As we previously discussed in this report, FDA reported inspecting only  about 8 percent of domestic importers in fiscal year 2003.", "Our panel of experts also concluded that equivalence agreements or less  comprehensive alternatives represent an effective approach for ensuring  the safety of imported seafood and would also shift some of the burden for  ensuring that imported seafood meets U.S. HACCP requirements to  exporting countries. Furthermore, the panel suggested that FDA  concentrate its efforts on first developing agreements with countries  known to have high-quality food safety systems, thereby allowing FDA to  focus its limited inspection resources on countries known to have lesser  quality food safety systems.", "We also acknowledge that time and resources are a necessary factor in  negotiating such agreements. However, we note that FDA has entered into  similar agreements with several countries that export fresh and frozen  shellfish products (fresh and frozen oysters, clams, mussels, and whole or  roe-on scallops) to the United States. By reaching agreements through  individual memorandums of understanding with Canada, Chile, Mexico,  New Zealand, and South Korea, FDA acknowledged that the foreign  countries\u2019 shellfish sanitation programs meet U.S. standards. If it chose to  do so, FDA could enter into these types of agreements with countries that  export seafood products to the United States as well.", "We also note that CFIA has established 14 agreements with foreign  exporting countries, including agreements for seafood products. According  to CFIA officials, these agreements allow CFIA to decrease the rate of  inspection for products from participating countries and direct its  resources to higher risk products from countries without such agreements.  In addition, CFIA believes that such agreements provide a vehicle for  increased communication, thereby allowing the exporting nation to take  corrective actions at violating firms discovered during CFIA\u2019s verification  inspections."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most FDA Regulatory Actions Are Not Timely", "paragraphs": ["To ensure that FDA takes prompt regulatory action when its investigators  find food safety violations during importer and foreign firm visits, we  recommended in our 2001 report that FDA communicate deficiencies to  port-of-entry personnel so that they can examine potentially contaminated  imported seafood before it can enter the United States. Although FDA  agreed with this recommendation, we found that it continues to experience  long delays between finding deficiencies and taking action, such as issuing  a warning letter or detaining a product. As a result, potentially  contaminated seafood could be entering the U.S. market.", "Once FDA investigators complete an inspection of U.S. importer\u2019s  documentation or of a foreign firm\u2019s processing plant, they submit a  recommendation and/or report to headquarters, which decides on  regulatory action. As explained below, FDA issues either untitled letters  or warning letters to inform responsible officials of violations found  during the inspection and to afford the officials the opportunity to  voluntarily take appropriate and prompt corrective action prior to the  initiation of enforcement action. The use of these letters is based on the  expectation that a majority of inspected firms will voluntarily comply.", "FDA issues untitled letters when the documented violations do not meet  the criteria for detention. Untitled letters may address, for example, the  foreign company\u2019s failure to have its HACCP plan list sulfites, an allergen;  failure to monitor the safety of water; or failure to maintain the cleanliness  of food contact surfaces. These letters do not set time frames for taking  corrective action and do not require a response from the firm.", "FDA also issues warning letters when it finds violations that can directly  affect product safety, such as no controls for scrombrotoxin, which is a  toxin most commonly found in tuna, mahi-mahi, and bluefish that can  cause severe allergic reactions and diarrhea. These letters could lead to  enforcement action, such as product detention, if the company does not  promptly and adequately correct the problem. To ensure prompt and  adequate correction, FDA requires that warning letters be issued within 30  work days\u2014approximately 45 calendar days.", "However, FDA is not required to issue letters to firms prior to taking  enforcement action. The agency has the authority to take immediate  enforcement action, such as detaining a firm\u2019s products. Under section  801(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, FDA can refuse  admission of imported products on the basis of information that the  product \u201cappears\u201d to be in violation of food safety requirements. When the  violations remain uncorrected despite prior warnings, FDA headquarters  notifies field offices by listing the firm and product on an Import Alert,  ordinarily the next course of action. According to FDA officials, now that  the requirements of seafood HACCP are well established, the agency  intends to use its refusal authority as the lead action without prior warning  to prevent the products of problem foreign processors from entering the  country. Our analysis of foreign firm inspections shows that the agency  used this authority for one firm in fiscal year 2002.", "According to our review of inspection records for 99 of 108 foreign firms  that the agency visited in fiscal year 2002, FDA is encountering significant  delays in issuing warning letters when serious violations are identified.  During its inspections, FDA found that of these 99 foreign firms, 40 had  serious violations that warranted regulatory action. For 20 of these 40  firms, FDA decided to issue a warning letter. However, FDA took an  average of 157 calendar days to issue these warning letters. As shown in  figure 5, all 20 warning letters exceeded FDA\u2019s time frame requirement of  approximately 45 calendar days.", "Fourteen of these 20 warning letters were issued to firms producing high- risk products\u2014such as semipreserved fish products, including smoked,  salted, and fermented fish that are susceptible to the growth of bacteria,  including Clostridium botulinum.

For the other 20 firms  that did not receive warning letters, FDA issued untitled letters to 14 firms  and is considering what action to take for the remaining 6 firms. Appendix  III provides a more detailed analysis of FDA\u2019s foreign firm inspections in  fiscal year 2002.", "In addition to failing to issue warning letters in a timely manner, FDA  encountered significant delays in alerting port-of-entry personnel to detain  imported seafood shipments from firms identified with serious safety  problems. On average, the agency took 348 calendar days to alert port-of- entry personnel about such products coming from 6 of the 99 foreign firms  that the agency inspected in fiscal year 2002. Moreover, 4 of the 6 firms  involved were processing high-risk products, which should have caused  FDA to take more prompt enforcement action. By not taking timely  enforcement actions and communicating these actions to U.S. port-of-entry  personnel, FDA increases the likelihood that unsafe products will enter the  U.S. market.", "Similar delays occurred when FDA investigators found problems with U.S.  importers\u2019 records. For the 96 inspection forms we reviewed, FDA found  that 16 importers had serious violations, such as failure to have the  required documentation. The agency issued warning letters to 8 of these  importers. The average time elapsed between the date of the inspection  and issuance of the warning letter was 103 calendar days; only 2 letters  were issued within the required 45 calendar days. Furthermore, 5 of the  warning letters covered high-risk products, including scombrotoxin- susceptible seafood, which, if not properly handled, could cause serious  health problems requiring hospitalization, particularly for elderly  individuals.", "FDA officials acknowledged that these delays are excessive and  unacceptable and attributed them to a change in personnel responsible for  reviewing and issuing these letters. In addition, these officials stated that  the time frames were exceeded because the agency has been compelled to  give precedence to other public health concerns, such as developing  programs to protect the food supply against terrorist threats. Finally, we  found that FDA does not prioritize enforcement actions when violations  that pose the most serious public health risk occur or have an automated  system for tracking the time involved in documenting, reviewing, and  processing enforcement actions. As a result of increased funding, FDA  recently increased the number of personnel responsible for reviewing and  issuing these letters and expects to substantially increase its timeliness.  Additionally, FDA is in the early stages of developing an automated system  that will track the time involved in documenting, reviewing, and processing  enforcement actions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Options Are Available for Enhancing FDA\u2019s Imported Seafood Safety Program, but They Present Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Several options could help FDA overcome some of the problems we  identified with its current regulatory approach for ensuring the safety of  imported seafood.

First, NOAA could provide  staff from its Seafood Inspection Program to augment FDA\u2019s inspections  capabilities, and FDA is considering the advantages and disadvantages of  doing so.

For example, NOAA  inspectors could certify domestic seafood products shipped to the  European Union and other countries, which is a service that NOAA  provided in the past on a fee-for-service basis. Also, FDA and NOAA could  agree to recognize NOAA\u2019s current inspections of approximately 240  domestic processing firms and authorize NOAA to inspect other domestic  firms for compliance with HACCP. NOAA officials estimate that they could  provide FDA with up to 22 full-time-equivalent field inspectors as well as  additional technical support staff in its headquarters office.", "In addition, NOAA and FDA officials are now negotiating the terms of an  agreement to use two NOAA laboratories to screen imported shrimp  samples for the antibiotic chloramphenicol. FDA is taking this action to  increase its testing capacity in response to the detection of the drug in  imported shrimp by food safety authorities in Europe, Canada, and some  U.S. states. Chloramphenicol is banned for use in food-producing animals  because there is no known safe level for human ingestion of this substance.  If the negotiations succeed, FDA would increase its screening capacity by  400 samples per year.", "FDA recognizes that it has the authority to use NOAA and is considering  the advantages and disadvantages of doing so.

Additionally, NOAA officials said that this concern could be  alleviated, in whole or in part, through its receipt of direct appropriations  to conduct these activities and/or through contracts with FDA that use  appropriated funds. Also, FDA-sponsored inspector training and periodic  audits of NOAA activities could further address such perceptions. FDA  officials also pointed out that it would have to incur costs to provide  training to NOAA inspectors and would have to develop an agreement with  NOAA specifying how NOAA would conduct inspections and investigations  on FDA\u2019s behalf.

This pilot program is  similar to FDA\u2019s proposed agreement with NOAA for testing imported  shrimp for the drug chloramphenicol. Under the proposed pilot program  with Florida, FDA would collect the samples and the state laboratory  would screen them for traces of chloramphenicol residues.

In addition, FDA is no longer making it a priority to negotiate equivalence  agreements with seafood-exporting countries, which remains one of the  most effective methods for ensuring the safety of imports. Indeed, our  panel of seafood safety experts believes that these agreements would help  FDA reduce its reliance on importer and port-of-entry inspections and  would enable the agency to leverage its staff resources by sharing the  responsibility for seafood safety with exporting countries, especially those  that are known to produce safe seafood. Coupled with the lack of timely  compliance and enforcement action, FDA\u2019s efforts to ensure the safety of  imported seafood continue to provide insufficient protection to consumers.

In commenting on this recommendation, FDA said the  agency is not currently positioned to assign high priority to negotiating  equivalence or other types of agreements with numerous countries that  export seafood to the United States in light of the pressing priorities  associated with implementation of the Bioterrorism Act. FDA also said that  establishing these agreements is extraordinarily resource intensive. We  agree that the process for creating these agreements is complex and  resource intensive; however, we continue to believe that it should be a  priority for FDA to negotiate equivalence or other less comprehensive  agreements with seafood exporting countries to leverage its limited  inspection resources. Additionally, FDA should view the creation of these  agreements as a long-term investment in improving imported seafood  safety.

Under an effective HACCP system,  the panelists felt that FDA\u2019s emphasis should be on inspection and  testing in the foreign country where the seafood is harvested and  processed and where hazards are introduced.", "Panelists recommended that when problems are discovered as a result  of inspections of foreign firms or importers, FDA should discuss with  the exporting countries how to prevent these problems from  reoccurring."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Port-of-entry Examinations and Testing", "paragraphs": ["Panelists suggested that state regulatory laboratories (e.g., those  operated by the state Department of Health or Agriculture) may be a  good option for assisting FDA in testing imported seafood products,  particularly in those states with ports and seafood industries. State  laboratories provide comparable testing for state regulatory authorities  and have procedures in place that could meet FDA\u2019s standards for  compliance testing. State laboratories are also well equipped for food  testing and provide reliable results. Panelists did note, however, that  most states are financially constrained, and therefore state laboratories  may not have any excess capacity (e.g., qualified analysts, equipment  time, or laboratory space) to analyze additional samples for FDA.  Furthermore, in order to use the facilities, FDA would need to  harmonize testing methodologies.", "Panelists suggested that FDA use the National Marine Fisheries Service  laboratories in Pascagoula, Mississippi, and Seattle, Washington, to  augment testing at ports of entry. Panel members believed that this was  a good option for FDA because these laboratories currently conduct  seafood research and testing.", "Panelists did not recommend that FDA use academic laboratories for  testing at ports of entry.

We modified our report to state that although FDA does not have an  automated system for computing the time it takes to review warning  letter and untitled letter recommendations, it is in the early stages of  developing such a system.  This system will enable FDA to track the  time involved in documenting, reviewing, and processing enforcement  actions.   2. We modified this report to include the actual number of cases  associated with seafood and meat and poultry outbreaks.  We also  added the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s observation  that foodborne illness outbreaks are generally underreported and that  it is easier to identify the source of some diagnosable illnesses, such as  scombroid poisoning from seafood, than illnesses that result from  nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms caused by other foods.   Additionally, we added FDA\u2019s comment that some seafood-related  illnesses may be caused by recreational or subsistence fishing, over  which the federal government has little or no control. 3. As shown in our report, FDA inspects only a small percentage of U.S.  importers, examines and samples a very small amount of imported  seafood at U.S. ports of entry, and inspects few seafood firms in foreign  countries each year.  In the absence of equivalence or other agreements  such as memorandums of understanding with seafood-exporting  countries, FDA must continue to rely principally on reviews of importer  records to determine whether imported seafood is produced under  acceptable food safety systems.  For these reasons, we continue to  believe that FDA should develop such agreements as quickly as  possible.  Moreover, FDA acknowledged in its final HACCP rule, issued  in December 1995, that in the absence of significant numbers of agency  inspections of foreign processing facilities, a memorandum of  understanding can be the most efficient and effective mechanism for  ensuring that foreign processing plants are operating in compliance  with the requirements of the regulations.      4. We modified this report to include FDA\u2019s basis for issuing these letters. 5. We acknowledge that establishing equivalence or other agreements is  complex and resource intensive.  However, we continue to believe, as  supported by our panel of nationally recognized food safety experts,  that equivalence agreements or less comprehensive alternatives, such  as compliance agreements or memorandums of understanding  represent a more effective long-term approach for ensuring the safety  of imported seafood and would allow FDA to leverage its staff  resources by shifting some of its regulatory burden to exporting  countries.  Also, U.S. importers would be able to rely on the foreign  regulatory authority to ensure compliance with HACCP requirements  by foreign processors.", "Also see comment 3. 6.
