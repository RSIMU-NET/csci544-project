GAO was asked to review critical issues associated with these types of offers.", "This report focuses on 1) the prevalence of lump sum offers and sponsors' incentives to use them, 2) the implications for participants, and 3) the extent to which selected lump sum materials provided to participants include key information. To conduct this work, GAO identified sponsors offering lump sum windows and used social media to identify participants given offers. GAO reviewed 11 informational packets acquired through interviews with selected plan sponsors and participants. GAO also analyzed lump sum calculations and interviewed federal officials and pension experts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Little public data are available to assess the extent to which sponsors of defined benefit plans are offering participants immediate lump sums to replace their lifetime annuities, but certain laws and regulations provide incentives for use of this practice. Although the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) has primary responsibility for overseeing pension sponsors' reporting requirements, it does not require sponsors to report such lump sum offers, making oversight difficult. Pension experts generally agree that there has been a recent increase in these types of offers. By reviewing the limited public information that is available, GAO identified 22 plan sponsors who had offered lump sum windows in 2012, involving approximately 498,000 participants and resulting in lump sum payouts totaling more than $9.25 billion. Most of these payouts went to participants who had separated from employment and were not yet retired, but some went to retirees already receiving pension benefits. Sponsors are currently afforded enhanced financial incentives to make these offers by certain laws and regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury (specifically the Internal Revenue Service) governing the interest rates and mortality tables used to calculate lump sums.", "Participants potentially face a reduction in their retirement assets when they accept a lump sum offer. The amount of the lump sum payment may be less than what it would cost in the retail market to replace the plan's benefit because the mortality and interest rates used by retail market insurers are different from the rates used by sponsors, particularly when calculating lump sums for younger participants and women. Participants who assume management of their lump sum payment gain control of their assets but also face potential investment challenges. In addition, some participants may not continue to save their lump sum payment for retirement but instead may spend some or all of it.", "GAO reviewed 11 packets of informational materials provided by sponsors offering lump sums to as many as 248,000 participants and found that the packets consistently lacked key information needed to make an informed decision or were otherwise unclear. Using various sources, including financial advisors, federal agency publications, laws, and regulations, GAO identified eight key types of information that participants need to have a sound understanding of a lump sum offer. While GAO did not review the packets for compliance or legal adequacy, most packets provided a substantial amount of this key information. However, all of the packets GAO reviewed lacked at least some key information. For example, the relative value notices were often unclear about how the value of the lump sum compared to the value of the lifetime monthly benefit provided by the plan. Similarly, many packets did not clearly indicate the interest rate or mortality assumptions used, limiting participants' ability to assess how the lump sum payment was calculated. Further, few of the packets informed participants about the benefit protections they would keep by staying in their employer's plan\u2014full or partial protections provided by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the agency that insures defined benefit pensions when a sponsor defaults. This omission is notable because many participants GAO interviewed cited fear of sponsor default as an important factor in choosing the lump sum."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOL improve oversight by requiring plan sponsors to notify the agency when they implement lump sum windows, and coordinate with Treasury to clarify guidance on the information sponsors provide to participants.

Under this type of plan, employer-sponsors typically  bear the risks associated with investing the plan\u2019s assets and ensuring  that sufficient funds are available to pay the benefits to plan participants  as they come due. However, during 2012, a number of large private  sector sponsors of defined benefit plans acted to reduce their pension  liabilities by essentially transferring the liabilities to other parties. Through  one particular type of risk transfer action, sponsors offered to pay some  participants\u2014including participants already retired and receiving a  monthly pension\u2014the estimated present value of their lifetime benefit in  one immediate lump sum payment. This action, commonly referred to as  a \u201clump sum window,\u201d presents certain participants with a choice of  keeping their lifetime retirement annuity or taking the lump sum amount.  Participants who accept the lump sum assume all the risks of managing  the funds themselves. Further, their retirement benefits are no longer  governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974  (ERISA), as amended, including the guarantees provided by the Pension  Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), which insures benefits from  private sector defined benefit plans up to certain statutory limits.

We obtained documents  from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), PBGC, the  Pension Rights Center, consulting firms, and sponsors. To explore  sponsors\u2019 incentives for making lump sum offers, we interviewed  managers from three plan sponsors who took such actions, as well as  other stakeholders, such as consultants, insurance company  representatives, independent fiduciaries, and subject matter experts. To  explore the implications for participants, we consulted retirement security  experts and reviewed associated literature. We also used social media to  identify and interview pension plan participants whose sponsor had  offered them a lump sum payment. Specifically, we contacted alumni  groups associated with sponsors whom we had identified as having  carried out lump sum windows. We solicited input from plan participants  who had been offered lump sums and administered a questionnaire to 37  participants who had contacted us. These individuals were associated  with 11 plan sponsors. Of the group, we interviewed 33 to gather  additional information. We also collected information materials provided to  participants by all 11 of the sponsors. While not generalizable,  participants\u2019 responses helped inform our discussion about the factors  participants weighed when making benefit choices. In addition, we  developed a lump sum calculator to generate lump sum amounts based  on participant information obtained during our interviews. Using the  calculator, we mimicked sponsor lump sum calculations to gain a better  understanding of how certain provisions in federal law and regulations  affect lump sum amounts, and we evaluated whether the rules advantage  either sponsors or participants in how the amounts are calculated. Lastly,  to determine the adequacy of the lump sum offer materials sponsors  provide to participants, we identified key types of information participants  need to make an informed decision based on a review of publications by  federal agencies, financial advisors, and various other sources. We then  evaluated the contents of 11 packets of information materials, each from  a different sponsor\u2019s lump sum window offer, to determine whether the  packets included this information.

Such risks can include fluctuations in the value of plan assets and in  interest rates, either of which can cause volatility in the plan\u2019s funded  status and plan contributions. This type of volatility has been  exacerbated by recent fluctuations in the national economy, while a 2006  accounting standard change caused pension funding status to take a  more prominent role on private sector plan sponsors\u2019 balance sheets,  making such volatility more visible.sponsors have chosen to lessen their exposure to such financial risks by  shifting away from defined benefit plans and choosing to offer or  emphasize defined contribution plans, such as 401(k) plans, whereby the   Over the past several decades, many  various risks are borne by the participants whose sustainable retirement  income will depend on factors such as the participants\u2019 contribution  decisions, the investment returns on their personal accounts, their spend- down decisions in retirement, and their longevity. Likewise, sponsors  who have chosen to retain their defined benefit plans have taken steps to  reduce their plans\u2019 financial risks by other means. In some cases, these  steps have also resulted in the transfer of risk to participants.", "The steps sponsors can take to limit the financial risks they see posed by  their plans are commonly referred to as pension \u201cde-risking.\u201d Broadly  speaking, de-risking actions can be divided into two groups, internal and  external methods. Internal methods of de-risking\u2014although beyond the  scope of our study\u2014allow the plan sponsor to reduce risk without directly  removing liabilities, or participants, from the plan. These methods may  include restricting plan participation or modifying the benefit formula to  reduce future benefit accruals. They may also include adjustments to the  allocation of plan assets, such as by liability-driven investing. This may  involve shifting away from equities and toward fixed income securities  that match the duration of plan liabilities in order to shield the plan from  risks associated with market fluctuations in both stock market values and  interest rates. Although these internal methods allow sponsors to mitigate  some of the risks associated with their plans, the existing liabilities remain  in the plans and, as a result, continue to expose sponsors to certain  remaining risks. For example, plan sponsors continue to be subject to the  longevity risk of plan participants living longer than anticipated.", "External approaches, on the other hand, involve permanently removing a  portion of pension liabilities from the plan, discharging the obligation to  pay a lifetime annuity to plan participants. Two of these approaches can  be appropriately termed \u201crisk transfers\u201d because the risks of providing  pension income or managing pension assets are essentially transferred to  another party outside the plan. One form of risk transfer\u2014also beyond the  scope of our study\u2014is the purchase of a \u201cbuy-out\u201d group annuity,  whereby plan assets are transferred to an insurance company that then  assumes the responsibility for making pension benefit payments to  participants removed from the plan. When a sponsor implements an  annuity buyout, the risks associated with providing promised pension  benefits are shifted from the plan sponsor to the insurer. In 2012, two  large plan sponsors, General Motors and Verizon, purchased group  annuities from Prudential Insurance Company involving the transfer of a  reported $32.6 billion in plan liabilities.", "A second form of risk transfer is a \u201clump sum window\u201d offer\u2014the form of  risk transfer that is the focus of our study.

In a lump sum window offer, the participant is offered a choice between  three optional forms of his or her benefits accrued to date.

Annuity at normal retirement age (or current annuity) \u2013 In the case of  a separated participant not yet in pay status, this is their lifetime  annuity promised under the plan that would begin at a future date,  often age 65. In the case of a retiree in pay status, it is the lifetime  annuity they are currently receiving.  2.  Immediate annuity (or alternate annuity) \u2013 In the case of a separated  participant not yet in pay status, this is their lifetime annuity promised  under the plan, with payments beginning at the time of the lump sum  offer rather than at their normal retirement age. The payments are  reduced by a specified factor to account for the earlier  commencement of benefits. In the case of a retiree in pay status, it is  the lifetime annuity they are currently receiving, but they may have the  option of changing to another form of benefit offered under the plan.  3.  Lump sum \u2013 In the case of both a separated participant not yet in pay  status or a retiree in pay status, this is the actuarial equivalent of the  remaining expected payments of their lifetime annuity, given to them  in a single immediate payment.", "The participant then has a limited amount of time, or window, to choose  between the three options.

As fiduciaries under ERISA, sponsors are required to administer the plan  solely in the interest of participants and beneficiaries and for the exclusive  purpose of providing benefits and defraying plan expenses. However,  some functions, such as those related to establishing a plan and choosing  its design features, are considered settlor functions that are not subject to  ERISA\u2019s fiduciary standards. For example, a sponsor\u2019s decision to take  risk transfer actions, such as offering a lump sum window, is a matter of  plan design, generally making it a settlor function rather than a fiduciary  function.

In addition, the  council recommended DOL consider collecting relevant information at the  time sponsors take risk transfer actions.", "For its part, the IRS determines whether private sector pension plans  qualify for preferential tax treatment under the Internal Revenue Code.  Qualified pension plans receive favorable tax treatment, generally  including the deferral of taxes on contributions and investment earnings  until benefits are received. To be qualified, a plan must meet a number of  requirements. Plan sponsors can request a determination letter that  addresses the qualified status of the plan. In addition, a plan sponsor can  request that the IRS address a unique issue requiring immediate  guidance that is not likely to be provided through the determination letter  process. If the IRS determines that it is in the interest of good tax  administration to respond to this request, its response, known as a private  letter ruling, will interpret and apply tax laws to the sponsor\u2019s represented  set of facts. By law, this specific ruling may not be used or cited as  precedent by other taxpayers or by IRS personnel.", "Also, to protect the value of each participant\u2019s pension benefit, the  Internal Revenue Code prescribes the interest rate and mortality table  that the sponsor must use to calculate the minimum amount of any lump  sum option.  A plan may pay a larger lump sum, but it may not pay less  than this prescribed minimum. Further, sponsors are required to provide  several specific pieces of information to the participant as part of the  offer. For example, sponsors, when distributing pension benefits in any  form, are required to provide notices to participants detailing tax  implications, rollover options, and a description of the financial effect of  electing an optional form of benefit. As part of this description, the  participant must receive a statement comparing the relative value of the  new form of benefit to their original benefit. For instance, when an  optional lump sum would replace a monthly annuity, participants must be  shown how the lump sum compares to the value of that annuity. Also, in  order to receive the benefit in a form other than an annuity, such as a  lump sum, the participant (and if married, the spouse) must receive and  sign a waiver consenting to this alternative form of payment.", "The PBGC, also established by ERISA, acts as an insurer of private- sector defined benefit pension plans by guaranteeing participants\u2019  benefits up to certain statutory limits. In the case of covered single- employer plans, PBGC protects participants if the plan terminates with  insufficient assets to pay all benefits, such as in the bankruptcy of a plan  sponsor with an underfunded plan. Under ERISA, plan sponsors pay  premiums to PBGC to help fund its guarantees. The law currently  requires sponsors to pay both a per-participant flat rate premium and a  variable rate premium based on the plan\u2019s level of underfunding. PBGC  also collects a termination premium from sponsors who terminate their  plans under certain criteria.", "In both the case of a sponsor\u2019s buyout through a group annuity purchase  and the case of a participant\u2019s acceptance of a lump sum payment, the  participant loses the protections of ERISA and the guarantees offered by  PBGC.

In summarizing  its 2013 hearings on pension de-risking, the ERISA Advisory Council  concluded that the testimony they had heard served to confirm that risk  transfer actions, such as lump sum windows, are on the rise. Studies  cited by leading pension consulting firms, albeit without full disclosure of  their data and study methods, have furthered this perception. Citing  proprietary data, one firm has estimated that nearly 200 sponsors  implemented lump sum windows during 2012. That firm reported that its  survey of 180 plan sponsors found that 26 percent had implemented a  lump sum window in 2012, and another 41 percent were in the process  of, or considering, taking such action between 2013 and 2015. Another  firm reported that its study indicated that of 223 sponsors surveyed, 12  percent had recently implemented a lump sum window. Of the remaining  sponsors, 43 percent were reported to have said they were very or  somewhat likely to do so in 2014.", "We based our analysis on publically available information from a variety of sources,  including information collected from PBGC, a participant advocacy group, SEC filings,  corporate reports, and media reports. We verified this information to the extent possible.

Based on its study of  lump sum windows completed during 2012, a pension consulting firm  reported acceptance rates ranging between 25 and 85 percent, with a  majority being between 45 and 65 percent.

Prior to  implementation, it was also widely reported that both sponsors had  requested and obtained IRS private letter rulings stating that their actions  would \u201cnot fail to satisfy\u201d certain provisions of the Internal Revenue  Code.

However, changing federal laws and regulations concerning interest  rates, mortality tables, and PBGC premiums may be providing additional  cost-saving incentives for more plan sponsors to offer lump sums to their  plans\u2019 participants in recent years. Moreover, certain longstanding rules  can also afford savings to sponsors by allowing them to offer lower lump  sums by choosing an advantageous interest rate and excluding certain  additional plan benefits, such as early retirement subsidies, when  calculating lump sums. Lump sum windows also offer sponsors an  opportunity to reduce oversized plan liabilities, such as in cases where  the pension plan is large relative to the size of the plan sponsor\u2019s  business.

Prior to  enactment of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA), sponsors were  required to calculate lump sums using interest rates on 30-year Treasury  bonds. Since PPA, sponsors have been allowed to use generally higher  corporate bond interest rates, which can serve to lower the amount of  the lump sums offered to many participants. A consulting firm  estimated that, because of the general reduction in lump sum amounts  resulting from this rule change, one of their client sponsors paying out  $40 million in lump sums could potentially save about $10 million due to  the switch to the higher rates. The PPA switch from Treasury bond rates  to corporate bond rates became fully effective in 2012, and some experts  believe that this timing may partly explain the reported recent increase in  risk transfers since 2012.", "Illustration of How PPA Rules on Interest Rates Can Affect Lump Sums Bob is 45, has a lifetime deferred retirement pension of $10,000 a year starting at age  65, and was offered a lump sum in October 2012.", "Prior to PPA, Bob\u2019s immediate lump sum would have been $62,643, calculated based  on a 30-year Treasury interest rate of 3.65 percent.", "After PPA, Bob\u2019s immediate lump sum is $32,453, calculated based on a corporate bond  interest rate of 6.02 percent, or 48 percent less than it would have been under rules prior  to PPA.", "In addition, the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP- 21) allowed more sponsors to take advantage of this rule change by  temporarily raising the interest rates that can be used to value plan  liabilities, significantly improving many plans\u2019 reported funded status,  which in turn allowed more plan sponsors to consider offering lump-sum  payouts.", "The mortality tables which sponsors must use in determining minimum  lump sum amounts provide another incentive to conduct a lump sum  window at this time. This is because the tables currently required for this  purpose under IRS regulations do not reflect the accelerated rate of  longevity improvements that have occurred in recent years. These  longevity improvements have been reflected in updated mortality tables  recently released by the Society of Actuaries (SOA) and they are  expected to be adopted by IRS for lump sum calculations, but possibly  not until 2016. The new SOA tables reflect a longer life expectancy for  individuals, and when used to calculate lump sums will yield  correspondingly larger lump sum amounts. Thus, sponsors making lump  sum offers prior to IRS\u2019s anticipated adoption of the new tables can  realize substantial financial savings since their lump sum calculations will  still be based on older tables. According to SOA, the new mortality tables  reflect a 10.4 to 11.3 percent longer life expectancy for individuals age 65  in 2014\u2014increases that could translate into lump sums that are  markedly greater than those based on the current tables used for 2014  lump sum calculations.

They said nothing precludes IRS from adopting new  tables prior to 2016, but they said it will not occur until the agency  completes its issuance process. Several pension experts are of the  opinion that the switch is not likely to occur until at least 2016.

PBGC premiums are based, in part, on the number of participants in a  plan, so reducing the number of participants via a lump sum window  directly reduces the total amount of the annual premium for that sponsor.  The flat rate portion of the single-employer premium rose 63 percent\u2014 from $35 to $57 per participant\u2014between 2012 and 2015.

Thus, for each participant that had been removed from a plan prior to  2015, the sponsor reduced its 2015 PBGC single-employer, flat rate  premium costs by $57. Likewise, removal of participants in 2016 will  result in similar savings.", "Terminated vested participants can be a particularly attractive group  through which to achieve PBGC premium savings through a lump sum  offer since they often represent a large portion of a population but a small  portion of the participant liabilities. According to a leading consultant\u2019s  analysis of selected plans, terminated vested participants can represent  less than one-sixth of the total amount of liabilities in single-employer  pension plans but nearly a third of the total plan participant counts. As a  result, terminated vested participants can account for a significant portion  of a plan\u2019s ongoing administrative expense, such as PBGC premiums. A  sponsor can generate significant administrative cost savings, especially  for large plans, if they can remove participants and their associated  premium costs from the plan. Experts differ in their opinion of the extent  to which rising PBGC premium rates act as an incentive for sponsors to  implement a lump sum window. Notably, two of the sponsors we spoke to  said the rate increases did not factor into their decision to any great  extent.

This interest rate is commonly known as a \u201clookback\u201d rate. IRS  officials we interviewed pointed out that when used for the calculation of  lump sums that are part of a plan\u2019s ongoing design (not a lump sum  window situation), this rule can work to the advantage of either the plan  sponsor or the plan participant at different points in time, depending on  whether interest rates have decreased or increased since the \u201clookback\u201d  month. However, when used in association with a one-time lump sum  window with a fixed payment date, the \u201clookback\u201d rate can be selectively  used to financial advantage by plan sponsors when interest rates have  decreased. This is because it allows sponsors to choose favorable  interest rates that are higher than prevailing rates, resulting in smaller  lump sum payouts. In 2012, as interest rates were declining, this rule  allowed plans to look back to higher rates from as early as August 2011.  Of the 11 sponsors whose information packets we examined, all sponsors  who disclosed the interest rates used for the lump sum calculations had  used sponsor-favorable \u201clookback\u201d interest rates from between 11 and 16  months prior to the lump sum payment date.", "Illustration of How the \u201cLookback\u201d Rules on Interest Rates Can Affect Lump Sums Dan is 45, has a lifetime deferred retirement pension of $10,000 a year starting at age 65,  and was offered a lump sum in October 2012.", "Dan\u2019s immediate lump sum would have been $46,967, calculated based on prevailing  interest rates as of September 2012, the month prior to the lump sum offer.", "Dan\u2019s immediate lump sum is $32,453, calculated based on \u201clookback\u201d rates as of August  2011, or 31 percent less than it would have been using a rate as of the month prior to the  offer.", "Ability to Exclude Certain Additional Plan Benefits  Another longstanding rule that provides an incentive for offering a lump  sum window is the rule that allows sponsors to exclude certain additional  plan benefits when calculating the amount of the lump sum. These  additional plan benefits that are sometimes provided by pension plans  include subsidized early retirement benefits, subsidized joint-and-survivor  benefits, and supplemental early retirement benefits. Although a  separated participant, in the absence of a lump sum window, might have  gone on to be eligible for and collect such additional benefits in the future,  or might already be eligible for such benefits, the lump sum may still be  calculated assuming the participant would have collected a normal  retirement benefit without any additional benefits.", "Illustration of How the Exclusion of Early Retirement Subsidies Can Affect Lump  Sums Pam is 45, has a lifetime deferred retirement pension of $10,000 a year starting at age 65,  but also qualifies for a subsidized, unreduced early retirement benefit starting at age 60.

Indeed, two of the three sponsors we spoke to said recent restructuring of  their companies had resulted in their plan\u2019s liabilities becoming  unacceptably large relative to the overall size of the business. Both had  recently experienced significant downsizing of their core business, yet  both had retained large amounts of benefit obligations owed to  participants.

The sponsor had stated that the pension  obligations reported on the company\u2019s financial statements had become  \u201cdisproportionately large\u201d and very sensitive to swings in interest rates.

Disincentives include the administrative costs involved, future costs  associated with adverse selection, the need to make sizeable immediate  payments, interest rate uncertainty, and foregone potential returns.", "Administrative costs. Conducting a lump sum window requires  sponsors to collect and verify data on their participant population to  properly value their benefit obligations, which in some cases may  involve the reconciliation of thousands of participant data records. In  addition, participant communications, including information materials,  must be prepared, and call centers may need to be set up, requiring  staffing and training. If these administrative tasks are performed in- house, it will take time and resources; if outsourced to a third party,  the sponsor will likely incur service fees.", "Adverse selection. When lump sums are offered, it is possible that  relatively unhealthy participants will be more likely to accept the lump  sum and, conversely, healthier participants will choose to keep their  existing deferred annuity. If so, the remaining plan participants may  outlive the mortality assumptions used to value liabilities, requiring  additional plan funding in the future to cover benefit payments.", "Sizeable immediate payments. The payment of lump sums results in  an immediate depletion of plan assets. In such cases, it is possible  that the sponsor might have to sell assets at a poor time, when their  position in the market is low. In addition, lump sum payouts could  reduce the funded ratio of an underfunded plan, potentially increasing  minimum required contributions.  Interest rate uncertainty. Future interest rate increases can reduce  the lump sum amounts to be paid, so that the sponsor might have  achieved greater benefits if action had been postponed. However, the  potential effect of interest rate increases on the value of plan assets  would also be a consideration. For example, if a sponsor anticipates  that interest rates will rise in the future, they will need to determine  whether the cost savings associated with paying lower lump sum  amounts then is offset by the potential for investment losses on plan  assets before the lump sum window is executed.", "Foregone potential returns. Lump sum payments can come at the  expense of future market earnings, if future rates of return on the  assets would have exceeded the interest rate used to calculate the  lump sums.

This is likely due in large part to differences in the  actuarial factors used to value minimum lump sums, as set by law and  regulation, versus those used by insurance companies to price annuities.  One such factor is the discount rates, or interest rates used to convert  future projected annuity payments into a lump sum amount or an annuity  price. The generally higher lump sum discount rates have the effect of  making the lump sum less than the amount needed to purchase a  corresponding annuity, with the gap increasing at younger ages. A  second factor is the mortality (or longevity) assumption. As noted earlier,  the mortality assumption for determining minimum lump sums has not  kept up with increases in longevity and, all else equal, has the effect of  making lump sums today lower than they would be with up-to-date tables.  In contrast, insurance companies will factor this increased longevity into  their pricing, so that this factor will also tend to make minimum lump sums  insufficient to purchase a corresponding annuity.", "The reduction in retirement income, or the gap between the amount of the  lump sum offered and the amount needed, varies significantly by both the  age and gender of the participant. Regarding gender differences, for  example, figure 1 shows a 36 percent reduction in income for a 55 year- old male, compared to a 41 percent reduction for a 55-year-old female,  from accepting a lump sum and purchasing an annuity. This gender  differential occurs because federal law requires a sponsor calculating the  amount of the lump sum payment to assume both men and women have  the same life expectancy, while an insurer offering retail annuities  outside the qualified retirement plan environment generally can charge  different rates to men and women. On average, women live longer than  men and thus collect benefits over a longer period of time. The insurer will  thus require a woman to pay more than a man of the same age to  purchase an equivalent lifetime monthly benefit.", "Most participants accepting the lump sum payment, but then wishing to  still have an annuity, will be subject to purchasing a more costly individual  retail annuity rather than a group annuity. One reason for this cost  difference is that the individual retail annuity market is also subject to  adverse selection, which means that when given a choice, relatively  healthier individuals will tend to purchase or select annuities, increasing  average costs because such individuals are expected to live longer.  According to the American Academy of Actuaries, adverse selection can  add about a 10 percent increase to the annuity price. Retail annuities can  also include additional distribution, administrative and sales charges that  can add further to their cost differential over group annuities. Moreover,  certain individuals, particularly older retirees, may find that regardless of  cost, they do not have the ability to purchase a lifetime annuity on their  own.

However, at an  annualized 7 percent rate of return, the participant\u2019s monies will last an  additional 30 years, exhausting after 35 years at age 100.

Unlike the constant rates of return  reflected in the preceding spend-down scenario (see figure 2),  participants\u2019 investments may fluctuate, and the sequence of  fluctuating rates of return can pose additional risks. For example, due  to net cash outflows from a retiree\u2019s spend-down of his or her lump  sum, the lump sum account has a diminishing asset base that can be  particularly at risk if the retiree encounters periods of low returns or  losses, as the account will have less time to recover from such  downturns. Further, the continued draw-down of the account during  such periods means that assets might have to be sold at depressed  values, and less money will remain in the account to benefit from any  future market upturn.", "Effect of fees. As prior GAO work on fees has shown, fees can  significantly decrease retirement assets. Even a small fee deducted  from one\u2019s assets annually could represent a large amount of money  years later had these funds remained in the account to be reinvested.  This means that participants will have to carefully consider fees as  they review alternative investment options. Compared to participant  controlled investment in account-based pension plans, this can be  more difficult in the retail market.", "Loss of budgeting signal. A monthly pension has the advantage of  providing a retiree a budgeting signal as to how much can reasonably  and safely be spent each month. During the spend-down phase, this  valuable information is lost when a participant converts a monthly  pension into a single lump sum. The retiree may spend more of the  lump sum each month than is sustainable. In addition, the retiree may  have to make large unforeseen expenditures at certain times without  realizing the likely negative impact on the exhaustion date of the lump  sum, whereas for a retiree receiving a monthly pension, a large  expenditure can be seen relative to the monthly pension amount and  may lead the retiree to take other remedial measures. Additionally,  in some cases the retiree may unnecessarily restrict his or her  standard of living by spending less each month than a steady pension  would have permitted.", "Diminished capacity. Managing assets through retirement may be  particularly challenging for retirees who experience diminished  physical or mental capacity as they age. For example, a retiree with  dementia may find it more difficult to manage the many decisions  involved with investing and drawing down an IRA compared to the  relative simplicity of receiving a monthly pension check. As one  scholar has noted, if the retiree misuses a monthly pension check,  another check will arrive the following month. However, if the retiree  makes investments that result in significant losses for their IRA, there  may be no additional funds for future withdrawal.", "Planning for spouses. Our previous illustration assumes the money  is drawn down for an individual\u2019s lifetime. Acceptance of a lump sum  over $5,000 for married or formerly married individuals requires  spousal consent to waive the right to a future annuity based on the  combined lifetime of participant and spouse, known as a joint and  survivor annuity. However, this does not preclude the participant from  including a spouse or beneficiary in his retirement planning.

Some of the recent lump sum window offers may have been driven by  federal rules that may serve as cost-saving incentives for sponsors to  take such actions. Through lump sum payments, sponsors transfer the  risks and responsibility of retirement security away from themselves\u2014and  the defined benefit system more generally\u2014and onto participants. As the  proportion of the U.S. population over age 65 increases, the importance  of retirement security for our country\u2019s well-being increases as well.

In most cases, the lump sum payment received is unlikely to  purchase an equivalent annuity on the retail annuity market. Furthermore,  the lump sum is exposed to potential erosion over the years, as the  participant assumes all the risks inherent in managing both the  investment and drawdown of their lump sum amount.

The future cash flows are discounted at the discount rate, and the higher  the discount rate, the lower the present value.

How long the  stream of benefits will last depends on how long the participant lives, and  lump sums take into account the probability that the participant will be  alive at each future date. A mortality table is a common actuarial  convention which shows, for each age, the probability that a person will  die before his or her next birthday.", "For ease of reference, we refer to this simply as \u00a7 417(e)(3) throughout this appendix. segments of a corporate bond yield curve.term corporate bond interest rate applied to projected pension payments  payable within 5 years; the second segment is a medium-term corporate  bond interest rate applied to payments payable 5 years or more, but less  than 20 years, into the future; and the third segment is a long-term  corporate bond interest rate applied to payments payable in 20 years or  more."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Description of Our Lump Sum Calculations", "paragraphs": ["We constructed a calculator of minimum lump sums to show some of the  effect certain methods and assumptions can have on the calculation. We  constructed a number of illustrative individuals to show how the minimum  lump sums may vary according to key participant characteristics, namely  age, gender, and retirement age, and key input calculation parameters,  namely interest rates, mortality tables, and the inclusion or exclusion of  certain additional plan benefits. While we performed lump sum  calculations across a number of illustrative individuals, throughout this  appendix we present the results for single individuals in 10-year age  increments, from age 35 to age 95. We assumed all individuals are full  integer ages\u2014that is, the participant has his or her birthday on the  measurement date of the lump sum offer. For terminated vested  participants, we assumed a normal retirement age of 65. For retired  participants, the present value of their lump sum is calculated and  commences at their current age and is based on the remaining payments  that are expected to be due from that point forward. Technically, our  calculator projects an annual lump sum factor, which produced a lump  sum based on an annual benefit. We used a common actuarial  adjustment factor to account for monthly payments.", "We verified our lump sum calculations in two ways. First, when we started  our study we asked Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC)  officials with actuarial expertise to furnish us with lump sum amounts  based on varying age and benefit commencement assumptions using  various mortality and interest rate assumptions consistent with  \u00a7 417(e)(3).to base our calculations on annual benefit amounts, and asked the  officials to perform the calculation using such a method. Additionally, to  determine if we could come reasonably close to actual offers, we  reviewed lump sum offers in two participant packets for which we had  enough information to calculate or approximate the lump sum in that  packet. Our calculations differed by 1.5 percent and nearly zero percent  for the two offers we reviewed. The 1.5 percent difference is very modest  and may be due to the fact that the birth date or the date of normal  retirement age of the participant we used differed from the date of the  offer by a few calendar months. Based on these small differences, and  since our purpose was to then estimate changes to lump sums based on  changes in certain assumptions, we deemed our calculator to be  adequate for such purposes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Figures and Results", "paragraphs": ["We discuss our lump sum results below and show how values can  change depending on certain key factors. Generally, we are comparing  alternative assumptions to our baseline assumptions. We found, of the  materials we reviewed, that many of the lump sum election windows  occurred between September and December 2012. Based on our review  of election materials, we found that many of these sponsors elected to  use August 2011 interest rates for the 2012 plan year. Thus, our  \u201cbaseline\u201d assumption is an offer made in October 2012, using a  methodology under \u00a7 417(e)(3) for August 2011 interest rates for the  2012 plan year, along with the IRS published unisex mortality table for the  2012 plan year, and without including any additional plan benefits.  Comparisons and deviations from this baseline are noted with the figures.", "Figure 4 compares, for our range of ages, the PPA interest rate basis (our  baseline) against the pre-PPA interest rate basis for minimum lump sums,  for a lump sum payment offer made in October 2012. As noted, our  baseline uses August 2011 corporate bond segment rates (for the 2012  plan year), which under PPA uses corporate bond rates published by IRS  as the interest rate used to determine minimum required lump sums. The  comparison uses the August 2011 30-year Treasury Securities Rate  (TSR), as the 30-year TSR was used to determine minimum required  lump sums prior to PPA. Figure 4 shows that lump sum payments are  most disparate for younger individuals. This occurs because these  individuals have their payments discounted at the second or third  segment rates, which are much higher than the 30-year TSR in this  instance, and because lump sum amounts for younger participants are  more sensitive to changes in interest rates because of the greater length  of the discounting period. As shown, minimum lump sums for 35-year-old  participants would have increased by 142 percent if an August 2011 30- year TSR was used instead of the baseline.", "Figure 5 compares the effect of using the \u201clookback\u201d interest rates that  sponsors are allowed to select (our August 2011 interest rates baseline  used for the 2012 plan year) against using interest rates as of the month  immediately preceding the month of the lump sum offer (September 2012  rates). As noted previously, sponsors may elect a stability period of one  year with a maximum lookback of 5 months. This means that the rates  used at the time of the offer may be nearly 17 months old compared to  rates that are current just before the offer. As shown, minimum lump  sums would have been higher at all ages, as much as 65 percent higher  for 35-year-olds, if more current interest rates were used instead of the  \u201clookback\u201d rates.", "Figure 6 compares the effect of using current prescribed mortality tables  (baseline) against using more up-to-date mortality tables on a  participant\u2019s minimum lump sum amount at selected ages. Here we show  lump sums that are calculated using the new mortality tables and  projection scales devised by the Retirement Planning Experience  Committee of the Society of Actuaries and compare that to the current  mortality tables used for lump sum payments under \u00a7 417(e)(3). The  differences in lump sum values, which are also sensitive to the assumed  interest rate, vary significantly depending on the age of the participant. As  shown, the more up-to-date mortality method improves lump sums by as  little as 5 percent for 95-year-olds but as much as 13 percent for 35-year- olds.", "Figure 7 compares baseline lump sums against an estimate of what they  would be if based on group annuity purchase rates. It shows how a lump  sum payment, calculated in 2012 using sponsor-elected August 2011  corporate bond interest rates (for the 2012 plan year) and the prescribed  mortality tables, would compare to lump sum payments calculated in the  month before the offer was made, or September 2012, using the interest  rate, mortality assumptions, and loading factors used by PBGC. This  method uses the survey that PBGC takes of recent prices of group  annuities to derive the interest factors that are used to calculate the  present value of future benefit-payment obligations under section 4044 of  the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). These  future benefits are obligations that PBGC must pay to participants in the  plans that they have taken over as trustee.", "As observed earlier in the report, figure 7 shows that lump sum payments  under the minimum method prescribed under \u00a7 417(e)(3) can be  significantly smaller than the lump sums that would be necessary to  repurchase an annuity that matches the benefit forgone under the  participant\u2019s plan. In this case, and because retail annuity data is not  easily available, we used a group annuity methodology consistent with   For example, a 55-year-old female  PBGC section 4044 assumptions. would receive a lump sum payment of $67,020 under the \u00a7 417(e)(3)  minimum, while she would need $114,460, or a 71 percent larger lump  sum, to purchase an annuity that would have been provided under her  plan (in this case, a $10,000 annual, or $833 monthly, benefit starting at  age 65). As noted earlier in the report, group annuities are generally only  available to large pension plans, and retail annuities are generally more  expensive due to adverse selection and administrative charges or other  fees, so an individual would likely need an even larger lump sum payment  to replicate their prior benefit on the retail market.", "Additionally, a loading factor consistent with 4044 assumptions is added to the lump sum.  In the case of the annuity prices, which are all less than $200,000, this is a charge of 5  percent of the preliminary annuity price plus $200.
