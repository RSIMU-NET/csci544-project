Specifically, state and district officials were challenged to build staff capacity and commitment for reform, facing difficulties such as recruiting and retaining strong staff members. In addition, the SIG requirements to develop teacher evaluations and increase student learning time were difficult to implement quickly and effectively because they required extensive planning and coordination. Furthermore, states sometimes had limited evidence about the performance of SIG schools when making grant renewal decisions. For example, although Education\u0092s guidance identifies meeting annual student achievement goals as a key criterion for making renewal decisions, some states did not receive student achievement data by the time decisions had to be made. States also made decisions through qualitative assessments of schools\u0092 implementation efforts, but such determinations were not always based on extensive interaction with schools or systematic monitoring. Education did not provide written guidance to states about making evidence-based grant renewal decisions after they encountered these challenges.", "Districts used a significant portion of their SIG funds to hire contractors for a range of services, such as managing school operations and conducting teacher professional development. Leading practices show that screening potential contractors and then reviewing their performance are important for ensuring accountability and quality of results. Education required screening of contractors before contract awards were made. However, Education did not require review of contractors during contract performance, and states varied in whether they ensured that contractors were reviewed during the course of contract performance.", "Education\u0092s assistance and oversight activities are generally supporting SIG implementation. In our survey, nearly all states reported they were satisfied with Education\u0092s technical assistance, particularly the agency\u0092s SIG guidance and conferences. In addition, many states reported that Education\u0092s guidance was timely. With respect to oversight, Education monitored 12 states in school year (SY) 2010-2011 and found deficiencies in 11 of the 12 states. Education is working with states to correct these deficiencies. For SY 2011-2012, the agency plans to use a risk-based approach to conduct on-site monitoring in 14 additional states. To maximize its oversight resources, Education also plans to conduct some limited monitoring in five additional states in SY 2011-2012. Education officials told us that they plan to monitor the remaining states in SY 2012-2013 and that these states represent a small percentage of SIG funds."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that Education (1) provide additional support to states about making evidence-based grant renewal decisions and (2) ensure that contractor performance is reviewed.

After grant awards are made, states  are also responsible for deciding whether to renew schools\u2019 SIG funding  for additional years. State renewal decisions are to be based on criteria  that can include whether school assessment results meet annual student  achievement goals, and whether the school has implemented its chosen  intervention model. Education oversees the program by reviewing state  grant applications, monitoring implementation and providing technical  assistance.", "The recent changes to the SIG program have raised questions about how  grants are being implemented. The Senate Appropriations Committee  and its Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education,  and Related Agencies requested that we conduct a broad review of the  SIG program, and in July 2011 we reported on early implementation  issues in six states during the first year of the expanded SIG program.  That report found that the program\u2019s implementation time frames in some  cases did not allow schools sufficient time to plan and fully enact reforms,  and we recommended that the Secretary of Education consider options to  award SIG grants to school districts earlier in the school year. In this  review, we addressed the following questions: (1) What, if any, aspects of  SIG pose challenges for successful implementation? (2) How do  Education and state guidance and procedures for screening potential  contractors and reviewing contractor performance compare with leading  practices? (3) To what extent are Education\u2019s technical assistance and  oversight activities effectively supporting SIG implementation?", "To identify aspects of SIG that pose challenges to successful school  turnaround, we administered a survey to the 50 states and the District of  Columbia, and received a 100 percent response rate.Education documents and interviewed Education officials. We gathered  in-depth information from eight states that were selected to represent a  range of size, geographic diversity, and the intervention models being  used. These states were California, Delaware, Nebraska, Nevada, Ohio,  Rhode Island, Texas, and Virginia. In each of the states, we also  interviewed school district and school officials from one to three districts  that had SIG schools. To collect information about policies and  procedures for screening potential contractors and reviewing contractor  performance, we examined Education guidance and state monitoring  policies. We also interviewed Education officials and state and local  officials from our site visit states. We identified leading practices for  screening and reviewing contractors based on our past work.

These entities  all play key roles in the SIG award and implementation process, with  Education supporting and overseeing state SIG efforts. Before awarding  formula grants to states, Education reviews each state\u2019s application and  approves the state\u2019s proposed process for competitively awarding SIG  grants and monitoring implementation. As part of the state application  process, states identify and prioritize eligible schools into three tiers:", "Tier I schools. Receive priority for SIG funding and are the state\u2019s  lowest-achieving 5 percent of Title I schools (or 5 lowest-achieving  schools, whichever number is greater) in improvement status.", "Tier II schools. Secondary schools eligible for, but not receiving, Title I  funds with equivalently poor performance as Tier I schools.", "Tier III schools. Title I schools in improvement status that are not Tier  I or Tier II schools.", "After states receive SIG funding, school districts submit applications to  states describing their SIG reform plans for eligible schools. Education  has required that districts base their plans on an analysis of each school\u2019s  needs, called a needs assessment. After reviewing district applications,  states distribute their SIG dollars using their approved competitive grant  award process, giving priority to districts seeking funding for Tier I and  Tier II schools. Education\u2019s regulations and guidance require districts  receiving SIG awards for Tier I or Tier II schools to implement one of four  intervention models in each school. Select aspects of each model are as  follows:", "Transformation. Transformation schools must replace the principal,  implement a transparent and equitable teacher and principal  evaluation system that incorporates student academic growth, identify  and reward staff who are increasing student outcomes, and provide  increased student learning time, among other requirements.", "Turnaround. In addition to implementing many requirements of the  transformation model, turnaround schools must use locally adopted   competencies to screen existing staff and rehire no more than 50  percent of the existing staff.", "Restart. The district must reopen the school under the management of  a contractor, such as a charter school operator, charter management  organization, or education management organization.", "Closure. The district must close the school and enroll its students in a  higher achieving school within a reasonable proximity.", "Districts may choose to use contractors to implement aspects of their  reform plans. Schools enacting a restart model are required to contract  with an organization that will assume many of the decision-making and  leadership functions in that school. Districts employing other models may  also contract with external organizations for services that could include  data analysis, teacher professional development, and efforts to create  safe school environments. Our work notes the importance of screening  potential contractors before awarding contracts, as well as regular  evaluation in order to ensure contractors are providing timely and quality  services with government funds.", "In addition to reviewing district applications, states are also responsible  for monitoring grant implementation. States make decisions about  whether to renew funding for each SIG school for an additional year,  based on factors such as whether schools meet annual student  achievement goals that districts set for the schools. Pursuant to  Education\u2019s guidance, if a school meets its annual goals, the state must  renew the school\u2019s SIG grant. If a school does not meet one or more  annual goals, Education\u2019s guidance gives states the flexibility to consider  other factors such as the \u201cfidelity with which the school is implementing\u201d  its chosen intervention model.", "Education provides states with technical assistance and oversight  regarding SIG implementation. For example, Education funds 21  Comprehensive Centers that help build states\u2019 capacity to assist school  districts and schools. Sixteen of these organizations serve states in  designated regions, and 5 provide technical assistance on specific issues,  such as teacher quality. In addition, Education funds Regional  Educational Laboratories, a network of 10 laboratories that serve  designated regions by providing access to applied education research  and development projects, studies, and other related technical assistance  activities. Education also monitors states\u2019 implementation of SIG. This  monitoring process consists of visits to selected states and several SIG  districts and schools within the monitored states, followed by reports  documenting any findings. States have an opportunity to respond to any  findings before the release of Education\u2019s monitoring reports.", "States have awarded funding to two cohorts of schools since the program  was modified and expanded in 2010. In the first cohort, 867 schools  received SIG funding to implement one of the four intervention models in  SY 2010-2011, and in the second cohort 488 schools received funding to  implement one of the intervention models in SY 2011-2012. Seven   have received waivers from Education to delay awarding funding  statesto their second cohort of schools until SY 2012-2013 because of various  issues, such as turnover of key staff in state educational agencies. The  proportion of schools choosing each model was similar in both cohorts  and, as shown in figure 1, most schools chose to implement the  transformation model."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Successful SIG Implementation Has Posed a Number of Challenges", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Staff Capacity and Commitment to Reform Posed Implementation Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Although most states have increased the amount of staff time devoted to  SIG since the program was expanded, some states have struggled to  develop the necessary staff capacity to successfully support and oversee  SIG implementation because of budget constraints. In our survey, 29  states told us that they have increased the staff time devoted to SIG since  they first applied for SIG funds in the expanded SIG program. However,  officials from four of the eight states we visited\u2014California, Nebraska,  Rhode Island, and Texas\u2014told us that because of budgetary constraints,  the time staff could devote to administering the SIG program and  monitoring district implementation was significantly limited. For example,  officials in California said that as a result of the state budget crisis, the  state legislature reduced the amount of SIG funds available for state  administration from the allowable 5 percent to 0.5 percent, limiting the  number of staff available to administer the program and monitor districts.  Several state officials we spoke with also reported that their existing  workloads made it difficult to focus on SIG. For example, in several states  the program was administered by officials who also had responsibilities  for other major education programs, such as Race to the Top.", "In addition, state officials sometimes did not have expertise in supporting  school turnaround efforts. Officials from Education and several states and  research groups told us that SIG required states to support local reform  efforts to a much greater extent than they had in the past, and staff in  some states had not yet developed the knowledge base to fulfill these  responsibilities. Even when states were able to develop expertise in  school reform and hire necessary staff, officials from Education told us  that personnel turnover in many states made it difficult to retain such  knowledge. For example, Rhode Island officials said they encountered  difficulties filling vacated positions because many nearby states were also  recruiting from the same small pool of qualified applicants. Several states  increased their capacity through actions such as contracting with  nationally recognized experts to help them run their grant competitions,  establishing school turnaround offices, or hiring turnaround specialists  that regularly handled an individualized caseload of SIG schools. For  example, 18 states created new turnaround offices to help districts  implement SIG, according to our survey.", "In addition to these state level issues, many districts also struggled to  develop the necessary staff capacity to implement successful school  reforms. It was particularly difficult for schools to recruit and retain  qualified staff members, according to many stakeholders, including  officials from several states and districts we visited. They told us that SIG  schools were sometimes in rural areas or needed staff to have expertise  that was in short supply, such as experience with reform or specialized  academic subjects. Among the 12 states that Education monitored during  SY 2010-2011, they found that 4 states did not ensure that turnaround  schools met requirements to remove at least half of the schools\u2019 staff and  hire new staff for those positions based on staff effectiveness. For  example, Education found that one monitored district in Minnesota did not  base hiring decisions on prospective teachers\u2019 instructional effectiveness.  In addition, Education found that three of the monitored states did not  ensure appropriate replacement of the principal in turnaround or  transformation schools.", "Moreover, some districts did not have staff with expertise in using  performance and evaluation data\u2014such as data on student  performance\u2014to inform plans for reforming schools and ongoing  instructional improvements. Education officials said that, in many cases,  school district staff were able to collect data, but did not have experience  linking data to needed interventions. In addition, our review of the needs  assessments districts were required to develop when planning SIG  interventions showed that some were more extensive than others. Also, in  one district we visited, the new teacher evaluation process did not include  state assessment data on student achievement as one of the evaluation  criteria, as required by Education. Several states, districts, and  researchers identified promising practices for recruiting and retaining staff  or improving data usage, such as developing \u201cgrow-your-own\u201d leadership  programs, conducting priority hiring for SIG schools, or hiring data  coaches to help teachers collect and analyze student data.", "Districts also varied in their commitment to use SIG funds to enact major  reforms. According to our survey, 35 of 51 states awarded grants to all or  most Tier I applicants who applied for grants starting in SY 2010-2011,  but several officials from states we visited and research organizations  reported that some districts receiving SIG grants were not prepared to  make significant reforms. For example, officials in one large school district  we visited told us they followed turnaround model requirements to rehire  no more than 50 percent of teachers at a SIG school. However, the  district officials said they relocated the released teachers to other SIG  schools in their district because those schools had almost all of the  vacancies. Similarly, in two states we visited, district officials moved a  school\u2019s previous principal into another leadership position on site so that  person could continue to work in the school even after a new principal  was assigned. State and district officials also cited instances where  districts chose their SIG model for reasons other than its likelihood of  improving student success. For example, the superintendent in one  district told us they chose the restart model because they considered it  less restrictive than other models. Although many states responding to  our survey told us that all or most of their transformation model schools  were operating very differently after the first year of SIG, 33 states said  that at least some of these schools choosing the transformation model  were not. Figure 2 shows responses from these 33 states about  whether inadequate action by SIG schools or districts was a reason the  schools were not operating very differently. increased learning time requirements in about half of the states that it  monitored during SY 2010-2011 and in both states for which it had  completed SY 2011-2012 monitoring reports by February 2012..According  to district officials, at least half the districts we spoke with will not have  fully implemented new teacher evaluation systems by the end of their  second year of SIG. In addition, during its SY 2011-2012 monitoring visit  to Iowa, Education found that student growth was not always incorporated  in new teacher evaluation systems, as required. Our analysis showed that  increased learning time and teacher evaluation requirements were  challenging because the planning needed to implement them was  complex and time-consuming, and stakeholders, such as unions and  parents, were sometimes reluctant to embrace the changes. Some  districts struggled to develop increased learning time initiatives that would  be sustainable after their 3-year SIG grant ended. More specifically:  Interventions required extensive planning. Effectively implementing  increased learning time and teacher evaluations required extensive  planning. Several stakeholders stressed the importance of carefully  designing increased learning time schedules because, for the  intervention to be successful, it must provide quality instruction rather  than simply increasing the amount of poor instruction. Officials from  several districts said they were unable to fully implement their plans  for increased learning time at the beginning of the first year of  increased SIG funding because, for example, they first needed to fully  analyze their existing schedules and curricula and adapt them to meet  SIG requirements. Officials from states and districts we visited often  stressed that developing a teacher evaluation system is time- consuming because it requires districts to accurately and  comprehensively identify, collect, and analyze information about  teachers\u2019 performance and students\u2019 academic growth. In response to  the challenges involved in planning and implementing teacher  evaluation systems, Education allowed states to apply for a waiver to  extend the planning period for this requirement, and 27 states applied  for and received the waiver as of February 2012. In its final SIG  requirements, Education required schools implementing the  transformation model to implement new teacher evaluation systems  within the first year of the grant. Districts in states receiving these  waivers must develop their evaluation systems during SY 2011-2012;  pilot or fully implement them by SY 2012-2013; and use them to make  decisions about retention, promotion, and compensation by SY 2013- 2014. The timeline is the same regardless of whether the SIG schools  in the district are from the first or second SIG cohort.", "Stakeholders sometimes reluctant to embrace required changes.", "Implementation was also delayed or otherwise challenged by  concerns from various stakeholder groups. Teachers and teachers\u2019  unions were sometimes concerned about increasing student learning  time or implementing new teacher evaluations in SIG schools,  according to Education, state, and district officials. For example, these  officials said unions were concerned about whether teacher  evaluation systems that incorporated student academic growth could  do so in a manner that would not penalize teachers working with the  most challenging students. Such concerns sometimes led to delays in  finalizing evaluation systems. In a few cases, officials told us that  other stakeholder groups such as parents and school board members  were also resistant to SIG requirements. For example, an official in  Virginia said that some schools trying to increase learning time had  met resistance from parents because students often had jobs or  responsibilities at home once the traditional school day was over.", "Difficulty designing sustainable approaches for increasing learning  time. State and district officials also questioned whether increased  learning time initiatives would be sustainable after SIG funds were  exhausted. For example, survey respondents from 26 states said the  costs of increased learning time were unlikely or very unlikely to be  sustainable after the SIG grant ends, compared with 10 states that  reported it was likely or very likely to be sustainable. Rhode Island  officials noted that increased learning time benefits students enrolled  in SIG schools during the grant cycle, but state and local financial  constraints will make it difficult to sustain the increased learning time  for future students. Due in part to these concerns, one of the two  districts in the state with SIG schools limited the amount of learning  time it added in order to avoid significant cuts in this time after grant  funding ends.", "While many officials stressed the complexity of effectively implementing  these requirements, some states and districts that we visited found ways  to address the challenges they posed. This was particularly true in  districts that had started to plan for and implement similar school reforms  prior to applying for SIG funds. Many officials from Education, state, and  districts stressed the importance of stakeholder involvement while  designing and implementing SIG reforms in order to enhance buy-in and  strengthen reform initiatives. In order to increase students\u2019 learning time  without increasing teacher workloads and salaries, Education officials and  researchers told us that a few districts were working with community  partners to fund or staff additional learning time or were staggering  teachers\u2019 schedules so that students would be in class longer but  teachers would not. In addition, a few states developed sample teacher  evaluation system that met SIG requirements so that districts could use it  as a framework for developing their own systems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some States Had Limited Evidence about SIG Grant Performance When Making Grant Renewal Decisions", "paragraphs": ["States often had limited evidence for making decisions about whether to  renew schools\u2019 SIG funding. For example, in our survey, officials from 10  states told us that they did not use schools\u2019 achievement of annual goals  to make grant renewal decisions after SY 2010-2011. According to state  officials, at least half the states we interviewed did not have the annual  student achievement data available at the time they had to make renewal  decisions because assessment results only became available at the end  of the summer. Officials from two of these states told us that timely  access to annual achievement data will continue to be a problem in future  years. In addition, even when these data were available, states frequently  chose not to base their decisions on schools\u2019 achievement of annual  goals. Twenty-three of 44 states responding to our survey question said  that, among schools that had their funding renewed, all or most did not  meet their annual goals. Several officials from our site visits questioned  the usefulness of annual goal data in determining whether progress was  made, particularly because districts set their own performance targets.  For example, California officials said they did not find annual goals data  useful because districts often included generic annual goals in their  applications for SIG funding instead of proposing goals based on schools\u2019  unique circumstances.", "Regardless of whether annual goals information was available, states  almost always considered \u201cfidelity of implementation\u201d\u2014the extent to  which the school is implementing the requirements of its intervention  model\u2014when making grant renewal decisions. However, states did not  always base decisions about this criterion on extensive information. In our  survey, 48 of 51 states identified fidelity of implementation as an  important factor in their decision-making process, more than any other  factor. Several states we spoke with said that qualitative information  about implementation was important for assessing grant progress  because the first steps of school reform, such as efforts to change school  culture, do not always result in measurable student achievement gains.", "However, making this assessment can involve a high degree of  subjectivity and states\u2019 determinations were not always developed based  on extensive interaction with schools or systematic monitoring of their  implementation efforts. For example, officials in California told us they  used fidelity of implementation as their key criterion for making grant  renewal decisions, and that the primary method for evaluating this  criterion was one telephone conversation with each district at the end of  the year. Prior to those conversations, the state had limited interaction  with most districts for the purpose of assessing their implementation and  was unable to conduct SIG monitoring visits for budgetary reasons. In  addition, a Virginia official told us the state used fidelity of implementation  for making renewal decisions but would benefit from guidance on how to  define and measure it.", "States were in some cases reluctant to discontinue SIG funding even  when information they collected showed that schools were not  implementing key requirements with fidelity. Several officials from states  we visited said they renewed all schools\u2019 SIG funding even if the schools  were struggling to fulfill key SIG requirements because tight  implementation timeframes made the officials reluctant to eliminate  funding after the first year of the grant. In our survey, 21 states reported  that half or fewer of their Tier I and Tier II schools were able to implement  major aspects of their plan by the beginning of SY 2010-2011, such as  extending the school day or having new staff in place. In the 19 cases  where these states had made renewal decisions, the state renewed all or  most grants. Furthermore, officials in several states we visited identified  instances where they chose to renew schools\u2019 funding despite significant  problems at the district or school level, such as having administrators who  were not committed to enacting major reforms or were not ensuring that  planned reforms were fully implemented. For example, officials from  Nevada said they renewed such grants after the first year because they  did not want to negatively impact students and teachers when significant  district-level problems were outside their control.", "Although Education reviewed states\u2019 proposed grant renewal procedures  through the state SIG application process, the agency did not provide  written guidance after grant renewal challenges arose. Education required  states to submit their renewal processes for review as part of their SIG  applications. Nonetheless, in several state applications we reviewed,  descriptions of renewal processes and criteria did not align with the  practices the state actually implemented. For example, states that told us  they were unable to use annual goals data to make renewal decisions  had originally identified these goals as a key renewal criterion in their  applications to Education. In its work with states, Education officials told  us they found some had difficulty using annual goals data or fidelity of  implementation and that the agency provided technical assistance to  several states that asked for help. However, agency officials were not  aware of how states ultimately addressed these issues, and said the  agency has not provided any additional technical assistance on grant  renewal.", "States renewed almost all SIG grants at the end of SY 2010-2011, and in  some cases imposed conditions on schools for renewal. According to  Education, 39 states chose to renew funding to every SIG school in their  state. Eleven states and the District of Columbia chose not to renew  funding to one or more schools, for a total of 16 nonrenewed schools  overall.problems with fidelity of implementation. Several states we spoke with  chose to renew grants with conditions or required changes. For example,  officials in Ohio told us that struggling schools were required to take  corrective actions in the second year of the 3-year grant and that their  level of success in taking such actions will be a key criterion in future  renewal decisions. In addition, New York officials renewed all grants after  SY 2010-2011 under the condition that transformation and restart schools  would implement state and federal SIG teacher evaluation requirements  by December 30, 2011. Once that deadline passed, state officials  determined that no districts had met the requirements and suspended all  SIG funding until they were met. In February 2012, the state  commissioner reinstated funds to half of the SIG districts after  determining that the districts had made the necessary changes. In our  survey, 23 states reported that at least a few of their SIG schools were  required to make major changes to their SIG plans as a condition of  having funding renewed."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "States and Districts Screen Contractors Before Selecting Them to Receive SIG Funding, but Inconsistent Approach to Reviewing Performance Reduces Contractor Accountability", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Contractors Provide a Wide Range of Services, and Many Receive Significant Amounts of SIG Funding", "paragraphs": ["Contractors provide a wide range of services with SIG funds, and school  districts have often given contractors major roles in schools using the  restart, turnaround, and transformation models.

In contrast, Education allows districts  with schools using the turnaround and transformation models\u2014which  include more than 90 percent of schools receiving SIG funds\u2014to use  contractors, but does not identify a specific role for them. Most turnaround  and transformation schools we visited were working with contractors.  Although in some cases turnaround and transformation schools used  these contractors for minor tasks, in other cases the contractors played a  major role in school operations.

For example, Virginia officials told us they enacted statewide  contracts with four organizations, and strongly encouraged districts to  choose one of those four organizations.

While states and school districts carry a large share of the responsibility  for planning and implementing successful SIG reforms, Education also  plays a critical role in supporting these efforts and mitigating risk through  strong oversight and accountability. For example, it is important that  Education have rigorous processes for reviewing state SIG applications,  conducting oversight, and providing technical assistance when needed.  The ability to successfully carry out these functions is vital to ensuring the  long-term success of the SIG program and protecting taxpayer funds from  waste and abuse. Although SIG has been challenging to implement, in  part due to the short implementation timeframes we highlighted in our  July 2011 report, Education has reviewed state SIG applications,  distributed funds to states, begun its monitoring activities, and provided  technical assistance. However, the agency\u2019s guidance in some cases has  not been sufficient to ensure that schools and contractors are fully  accountable. For example, given the implementation issues we and  Education\u2019s monitoring have found, it is critical that states have rigorous  SIG grant renewal procedures in place to identify schools that are not  making progress. Education has provided limited guidance to states  about how to make renewal decisions. Some states are using highly  subjective review processes to renew nearly all grants, often without key  information on SIG schools\u2019 performance. Until Education provides  additional support about how states should make evidence-based  renewal decisions when, for example, state assessment results are  received too late to be factored into these decisions, schools that are not  making progress may continue receiving SIG funds. In addition, although  contractors are receiving large amounts of many schools\u2019 SIG funds,  Education has not ensured that states or districts review contractor  performance during the terms of their contracts. Unless Education takes  action to ensure that states or districts review contractor performance,  districts may not receive an appropriate level of contractor services for  their SIG funds and funds may not be well spent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To ensure that SIG grant renewal decisions serve to hold districts and  schools accountable, we recommend that the Secretary of Education  provide additional support to states about how to make evidence-based  grant renewal decisions, particularly when states do not have annual  student achievement goal information available at the time renewal  decisions are made.", "To ensure that contractors hired with SIG funding are accountable for  their performance, we recommend that the Secretary of Education take  steps to ensure that the performance of SIG funded contractors, including  those in turnaround and transformation schools, is reviewed during  contract performance.

In its comments, Education said that it believed  that existing provisions and requirements address this issue  appropriately. For example, Education cited a federal regulation that  requires districts to follow their existing procurement procedures, and  noted that districts and states have their own requirements for evaluating  contractors to ensure accountability. Education also said that the type of  evaluation process needed for a contractor should depend on the  contractor\u2019s role, and that contractors used by schools implementing the  turnaround or transformation models may be working on small, discrete  projects and may require less provider-specific reviews than contractors  in schools implementing the restart model.", "We agree with Education that the need for performance reviews should  be dependent on the specific role of the contractor, and we modified our  recommendation to address some of Education\u2019s concerns. Specifically,  Education may wish to create a dollar threshold above which  performance reviews are required. We continue to believe, however, that  the current monitoring framework is inadequate. As noted in our report,  schools implementing the turnaround and transformation models account  for the overwhelming majority of SIG schools, and contractors operating  in these schools are performing a range of functions, including some that  are large or complex. In our view, there is a need for additional steps to  ensure adequate review of contractor performance. Furthermore, our  work shows that as a practical matter, states varied in their approaches to  contractor review, with some imposing no requirements on districts.  Education says that it will clarify in existing guidance the requirement for  SIG recipients to follow state and local procurement procedures.
