In a June 1999 report, we estimated that nearly 75,000 of the approximately 221,000 cases reported to LSC by 5 of its largest grantees were questionable. In light of these findings, we were asked to determine (1) what efforts LSC and its grantees have made to correct case reporting problems, and (2) whether these efforts are likely to resolve the case reporting problems that occurred in 1997.

LSC regulations require that grantees (1) adopt a form and procedure to obtain eligibility information and (2) preserve that information for audit by LSC. With respect to citizenship/alien eligibility, only citizens and certain categories of aliens are eligible for services. For clients who are provided services in person, a citizen attestation form or documentation of eligible alien status is required.

We conducted a file review of a random sample of cases at each of these grantees to determine the extent to which they made overreporting errors in reporting cases closed during 1997 and cases open on December 31, 1997. We found similar types of reporting errors to those the OIG found and estimated that, overall, about 75,000 (+/- 6,100) of the approximately 221,000 cases that the five grantees reported to LSC for 1997 were questionable. Three grantees identified about 30,000 of their cases as misreported prior to our case file review.

The two changes pertained to timely closing of cases and management review of case service reports. The remaining new provisions of the 1999 CSR Handbook were not applicable to 1998 cases.

Grantees were to verify that the case file contained a notation of the type of assistance provided, the date on which the assistance was provided, and the name of the case handler providing the assistance. Grantees were also to determine whether assistance had ceased prior to January 1, 1998; was within certain service categories as defined by the 1999 handbook; was provided by an attorney or paralegal; and was not prohibited or restricted.

However, LSC placed some programs on the certified list if the program\u2019s overall error rate for closed cases was 5 percent or less, even if the overall error rate actually was higher than 5 percent. In two instances, executive directors told us that they did not certify their CSR data because their overall error rate exceeded 5 percent. However, these programs appeared on LSC\u2019s list of certified programs.

In response to our inquiry, the official reviewed the certification letters submitted by nearly 200 grantees, and identified 5 certified programs whose error rates for open cases exceeded 5 percent.
