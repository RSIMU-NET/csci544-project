GAO reviewed DOD furlough guidance, interviewed officials, and conducted visits at selected sites that were selected to represent different categories of furlough exceptions and potential sequestration impacts, among other things."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In January 2013, the Department of Defense (DOD) instructed components to plan for the possibility of up to a 22-day administrative furlough of civilian personnel. On May 14, 2013, the Secretary of Defense issued a memorandum directing up to an 11-day furlough of most of DOD's civilians, and on August 6, 2013, reduced the number of furlough days to 6, resulting in a cost savings of about $1 billion from civilian pay, excluding implementation costs. DOD officials stated the decision to reduce the number of furlough days was due to DOD gaining greater flexibility from fund transfers and reprogrammings that occurred towards the end of the fiscal year. DOD identified categories of furlough exceptions for personnel including those assigned to a combat zone and those necessary to protect safety of life and property. Clarifying guidance was issued to help ensure that borrowed military personnel were not used to compensate for work resulting from the furlough, and to prohibit contracted support from being assigned or permitted to perform additional work or duties to compensate for workload or productivity loss resulting from the furlough. Ultimately, DOD furloughed 624,404 civilians and excepted 142,602 civilians for 6 days.", "DOD developed its initial estimated cost savings for the furlough without excluding pay for those excepted from the furlough and did not update its estimate throughout the furlough period as more information became available, such as real-time cost savings and when subsequent decisions were made to reduce the number of furlough days. The initial estimated cost savings were calculated at $300 per person per furlough day, totaling about $2.1 billion for 11 furlough days. When DOD reduced the furlough from 11 to 6 days, the estimated cost savings were reduced by about $900 million. However, the estimated savings per person per day was not updated to reflect actual payroll reductions, in part because, according to DOD officials, there was only 1 week's worth of payroll data available at the time the decision was made. While officials stated that the estimated savings per person per day was not updated because they thought it was sufficient for their purposes and that the decision to reduce the number of furlough days was primarily based on funding received from transfers and reprogramming actions, the determination of exceptions was made 3 months earlier. If this initial estimate had been updated it may have provided more-comprehensive information for DOD officials to consider regarding the length of the furlough and DOD's cost-savings estimate. As DOD continues to face budgetary uncertainty, and in the event of a future furlough, having comprehensive and updated cost information may help better inform decision makers.", "Officials at selected sites GAO visited noted a number of actions taken to prepare for the furlough and described impacts of the furlough, such as decline in morale, mission delays, and inconsistencies and clarification issues with the furlough guidance. However, attributing these impacts directly to the furlough is difficult given other factors, such as a civilian hiring freeze and pay freeze that may also have contributed to declining morale. For example, satisfaction with the organization had declined from 63 percent in 2010 to 55 percent in 2013. Furthermore, a longer term impact may result from DOD civilians filing over 32,000 appeals related to the administrative furlough in 2013, most of which have not yet been resolved."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD update and utilize its furlough cost-savings information as it becomes available in the event that it decides to implement another administrative furlough in the future.

The civilians who were excepted may  have had higher salaries or lower salaries; thus, these exceptions may  have affected the average per day savings. Further the per person per  day cost savings effects the total estimated savings.

Army  Medical Command initially withheld civilian pay from the medical  facility to account for the estimated cost of furloughing staff for 22  days and later returned the funds to Brooke Army Medical Center as  the length of the furlough was reduced.", "The following are examples of impacts reported by officials at the  locations we visited that they believe can be linked to the implementation  of the furlough:", "Decline in Morale\u2014Officials at all three sites stated that civilian  morale declined due to the civilian workforce furlough that resulted in  a 20 percent reduction in pay per week for 6 weeks. This was further  exacerbated as some civilians were excepted from furlough while  other civilian colleagues were not, contracted support staff continued  working, and some civilians who were historically deemed \u201cmission  essential\u201d and required to report to the office for events, such as snow  days, were now furloughed. For example, officials at Norfolk Naval  Shipyard reported civilians furloughed within the supporting  commands experienced frustration and a decline in morale as their  civilian colleagues working in the shipyard were not only excepted but  were also working overtime during the furlough period. Officials at  Brooke Army Medical Center described a decline in morale within the  Army inpatient nursing staff because the Air Force excepted its  inpatient nursing staff from furlough while the Army did not.some officials at Brooke Army Medical Center indicated that the  furlough affected some patients who tried to get refills on their  medication prior to the furlough out of fear that they would not have  access to care during the furlough period. In addition, officials at Air  Mobility Command described a decline in morale among civilian staff  who had to take a pay cut while contracted support staff did not.  Further, officials at Air Mobility Command described instances where  some civilians historically considered \u201cmission essential,\u201d such as air  traffic controllers and firefighters, were now furloughed.", "Officials at the sites we visited stated that they followed the Secretary of  Defense\u2019s guidance and did not use borrowed military personnel to  compensate for work that would have been conducted by furloughed  civilians. Some officials stated that servicemembers experienced a  decline in morale as they worked longer hours to complete their missions  in the absence of civilians who were furloughed. For example, at Brooke  Army Medical Center, officials stated that they relied on their military  medical staff to work during the furlough. Officials stated that their use of  military personnel only extended to those personnel who were assigned  to their unit and that they did not borrow personnel from other units. While  the term \u201cborrowed military personnel\u201d is not defined in Assistant  Secretary of Defense for Readiness and Force Management\u2019s June 2013  memorandum, the Army\u2019s definition of \u201cborrowed military personnel\u201d only  includes certain uses of military personnel outside of the unit to which  they are assigned.", "In December 2013, DOD reported to Congress that the results of OPM\u2019s  recent annual Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey showed its civilian  workforce morale had continued to decline, and that DOD expected the  furloughs to affect employee recruiting and retention in the future. Of  note, the survey showed a decline in satisfaction among DOD  respondents to questions that dealt with job satisfaction (decline from 71  percent in 2010 to 64 percent in 2013), pay (decline from 65 percent in  2010 to 53 percent in 2013), and satisfaction with the organization  (decline from 63 percent in 2010 to 55 percent in 2013). DOD identified  several examples of efforts it was taking to minimize any negative impact  on the morale of the civilian workforce and long-term consequences on  recruiting and retention of the civilian workforce. Most of these actions  were high-level, such as continuing to focus on the Strategic Workforce  Plan and conducting leadership development programs for entry, mid-,  and senior-level personnel. Other examples of actions DOD noted it was  taking to address morale included initiating an enterprise strategic  recruitment effort and the development of a new performance appraisal  system. However, the letter does not provide specifics about these  actions. For example, it does not address how the Strategic Workforce  Plan would minimize the negative impact on morale of the civilian  workforce. The letter also does not provide time frames for when these  actions will be completed.", "Attrition as a Result of the Furlough: Officials at Brooke Army Medical  Center and Norfolk Naval Shipyard stated a number of examples  where employees left as a result of the furlough. For example, some  officials at Brooke Army Medical Center we interviewed stated that  they knew of colleagues who left the hospital to work at the  Department of Veterans Affairs since it did not furlough its staff. In  August 2013, the Army Surgeon General made a statement that,  during 2013, 2,700 Army civilian medical doctors, nurses, and other  health workers left their jobs for work elsewhere due to the furlough,  many transferring to the Department of Veterans Affairs. We  examined the attrition rate of civilian personnel at Army Medical  Command and DOD between fiscal years 2009 and 2013.  Specifically, for the Army Medical Command, we found that attrition  rates for on-board civilian medical officers and nurses peaked at 22  percent in fiscal year 2011. For more information on Army Medical  Command and DOD component attrition rates, see appendix III.", "Mission Delays\u2014While none of the selected sites we visited indicated  mission failure as a result of the furlough, some officials described  increased challenges in meeting their missions.", "Defense Logistics Agency, Maritime support command, officials  from the Norfolk Naval Shipyard stated that, during the furloughs,  they experienced an increased backlog in providing goods and  services in support of shipyard operations. Specifically, the  Defense Logistics Agency, Maritime support command, reported  that the backlog of requests to provide goods and services nearly  doubled during the furlough period, from 330 outstanding requests  on July 3, 2013, to a peak of 614 outstanding requests on July 29,  2013, before dropping down to 465 outstanding requests by  August 13, 2013, as the furlough drew to an end for most civilians.", "Norfolk Navy Shipyard officials stated that a building had a fire  alarm malfunction on a Friday during the furlough period and,  because civilian staff were furloughed, no one was able to fix it  until the following Tuesday, so the building had to establish a 24- hour watch over the weekend to ensure a potential fire could be  reported.", "Air Mobility Command officials described delays in permanent  changes of station because the furlough occurred in summer\u2014the  peak season for such moves. These officials explained that delays  in permanent changes of station can impact a military  servicemember\u2019s ability to report to his or her next installation on  time.", "Guidance Challenges\u2014Some officials stated that they were confused  by the guidance that was provided on implementing the furlough,  while others expressed frustration at the volume of updates to the  guidance. For example, at Brooke Army Medical Center, the Air Force  had not yet transitioned its civilians to Army control through the Base  Realignment and Closure process, and therefore Army and Air  Force civilians were operating under separate guidance during the  furlough. This added to the administrative burden of management at  Brooke Army Medical Center and confusion among staff who work  side-by-side. Specifically, Air Force staff decided to except all of their  in-patient nurses from furlough, while the Army furloughed its in- patient nurses. Further, officials at Brooke Army Medical Center and  Air Mobility Command stated that they received numerous updates to  the furlough guidance, often on a daily basis and from multiple  sources. Officials expressed confusion and sought clarification over  the terms used in the furlough guidance, such as \u201cborrowed military  personnel,\u201d \u201cmission essential,\u201d and \u201c24-hour emergency care.\u201d For  example, the term \u201cborrowed military personnel\u201d was not defined in  the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Readiness and Force  Management\u2019s June 2013 memorandum regarding the use of  borrowed military personnel during the furlough.", "Longer Term Impact from DOD Civilian Appeals Filed to Merit  Systems Protection Board\u2014DOD federal civilians filed 32,259  appeals regarding the administrative furlough to the Merit Systems  Protection Board. Once DOD began implementing the furlough on  July 8, 2013, DOD civilians were then eligible to file appeals of the  furlough action to the Merit Systems Protection Board. Figure 1  illustrates the process for filing and adjudicating appeals with the Merit  Systems Protection Board and the status of the DOD civilians\u2019  appeals to the administrative furlough as of March 31, 2014.", "All of the 1,101 cases that have been adjudicated to date have been  decided in DOD\u2019s favor, though the Merit Systems Protection Board has  received 8 petitions for review from DOD civilians who have chosen to  appeal the Administrative Judge\u2019s decision in their case. According to the  Merit Systems Protection Board, their current workload is unprecedented,  as they received over 32,000 furlough appeals from DOD employees  alone in 2013\u2014approximately 5 times the number of personnel appeals  they typically receive in 1 year. As a result, the Merit Systems Protection  Board is unable to predict how long it will take to adjudicate all of the  DOD furlough appeals, but the Merit Systems Protection Board has  committed to issuing initial decisions in all furlough appeals by the end of  fiscal year 2015."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["In light of ongoing fiscal uncertainty, and given the toll that furlough  actions can have on mission needs and employee morale, among other  things, it is important that DOD accurately estimate financial actions that  affect its personnel and update these estimates to ensure the most timely  and reliable information is available for effective planning. This includes  taking actions aligned with Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government, such as identifying, capturing, and distributing information to  the right people in sufficient detail and at the appropriate time to maintain  its relevance and value to management in controlling operations and  making effective and efficient decisions. DOD\u2019s approach to furloughing  did not adjust to accommodate decisions made to except certain civilian  employees from furlough. Further, because DOD only had 1 week\u2019s worth  of civilian payroll data at the time it reduced the number of furlough days,  it did not track cost savings in real time. Such information could be  considered during any future administrative furlough deliberations to  enable DOD leadership to make informed decisions by having reliable  and accurate cost-savings information as it becomes available. In light of  the current fiscal environment, it is even more critical for DOD to  accurately identify its current and future total workforce priorities and  associated costs. While DOD was able to mitigate the furlough as a result  of transfer and reprogramming actions, DOD may face future furloughs  where it may be limited in how much funding is available to transfer and  reprogram and the length of a potential furlough period may be longer,  thus having comprehensive, up-to-date information for decision makers  would be important."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help ensure that DOD is better informed in its decision-making  processes, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Under  Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) and the Under Secretary of Defense  for Personnel and Readiness to utilize comprehensive and up-to-date  furlough cost-savings information as it becomes available in the event  that DOD decides to implement another administrative furlough in the  future."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DOD for review and comment. In its  written comments, DOD partially concurred with the recommendation to  utilize comprehensive and up-to-date furlough cost-savings information as  it becomes available in the event that DOD decides to implement another  administrative furlough in the future. DOD\u2019s comments are summarized  below and reprinted in appendix IV.", "In its written comments, DOD did not elaborate on why it partially  concurred with the recommendation. DOD stated that it had several  concerns with the findings in the report. The department stated that  important contextual information regarding the size of the total force was  not included in the draft report and elaborated on reasons for growth in  the civilian workforce after the events of September 11, 2001. DOD stated  that without context, readers may believe that the DOD civilian workforce  is not thoughtfully and purposefully sized. However, we disagree with  DOD\u2019s characterization of the draft report. The draft report states that  DOD\u2019s civilian personnel are critical to achieving the department\u2019s  missions by performing a wide variety of duties, and the report  acknowledges that civilians have expanded their responsibilities. Further,  the focus of this report was not on DOD\u2019s total workforce management  but how DOD planned for, implemented, and monitored furloughs of its  civilian workforce to include any challenges the department faced in its  implementation and cost savings realized.  Nonetheless, we have  conducted assessments of DOD\u2019s strategic workforce plans since 2008,  and our body of work has found that DOD\u2019s efforts to address strategic  workforce planning requirements, including assessing the appropriate mix  of civilians, military and contractor personnel, have been mixed. For  example, in our most recent report in September 2012, on the  department\u2019s overall civilian strategic workforce plan, we recommended  that DOD take a number of actions, including providing guidance for  developing future strategic workforce plans that clearly directs the  functional communities to collect information that identifies not only the  number or percentage of personnel in its military, civilian, and contractor  workforces, but also the capabilities of the appropriate mix of those three  workforces. DOD either concurred or partially concurred with our  recommendations, stating that, among other things, the department was  deliberate in applying lessons learned from previous workforce plans and  identifying specific challenges and the actions being taken to address  those challenges to meet statutory planning requirements by 2015. Our  review on DOD\u2019s latest strategic workforce plan will be issued in July  2014.", "Although DOD did not specifically state in its letter why it partially  concurred with the recommendation, DOD provided comments related to  the recommendation, and we have addressed them throughout the report  as appropriate. However, we disagree with two of DOD\u2019s specific  comments as discussed below:", "DOD commented that we should delete the report\u2019s discussion  regarding DOD being placed on our High Risk List because of  financial management weaknesses that affect its ability to control  costs; ensure accountability; anticipate future costs and claims on  the budget; detect fraud, waste, and abuse; and prepare auditable  financial statements. DOD stated in its comments that this  paragraph \u201cis unrelated to this report on administrative furloughs.\u201d", "We disagree. We believe that having accurate financial  information is not only related but very important to the report on  administrative furloughs. Specifically, DOD made the  determination to furlough civilians in response to budgetary  shortfalls, which was part of a larger effort to achieve specific  funding reductions resulting from sequestration. This decision  affected its approximately 770,000 civilian workers \u2013 which  included 642,404 civilians being furloughed for 6 days and  142,602 civilians being excepted. We believe that when making  decisions with the goal of reaching a financial target that  negatively affects so many people\u2014including a 20 percent  reduction in pay for 6 weeks\u2014DOD\u2019s ability to accurately account  for spending or assets is an important factor related to this report.  Further, in DOD\u2019s comments, it states that it could not track cost  savings in real time due to system and process limitations. We  believe that this further illustrates the relevance of having  accurate, complete, and timely financial information available to  make management decisions.", "DOD commented that we misrepresented information regarding  DOD\u2019s cost savings estimates and recommended alternative  language for the report. Specifically, DOD stated that it excluded  employees categorized as exempt from the cost savings estimate  of $2.1 billion provided to Congress as well as the known  exceptions as part of the per day cost projection developed using  March payroll data. Similarly, DOD commented that the report  misrepresented information provided during various meetings. We  disagree.", "We disagree with DOD\u2019s characterization of our report. Our report  accurately reflects information included in DOD\u2019s documents  related to how it calculated its estimated furlough savings and  associated documentation it provided to Congress. As we stated  in the report, DOD calculated a cost estimated savings of $300  per person per day and used this estimate in discussions including  the initial decision to furlough until it decided to reduce the number  of furlough days from 11 to 6 days even though additional  information was available regarding which civilians DOD  excepted, as the exceptions decision was made 3 months earlier.  However, DOD did not initially include or update the estimated  savings per person per day of $300 to account for the 142,602  civilians that were excepted from the furlough. These civilians  excepted from the furlough represent approximately 18 percent of  the total civilian workforce.savings as a result of the civilian workforce furlough, DOD  multiplied the estimated number of civilians to be furloughed by  the estimated savings of $300 per person per day. While DOD did  adjust the numbers of civilians it included in its calculated cost  savings, it never adjusted the per person per day estimate of $300  to account for the 18 percent of the civilian workforce excepted  from the furlough. Further, as we state in the report, should DOD  need to furlough civilians in the future, the incorporation of  information as it becomes available would better inform decision  makers because actions taken regarding DOD\u2019s civilian workforce  affects approximately 770,000 civilians.", "To calculate the estimated cost  We are sending copies of this report to other interested congressional  parties; the Secretary of Defense; the Secretaries of the U.S. Army, the  U.S. Navy, and the U.S. Air Force; and, the Commandant of the U.S.", "Marine Corps.

We obtained and analyzed guidance and policy documents  outlining the furlough decision and subsequent reduction in the number of  administrative furlough days. The guidance and policy documentation  included the numbers of civilians furloughed, the categorical exceptions  granted, and the numbers of civilians provided exceptions. In addition, we  examined guidance outlining the decisions directly related to the decision  to implement a furlough as well as guidance imposing limitations on  utilizing other personnel within the department to augment the civilian  workforce during the furlough.

These sites were selected on the basis of the Secretary of  Defense memorandum outlining categories of exceptions to the furlough,  DOD statements about potential sequestration impacts, and mission- critical occupations as outlined in DOD\u2019s Strategic Workforce Plan. We  developed a standard set of interview questions to use in discussions with  officials at selected sites regarding what policy and guidance was  generated and how the furlough was implemented, such as information  about employee furlough notification and scheduling of furlough days,  among other things.

We analyzed agency- level EHRI-SDM data for all DOD departments (Army, Navy, Air Force,  and other DOD agencies). We focused on career permanent employees  in our analysis of on-board and separation trends because these  employees represent the long-term employee population and constitute  most of the workforce. To calculate attrition rates, we added the number  of career permanent employees with personnel actions indicating they  had separated from one of the DOD departments (for example, transfers,  resignations, retirements, terminations, and deaths) and divided that by  the 2-year on-board average. We assessed the reliability of the EHRI  data through electronic testing to identify logical inconsistencies, and  followed up with DOD, where necessary, to understand these issues. We  also reviewed our prior work assessing the reliability of these data. On the  basis of this assessment, we believe the EHRI data we used are  sufficiently reliable for the purpose of this report.
