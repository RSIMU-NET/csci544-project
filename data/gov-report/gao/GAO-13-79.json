According to a DHS official who leads DHS's CVE efforts, identifying topics has helped to provide a logical structure for DHS's CVE-related training efforts. According to DOJ officials, even though they have not specifically identified what topics should be covered in CVE-related training, they understand internally which of the department's training is CVE-related and contributes either directly or indirectly to the department's training responsibilities under the CVE national strategy. However, over the course of this review, the department generally relied upon the framework GAO developed for potential CVE-related training topics to determine which of its existing training was CVE-related. Further, because DOJ has not identified CVE-related training topics, DOJ components have had challenges in determining the extent to which their training efforts contribute to DOJ's responsibilities under the CVE national strategy. In addition, officials who participated in an interagency working group focusing on ensuring CVE-related training quality stated that the group found it challenging to catalogue federal CVE-related training because agencies' views differed as to what CVE-related training includes.", "The majority of state and local participant feedback on training that DHS or DOJ provided or funded and that GAO identified as CVE-related was positive or neutral, but a minority of participants raised concerns about biased, inaccurate, or offensive material. DHS and DOJ collected feedback from 8,424 state and local participants in CVE-related training during fiscal years 2010 and 2011, and 77--less than 1 percent--provided comments that expressed such concerns. According to DHS and DOJ officials, agencies used the feedback to make changes where appropriate. DOJ's Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and other components generally solicit feedback for more formal, curriculum-based training, but the FBI does not require this for activities such as presentations by guest speakers because the FBI does not consider this to be training. Similarly, DOJ's United States Attorneys' Offices (USAO) do not require feedback on presentations and similar efforts. Nevertheless, FBI field offices and USAOs covered about 39 percent (approximately 9,900) of all participants in DOJ CVE-related training during fiscal years 2010 and 2011 through these less formal methods, yet only 4 of 21 FBI field offices and 15 of 39 USAOs chose to solicit feedback on such methods. GAO has previously reported that agencies need to develop systematic evaluation processes in order to obtain accurate information about the benefits of their training. Soliciting feedback for less formal efforts on a more consistent basis could help these agencies ensure their quality.", "DOJ and DHS have undertaken reviews and developed guidance to help improve the quality of CVE-related training. For example, in September 2011, the DOJ Deputy Attorney General directed all DOJ components and USAOs to review all of their training materials, including those related to CVE, to ensure they are consistent with DOJ standards. In addition, in October 2011, DHS issued guidance that covers best practices for CVE-related training and informs recipients of DHS grants who use the funding for training involving CVE on how to ensure high-quality training. Since the departments' reviews and efforts to implement the guidance they have developed are relatively new, it is too soon to determine their effectiveness."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOJ identify and communicate principal CVE-related training topics and that FBI field offices and USAOs consider soliciting feedback more consistently. DOJ agreed that it should more consistently solicit feedback, but disagreed that it should identify CVE training topics because DOJ does not have primary responsibility for CVE-related training, among other things. GAO believes this recommendation remains valid as discussed further in this report."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["State and local law enforcement and homeland security officials, in  partnership with local community members, are the first line of defense  against the evolving threat posed by violent extremism\u2014ideologically  motivated violence to further political goals. In recent history, the United  States has faced violent extremist plots by neo-Nazis and other anti- Semitic hate groups, racial supremacists, and international and domestic  terrorist groups. These events included the 2009 shooting at Fort Hood in  Texas, the 2010 attempted bombing at Times Square in New York City,  and the 2011 attempt by a white supremacist to injure participants of a  Martin Luther King, Jr., Day parade with an explosive device in the state  of Washington. Since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, al Qaeda  and its affiliates and adherents, as well as other extremists, have inspired  or directed an expanded range of plots and attacks in the United States.  For example, the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and  Responses to Terrorism, using open sources, developed a database with  information on 210 violent Islamic extremists known to have radicalized in  North America from 1989 through 2011 to the point of supporting  violence. Of these individuals, 80 percent began their radicalization after  the events of September 11, 2001, and the subsequent Global War on  Terrorism. The United States government identifies al Qaeda as the  preeminent terrorist threat to the country, and the Executive Office of the  President has emphasized that the prevalence of particular violent  extremist ideologies changes over time and new threats will undoubtedly  arise in the future. Accordingly, the United States government must  ensure that its approach to countering violent extremism (CVE) is flexible  enough to address a variety of current and possible future threats,  whether they are posed by al Qaeda or other groups.", "Given the critical role state and local law enforcement officers play in  CVE, it is important that they receive high-quality CVE-related training.  The Departments of Homeland Security (DHS) and Justice (DOJ) have  responsibility for executing several programs and activities related to  CVE, some of which include providing or funding CVE-related training for  state and local law enforcement officers or community members who  partner with law enforcement. However, some community members and  advocacy organizations have raised concerns about the quality of CVE- related training, including training that DHS and DOJ provide or fund. In  particular, letters that individuals and advocacy organizations submitted to  DHS and DOJ have indicated anecdotally that some of the individuals  who provide training to state and local law enforcement agencies and  community members misunderstand the ideology of violent Islamist  extremism and cast aspersions on the vast majority of Muslim Americans  who pose no threat to the United States. According to the implementation  plan for Empowering Local Partners to Prevent Violent Extremism in the  United States (CVE national strategy), the instances of federally  sponsored or funded CVE and counterterrorism training that used  offensive and inaccurate information underscored a need to improve  CVE-related training and develop standards for such training. Further,  according to the CVE national strategy, misinformation about the threat  and dynamics of radicalization to violence can harm security by sending  local stakeholders in the wrong direction and unnecessarily creating  tensions with potential community partners.", "You requested that we assess DHS and DOJ efforts to ensure the quality  of violent extremism training that the departments provide or fund for  state and local partners. Specifically, we addressed the following  questions:", "To what extent have DHS and DOJ identified and communicated  topics that CVE-related training addresses to their components and  state and local partners?", "What, if any, concerns have been raised by state and local partners  who have participated in CVE-related training provided or funded by  DHS and DOJ?", "What actions, if any, have DHS and DOJ taken to improve the quality  of CVE-related training?", "This report is a public version of the prior sensitive report that we  provided to you. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) determined  that some of the information in the prior report was For Official Use Only  and Law Enforcement Sensitive, which must be protected from public  disclosure. Therefore, this report omits sensitive information about CVE- related training that the FBI provided, including associated costs, and the  results of a review that the FBI undertook to assess the quality of its  counterterrorism training materials, some of which included CVE-related  content. Although the information provided in this report is more limited in  scope, it addresses the same questions as the sensitive report. Also, the  overall methodology used for both reports is the same.", "To address our objectives, we met with DHS and DOJ officials to  determine how the departments define and communicate CVE-related  training topics, and which departmental training programs were relevant  to our review. We analyzed this information to assess the extent to which  the departments\u2019 efforts allow them to demonstrate fulfillment of their  CVE-related training responsibilities under the CVE national strategy.  During these initial interviews, DHS and DOJ officials expressed difficulty  in responding to our request for CVE-related training materials, in part  because agency officials were not clear on which training should be  considered CVE-related. Therefore, for the purposes of this review, we  developed a framework for what constitutes CVE-related training. This  framework identifies three distinct content areas CVE-related training  likely addresses: (1) radicalization, (2) cultural competency, and (3)  community engagement. We discuss these content areas in greater detail  later in this report. We solicited feedback on this framework from DHS  and DOJ. DHS officials generally agreed with the content areas we  identified, and we incorporated feedback DHS provided, as appropriate.  DOJ officials stated that they view the framework as reasonable for the  purpose of our review. We focused generally on training provided in fiscal  years 2010 and 2011 because \u201ccountering violent extremism\u201d is a  relatively nascent term. In addition, we focused on training provided to  state and local entities because the CVE national strategy identifies CVE- related training for these entities as a major component of the national  CVE approach.", "For the purpose of this review, we considered training to include  instruction, presentations, or briefings. We asked DHS and DOJ  components to identify CVE-related offices and programs that would be  appropriate to include in the scope of our review utilizing the framework  for CVE-related training that we developed. We also asked DHS and DOJ  to identify and provide all materials for any training that DHS and DOJ  provided or funded through grant programs for state and local entities,  including law enforcement officers and community members, that  agencies assumed to be CVE-related based on our framework. We  considered the training to be CVE-related if all or a portion of it addressed  one or more of the three content areas. For training that we determined  was CVE-related, we requested information on the approximate number  and type of participants that attended each training and the estimated  cost of providing the training. In addition, in July 2012, GAO conducted a  web-based survey of training points of contact within 51 state  administrative agencies regarding the clarity of guidance DHS provides to  recipients of grant funds that can be used for CVE-related training. Of  the 51 state administrative agencies to which we sent a survey, 30  responded for an overall response rate of 59 percent. On the basis of a  comparison of the geographic regions and state populations of state  administrative agencies that did and did not respond to our survey, we  concluded that the experiences of state administrative agencies from  some of the larger states may not be captured in our survey results.  Nevertheless, the survey results provide insight into the level of clarity  about DHS CVE guidance among grantees.", "To obtain participant perspectives about CVE-related training, two  analysts independently reviewed 8,424 evaluations completed by  participants of six DHS and DOJ training programs that were CVE-related  according to our framework to identify and categorize any complaints or  concerns about this training. To identify complaints or concerns that were  submitted to the agencies outside of course evaluations, we asked DHS  and DOJ to identify concerns that were submitted to them in writing,  conducted keyword searches of LexisNexis and Google, and interviewed  representatives, including leaders, of advocacy groups that raised the  concerns we identified through our searches. We also interviewed DHS  and DOJ officials who oversee these training programs to obtain their  perspectives on any concerns or complaints that were raised about the  CVE-related training and to learn about any actions agencies took in  response to these incidents.", "To address what actions DHS and DOJ have taken to improve the overall  quality of CVE-related training, we reviewed relevant documents,  including recently released guidance and best practices for training that  DHS, DOJ, and the FBI developed. We also analyzed the  counterterrorism training materials that were CVE-related according to  our framework that the FBI determined were inappropriate as a result of  its internal review, which the FBI undertook to identify and purge  potentially objectionable training materials. This analysis enabled us to  better understand the review results with regard to training materials that  were CVE-related according to our framework, and provided context for  the quality assurance steps the FBI has taken in response to the review.  The FBI considers the methodology it used to conduct its internal review  and our analysis of the training materials that the FBI considered  objectionable to be For Official Use Only; therefore, we did not include  that information in this report.  In addition, we interviewed DHS and DOJ  officials and inquired about guidance agencies adhere to when vetting or  reviewing training materials and instructors, as well as other actions they  have taken to ensure CVE-related training quality. Appendix I contains  additional details on our scope and methodology.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2011 through October  2012 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

More recently, in August 2011, the White House issued the  nation\u2019s first CVE strategy, Empowering Local Partners to Prevent Violent  Extremism in the United States, and in December 2011, it issued an  implementation plan for the CVE national strategy. The strategy  leverages existing programs and structures in order to counter  radicalization that leads to violence, rather than creating new programs  and funding streams. The strategy highlights three major areas of  activity: (1) enhancing engagement with and support to local communities  that violent extremists may target, (2) building government and law  enforcement expertise for preventing violent extremism, and (3)  countering violent extremist propaganda while promoting U.S. ideals. The  strategy also identifies the provision of training to federal, state, and local  entities as a major component of the national CVE approach, and the  implementation plan notes that the federal government will enhance CVE- related training offered to federal, state, and local agencies. The  implementation plan states that this is necessary because of \u201ca small  number of instances of federally-sponsored or funded CVE and  counterterrorism training that used offensive and inaccurate information.\u201d  Accordingly, one of the objectives of the implementation plan is to  improve the development and use of standardized training with rigorous  curricula that imparts information about violent extremism, improves  cultural competency, and conveys best practices and lessons for effective  community engagement and partnerships.", "The implementation plan designates federal departments, agencies, and  components as leaders and partners regarding certain aspects of CVE,  and DHS and DOJ have principal roles in implementing the CVE national  strategy.

In order for DHS and DOJ components to determine the extent  to which they are fulfilling departmental CVE-related responsibilities, they  must be able to identify which of the training they conduct is CVE-related,  which requires that they understand what constitutes CVE-related  training. The DHS Counterterrorism Working Group, the entity  responsible for leading DHS\u2019s CVE efforts under the direction of the  Principal Deputy Counterterrorism Coordinator, has identified topics to be  addressed in CVE-related training that DHS develops, provides, or funds.  The group has also undertaken efforts to communicate these topics to  other DHS components, state and local law enforcement officials, and  grant recipients who may allocate DHS funding for CVE-related training  within their states. DHS\u2019s communication efforts have helped DHS  components and state and local partners to better understand what  constitutes CVE-related training, but some DHS grantees who responded  to our survey reported that they were not clear as to what topics should  be addressed in CVE-related training, and most indicated that it would be  helpful for DHS to provide additional information or guidance on topics  covered under CVE.

The council established the  HSAC CVE Working Group to carry out this tasking, and the working  group issued its findings in summer 2010. The HSAC CVE Working  Group determined that CVE-related training should focus on (1) improving  the capacity of law enforcement and other government personnel to  communicate and collaborate with individuals from diverse religious,  ethnic, and racial communities, and (2) promoting understanding of the  threats facing a local community and recognizing behavior and indicators  associated with those threats. The DHS Counterterrorism Working Group  subsequently determined that, in order to support implementation of the  CVE national strategy and the HSAC CVE Working Group findings, CVE- related training should address the following: violent extremism (e.g., the  threat it poses), cultural demystification (e.g., education on culture and  religion), community partnerships (e.g., how to build them), and  community policing efforts (e.g., how to apply community policing efforts  to CVE). According to the DHS Principal Deputy Counterterrorism  Coordinator, identifying these topics helped to provide a logical structure  for DHS\u2019s CVE-related training\u2013related efforts.", "The Counterterrorism Working Group has undertaken efforts to  communicate these topics to DHS components that contribute to DHS  CVE-related training. Toward the beginning of our review officials from  DHS components that contributed to training in fiscal years 2010 and  2011 that was CVE-related according to our framework cited lack of  clarity regarding what topics CVE-related training is to address; however,  by August 2012, the components reported that the topics were clear, a  fact that they attributed to these communications efforts. The  Counterterrorism Working Group communicated CVE-related training  topics to relevant DHS components during weekly meetings as well as by  involving the components in the development of new CVE-related  training. For example, the Counterterrorism Working Group has invited  relevant components to participate in workshops on CVE-related training,  provided them with briefings and updates on its CVE-related training  development efforts, and included them in review of draft CVE curricula.  According to Counterterrorism Working Group officials, the group led a  series of meetings with these components to communicate and review  the content of multiple CVE-related trainings the group is working to  develop. According to officials from relevant DHS components, these  communication efforts have helped to clarify topics CVE-related training  addresses. For example, according to the official that leads CVE-related  training that the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties provides,  reviewing the CVE curricula under development involves ensuring that  training topics are clear and well understood. In addition, according to the  S&T official who oversees research on CVE that is to inform CVE-related  training content, DHS officials have clearly communicated topics that  CVE-related training is to include during weekly meetings that the  Counterterrorism Working Group leads involving all DHS CVE Working  Group members.", "The Counterterrorism Working Group also communicated with state and  local partners and associations that DHS collaborates with to achieve  national CVE goals regarding DHS\u2019s CVE-related training topics. For  example, according to the director of a state police academy and a police  department lieutenant, the Counterterrorism Working Group has  consistently consulted with them in developing training modules  addressing CVE topics. The Counterterrorism Working Group is also  collaborating to develop and implement CVE-related training curricula  with the Major Cities Chiefs Association (MCC), the National Consortium  for Advanced Policing (NCAP), and the International Association of Chiefs  of Police (IACP).

According to officials  from FEMA, which administers DHS grant funding, the agency has  increased grant funding available for CVE-related training because the  Secretary of Homeland Security has identified CVE efforts as a priority for  the department. In particular, in fiscal year 2011, FEMA began to allow  state and local entities to use funds awarded through the Homeland  Security Grant Program for CVE-related training. Further, in fiscal year  2012, FEMA explicitly stated in its Homeland Security Grant Program  funding announcement that grantees could use program funds for CVE- related training, and retroactively allowed recipients to use program funds  from prior years for CVE activities. In July 2012, we surveyed the 51  training points of contact within state administrative agencies\u2014which are  responsible for managing Homeland Security Grant Program funds that  DHS awards\u2014about the extent to which they understand what is meant  by CVE training. Of the 30 training points of contact who responded to our  survey, 11 indicated that they were not at all clear or were somewhat  clear on what is meant by CVE-related training. Further, 26 agreed or  strongly agreed that it would be helpful for DHS to provide additional  information or guidance on topics covered under CVE. As long as FEMA  continues to make grant funding available for CVE-related training, but  grantees do not have an understanding of what topics CVE-related  training should address, it will be difficult for grantees to determine what  training best supports the national CVE objective of improving CVE- related training and use funds appropriately toward those efforts.", "DHS Counterterrorism Working Group officials stated that the group had  made efforts to communicate CVE-related training topics to state  administrative agencies, but in light of our survey results, the group plans  to expand its efforts. In winter 2011, the Principal Deputy  Counterterrorism Coordinator, who leads DHS CVE efforts, participated in  a conference call with State Homeland Security Program advisers and  staff who administer DHS grants that can be used for CVE-related  training, during which this official highlighted DHS\u2019s CVE-related training  efforts and associated guidance. Nonetheless, according to the Principal  Deputy Counterterrorism Coordinator, some training points of contact  may not be aware of what topics CVE-related training should address  because the working group\u2019s coordination efforts have focused on state  and local representatives who administer law enforcement training  programs (e.g., at police academies), not state administrative agencies.  The Principal Deputy Counterterrorism Coordinator also emphasized that  DHS has focused its efforts on developing high-quality CVE-related  training that state and local entities can readily access and that FEMA will  pre approve as eligible for DHS grant funding. As a result, according to  this official, grantees will rarely have to independently identify appropriate  CVE-related training to fund or undertake steps to ensure the quality of  CVE-related training they fund.", "Nevertheless, the Principal Deputy Counterterrorism Coordinator agreed  that our survey results revealed that it is important for DHS to undertake  additional efforts to educate state administrative agency officials on the  principal topics CVE-related training addresses. To that end, in August  2012, the Principal Deputy Counterterrorism Coordinator held an  additional meeting with more than 100 state administrative agency  representatives and other federal, state, and local officials, during which  the Coordinator provided information on DHS CVE-related training  development efforts and the content of DHS\u2019s CVE-related training,  among other things. In addition, in August 2012, DHS, in partnership with  the FBI, launched an online portal for a select group of law enforcement  training partners that is intended to provide federal, state, local, tribal,  territorial, and correctional law enforcement with access to CVE-related  training materials. DHS aims to broaden access to the portal to trainers  nationwide by the end of September 2012. Further, the Principal Deputy  Counterterrorism Coordinator stated that the Counterterrorism Working  Group is developing an outreach strategy for communicating with state  and local entities about DHS\u2019s CVE-related training efforts. Given the  recency of these efforts, we are not able to assess their effectiveness as  part of our review.

This group, which is chaired by DHS  and NCTC, was formed at the direction of the President\u2019s National  Security Staff to identify and coordinate CVE-related training that federal  agencies deliver or fund. The group\u2019s principal objective was twofold: (1)  to determine how agencies are currently developing training and (2) to  identify options for ensuring that the Intelligence Community\u2019s current  analysis of radicalization informs training for federal, state, local, and  tribal officials, and that customers of this type of training receive high- quality training and information consistent with U.S. government  analysis. As part of this effort, the Interagency Policy Committee  Working Group on Law Enforcement Training Regarding Domestic  Radicalization and CVE endeavored to create an inventory of CVE- related training that the federal government offers. However, according to  DHS officials that participated in the working group, members who led this  effort found it challenging to do so because agencies\u2019 views differed as to  what CVE-related training includes when providing information on their  training. More specifically, according to one DHS official, some  components found it difficult to differentiate between counterterrorism and  CVE-related training, and trying to categorize training that was not  developed for CVE purposes but that can benefit CVE can be confusing.  We observed this problem firsthand during our review when the DOJ  components that the department identified as potentially relevant to our  work, including the FBI, Executive Office for United States Attorneys, and  Office of Community Oriented Policing Services could not readily respond  to our requests for information about CVE-related training they provide or  fund.

Figure 1 presents the DOJ and DHS programs that provided  the CVE-related training we identified, and appendix III provides more  detailed information about the training, including the number of  participants and associated costs.", "The majority of participant feedback on CVE-related training that DHS  and DOJ provided or funded during fiscal years 2010 and 2011 was  positive or neutral; a minority of participants expressed concerns about  information included in course materials or that instructors presented.  DHS and DOJ collected and retained feedback forms from 8,424 of the  more than 28,000 participants\u2014including state, local, and tribal law  enforcement officials, prison officials, and community members\u2014of  training they provided or funded in fiscal years 2010 and 2011 that was  CVE-related according to our framework. We analyzed all of these  evaluations and found that the vast majority of participants submitted  comments about the training that were positive or neutral. For example,  participants commented that the courses were among the most  challenging they had taken, that the instructors were professional and  knowledgeable, or that the course materials were well assembled. In  addition, participants stated that the training was informative with regard  to the threat posed by, and how to best counter, violent extremists or  provided a valuable overview of an extremist group. In another instance,  a participant stated that the course was helpful in understanding the  beliefs and concerns of a particular community. Some participants also  said that the training would be worthwhile to provide to a broader  audience, that they intended to share what they learned with colleagues,  or that they would like to see the course length expanded. We also  identified 77 participant evaluations\u2014less than 1 percent\u2014that included  comments that expressed concern of any sort. For example, we identified  concerns that a training was too politically correct, as well as concerns  that a training was one-sided, with regard to issues of religion and culture.  The concerns the participants expressed fell into the following three  categories:  1.  The course information or instruction was politically or culturally  biased (54 evaluations). For example, participant comments that fell  into this category were that the instructor had a liberal bias, and other  comments were that the instructor too often relayed his or her  personal views.  2.  The course information or instruction was offensive (12 evaluations).", "For example, one concern raised in this category was that an  instructor presented Islam in a negative manner, whereas another  concern was that a guest presenter spoke disrespectfully about the  United States.  3.  The course information was inaccurate (11 evaluations). For example,  comments that fell into this category raised concern that an instructor  provided misinformation about dressing norms for Middle Eastern  women and that an instructor cited incorrect information about a  criminal case discussed during the class.", "The concerns that were raised varied across different training providers  and, although few, most of the concerns stemmed from the evaluation  records documenting feedback from DOJ SLATT Program and FBI  National Joint Terrorism Task Force Program participants. See appendix  IV for additional details on the types of concerns by training provider.", "DOJ and DHS officials who oversee these training programs indicated  that they review the feedback participants provide and assess if it  warrants action. However, these officials stated that determining how to  respond to feedback can be difficult when the feedback is subjective or  not actionable. For example, the SLATT Program Director stated that if a  comment simply says \u201cone-sided information,\u201d he cannot take action on it  because he does not know which side the person is referring to or what  the person thinks should be changed. However, if there is a trend in clear  feedback participants provided, he will take action. Further, according to  SLATT and Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties officials, perceptions  regarding what is biased vary by audience and even by the participants  within a given audience. Therefore, DHS and DOJ officials stated that  they take action to address participant feedback on a case-by-case basis,  as they and their staff deem appropriate. For example, the SLATT  Director explained that there is no specific threshold to determine whether  a participant\u2019s comment warrants further action, but generally, if a similar  concern has been submitted by multiple participants, over multiple  courses, SLATT officials will review the substance of the comment and  devise a plan to correct the issue. For example, the SLATT Director noted  that in response to a comment that a course title did not reflect the  material taught in the course, he suggested a change to the title."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "More Consistently Soliciting Feedback on Informal CVE-Related Training Could Provide Information to Help Ensure Its Quality", "paragraphs": ["Most of the CVE-related training that DHS and DOJ components provided  was formal, classroom-based or curriculum-based training, and the  components generally solicited participant feedback for this type of  training, which we describe above.

However, these components did not consistently solicit participant  feedback for this type of training, which makes it difficult for them to  assess the quality of the training, determine whether the training is  achieving expected outcomes, and make changes where appropriate.", "According to FBI officials, training that the FBI centrally administers\u2014 including that provided under the National Academy and National Joint  Terrorism Task Force programs\u2014is to adhere to the Kirkpatrick model to  help ensure its quality. The standards this model prescribes require the  solicitation of student feedback. As a result, the FBI collects feedback  through evaluations on the formal, classroom-based courses it provides  through its National Academy. The FBI does not require entities providing  informal training, such as briefings and presentations during outreach, to  solicit feedback. Specifically, officials from the FBI\u2019s Office of Public  Affairs told us that the bureau does not solicit feedback on presentations,  briefings, or its Citizens\u2019 Academy and Community Relations Executive  Seminar Training (CREST) outreach programs because doing so is not  required, and the officials noted that the FBI does not classify these  programs and activities as training. Officials also noted that some field  offices, which administer the programs, do solicit feedback from  participants although they are not required to do so. For example, 4 of 21  FBI field offices that provided Citizens\u2019 Academy training that was CVE- related according to our framework collected evaluations. However, none  of the 3 FBI field offices that provided CREST training or the 5 FBI field  offices that provided other training that was CVE-related according to our  framework solicited feedback from course participants. Similarly, USAOs  are not required to obtain feedback from recipients of training that their  individual offices provide. According to Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys  officials, USAOs do not typically solicit feedback from participants on the  presentations that our framework identified as CVE-related that they  provide in their districts, particularly with respect to threat-related briefings  for law enforcement officials that are intended to address a particular area  of concern for that region at a particular time. Under these circumstances,  according to these officials, feedback may be less useful than it would be  for curriculum-based trainings, because the presentation is less likely to  be repeated for many different audiences. We identified 39 USAOs that  provided or facilitated training that was CVE-related according to our  framework, excluding training that was facilitated by a USAO, but  provided by another federal entity (such as SLATT).

Soliciting feedback on informal training could help the FBI and  USAOs obtain valuable information for determining the extent to which  these programs are yielding desired outcomes (e.g., whether the FBI\u2019s  Citizens\u2019 Academy is projecting a positive image of the FBI in the  communities it serves) as well as complying with the CVE national  strategy. Such feedback could also be obtained without incurring  significant costs. According to officials at a FBI field office that distributes  feedback forms and the DHS official who oversees the Office for Civil  Rights and Civil Liberties CVE-related training, agencies can solicit  feedback from training participants at minimal cost (e.g., the paper on  which the form is distributed and the employee time associated with  reviewing the forms), feedback is critical to ensure the training is  communicating its intended messages effectively, and soliciting feedback  is a worthwhile undertaking given the significant time and resources their  offices invest in providing CVE-related training."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Individuals and Advocacy Organizations Have Raised Some Concerns about CVE- Related Training", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the concerns we identified in participant evaluations,  individuals and advocacy organizations submitted at least six letters of  complaint to DHS, DOJ, the Executive Office of the President, and other  federal government entities regarding 18 alleged incidents of biased CVE  and counterterrorism training that DHS or DOJ provided or funded during  fiscal years 2010 and 2011. Representatives of the advocacy  organizations that submitted the letters generally did not participate in the  training that generated these concerns. Rather, their concerns were  derived from information reported in the media and individuals who  attended a training session and expressed concern about the training to  the organizations.

To this end, its goals are to help ensure that (1) trainers are  experts and well regarded; (2) training is sensitive to constitutional values;  (3) training facilitates further dialogue and learning; (4) training adheres to  government standards and efforts; and (5) training and objectives are  appropriately tailored, focused, and supported. The guidance provides  best practices for federal, state, and local officials organizing CVE,  cultural awareness, or counterterrorism training to adhere to in support of  these goals. Best practices include reviewing a prospective trainer\u2019s  r\u00e9sum\u00e9; reviewing the training program to ensure that it uses examples to  demonstrate that terrorists and violent extremists vary in ethnicity, race,  gender, and religion; and reaching out to sponsors of existing government  training efforts for input.", "The DHS CVE guidance states that training must be  Following the release of DHS\u2019s CVE Guidance, FEMA issued an  information bulletin to its state, local, and private sector partners and  grantees to emphasize the importance of ensuring that all CVE-related  training is consistent with DHS and U.S. government policy.referenced the DHS CVE Guidance and stated, among other things, that  grant-funded training should avoid the use of hostile, stereotypical, or  factually inaccurate information about Muslims and Islam or any  community.

According to FEMA officials, if a grantee were to provide CVE- related training and not follow the DHS CVE guidance, DHS may require  that the grantee repay any grant funds that were spent on the training.  However, several DHS grantees indicated that they would not necessarily  know when to apply the best practices for ensuring the quality of CVE- related training described in the informational bulletin. Specifically, of the  30 Homeland Security Grant Program training points of contact who  responded to our survey, 18 said that they were not at all clear or only  somewhat clear about when to apply the principles in the FEMA bulletin.  In addition, 20 said that topics that may be covered during CVE-related  training are not at all clear or only somewhat clear in the bulletin. As a  result, these grantees could have difficulty in determining when to apply  the principles. As previously discussed, the additional efforts DHS is  undertaking to educate state administrative agency officials on the  principal topics CVE-related training addresses could further enable the  officials to fund training that supports the CVE national strategy. These  survey results indicate that such educational efforts should help grantees  more readily identify topics that may be covered during CVE-related  training, and thus more appropriately apply DHS CVE-related training  quality assurance guidance.", "DHS is also developing additional mechanisms to ensure the quality of  CVE-related training. Specifically, Counterterrorism Working Group  officials told us that in June 2012 DHS established a CVE-related training  Working Group within the department to develop a framework to (1)  ensure that training DHS components provide meets DHS and the U.S.  government\u2019s CVE standards; (2) ensure that grantees using grant funds  for training utilize certified trainers; and (3) disseminate DHS training  through agency partners, such as the International Association of Chiefs  of Police. In July 2012, this working group proposed recommendations for  meeting these goals in a memorandum to the DHS Deputy  Counterterrorism Coordinator. For example, the group recommended that  the department establish and maintain a database of certified CVE  instructors and appoint a CVE program coordinator to oversee the  instructor vetting and training process.

We focused generally on training  provided in fiscal years 2010 and 2011 because \u201ccountering violent  extremism\u201d is a relatively nascent term. In addition, we focused on  training provided to state and local entities because the CVE national  strategy emphasizes the importance of providing CVE-related training to  these entities. While the FBI identified its National Academy as providing  training that could be considered CVE-related, it did not identify any of its  other programs as germane to our review. However, complaint letters  raised concerns about FBI training that was CVE-related according to our  framework that was provided through two other FBI programs\u2014 the  Citizens\u2019 Academy and the National Joint Terrorism Task Force. We  assessed some of the training provided through these programs and  determined the training to be CVE-related according to our framework. In  addition, the FBI\u2019s internal review of counterterrorism training, which  included the FBI programs within the scope of our review, assessed the  training materials against criteria for CVE-related training, thereby  suggesting that these programs may have provided training that was  CVE-related. Accordingly, we requested course materials on these  programs, as well as the Community Relations Executive Seminar  Training Program, which is an abbreviated version of the Citizens\u2019  Academy.", "We received approximately 290 presentations, briefings, and course  materials from two components within DHS and four within DOJ. In some  cases, DHS and DOJ offices provided us only with course abstracts or  agendas instead of the full presentations or course materials because (1)  they contracted the training with an outside provider and did not retain all  of the associated training materials or (2) the training materials were  particularly voluminous and, on the basis of discussions with the offices,  we agreed that the course abstracts or agendas would enable us to  sufficiently determine the relevancy of the training to our review. In those  cases, we determined CVE-relevancy based on the agenda or abstract  alone. We reviewed these training materials to assess whether each of  the individual courses, presentations, briefings, and other training-related  activities undertaken or funded by DHS and DOJ agencies addressed  one or more of the three content areas described above. If they  addressed any of these content areas, we considered them CVE-related,  even if the primary focus of the materials was not CVE-related. To ensure  consistency in our analysis, two analysts independently reviewed the  materials for each training and recorded their assessment of whether the  training addressed each content area. Any discrepancies in the initial  determinations were then discussed and reconciled."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Identifying Concerns about CVE-Related Training", "paragraphs": ["To determine what concerns, if any, participants raised about CVE- related training, we reviewed course evaluations completed by  participants of CVE-related training offered by DHS I&A, DHS Office for  Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, DOJ BJA, and the FBI, and identified  complaints or concerns about CVE-related training made formally in  writing. We limited our analysis to training that was provided or funded by  DHS or DOJ during fiscal years 2010 or 2011 and provided to a state or  local entity (e.g., police department, community group, or fusion center).  Two analysts independently reviewed 8,424 course evaluations from six  training programs to consistently determine which ones included  concerns or complaints. The analysts also assessed the nature of the  concerns and complaints and assigned each complaint to one of three  categories: (1) politically or culturally biased, (2) offensive, or (3)  inaccurate. Where there were discrepancies between the analysts, they  were resolved through supervisory review.", "To identify formally submitted or documented complaints or concerns  participants expressed, we asked DHS and DOJ to identify those  submitted in writing to DHS or DOJ, or articulated to DHS or DOJ through  other means but subsequently documented by the agency, from fiscal  years 2010 through 2011. We also conducted keyword searches using  LexisNexis and Google to identify concerns that were raised by either  individuals or advocacy groups that were submitted in writing to DHS or  DOJ. In addition, we interviewed representatives, including leaders, of  select advocacy groups that raised concerns about CVE-related training  to identify what concerns and complaints, if any, they submitted in writing  to DHS or DOJ on behalf of training participants. The advocacy and civil  liberties organizations we interviewed included the American Civil  Liberties Union, the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, the  Council on American Islamic Relations, and the Muslim Public Affairs  Council. We selected these organizations based on their leadership in  raising concerns we identified (e.g., by virtue of being the primary  signatories) and upon the recommendation of other advocacy groups.  These interviews also enabled us to confirm or obtain additional views on  the formally documented complaints DHS or DOJ provided. Through  these approaches, we identified a total of six letters of complaint  regarding 18 alleged incidents of biased CVE and counterterrorism  training that DHS or DOJ provided or funded during fiscal years 2010 and  2011. Given that the scope of this review is limited to CVE-related training  provided to state and local officials and community members, and not  training that is exclusively provided to federal officials, we determined that  7 of the alleged incidents described in five of the letters were relevant to  this review. We also interviewed relevant DHS and DOJ officials to obtain  their perspectives on the concerns raised in the written complaints and  information on any actions agencies took in response to these incidents."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Identifying DHS and DOJ Efforts to Improve the Quality of CVE-Related Training", "paragraphs": ["To address what actions, if any, DHS and DOJ have taken overall to  improve the quality of CVE-related training, we interviewed DHS and DOJ  officials responsible for providing or funding CVE-related training to  inquire about any current or pending guidance, whether documented or  undocumented, they adhere to when vetting training materials and  instructors and other actions they have taken to ensure the quality of  CVE-related training. We reviewed relevant DHS and DOJ documents  including recently released guidance and best practices for training that  DHS, DOJ, and the FBI developed. We also analyzed FBI and DOJ data  from training reviews and information on how DHS and DOJ review and  vet training curricula and instructors. Specifically, we analyzed the  counterterrorism training materials that the FBI determined were  inappropriate as a result of its internal review, which the FBI undertook to  identify and purge potentially objectionable training materials. This  analysis enabled us to better understand the review results with regard to  training materials that were CVE-related under our framework, and  provided context for the quality assurance steps FBI has taken in  response to the review. To focus our analysis on training materials  included in the FBI\u2019s review that were CVE-related, one analyst assessed  which of these training materials were CVE-related, according to our  framework, and if the materials were CVE-related, the analyst entered the  FBI\u2019s observations and additional data about that training into a data  collection form. A second analyst then reviewed these results. When  there was disagreement, the two reviewers discussed the material,  reached agreement, and modified the entries as necessary to ensure  concurrence regarding which of the training materials included in the  FBI\u2019s review were germane to our review. The FBI considers the  methodology it used to conduct its internal review and our analysis of the  training materials that the FBI considered objectionable to be For Official  Use Only; therefore, we did not include that information in this report.", "In addition, we conducted a site visit in San Diego, California, in January  2012, where DHS hosted a pilot of a CVE-related course under  development. During the site visit, we observed the pilot training, and  interviewed DHS officials who were sponsoring the training and local  agencies that had developed and delivered the course curriculum. On the  basis of the information we collected, we evaluated DHS\u2019s adherence to  its own CVE-related training guidance.

DHS\u2019s Principal  Deputy Counterterrorism Coordinator, who heads the department\u2019s CVE  efforts, has testified that developing CVE-related training is a priority for  the department because inappropriate or inaccurate training undermines  community partnerships and negatively affects efforts of law enforcement  to identify legitimate behaviors and indicators of violent extremism. DHS  has determined that CVE-related training should address: violent  extremism (e.g., the threat it poses), cultural demystification (e.g.,  education on culture and religion), community partnerships (e.g., how to  build them), and community policing efforts (e.g., how to apply community  policing efforts to CVE). Accordingly, the DHS Counterterrorism Working  Group, which is overseen by the Principal Deputy Counterterrorism  Coordinator, is developing training that addresses these topics. These  trainings include the following:", "A continuing education CVE curriculum for frontline and executive  state and local law enforcement that DHS is developing with the Los  Angeles Police Department, Major Cities Chiefs Association (MCC),  and the National Consortium for Advanced Policing (NCAP). DHS hosted a first pilot for this course in San Diego, California, in January  2012 that 45 state and local law enforcement officials attended. The  pilot consisted of 3 days of classroom instruction and student  participation activities. According to Counterterrorism Working Group  officials, DHS held a second pilot in the National Capital Region in  July 2012, and a third pilot in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in August 2012.  In July 2012, DHS also presented the curriculum at a CVE conference  it hosted in Washington, D.C., and according to Counterterrorism  Working Group officials, the department is working to enhance the  curriculum based on feedback that conference attendees provided.  MCC has passed a motion to adopt the curriculum, which DHS aims  to implement in collaboration with state and local partners in 2013.", "CVE-related training modules for state police academies, which DHS  is developing in collaboration with the International Association of  Chiefs of Police (IACP). These training modules will be 1 to 2 hours  in length, and are intended for police recruits. DHS plans for police  academies to introduce the modules into their training and to make  them available online for police recruits by the end of 2012.", "A CVE awareness training for correctional facility, probation, and  patrol officers at the state and local levels that DHS is working to  develop in collaboration with the Bureau of Prisons, the FBI National  Joint Terrorism Task Force, and the Interagency Threat Assessment  Coordination Group.

According to FBI officials, the FBI established a CVE office in  January 2012, and as of August 2012, had assigned staff to the office and  was in the process of developing CVE-related training modules. In  particular, the CVE Office developed and presented a CVE-related  training module to FBI public affairs specialists and community outreach  coordinators and specialists in FBI field offices from April through August,  2012, according to FBI officials.

That is, DOJ  and DHS components provided training, including courses, briefings,  presentations, and workshops, that addressed one or more of the three  CVE-related training topical areas we identified: (1) the phenomenon of  violent extremism and the threat posed by radicalization that leads to  violence; (2) cultural competency and how to distinguish between criminal  and constitutionally protected cultural and religious behaviors; and (3)  how to build effective community partnerships to, among other things,  mitigate threats posed by violent extremism. The majority of these  trainings did not have the term \u201cCVE\u201d in their titles, a fact that DOJ and  DHS officials attributed to CVE being a relatively new concept, or that the  trainings had been developed for purposes other than CVE. Nonetheless,  they provided some instruction on at least one of the three CVE-related  training topics we identified, and thus are considered CVE-related for the  purpose of this review. Although the CVE-related trainings that DOJ and  DHS provided collectively addressed all three CVE-related training topics,  the trainings more frequently addressed the phenomenon of violent  extremism and cultural competency than community engagement. The  specific topics addressed by each training DOJ and DHS components  provided during fiscal years 2010 and 2011 are described in the tables  that follow.

CRS works with communities to help address  tension associated with allegations of discrimination on the basis of race,  color, or national origin. CRS also works with communities to develop  strategies to prevent and respond more effectively to alleged violent hate  crimes on the basis of race, color, national origin, gender, gender identity,  sexual orientation, religion, or disability. According to CRS officials,  through its work preventing hate crimes, CRS helps develop relationships  among Arab, Muslim, and Sikh communities who may be targeted for  hate violence by violent extremists, including supremacists, and other  community members, as well as local government and law enforcement  officials. As a result, CRS does not conduct activities or programs with the  express goal of CVE, but recognizes that its ability to help promote  dialogue and develop strong relationships to create a sense of inclusion  in communities may have ancillary CVE benefits in preventing violent  extremism.", "Within DHS, the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Institute and I&A  provided CVE-related training to approximately 3,410 state and local  intelligence and law enforcement officials during fiscal years 2010 and  2011.
