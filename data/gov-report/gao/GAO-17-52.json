GAO was asked to update that study. This report examines (1) the extent that VA medical centers complied with requirements related to the environment of care for women veterans and VHA's oversight of that compliance; (2) what is known about the availability of VHA medical providers who can provide sex-specific care for women veterans at VA facilities; and (3) VHA's efforts to provide and monitor access to sex-specific care for women veterans through Choice. To do this work, GAO reviewed VHA data on environment of care deficiencies; the number, location, and availability of VHA and Choice medical providers; women veteran enrollment; and Choice access-related performance measures. In addition, GAO inspected the environment of care for compliance with VHA policy at a nongeneralizable sample of six VA medical centers, which were selected to achieve variation in different care models, the size of the women veterans' population, and geographical locations. GAO also interviewed VHA Central Office and VA medical center officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not have accurate and complete data on the extent to which its medical centers comply with environment of care standards for women veterans. VHA policy requires its medical facilities, including VA medical centers, to meet environment of care standards related to the privacy, safety, and dignity of women veterans. VHA Central Office relies on medical centers to conduct regular inspections and to report instances of noncompliance, which are compiled in a VHA database. However, almost all the noncompliance GAO identified through inspections at six VA medical centers it visited had not been reported or recorded in the VHA database, and compliance rates ranged from 65 percent to 81 percent. For example, GAO found a lack of auditory privacy at check-in clerk stations and a lack of privacy curtains in examination rooms, as required by VHA policy. GAO also found weaknesses in VHA's oversight of the environment of care for women, including a lack of thorough inspections and limited verification of facility-reported data which results in inaccurate and incomplete data. As a result, the privacy, safety, and dignity of women veterans may not be guaranteed when they receive care at VA facilities. Federal internal control standards for monitoring call for management to establish activities to monitor the quality of performance over time and promptly resolve any identified issues.", "GAO's analysis of VHA data shows that nationally the number of VHA full-time-employee equivalent gynecologists and the number of women's health primary care providers\u2014VHA primary care providers specially trained in women's health care services, such as breast exams\u2014increased by 3 percent and 15 percent respectively, from fiscal year 2014 through fiscal year 2015, and those percentages exceeded the 1 percent growth in women veteran enrollment during the same period. However, about 27 percent of VA medical centers and health care systems lacked an onsite gynecologist and about 18 percent of VA facilities providing primary care lacked a women's health primary care provider, according to VHA data. VHA officials said not all facilities require onsite gynecologists and facilities may authorize gynecological services from non-VA providers. They acknowledged a shortage of at least 675 women's health primary care providers and have a plan to train at least 535 providers by the end of fiscal year 2016.", "The Veterans Choice Program (Choice) is a primary option for veterans to receive care from non-VA providers in the community if care cannot be provided at VA facilities. While the number of obstetricians and gynecologists under Choice has increased, some areas lack these providers, according to a VHA analysis. While VHA monitors access-related Choice performance measures (such as timely appointment scheduling) for all veterans, it does not have such measures for women veterans' sex-specific care, such as mammography, maternity care, or gynecology. VHA's data show poor performance on access-related performance measures for all veterans, and GAO found cases where women veterans' maternity care was significantly delayed, suggesting that veterans, including women, face challenges receiving timely access to care.

Women veterans seeking care through VA\u2019s national  health care system, which is operated by the Veterans Health  Administration (VHA), are eligible to receive a full range of health care  services\u2014including services specific to their sex, such as breast  examinations, cervical cancer screenings and treatment, and obstetric  care. When these and other services are not available at VA medical  facilities\u2014including health care systems, VA medical centers (VAMC),  and community-based outpatient clinics\u2014or within required driving  distances or time frames, VA may purchase care from non-VA providers  through its care in the community programs, such as the Veterans Choice  Program (Choice).", "Given the growth in the number of women veterans, in 2010 we examined  the availability of VHA health care services for women. We found  variation in the types of sex-specific health care services available to  women veterans at VA medical facilities. We also found that none of the  19 VA medical facilities we visited were in compliance with VHA\u2019s policies  that govern the environment of care for women veterans. These VHA  policies require all VA medical facilities to adhere to certain standards  intended to ensure women\u2019s privacy, safety, and dignity when they  receive care. The standards relate to, for example, ensuring auditory  privacy at check-in and in interview areas, the location of exam rooms,  and the presence of privacy curtains in exam and inpatient rooms.", "In our 2010 report, we recommended that VA take several steps to  strengthen VHA\u2019s provision and oversight of services for women  veterans. VA agreed with our recommendations and has made progress  in addressing issues raised. For example, VHA introduced a policy in  2010 requiring that all women veterans treated at VA medical facilities  have access to a primary care provider specially trained in women\u2019s  health care services, known as a women\u2019s health primary care provider.  However, there are still concerns that VHA may not be fully meeting the  health care needs of women veterans. For example, a Congressional  hearing in April 2015 raised concerns about gaps in the services available  for women veterans in VA medical facilities. In addition, we and others  have expressed significant concerns about VHA\u2019s management of its  health care system, including VHA\u2019s ability to effectively provide timely  access to health care for veterans. In 2014, a series of events called into  question the ability of veterans to gain timely access to care from VHA  medical facilities. As a result of these and other systemic problems, we  concluded that VA health care is a high-risk area and added it to our High  Risk List in 2015.", "We were asked to follow-up on our 2010 report and assess VA\u2019s progress  in providing a full range of health care services for women veterans.

We selected VAMCs located in Baltimore and Perry Point,  Maryland; Gainesville and Lake City, Florida; Cincinnati, Ohio; and  Cheyenne, Wyoming. We chose these sites to represent different  models of care for women veterans, diverse regions of the country, urban  and rural locations, and a range in the percentage of the state population  made up by women veterans. For these selected VAMCs, we  conducted site visits to inspect the environment of care in waiting areas  as well as in procedure and examination areas across various outpatient,  inpatient, and residential treatment units where women veterans can  receive health care services. We developed a standardized data  collection instrument containing the VHA environment of care  requirements we reviewed during our inspections to determine whether  each requirement in every applicable setting was in compliance. The  findings of our site visits cannot be generalized to other VAMCs. To  examine VHA\u2019s oversight of medical facilities\u2019 compliance with  requirements related to the environment of care for women veterans, we  reviewed VHA policies on the environment of care rounds process and  related internal inspections. We also reviewed the findings from  contracted evaluations of women\u2019s health programs at VA medical  facilities. Finally, we interviewed officials from the VHA administrative  office that oversees compliance in the environment of care at VA medical  facilities and from the selected VAMCs about VHA oversight and the  implementation of environment of care policies. We examined this  evidence in the context of federal internal control standards for monitoring  and control environment.", "To examine what is known about the availability of VHA medical providers  who can provide sex-specific care for women veterans, we analyzed  available VHA data on the number, location, and the availability of  women\u2019s health primary care providers and gynecologists in fiscal years  2014 and 2015. We also reviewed VHA data on women veteran  enrollment and the number of completed VA women\u2019s health and  gynecology appointments for fiscal years 2014 and 2015. We assessed  the reliability of the data sources by reviewing relevant documentation,  interviewing knowledgeable agency officials, or reviewing the data for  missing values and outliers. Through these steps, we determined that the  data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this reporting objective.

We also reviewed the results of a 2016 VHA  study analyzing the number and location of Choice obstetricians and  gynecologists in Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN) 10 and 19  as of May 2016 and the VA medical facilities where gynecology is  available in those VISNs. For these two VISNs, we compared the  reported number and location of Choice obstetricians and gynecologists  in May 2016 with the number of non-VA community providers that VA  medical facilities in these VISNs sent women veterans to for obstetrics or  gynecology services in fiscal year 2014, prior to the introduction of Choice  in November 2014. We focused on VISNs 10 and 19 because, as a part  of this study, we conducted site visits to VAMCs in these VISNs, located  in Cincinnati, Ohio and Cheyenne, Wyoming. In addition, these VISNs  allow for comparisons of urban and rural areas. We also reviewed VHA  data on women veteran enrollment in 2014 and 2016 and third-party  administrator (TPA) performance data on Choice access to care and  network adequacy from August 2015 through May 2016. In addition, for  illustrative purposes, we identified three examples of sex-specific care  obtained by women veterans under Choice from a review of veteran  medical records associated with an ongoing GAO study examining the  implementation of Choice.

Thirty-nine of 145 VAMCs or VA health  care systems in fiscal year 2015 (about 27 percent) did not have an  onsite gynecologist. VHA Central Office officials said that, based on  workload, not all VA medical facilities need an onsite gynecologist, and  women veterans may receive necessary gynecological services through a  care in the community program.", "At facilities where onsite gynecology was available, the number of VHA  gynecologists available to treat women veterans varied. In fiscal year  2015, the number of full-time equivalent gynecologists (for VAMCs or VA  health care systems that had them) ranged from 3.18 (Gainesville,  Florida) to 0.02 (Dayton, Ohio), which corresponds to less than 1 hour per  week. VA data also show that the number of completed gynecology  appointments increased across VA, from about 81,000 in fiscal year 2014  to about 85,000 in fiscal year 2015\u2014an increase of about 5 percent. The  increase in completed gynecology appointments suggests a greater  overall utilization of gynecology services in VA medical facilities.

Specifically, in fiscal year 2014, there were  2,130 providers, and in fiscal year 2015, there were 2,439 providers.  The increase in providers significantly outpaced the increase in women  veteran enrollment (1 percent) during the same time period. In addition,  VHA data show that the number of completed women\u2019s health  appointments increased across VHA, from about 304,000 in fiscal year  2014 to about 331,000 in fiscal year 2015\u2014an increase of about 9  percent.", "VHA data show that a women\u2019s health primary care provider was  available to see veterans about 31 clinical hours per week, on average, at  the end of fiscal year 2015. However, that availability included any  clinical time women\u2019s health primary care providers spent seeing male  veterans. Because women\u2019s health primary care providers see both  men and women, according to VHA, it is highly likely that a typical  women\u2019s health primary care provider was available for less than 31  hours per week to see women veterans. When VHA adjusted clinical  availability data by the proportion of women veterans seen for primary  care at each VA medical facility, the data show that a women\u2019s health  primary care provider\u2019s availability was estimated at about 6 hours per  week, on average, at the end of fiscal year 2015. Fiscal year 2015 was  the first year for which VHA collected and validated data on the clinical  availability of women\u2019s health primary care providers, and according to  VHA officials, the data are considered preliminary and not yet robust  enough to compare with the demand for services.", "Despite the increase in providers nationally, VHA data show that 17  percent of VA community-based outpatient clinics that provide primary  care and 3 percent of VAMCs or VA health care systems lacked a  women\u2019s health primary care provider at the end of fiscal year 2015.  Specifically, 151 out of 881 outpatient clinics that provide primary care  and 4 out of 155 VAMCs lacked a women\u2019s health primary care provider  at the end of fiscal year 2015. (See appendix V for more information on  the number of outpatient clinics that provide primary care lacking a  women\u2019s health primary care provider.) At least 1 of the 4 VAMCs lacking  a women\u2019s health primary care provider also lacked an onsite  gynecologist based on VHA fiscal year 2015 data.", "The fact that nearly 18 percent of VAMCs and outpatient clinics providing  primary care lacked a women\u2019s health primary care provider in fiscal year  2015 suggests that VHA may face challenges ensuring that all women  veterans have timely access to these providers, as required under VHA  policy. Specifically, each VA medical facility must ensure that eligible  women veterans have access to comprehensive medical care that is  comparable to care provided to male veterans, and veterans should not  wait more than 30 days from either the date an appointment is deemed  clinically appropriate by a VA provider or, if no such clinical determination  has been made, the date a veteran prefers to be seen for care. A VHA  official told us that if a women\u2019s health primary care provider is not  available at a veteran\u2019s local facility, women veterans can seek sex- specific care at other VA medical facilities, though in these cases women  veterans may face longer wait times and potentially longer driving  distances. Eligible women veterans may also receive care through  Choice or another care in the community program.", "In our interviews with VHA officials, they acknowledged a shortage of  women\u2019s health primary care providers at VA medical facilities. A VHA  official told us that facilities have difficulty recruiting and retaining primary  care providers who are interested and proficient in caring for women  veterans, particularly in rural areas. According to an agency memo, VHA  needs at least 675 additional women\u2019s health primary care providers,  under a guiding principle that each VA medical facility\u2014VAMCs and  community-based outpatient clinics\u2014should have, at a minimum, two  women\u2019s health primary care providers. In addition, according to the  agency memo, VA medical facilities with 2,000 or more women veteran  enrollees should have the equivalent of an additional one full-time  women\u2019s health primary care provider for every 1,000 women veteran  enrollees or fraction thereof. According to the memo, these providers do  not all have to be new hires, but could be drawn from VHA\u2019s existing pool  of primary care providers and trained to provide sex-specific care.  According to VHA, existing providers may participate in a VHA-sponsored  women\u2019s health training to become women\u2019s health primary care  providers, unless providers already possess the necessary training and  experience.", "While VHA has taken steps to hire and train additional women\u2019s health  primary care providers, these efforts have not yet yielded a sufficient  number of such providers. According to VHA, as of August 2016, using  funding from the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of  2014, VHA had hired 45 women\u2019s health-specific providers, including 11  gynecologists, since September 30, 2015. However, due to subsequent  turnover in staff as well as growth in the demand for services, VHA  reported that the number of women\u2019s health primary care providers  needed to meet VHA\u2019s criteria of a minimum of two per VA medical facility  has remained approximately the same. A VHA official told us that the  agency has a plan to train existing VHA providers so that there will be at  least 500 additional women\u2019s health primary care providers in fiscal year  2016. According to VHA documents, 305 providers attended the agency\u2019s  national training program in the spring and summer of 2016, and a VHA  official said an additional 230 providers will be trained by the end of fiscal  year 2016 at nine different VA locations across the country."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "While the Number of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Participating in Choice Networks Has Increased, VHA Does Not Have Performance Measures for Monitoring Access to Sex-Specific Care under Choice", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Obstetricians and Gynecologists Participating in Choice Networks Have Increased Nationally, though Some Geographic Areas Lack These Types of Providers", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis of VHA data show that the number of obstetricians and  gynecologists participating in Choice networks nationally increased  significantly from about 6,200 in May 2015 to 10,100 in May 2016, an  increase of about 64 percent. While the number of obstetricians and  gynecologists increased, some geographic areas lacked these types of  providers, which provided access challenges for women veterans seeking  care. For example, our analysis of VHA data for VISN 19 indicated that as of May 2016,  there were almost 33 percent more community obstetricians and  gynecologists participating in Choice (615) compared to the number of these providers (464) who delivered care to women veterans through  individually authorized care prior to the implementation of Choice in  fiscal year 2014. However, according to a VHA analysis of VISN 19  based on May 2016 data, certain areas within VISN 19 lacked these  providers. (See fig. 3). Specifically, VHA\u2019s analysis found that two  VA medical facilities in Montana offered gynecology services, and  there were no VHA or Choice obstetricians and gynecologists located  north and east of Billings, Montana. Parts of central Utah also  lacked VHA or Choice obstetricians and gynecologists. The Salt Lake  City/Provo/Ogden area was the only area in Utah that offered VHA  gynecology services, and Choice providers were also concentrated in  this area.

One VHA official  responsible for monitoring the TPAs\u2019 performance on Choice contract  requirements told us that the PC3 performance measures specific to sex- specific care were simply overlooked in the haste to implement Choice.  VHA could monitor driving distances for women veterans to receive  mammograms and maternity care services delivered through Choice, as  the TPAs currently collect these data as part of PC3, according to VHA  officials.", "While VHA doesn\u2019t have performance standards for sex-specific care  under Choice, it does have performance standards for all care delivered  through Choice. For example, VHA\u2019s contracts with the two TPAs require  the timely scheduling and completion of appointments, and VHA also  monitors the rates at which the TPAs return Choice authorizations to VHA  medical facilities without appointments.

See table 2 for TPA  average monthly performance under Choice for certain access-related  performance measures.", "If VHA monitored access to sex-specific Choice care for women veterans,  it is possible that delays in care would be identified and actions could be  taken to minimize future occurrence. For example, if VHA were  monitoring sex-specific Choice care, it might have identified the three  cases of delayed maternity care through Choice we found as part of an  ongoing review of 196 Choice authorizations for care (of both men and  women) from early calendar year 2016. In one case, almost a month and  a half elapsed from the time of the veteran\u2019s initial pregnancy confirmation  appointment at VA (when she was 6 weeks pregnant) to when the Choice  authorization was sent by the VA facility to the TPA for scheduling. It then  took two additional weeks for the TPA to attempt to schedule a prenatal  appointment; by that point, she was almost 15 weeks pregnant. At 18  weeks pregnant, she finally scheduled her initial prenatal appointment  herself, almost 3 months after her pregnancy was confirmed at VHA. In  another case, about a week and a half elapsed from the time the  veteran\u2019s Choice authorization was created (when she was 6 to 7 weeks  pregnant) to when the VA facility sent it to the TPA for scheduling. It then  took the TPA nearly a month to reach the veteran and determine if she  wanted to participate in Choice. After the veteran agreed to participate in  Choice, it took more than 2 weeks for the TPA to schedule an  appointment. The veteran was about 14 weeks pregnant by the time her  first appointment was scheduled.", "Federal standards of internal control for monitoring call for management  to establish activities to monitor the quality of performance over time and  promptly resolve the findings of audits and other reviews. VHA does not  currently have performance measures for sex-specific care under Choice.  While VA does monitor access to Choice care for all veterans, the past  performance of TPAs on access-related measures highly suggests that  veterans have problems obtaining timely access to these services as  required under Choice. Since women are more likely to use non-VA care  than male veterans, according to VHA, the lack of timely access to  Choice care may affect women veterans more so than male veterans. In  addition, we found instances where women veterans\u2019 care under Choice  was significantly delayed and we found a lack of participating  obstetricians and gynecologists in some areas, both of which further  underscore the importance of VHA\u2019s ability to monitor access to sex- specific care for women veterans.

This lack of oversight reflects long-standing weaknesses in the  policies and guidance for the environment of care rounds inspections  process, including how data is collected by facility staff and what  information is reported to VHA Central Office. For example, facility staff  do not inspect all applicable areas within the facility and the list of  requirements they inspect does not include all requirements in the VHA  women\u2019s health handbook. In addition, responsibilities for addressing  noncompliance are not clearly delegated, and VHA does not verify the  noncompliance information it receives from its facilities. These  weaknesses are similar to those we identified in our 2010 report, and the  problems have persisted even though VHA agreed with our previous  recommendations to strengthen oversight of its environment of care  standards. These findings further underscore the agency\u2019s continued lack  of adequate oversight and accountability, which resulted in our adding VA  health care to our High Risk List in 2015. If VHA does not strengthen its  environment of care inspections policies, it will remain unable to provide  reasonable assurance that it is protecting the privacy, safety, and dignity  of women veterans who receive care at VA medical facilities.", "Our review also suggests that VHA faces challenges ensuring that  women veterans have access to sex-specific care at its own medical  facilities and through community providers participating in Choice.

To the extent that VA  medical facilities cannot deliver sex-specific services, women veterans  will need to receive these services through Choice or other care in the  community programs.
