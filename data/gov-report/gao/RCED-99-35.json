To accomplish this overall mission, USDA has organized its agencies into seven mission areas: Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services; Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services; Marketing and Regulatory Programs; Food Safety; Natural Resources and Environment; Research, Education, and Economics; and Rural Development.
