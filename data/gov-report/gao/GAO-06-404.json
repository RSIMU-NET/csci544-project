For example,  US-VISIT provided us with 12 agreements for the agencies that we  reviewed, and only one of them described roles and responsibilities for  either APMO or the agency managing the contract work. Although  responsibilities were identified, they were at a high level and the same for  both the program office and the agency managing the contractor.  Specifically, the IAA states that the US-VISIT COTR or point of contact and  the servicing agency program office are responsible for technical oversight  of the specified product or service identified in the statement of work.  However, the IAA does not identify any specific contract oversight  practices to be performed. According to the APMO Director, the program  office did not define roles and responsibilities because the office is  relatively new, and most efforts have been focused on developing policies  and procedures for managing contracts that it directly controls.", "As noted earlier, we have previously reported that the use of IAAs is a  high-risk approach to contracting. Although these contract vehicles can  offer benefits of improved efficiency and timeliness, effective management  of IAAs is challenging. Accordingly, we concluded that the use of IAAs  requires, among other things, that the issuing agency clearly define roles  and responsibilities for conducting contractor management and oversight.", "Knowing the full range of contract work. The program office was not  able to provide us with a complete list of US-VISIT\u2013related contract  actions. Instead, US-VISIT told us that we needed to obtain a list of actions  from each of the DHS and non-DHS agencies that managed the contract  work. Once we compiled the list of contracting actions provided to us by  the other agencies, the Director told us that no one in the program office  could verify that the list was complete and correct. The Director further  stated that APMO is not responsible for overseeing contracts managed  outside the program office.", "Defining and implementing the steps to verify that deliverables  meet requirements. According to DHS\u2019s directive on IAAs, the issuing  agency (US-VISIT, in this case) is to, among other things, monitor the  performance of the servicing agency and/or contractor; the directive also  assigns responsibility for monitoring performance to the program office  (or program point of contact) and the contracting officer. The contracting  officer responsible for US-VISIT\u2019s IAAs told us that he relied on the  program office\u2019s designated points of contact to conduct oversight of  those IAAs. However, the program office did not define any specific  performance monitoring activities. As a result, oversight activities  performed have been informal and inconsistent. For example, on the  AERC contracts, the Facilities and Engineering Budget Officer held  weekly teleconferences with AERC to discuss project progress and  contract issues, and concerns on an exception basis. However, these  meetings were not documented; in other words, any follow-up on open  issues and tracking to closure was handled informally. On the CBP  contract actions, the US-VISIT Deputy Chief Information Officer (or one of  his representatives) attended most, but not all, of the system development- milestone progress reviews related to US-VISIT work, and held ad hoc  discussions with a CBP program manager to discuss funding and work  status. On air/sea exit, the US-VISIT Director of Implementation relied on  weekly meetings with TSA and the contractor to keep apprised of project  status. However, he relied on a representative from US-VISIT Mission  Operations to certify that testing on air/sea exit was completed in a  satisfactory manner, and neither he nor a member of his team reviewed  the results themselves. According to the Director of APMO, specific  activities to monitor contracts managed by other agencies have not been  established because the program office\u2019s efforts to date have focused on  developing policies and procedures for contracts that the program office  manages directly.", "Without clearly defined roles and responsibilities, as well as defined  oversight activities for ensuring successful completion of the work across  all US-VISIT\u2013related contract activities, the program office cannot be  adequately assured that required tasks are being satisfactorily completed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies Managing US-VISIT\u2013 Related Contractors Did Not Establish and Implement Key Contractor Management Practices", "paragraphs": ["As mentioned previously, acquisition management guidance identifies  effective contractor management as a key activity and describes a number  of practices associated with this activity, including (among other things)  establishing policies and procedures for contractor management, defining  responsibilities and authorities, providing training, verifying and accepting  deliverables, and monitoring contractor performance. As mentioned  earlier, these practices often consist of more detailed subpractices;  appendix III provides further details on the practices, subpractices, and  agency performance of these on each of the contract actions we reviewed.", "Table 3 shows the extent to which agencies, in their documented policies  or procedures, require that the critical contractor management practices  be performed (see columns under \u201cpractice established?\u201d); it also shows  (under \u201cpractice implemented?\u201d) the extent to which agencies had actually  implemented such practices for the contracting actions that we reviewed,  regardless of any documented requirement.", "As table 3 shows, agencies\u2019 establishment and implementation of the key  contractor management practices for US-VISIT\u2013related contracts have  been uneven.", "All of the agencies had established policies or procedures for performing  some of the key contractor management practices.

All of the  agencies (DHS and non-DHS) had established polices or procedures for  governing some key contractor management practices. For example,  CBP\u2019s Systems Development Life Cycle, augmented by its Office of  Information Technology Project Manager\u2019s Guidebook, defines policies  and procedures for assigning responsibilities and authorities for key  contracting personnel and training those people responsible for  implementing contractor management activities. Among other things,  these documents provide descriptions of the duties of the contracting  officer, the project manager, and COTR. The documents also require all  affected agencies to train the members of their groups in the objectives,  procedures, and methods for performing contractor management  activities. CBP guidance also addresses contractor management  procedures, including verifying and accepting deliverables, monitoring  contract risk and taking corrective action, and conducting various reviews  with the contractor.", "Other agencies, such as GSA and AERC, have established fewer  procedures for contractor management. For example, GSA had not  established procedures for three practices: (1) establishing and  maintaining a plan for performing contractor oversight, (2) conducting  technical reviews with the contractor, and (3) conducting management  reviews with the contractor. According to GSA officials, they have not  documented their oversight process in order to allow for as much  flexibility as possible in performing the process. Further, they said they  relied on the professional expertise of the contracting officer\u2019s  representative (COR) and/or COTR to ensure the technical accuracy of  work produced by a contractor.", "Without established policies and procedures for contractor management,  the organizations responsible for managing US-VISIT\u2013related contracts  cannot adequately ensure that these vital contractor management  activities are performed.", "Agencies\u2019 Implementation of Key Practices Was Uneven  Implementation of key practices in the contracting actions that we  reviewed was uneven.

For example, CBP relied on a  DHS-mandated training program to train its key contract personnel.  However, that program was not established until March 2004 for  contracting officers and December 2004 for COTRs, and so it did not apply  to all the contracting actions that we reviewed. Before these programs  were established, CBP relied on the previously existing qualifications of its  contracting personnel. However, it provided training documentation for  only some of the key contracting personnel for the contracting actions that  we reviewed.", "With respect to non-DHS agencies, AERC and GSA records showed that  contracting personnel had completed contracting-related training for the  contracting actions that we reviewed.", "Most agencies did not implement all key practices for verifying and  accepting contract deliverables. Verifying that contract deliverables  satisfy specified requirements provides an objective basis to support a  decision to accept the product. Verification depends on the nature of the  deliverable and can occur through various means, such as reviewing a  document or testing software. Effectively verifying and accepting contract  deliverables includes, among other things, (1) defining procedures for  accepting deliverables; (2) conducting deliverable reviews or tests in order  to ensure that the acquired product satisfies requirements;  (3) documenting the results of the acceptance review or test;  (4) establishing an action plan for any deliverables that do not pass the  acceptance review or test; and (5) identifying, documenting, and tracking  action items to closure.", "All agencies implemented some (but not all) of the key practices  associated with verifying and accepting contract deliverables. The  following two examples from CBP and TSA illustrate this.", "CBP implemented most of the subpractices associated with this practice.", "For one contracting action reviewed (software development for Increment  2B functionality), CBP defined acceptance (testing) procedures,  conducted the tests to verify that the deliverables satisfied the  requirements, and documented the results. However, it did not develop an  action plan to identify, document, and track unresolved action items to  closure. Further, CBP accepted the deliverable before verifying that it had  satisfied the requirements. Specifically, test results were presented at a  production readiness review (one of the progress reviews called for in  CBP\u2019s system development life cycle) on November 4, 2004. The review  meeting included a US-VISIT stakeholder representative who signed off on  the test results, indicating that US-VISIT accepted the deliverable and  concurred that it was ready to operate in a production environment.  However, the test analysis report highlighted several issues that called this  conclusion into question. For example, the report stated that testing  continued after the review (through November 8, 2004), and the report  identified 67 issues at severity level 2, which CBP defines as a function  that does not work and whose failure severely impacts or degrades the  system. The report further stated that some test cases were delayed and  subject to further testing. CBP could not provide any documentation that  these open issues were resolved or that the test cases were executed.", "Further, the COTR told us that CBP did not define specific acceptance  standards, such as the number and severity of defects permissible for  acceptance. Instead, acceptance of the deliverable was subjectively based  on the COTR\u2019s assessment of whether the software could provide critical  functionality.", "For another contract action (Increment 1 hardware and software  installation at ports of entry), CBP did not verify that the equipment was  installed according to contract requirements. We were told by both the  CBP Director of Passenger Systems (who was involved with much of the  US-VISIT work) and the contract task monitor that the formal process for  verifying and accepting contract deliverables consisted of a site-specific  deployment checklist that recorded acceptance of deployment at each  port. Acceptance required a signature from a government employee, a  date, and an indication of deployment status (the two options for this  status were (1) that the equipment was installed and operational or  (2) that it was not installed, along with a description of reasons why it was  not). However, as shown in table 4, not all checklists that we reviewed  were signed or indicated that the equipment was installed and operational,  and CBP could not provide documentation on how the identified issues  were resolved.

It also documented the test results in a test analysis report that  noted that the software was ready for deployment because of the low  severity of identified deficiencies. The report included, among other  things, a list of system deficiencies identified during testing. The report  also included copies of documents provided to a US-VISIT technical  representative: a test problem report, a summary of testing defects, and a  document indicating that the contractor had approved the test analysis.  However, TSA did not provide evidence that the deficiencies were  managed and tracked to closure. TSA officials told us that open issues  were tracked informally via twice-weekly meetings with a US-VISIT  representative, TSA personnel, and contactor staff. Although these  meetings were documented, the minutes did not provide any evidence of  testing issues being discussed. According to program officials, this was  due to the short development time frame (about 4 months) and the need to  bypass traditional TSA milestone reviews in order to ensure that the  product was delivered on time.", "Without adequately verifying that contract deliverables satisfy  requirements before acceptance, an organization cannot adequately know  whether the contractor satisfied the obligations of the contract and  whether the organization is getting what it has paid for.", "Most agencies performed contractor technical and management  reviews.

According to the auditors, ICE did not adequately maintain its  own accounting records or the accounting records of other DHS agencies,  including US-VISIT. The records that were not maintained included  intradepartmental agreements and transactions, costs, and budgetary  transactions.

In particular, ICE\u2019s substantial financial management  challenges precluded it from providing reliable information on amounts  invoiced against its contracts. Its inability to provide us with key financial  documents for US-VISIT\u2013related contracts illustrated its challenges. Over  a period of 9 months, we repeatedly requested that ICE provide various  financial documents, including expenditure listings, invoice  documentation, and a list of all contracting actions managed on behalf of  US-VISIT. However, it did not provide complete documentation in time to  be included in this report. In particular, ICE was not able to provide  complete and reliable expenditures to date.

Second, the task order was for services  performed bureauwide, not just for US-VISIT, and from the contract  documentation it was not discernable which work was specific to US- VISIT. Such discrepancies suggest that the amount invoiced specifically to  US-VISIT was not accurate. Finally, our summation of all the invoices,  through March 31, 2005, on this contracting action totaled about $8.8  million, which was about $1.3 million more than the total invoiced amount  that CBP had reported. This discrepancy indicated that CBP was not  adequately tracking funds spent for US-VISIT on this contracting action,  which increased the risk that the program was improperly reimbursing  CBP on this contract.

As a  result, ICE did not have reliable information on what it spent for the  program, which means that it could have requested improper  reimbursements from the program office. More specifically, the most  detailed list ICE could provide of its US-VISIT\u2013related payments was by  querying its financial management system by contract number, which  provided all payments under the contract number. However, each  contract\u2019s scope of work is generally broad and includes work throughout  ICE, not just for US-VISIT.

At that time, CBP tracked all US-VISIT expenditures under a single  project code. However, between fiscal years 2003 and 2004, CBP  underwent a system conversion that interrupted its tracking of US-VISIT\u2013 related funds, which made it challenging to separately report US-VISIT\u2013 related expenditures. During this time, several changes were made to the  codes used to track US-VISIT information. When we requested a listing of  the US-VISIT\u2013related expenditures by CBP, it took several weeks for CBP  finance center staff to document the financial management system coding  changes and produce a reasonably complete listing of the US-VISIT\u2013 related expenditures that CBP made during the system conversion. In  fiscal years 2004 and 2005, CBP again began tracking all US-VISIT\u2013related  expenditures separately under a single budget code.

Our Internal  Control Management and Evaluation Tool states that transactions and  events need to be appropriately classified and that pertinent information is  to be identified and captured in the right form.", "Overpayments occurred as a result of two kinds of errors: on one occasion  a duplicate payment was made, and on several other occasions incorrect  balances were paid.", "A duplicate payment was made on an invoice for over $3 million. APMO  had sent an authorization for payment in full on the invoice to its finance  center. Then, 1 month later, APMO sent another authorization for payment  in full on the same invoice. The second payment was later noticed, and the  contractor refunded the amount.", "The other set of overpayments, although small in dollar value, exemplify a  significant breakdown in internal control. Invoices billed to AERC on a  fiscal year 2005 contract listed the current amount billed on the invoice, as  well as a cumulative balance; the cumulative balance included invoice  payments that AERC had already made, but that had not been recorded by  the contractor when the next invoice was generated. On several of the  invoices, AERC mistakenly paid the higher cumulative balance when the  current amount should have been paid. As a result, AERC overpaid the  vendor by about $26,600. Moreover, it was the contractor that first  reported this overpayment in September 2005 and refunded the  overpayment amount to AERC. According to DHS officials, the US-VISIT  program office had independently identified the overpayment in  November 2005 and requested clarification from AERC the following day.", "Also at APMO, two questionable payments were made that arose from the  overriding of controls created for the prime US-VISIT contract. The prime  contract has been implemented through 12 task orders with multiple  modifications that either increased funding or made other changes to the  contract terms. To account for the obligations made on each task order,  the program\u2019s Office of Budget and Finance created separate tracking  codes in the financial system for each task order and sometimes for each  modification of a task order. The separate tracking of each obligation is a  good control for tracking and controlling spending against task order  funds. However, APMO overrode this control when it instructed the  finance center to pay two invoices\u2014one for about $742,000 and one for  about $101,000\u2014out of the wrong account: that is, with funds for task  orders other than those for which the invoices were billed. APMO did not  provide any justification for payment with funds from the improper  account. Our Internal Control Management and Evaluation Tool states  that any intervention or overriding of internal controls should be fully  documented as to the reasons and specific actions taken.", "CBP also inappropriately paid for work unrelated to US-VISIT out of funds  designated for US-VISIT. For a 2003 contracting action that we reviewed,  invoices included a significant amount in travel billings. However, several  travel vouchers that accompanied these invoices were for work unrelated  to US-VISIT. For example, terms like \u201cLegacy ag/legacy Customs  unification,\u201d \u201cAgriculture Notes Installation,\u201d and \u201cAgriculture AQI\u201d were  indicated on the vouchers. CBP confirmed that these vouchers were billed  to US-VISIT in error. Additionally, other vouchers included descriptions  that were vague and not clearly related to any specific program (e.g.,  emergency hardware replacement), and thus it was not clear that the work  being billed was related to the program. Along with the travel expenses,  the labor hours associated with the above vouchers were also being billed  to the program. This circumstance calls into question not only whether or  not the travel charges were inappropriately classified as US-VISIT work,  but also whether the time that these employees were charging was  inappropriately classified, and thus improperly paid.", "On one CBP contracting action, some charges that were not related to US- VISIT may have been reimbursed by the program office. The contracting  action in question was a 2002 action for CBP-wide disaster recovery  services, and thus not all charges were directly related to the US-VISIT  program. On this task order, CBP expended about $1.28 million from  program-designated funds on items that were not clearly specified as US- VISIT work on the invoices. Of that amount, about $43,000 could be  attributed to a contract modification specific to the program. However,  CBP stated that one invoice for about $490,000 included in this $1.28  million was paid from the program\u2019s funds to correct two payments for  earlier US-VISIT invoices that were erroneously made from nonprogram  funds. We also found about $771,000 of invoice dollars that were specified  as US-VISIT work, but that were not on the CBP-provided expenditure  reports for program funds.", "As a result of these various discrepancies, the US-VISIT program may have  reimbursed CBP for work that was not done on its behalf. Also, the  program official responsible, under DHS policy, for monitoring the CBP  contracts related to US-VISIT told us that he had not been reviewing  invoices on IPAC reimbursement requests from CBP, even though such  reviews are required by DHS policy.", "In addition, on the 2003 CBP contracting action that we reviewed, many of  the travel vouchers included first-class flights taken by contract personnel,  although (with few exceptions) purchase of first-class travel is not allowed  for travel on cost-reimbursable type contracts. However, travel  documentation indicated first-class travel on numerous instances with no  explanation or justification of the first-class travel or documentation to  indicate that CBP had requested any explanation. CBP officials noted that  some frequent fliers are automatically upgraded when purchasing a full- fare flight. Although this is a reasonable explanation, CBP provided no  documentation showing that it completed any inquiry or research at the  time it was invoiced to determine if first-class travel was being purchased  or if upgrades were being given, and invoice documentation did not clarify  this. Further, in several instances, complete documentation was not  provided for the costs of all airline travel expenses.", "A final concern regarding payments to contractors is raised by the fact that  several of the agencies made late payments on invoices. Under the Prompt  Payment Act, the government must pay interest on invoices it takes over  30 days to pay. Not only do these interest payments deplete funds  available for US-VISIT, but excessive late invoice payments are also a  signal that the contract payment oversight process is not being effectively  managed. CBP and TSA experienced agencywide increases in contract  prompt-payment interest. CBP reported that in fiscal year 2004, the year  that it converted to a new accounting system, prompt pay interest  accounted for 7.66 percent of all payments, a sharp increase from the prior  year\u2019s frequency rate of 1.74 percent. In fiscal year 2005, the rate of  interest payments at CBP receded to 1.80 percent of total payments.", "APMO also paid substantial amounts in prompt payment interest.  According to DHS\u2019s auditors, ICE, which provides US-VISIT payment  services, had not established internal controls to ensure that invoices were  paid in a timely manner. For the invoices that we reviewed, prompt- payment interest was paid on approximately 26 percent of the prime  contract invoices that we reviewed, representing over $27,000 in  payments. In addition, we could not verify that the proper amount of  interest was paid because information in the ICE financial management  system was incorrect. For example, in many instances, important dates  used for determining prompt-pay interest were entered incorrectly, or the  dates in the system could not be validated based on invoice  documentation provided. A program official told us that certain program  staff have recently been granted read-only access to ICE\u2019s financial  management system to monitor invoice payments. If the program office  effectively uses this increased oversight ability, it could reduce the number  of prompt-payment violations as well as reduce other improper contract  payments made by the program office."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Contractors have played, and will continue to play, a major role in  delivering US-VISIT capabilities, including technology, facilities, and  people. Therefore, the success of the program depends largely on how  well DHS manages and oversees its US-VISIT\u2013related contracts.  Establishing and implementing effective contractor management and  oversight controls, including financial management controls, can greatly  increase the department\u2019s ability to manage and oversee US-VISIT\u2013related  contracts. However, the department\u2019s management and oversight of US- VISIT\u2013related contracts are not yet at the level that they need to be to  adequately ensure, for example, that contract deliverables satisfy program  requirements, that cost and schedule commitments are met, that program  outcomes are achieved, that funds are not overspent and improperly  reimbursed, and that payments are made in a proper and timely manner.", "Although the program office has generally established and implemented  key contractor management controls on those contracts that it manages  directly, it has not adequately overseen US-VISIT\u2013related contracts that  were managed by other DHS and non-DHS agencies. According to program  office officials, this is because they have initially focused on those  contracts that they manage directly. However, this narrow focus raises  concerns because the agencies managing contracts on the program office\u2019s  behalf have not implemented the full range of management controls  needed to have a full, accurate, reliable, and useful understanding of the  scope of contract activities and performance.", "Moreover, none of the US-VISIT contracts that we reviewed have been  subject to important financial management controls. As previous audits  have shown, DHS suffers from numerous material weaknesses in financial  management, some of which are directly related to ICE (the DHS  component that provides financial management services to the program  office). These weaknesses have contributed to the program\u2019s inability to  know the full scope of contract activities and fully account for  expenditures, among other things. By impairing the reliability and  effectiveness of accounting for US-VISIT contracts, these weaknesses have  diminished the program\u2019s ability to effectively manage and oversee work  performed by contractors\u2014work that is essential for the program to  achieve its goals.", "Until DHS addresses these contract management and oversight  weaknesses, the US-VISIT program will remain at risk of not delivering  required capabilities and promised benefits on time and within budget, and  it will be vulnerable to financial mismanagement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["Given the US-VISIT program\u2019s mission importance, size, and heavy  reliance on contractor assistance, we recommend that the Secretary of  Homeland Security direct the US-VISIT Program Director to take the  following five actions to strengthen contract management and oversight,  including financial management:    For each US-VISIT contract action that the program manages directly,  establish and maintain a plan for performing the contractor oversight  process, as appropriate.", "Develop and implement practices for overseeing contractor work  managed by other agencies on the program office\u2019s behalf, including  (1) clearly defining roles and responsibilities for both the program office  and all agencies managing US-VISIT\u2013related contracts; (2) having current,  reliable, and timely information on the full scope of contract actions and  activities; and (3) defining and implementing steps to verify that  deliverables meet requirements.", "Require, through agreements, that agencies managing contract actions on  the program office\u2019s behalf implement effective contract management  practices consistent with acquisition guidance for all US-VISIT contract  actions, including, at a minimum, (1) establishing and maintaining a plan  for performing contract management activities; (2) assigning responsibility  and authority for performing contract oversight; (3) training the people  performing contract oversight; (4) documenting the contract; (5) verifying  that deliverables satisfy requirements; (6) monitoring contractor-related  risk; and (7) monitoring contractor performance to ensure that the  contractor is meeting schedule, effort, cost, and technical performance  requirements.", "Require DHS and non-DHS agencies that manage contracts on behalf of  the program to (1) clearly define and delineate US-VISIT work from non- US-VISIT work as performed by contractors; (2) record, at the contract  level, amounts being billed and expended on US-VISIT\u2013related work so  that these can be tracked and reported separately from amounts not for  US-VISIT purposes; and (3) determine if they have received  reimbursement from the program for payments not related to US-VISIT  work by contractors, and if so, refund to the program any amount received  in error.", "Ensure that payments to contractors are timely and in accordance with the  Prompt Payment Act."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We received written comments on a draft of this report from DHS, which  were signed by the Director, Departmental GAO/IG Liaison Office, and are  reprinted in appendix II. We also received comments from the Director of  AERC and the Assistant Commissioner for Organizational Resources,  Public Buildings Service, GSA. Both the Department of Defense audit  liaison and the GSA audit liaison requested that we characterize these as  oral comments.", "In its written comments, DHS stated that although it disagreed with some  of our assessment, it agreed with many areas of the report and concurred  with our recommendations and the need for improvements in US-VISIT  contract management and oversight. The department disagreed with  certain statements and provided additional information about three  examples of financial management weaknesses in the report. Summaries  of DHS\u2019s comments and our response to each are provided below.", "The department characterized as misleading our statements that US-VISIT  (1) depended on other agencies to manage financial matters for their  respective contracts and (2) relied on another agency for US-VISIT\u2019s own  financial management support. With respect to the former, DHS noted that  the decision to use other agencies was based on the nature of the services  that were required, which it said were outside the scope of the program  office\u2019s areas of expertise. We understand the rationale for the decision to  use other agencies, and the statement in question was not intended to  suggest anything more than that such a decision was made. We have  slightly modified the wording to avoid any misunderstanding.", "With respect to its own financial management, DHS said that for us to  declare that US-VISIT depended on another agency for financial  management support without identifying the agency and the system, in  combination with our acknowledging that we did not examine the  effectiveness of this unidentified system, implies that our report\u2019s scope is  broader than what our congressional clients asked us to review. We do not  agree. First, our report does identify ICE as the agency that the program  office relies on for financial management support. Second, although we  did not identify by name the ICE financial management system, we did  describe in detail the serious financial management challenges at ICE,  which have been reported repeatedly by the department\u2019s financial  statement auditors and which have contributed to the department\u2019s  inability to obtain a clean audit opinion. Moreover, we fully attributed  these statements about these serious challenges to the auditors.", "The department said that our statement regarding the purpose of the  contracts managed by AERC needed to be clarified, stating that our report  reflects the scope of the two contract actions reviewed and not the  broader scope of services under the interagency agreement. We agree that  the description of AERC services in our report is confined to the scope of  the two contract actions that we reviewed. This is intentional on our part  since the scope of our review did not extend to the other services. We  have modified the report to clarify this.", "The department provided additional information about three examples of  invoice discrepancies and improper payments cited in the report,  including reasons why they occurred. Specifically, the department said  that the reason that CBP reported a 2002 contracting action as also a 2004  contracting action was because of the concurrent merger of CBP within  DHS and the implementation of CBP\u2019s new financial system. It further  stated that the reason that US-VISIT made a duplicate payment to the  prime contractor was, at least partially, due to poor communication  between US-VISIT and its finance center. Regarding two other duplicate  payments, DHS stated that while the cause of the duplicate payments is  not completely clear from the available evidence, both are almost certainly  errors resulting from processes with significant manual components, as  opposed to deliberate control overrides, since adequate funds were  available in the correct accounts for each case. The department also noted  that communications may have also contributed to one of these two  duplicate payments. We do not question the department\u2019s reasons or the  additional information provided for the other payments, but neither  changes our findings about the invoice discrepancies and improper  payments.", "The department stated that although the contractor initially identified the  AERC overpayment on September 13, 2005, the US-VISIT program office  independently identified the billing discrepancy on November 1, 2005, and  requested clarification from AERC the following day. The department  further stated that because we describe the overpayment example in the  report as being a small dollar value, we should have performed a  materiality test in accordance with accounting principles in deciding  whether the overpayment should be disclosed in a public report.  We do not dispute whether the US-VISIT program independently identified  the overpayment in question. Our point is that an invoice overpayment  occurred because adequate controls were not in place. In addition, while  we agree that materiality is relevant to determining whether to cite an  example of an improper payment, another relevant consideration to  significance is the frequency of the error. Our decision to disclose this  particular overpayment was based on our judgment regarding the  significance of the error as defined in generally accepted government  auditing standards. It is our professional judgment that this overpayment  is significant because of the frequency with which it occurred. Specifically,  of the eight invoices that we reviewed, four were improperly paid.", "In oral comments, the Director of AERC questioned the applicability of the  criteria we used to evaluate AERC contract management practices and our  assessment of its process for verifying and accepting deliverables. Despite  these disagreements, he described planned corrective actions to respond  to our findings.", "The Director stated in general that the Capability Maturity Model  Integration (CMMI)\u00ae model was not applicable to the contracts issued by  the Corps of Engineers, and in particular that a contract oversight plan  was not applicable to the two contract actions that we reviewed. In  addition, the Director commented that AERC\u2019s practices were adequate to  deal appropriately with contractor performance issues had these been  raised. Nonetheless, to address this issue, the Director stated that AERC  would require the US-VISIT program office to submit an oversight plan  describing the project\u2019s complexity, milestones, risks, and other relevant  information, and it would appoint qualified CORs or COTRs to implement  the plans and monitor contractor performance.", "We disagree with AERC\u2019s comments on the applicability of our criteria.  Although the CMMI model was established to manage IT software and  systems, the model\u2019s practices are generic and therefore applicable to the  acquisition of any good or service. Specifically, the contractor  management oversight practices discussed in this report are intended to  ensure that the contractor performs the requirements of the contract, and  the government receives the services and/or products intended within cost  and schedule. We also do not agree that the contract actions in question  did not warrant oversight plans. Although the content of oversight plans  may vary (depending on the type, complexity, and risk of the acquisition),  each acquisition should have a plan that, at a minimum, describes the  oversight process, defines responsibilities, and identifies the contractor  evaluations and reviews to be conducted. Since the chances of effective  oversight occurring are diminished without documented plans, we support  the program manager\u2019s commitment to require these plans in the future.", "Regarding an overpayment discussed in our report, the Director indicated  that this problem was resolved as described in DHS\u2019s comments, and that  in addition, AERC has procedures and controls to prevent the government  from paying funds in excess on a firm-fixed price contract such as the one  in question. Nonetheless, the Director described plans for strengthening  controls over contract progress payments and invoices, including having  trained analysts review all invoices and ensuring that a program/project  manager has reviewed the invoices and submitted written authorization to  pay them. The Director also stated that AERC has an established process  for controlling and paying invoices, which provides for verifying and  accepting deliverables. We do not consider that the AERC process was  established because although AERC officials described it to us, it was  neither documented nor consistently followed. For example, one  contracting action that we reviewed had three invoices that did not have a  signature or other documentation of approval, even though such approval,  according to AERC, is a required part of the process.", "In oral comments, the GSA Assistant Commissioner disagreed with the  applicability of certain of the criteria that we used in our assessment, as  well as with our assessment that these and other criteria had not been met.  For example, the Assistant Commissioner stated that regulations or  policies do not require GSA to establish and maintain a plan for  performing the contract oversight process, that its current practices and  documents (such as the contract statement of work and COR/COTR  delegation letters) in effect establish and maintain such a plan, that GSA  documented the oversight process and results to the extent necessary to  ensure contractor performance, and that GSA had established a  requirement to conduct contractor reviews. Although, as we state in our  report, GSA policies do not include a requirement for an oversight plan,  we still believe that it is appropriate to evaluate GSA against this practice  (which is consistent with sound business practices and applies to any  acquisition), and that GSA\u2019s processes and activities did not meet the  criteria for this practice and ensure effective oversight of the contracts.  We did not find that the delegation letters and contract statements of work  were sufficient substitutes for such plans, because, for example, they do  not consistently describe the contractor oversight process or contractor  reviews. Further, the inclusion of a requirement for contractor reviews in  some contracts/statements of work does not constitute agencywide  policies and procedures for performing reviews on all contracts.", "GSA also provided further descriptions of its financial management  controls and oversight processes and activities, but these descriptions did  not change our assessment of GSA\u2019s financial management controls or the  extent to which the oversight processes and activities satisfy the practices  that we said were not established or not consistently implemented.  Among these descriptions was information on an automated tool that GSA  provided its contracting officers; however, this tool was not used during  the period under review. GSA also provided certain technical comments,  which we have incorporated in our report, as appropriate.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

Not all  organizations awarded contracting actions in every fiscal year covered  under our review, in which case an action was not selected for that fiscal  year for that organization. The contracting actions selected from ICE were  excluded in our analysis of the implementation of management and  financial controls because of delays in receiving contract-specific  documentation.
