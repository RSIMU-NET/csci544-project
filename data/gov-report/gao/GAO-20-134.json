First, the Secretary of Homeland Security may initiate a review of a country for TPS designation in response to various triggering factors, such as a request from a foreign government, on the basis of one or more statutory conditions. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) requires subsequent reviews after an initial designation. Second, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)\u2014which manages and coordinates the TPS review process for DHS\u2014and the Department of State (State) compile country conditions reports and recommendations to inform the Secretary's decision. Although the INA does not prescribe the other agencies that must be consulted for a TPS review,State generally has a role in providing input for the Secretary of Homeland Security's consideration. GAO found DHS collected country conditions reports and recommendations from USCIS and State for all eight of the countries GAO selected for its review. Other DHS components and non-DHS entities may also provide information. Third, under the INA,the Secretary of Homeland Security exercises discretion in deciding whether to initially designate a country for TPS.

However, DHS has not provided consistent guidance regarding mechanisms it uses to communicate automatic extensions of TPS employment authorization documents. USCIS officials stated that the agency has typically communicated these extensions of documents for TPS beneficiaries through Federal Register notices. However, for five recent automatic extensions, USCIS instead mailed individual notifications to thousands of beneficiaries. USCIS guidance on its website identifies the individual notifications as a mechanism for communicating automatic extensions, but an employers' handbook and related guidance do not. As a result, some employers reportedly terminated TPS beneficiaries' employment because the employers did not understand or accept the notifications as proof of employment authorization. Consistent guidance about the mechanisms USCIS uses could help reduce the risk that TPS beneficiaries will lose their jobs because of confusion about their authorization to work in the United States."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends USCIS consistently identify in published guidance the mechanisms used to communicate automatic extensions of TPS employment authorization documents.

The Secretary of Homeland Security initiates a review of a country for  TPS. For an initial TPS designation, the Secretary may initiate  consideration of a country in response to various triggering factors.  Such factors may include, for example, a request from a U.S.  government entity or a foreign government for a TPS designation  based on the statutory conditions for TPS (i.e., armed conflict,  environmental disaster, or extraordinary and temporary conditions).  For an existing designation approaching its end date, a statutory  deadline requires the Secretary to undertake a review.  2.  DHS collects information on country conditions and recommendations  from USCIS and State and provides this information to the Secretary  of Homeland Security to inform his or her decision regarding an initial  or existing TPS designation. Other DHS components and non-DHS  entities, including other agencies and nongovernmental organizations,  may also provide information to the Secretary or USCIS.  3.  The Secretary of Homeland Security receives the information and  recommendations and makes a decision about TPS for the country.  The Secretary exercises discretion in determining whether to initially  designate a country for TPS. For an existing designation, under the  INA, the Secretary is required to determine whether country  conditions warrant an extension of TPS or whether the country no  longer meets the statutory criteria and TPS must be terminated.

According to DHS  and State officials, DHS generally consults with State on TPS decisions,  although it is not specifically required to do so under the statute. Our  review of 26 TPS decisions for the eight selected countries found that  DHS collected the following documents to inform each decision:  1.  a country conditions report compiled by USCIS,  2.  a memo with a recommendation from the USCIS Director to the  Secretary of Homeland Security,  3.  a country conditions report compiled by State, and  4.  a letter with a recommendation from the Secretary of State to the  Secretary of Homeland Security.", "USCIS manages and coordinates the TPS information-gathering process  for the Secretary of Homeland Security.

They noted that a review for an initial designation may have a  shorter time frame than a review for an existing designation, depending  on the situation. In addition, the officials noted that USCIS generally starts  the review process for an existing TPS designation about 6 months to a  year before the end date of the country\u2019s current designation. They added  that they generally start the review process within this timeframe, given  the INA requirement that the Secretary of Homeland Security either  undertake a review and make a determination regarding country  conditions at least 60 days in advance of the prior designation\u2019s end date  or automatically extend the designation for 6 months. According to  USCIS officials, at the start of a review for an initial or existing  designation, USCIS\u2019s Office of Policy & Strategy generally reaches out to  USCIS\u2019s Refugee, Asylum and International Operations Directorate  (RAIO) to request input on country conditions. USCIS officials also said  that the office coordinates with State\u2019s Bureau of Population, Refugees,  and Migration regarding the target time frame for receiving State\u2019s input.

For the 24 reviews of existing TPS designations,  USCIS provided recommendation memos to the Secretary of Homeland  Security about 2 to 7 months before the end date of the prior  designations. Most of State\u2019s 26 recommendation letters were dated  about 2 days to 6 months before the USCIS recommendation memos.", "RAIO officials noted that they use an internal template as informal  guidance for the draft country conditions reports that they compile for  USCIS\u2019s Office of Policy & Strategy for reviews for initial or existing TPS  designations. We reviewed the RAIO template and found, for example,  that for reporting on a country being considered for a TPS designation on  the basis of an environmental disaster, the template includes sections  (e.g., several paragraphs) about the population harmed, damage to  infrastructure, disruption in services, and status of disaster response and  reconstruction. Officials added that country conditions reports may  deviate from the template, because its use is not required; instead, it  serves as general, informal guidance.

State\u2019s Bureau of  Population, Refugees and Migration (PRM) facilitates and coordinates State\u2019s internal process for developing this input,  according to informal guidance, which State officials said the bureau has used at the working level since 2012, as well as our  interviews with State officials.", "After DHS initiates a TPS review, PRM generally directs the relevant regional bureau to reach out to overseas posts for  information about country conditions, according to State officials. State officials noted that in some cases, the regional  bureau\u2019s country desk officer takes the lead in drafting the country conditions report, depending on the country context.  Officials stated that the regional bureau generally uses a questionnaire on country conditions to request information from the  post for a TPS review and that the post generally also provides a recommendation, in addition to the questionnaire  responses, via cable or email to the regional bureau. For example, for a country that had an existing TPS designation based  on ongoing armed conflict in the country, a country conditions cable provided, among other things, information about the  status of the armed conflict, an assessment of whether the return of foreign nationals would pose a serious threat to their  personal safety and whether the country was unable to handle the return of nationals, and information about the impact of the  conflict on economic and humanitarian conditions. State and U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) officials  noted that other agencies represented at the overseas posts, such as USAID, may provide information for a post\u2019s input on  country conditions, including information gathered \u201con the ground\u201d as well as from publicly available sources.", "Once the regional bureau receives any input from post, the bureau desk officer prepares a draft country conditions report and  recommendation, and the regional bureau works with PRM to compile a joint action memo. PRM generally provides the joint  action memo, which includes a country conditions report, to the Secretary of State, according to State officials. The memo  may include a joint recommendation or varying recommendations (e.g., from PRM and the regional bureau) for the  Secretary\u2019s consideration. After the Secretary determines what the department will recommend, State provides a final country  conditions report and recommendation letter to the Secretary of Homeland Security as well as to U.S. Citizenship and  Immigration Services\u2019 Office of Policy & Strategy.", "We found that the USCIS and State country conditions reports and  recommendation memos or letters that DHS and State provided for our  nongeneralizable sample of 26 TPS decisions included information such  as background on the cause (or reason for consideration) of the initial  TPS designation and a summary of the country\u2019s recovery from, or the  status of, the situation to date.

For example,  documentation for a country designated on the basis of armed conflict  described the status of the conflict and ceasefire agreements;  provided information about violence against civilians and recruitment  of child soldiers; provided an update on civilian casualties since the  prior review; and described humanitarian challenges stemming from  the conflict, such as the risk of famine. For a country designated on  the basis of environmental disaster, documentation described the  status of investments in recovery and efforts to rebuild after the  disaster, including the number of houses and schools that had been  rebuilt or repaired. This documentation also included assessments of  disruption in living conditions and the extent to which economic  activity and basic services had been restored.", "Economic indicators. USCIS documentation for 16 TPS decisions  and State documentation for 12 TPS decisions in our review included  information about economic indicators. Examples of such information  included an estimate of damages from an environmental disaster as a  percentage of a country\u2019s gross domestic product, a summary of  growth in a country\u2019s gross domestic product in recent years, and data  on the increase in food prices as a result of armed conflict in a  country.", "Broader country context. USCIS documentation for 23 TPS  decisions in our review and State documentation for 20 TPS decisions  provided information about broader country context. For example,  documentation for a country designated on the basis of armed conflict  included broader context regarding topics such as recent natural  disasters and the country\u2019s geography. As another example,  documentation for a country designated on the basis of environmental  disaster provided information about subsequent natural disasters as  well as violence, criminal activity, and corruption in the country.", "In addition to USCIS and State, other DHS offices and components and  non-DHS entities may provide information to inform the Secretary\u2019s  decision.

DHS provided memorandums or notices  documenting the Secretary\u2019s TPS decisions for all 26 decisions in our  nongeneralizable sample. After the Secretary makes a TPS decision,  DHS typically communicates the decision to State before announcing it to  the general public. Either DHS or State then communicates the decision  to the foreign embassy in Washington, D.C., and State may communicate  it to the foreign government overseas.

In addition, DHS frequently used Federal Register notices as a  mechanism for communicating other related information, such as effective  dates for TPS designation periods, applicant registration periods, TPS  beneficiary eligibility requirements, and information about employment  authorization for beneficiaries. For example, the Federal Register notice  extending the TPS designation of El Salvador, published on July 8, 2016,  included the following:  summary information about the extension, such as the period of  extension and the start and end date of the extension; procedures and eligibility information for beneficiaries to register or  reregister for TPS and to apply for renewal of employment  authorization documents, including required forms and fees to register  or reregister; directions for obtaining additional information and help with questions  by accessing the USCIS website or by contacting an identified USCIS  official or a USCIS customer contact center; and general information about TPS as well as information about El  Salvador\u2019s initial TPS designation and about the Secretary\u2019s authority  and reason for extending TPS for El Salvador.", "For a Federal Register notice of a TPS decision, according to USCIS  officials, USCIS generally takes about 2 weeks to draft the notice. DHS  then completes an internal review before submitting the notice to the  Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for interagency review,  according to officials. OMB\u2019s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs  coordinates the notice review process, including gathering comments or  proposed revisions from relevant executive branch agencies. For  example, we reviewed examples of technical comments from the Centers  for Disease Control and Prevention regarding draft notices of TPS  decisions for the Ebola-affected countries that included information and  data on the status of the epidemic and an assessment of health care  infrastructure. According to USCIS officials, OMB comments are returned  to DHS without identifying the agency that made each comment, and  additional interagency review and comment may occur before DHS  publishes the notice in the Federal Register. USCIS officials also noted  that, under regulation, OMB can take up to 90 days to complete the interagency review, although the officials added that OMB aims to  complete the process in a timely manner for TPS notices and generally  takes about a month.", "According to USCIS officials, to help raise awareness of TPS decisions,  USCIS has generally also issued press releases announcing all TPS  decisions and published them on its website in addition to publishing  Federal Register notices.

See the text box for a  description of the process that TPS beneficiaries and employers must  follow to verify beneficiaries\u2019 employment eligibility.", "According to USCIS officials, USCIS aims to adjudicate both initial  employment authorization applications and renewal applications within 90  days after receiving an application. When it is unable to process the  adjudications in this time frame, USCIS issues automatic extensions of  expiring employment authorization documents for TPS beneficiaries from  a specific country, to allow time for USCIS to process the volume of  applications associated with a TPS reregistration period. In some  instances, USCIS may issue additional automatic extensions of  employment authorization documents for specific countries if it has been  unable to process all pending applications within the initial automatic  extension period, according to USCIS officials.", "When employment authorization documents are automatically extended  for eligible TPS beneficiaries, the documents may appear to have expired  even though they remain valid. According to USCIS officials, DHS has  used the Federal Register notices announcing TPS decisions to  communicate most automatic extensions of TPS employment  authorization documents.

DHS has also communicated  automatic extensions of TPS employment authorization documents  through Federal Register notices independent of a TPS decision.  Generally, Federal Register notices announcing automatic extensions of  TPS employment authorization documents include instructions for  employers for completing the Form I-9, among other things.

According to the officials, they began this practice because  of the large number of affected beneficiaries. Our examination of USCIS  documents found that in four of these five cases, USCIS mailed individual  notifications to the TPS beneficiaries without also posting a Federal  Register notice communicating the automatic extension.", "In all five cases, USCIS published guidance on its website to inform TPS  beneficiaries and employers about the use of individually mailed  notifications to communicate employment authorization document  extensions. USCIS\u2019s website states that TPS beneficiaries may present  the Federal Register notice or individually mailed notification to their  employer along with their expired employment authorization documents to  show proof of continued employment authorization. The individual  notifications also state that beneficiaries may show the notifications, along  with the expired employment authorization document, to any U.S.  employer as proof of continued employment authorization.", "However, a USCIS handbook for employers and related guidance do not  specifically identify the individually mailed notifications as an official  means of communicating these extensions.", "USCIS\u2019s Handbook for Employers: Guidance for Completing Form I-9  (M-274) provides guidance for employers on how to properly complete  Form I-9, which helps employers verify that individuals are authorized  to work in the United States.
