Public Law 96-265 authorized the federal government to pay up to 90 percent of the states\u2019 total costs incurred in planning, designing, developing, installing, or enhancing these systems. The systems are required by OCSE to be implemented statewide and be capable of carrying out mandatory functional requirements, including case initiation, case management, financial management, enforcement, security, privacy, and reporting.

For example, in total, current cost estimates for the states we visited are about twice as high as originally planned. In addition, at least 10 states are now discovering that their systems will cost more to operate once they are completed. While these states expected cost increases as a result of added system functionality, increased information storage, and the use of sophisticated databases, estimated operating costs for some new systems may be even higher than anticipated. For example, one state\u2019s initial estimate showed the new system\u2019s data processing costs would be three to five times higher than that of the old system. However, according to a state official, those costs will likely be six to seven times higher than the current system\u2019s operating costs.

The difference can be attributed to a variety of factors, including caseload size, whether the states or the counties administer the child support program, the number of attempts states made to develop child support enforcement systems, the way the systems were developed\u2014by modifying an existing system or developing a new one, and the kind of system being developed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Few States Certified as Deadline Approaches", "paragraphs": ["Only five systems were certified and seven conditionally certified as of March 31, 1997.

However, OCSE did not publish federal regulations\u2014which described in general the program and automated systems\u2014until October 1992. The agency did provide draft systems development guidance\u2014functional requirements\u2014to the states, but it was not disseminated until July 1992. OCSE did not provide the states with final systems functional requirements until June 1993.", "OCSE acknowledges that the federal requirements were late; it attributes this primarily to its not using an incremental approach in releasing the requirements to the states. Rather than issuing certain requirements as they were defined, it waited until all requirements could be issued together. This was done because OCSE believed that certain underlying policy issues needed to be resolved before requirements could be made final and released. In addition, because OCSE\u2019s minimum requirements were extensive and difficult policy issues needed to be resolved, the review and approval process also contributed to the delayed issuance of requirements. According to OCSE, it took time to assess policy issues, determine the most effective way to automate related changes, and accurately define related requirements. For example, according to OCSE, before it could even begin to define requirements related to the replacement of monthly mail-in notices (e.g., of a client\u2019s child support status) with telephone recordings, complex policy decisions had to be considered.", "Another example of a policy issue needing resolution, according to OCSE, was related to guidance on financial distributions. For instance, OCSE had to assess how systems would handle the required \u201c$50 pass-through\u201d policy of the program. This policy states that the first $50 of current child support payments collected for a child also covered under Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC) must be delivered to the mother of that child rather than to the state AFDC office. While this policy sounds simple, it presented a certain degree of administrative complexity, especially for cases in which support payments were not made on time. In such a case, regardless of how many months a payment has been in arrears, only $50 (for the current month) goes directly to the mother.", "We have indicated in the past that an agency in the process of defining and analyzing requirements should assess the impact of changes on other organizational elements; therefore, we agree that policy issues such as these must be addressed prior to developing detailed requirements. We also agree with OCSE that where possible, it should have made final and issued certain requirements sooner, using an incremental approach.", "Delays in issuing final systems functional requirements meant more than just a late start; they compounded other problems. Uncertainties about final requirements slowed some states\u2019 development activities and contributed to contractor problems. Seven of the 10 regions we surveyed indicated that the delay in requirements had an adverse effect on their states\u2019 development. The following excerpts illustrate the impact of the delay on certain state projects.", "An official of one region (representing four states) indicated that the requirements were issued much later than needed and ranked the \u201clack of timely final functional requirements\u201d the number one impediment to states\u2019 systems development.

Another HHS regional official said, \u201cthe delay in getting official regulations published impacted contracts with the vendors and was an embarrassment to ACF  [yet, because of the deadline imposed], development efforts went forward.\u201d", "Still another region surveyed indicated that requirements were somewhat late and, for four of its six states, this was an impediment. However, a regional official alluded to strong contractor relations as one of the primary reasons that the delay was not a problem (but otherwise could have been) for two of the region\u2019s states. The official stated, \u201cthe effect of timing on  unique. Each was building one system that supported a few offices throughout each jurisdiction. Each also had a fairly good working relationship with its vendor.

One state official noted that the late functional requirements and short time frames contributed to development delays and increased costs. Another state noted that the delay in functional requirements contributed to many changes in the contract and, eventually, to contract termination. Finally, in one state, the child support systems\u2019 development contract had to be amended to address modifications to the functional requirements. In fact, three work segments in the contract had to be added as a result of these modifications, increasing project costs by at least $210,000 due to reprogramming.", "The HHS Office of Inspector General has similarly reported that several states experienced systems problems as a result of late functional requirements. In response to the Office of Inspector General survey, one state official noted that the state\u2019s system was designed to meet the requirements set out in the draft guidelines; once the final requirements were issued, the state had to shift to a new initiative and virtually start over.

While certainly a reasonable approach for saving money, at the time of this policy mandate, only a few available systems had been certified as meeting OCSE\u2019s old requirements and no systems were certified based on the more extensive 1988 act. As a result, states had difficulty transferring these systems and adapting them for their own programs.

OCSE noted that states needed to review other states\u2019 systems and determine how these systems varied from their own systems requirements. According to OCSE, this sharing of technology among states would decrease the installation time for automated systems and reduce the risk of systems failures due to poor system design or inadequate planning.", "The transfer policy required states to reuse software. Software reuse can be an appropriate part of systems development projects. According to the National Bureau of Standards, one of the most effective means of improving the productivity of software development is to increase the proportion of software that is reused. Reusable software not only increases productivity, but also improves reliability and reduces development time and cost. However, many technical, organizational, and cultural issues usually need to be resolved before widespread reuse of software should be mandated. In this case, this was not done.", "If properly implemented, OCSE\u2019s transfer policy could have saved states time and money in developing child support systems. As early as 1987, we reported that sharing state systems could save OCSE time and money.However, we also noted at that time that OCSE had not adopted standards or provided adequate oversight of states\u2019 efforts to develop compatible and transferable automated systems. Careful and detailed alternatives analyses are required prior to selecting software to be transferred. Analyses should consider functional requirements; standardization of data elements; compatibility of software and hardware platforms; and other factors, such as caseload processing, organizational structure, state and contractor expertise and skills, and any unique state requirements. For alternatives, state agencies should consider only completed systems that have been tested, validated, and successfully used in operation to ensure that benefits will be achieved.", "Two factors intensified the need for adequate planning for software reuse: states\u2019 different organizational structures and methods of administering the program and the magnitude of changes required by OCSE\u2019s implementation of the 1988 act. Since states administer the federal child support program, each state determines how its program will be organized and operated. These differences in state programs affect systems development. For example, county-administered states faced an additional challenge in complying with the 1988 requirement to have one statewide child support system. Those states had to build systems that considered the needs of users in all of their county offices, complicating system design. Careful planning for software reuse was especially important. Under the 1988 act and implementing regulations, states were required to obtain and track more detailed information on each absent parent, child, and custodial parent. OCSE mandated that states transfer systems before making the requirements final, so they were unable to first evaluate the ability of the transfer systems to meet those requirements.", "Despite its lack of requirements, oversight, and alternatives analyses, OCSE mandated the transfer policy without performing sufficient analyses or feasibility studies of existing certified systems as potential transfer candidates. Only eight certified systems were available when the mandate was issued, and these were certified based on the 1984 requirements. At the same time, no automated systems were certified based on the more extensive 1988 act, making it highly unlikely that the available systems would be suitable for transfer to other states. While, in July 1994, OCSE changed its transfer policy making it optional, this was after most states had attempted to transfer systems and when systems efforts had progressed further.", "Only one state we visited noted that it had successfully transferred another system. It was among the last to transfer a system, initiating the transfer in 1994. Moreover, the state began its project after the final federal requirements were issued, conducted thorough analyses of three potential systems, and transferred a system that had already been certified as meeting the 1988 requirements. In addition, the system selected was the result of a successful, earlier transfer from another location.", "However, some states we visited did not take as thorough an approach and faced difficulties in attempting to transfer existing child support systems.", "One project team we visited spent almost $400,000 attempting to transfer a system from another state, only to discover that the transfer was not possible because the system was not compatible with its existing operation.", "Another state\u2019s official explained that, to meet the mandate and the 1995 deadline, his state attempted to transfer a system that was immature, incomplete, and inadequately tested. While the state started to implement parts of the transfer system, the entire system was not delivered until a year later, increasing project costs.", "Yet another state attempted to have a contractor modify a transfer system that was also incomplete. Later, the entire effort was abandoned, wasting over a million dollars and contributing to a delay of several years.", "The HHS Office of Inspector General recently reported that 71 percent of states said that their attempts to transfer a system delayed, rather than enhanced, development of an automated system. In response to that survey, one state official noted, \u201c. . . when we began our project there were no systems certified to the 1988 level. We chose one state\u2019s system as our transfer model and wasted about a year documenting all of its deficiencies in order to justify not transferring it.\u201d In addition, we were told by officials in several other states that they transferred only concepts from other systems\u2014that the amount of computer code actually transferred was negligible."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "GAO Recommendations Only Partially Addressed Despite Delays and Escalating Costs", "paragraphs": ["In our 1992 report, we stated that efforts to develop child support enforcement systems were plagued by problems, particularly in the area of federal oversight provided to states.

OCSE is required to monitor 90-percent federally funded child support systems to ensure that they are successfully developed and are cost-effective. If this is not the case and if a state is not substantially adhering to its approved plan, OCSE is authorized to suspend federal funding.", "Past compliance reviews conducted by OCSE\u2019s systems division identified many deficiencies with states\u2019 development of automated child support systems and escalating costs. For example, development of three severely flawed systems continued at a total cost of over $32 million before they were stopped and redirected by OCSE. Rather than directing needed remedial actions when these problems were identified, OCSE informed the states of the deficiencies yet continued to fund the systems based on states\u2019 assurances that the problems would be addressed. Further, OCSE\u2019s systems division did not routinely use audit division reports to help monitor development because it was not required to do so.", "In 1992, we recommended that OCSE (1) work with the audit division to identify and resolve systems-related problems, (2) use its authority to suspend federal funding when major problems existed, and (3) require states to implement needed corrective actions when first identified. Despite the seriousness of the problems we identified in 1992 and recurring problems since then, the only recommendation fully implemented by OCSE was the first one, regarding working with the audit division to identify and resolve systems-related problems. OCSE reviews audit reports prior to certification visits and the auditors are now members of the certification review teams. In addition, officials in both the systems and audit areas stated that communication and coordination between the two have improved substantially since our 1992 report.", "Even though systems costs were escalating, OCSE did not fully implement the other two recommendations. It continues to assert that the federal government should work with the states to correct deficiencies rather than take enforcement actions. However, law and regulations require that OCSE monitor the 90-percent federally funded child support systems to ensure that they are successfully developed. OCSE is authorized to suspend federal funding if a state is not substantially adhering to its approved plan. While HHS regional staff noted that OCSE either held up, reduced, or stopped funding to 18 states since the 1988 act, almost 60 percent of these reported disruptions were due to insufficient information on the required APD or the state\u2019s exceeding its authorized funding level. OCSE believes that suspending funds is counterproductive to helping states meet the deadline.", "Even when funding was held up for major systems-related problems, efforts to correct these problems did not appear to be timely. For example, one HHS regional official suggested to OCSE that it hold up funding for projects in his region, yet, according to this official, the agency did not stop any funding until one of those projects\u2019 \u201cinitial efforts crashed.\u201d In another instance, OCSE had serious concerns about the status and future direction of one state\u2019s project, staffing levels, and methods of incorporating changes in code. As a result, it held up funding for several months. However, some problems were not identified until 2 years into the project\u2019s life cycle; as of the end of our review, OCSE was still working with the state to resolve them. In another case, OCSE identified problems with poorly documented code, inadequate planning and guidance, and contract management but did not stop federal funding.", "According to OCSE\u2019s systems division director and analysts, states have primary responsibility for developing their systems and therefore the federal government should not assume a primary role in directing how states should develop systems and remedy problems. We disagree with OCSE\u2019s approach of continuing to fund systems with serious problems that endanger the projects\u2019 success.

Major mechanisms OCSE uses to oversee states\u2019 systems development projects include reviews of the states\u2019 advance planning documents (APDs); advance planning document updates (APDUs); and certification reviews, which are assessments to determine if projects meet federal requirements. While these reviews provide OCSE information on states\u2019 plans for designing automated systems, the agency does not effectively use the APDs to oversee, monitor, or control the systems development projects, and the certifications are performed too late in the process to detect and correct problems.", "In short, critical systems development decision points are not monitored by OCSE and reviews of states\u2019 systems are primarily focused on determining whether all federal requirements have been met. Further, OCSE has not completed nationwide analyses or post-implementation reviews to effectively assess lessons learned, hindering its ability to provide more thorough, helpful leadership.

As such, the APDs are not used to measure systems development progress at key decision points; rather, according to state officials, APDs are used primarily as a funding approval mechanism only, requiring the states to report information and plans on the basis of a deadline that may or may not be realistic. Consequently, systems problems may go undetected until much later in the process when they are considerably more difficult and expensive to correct.", "APDs are written plans of action submitted by states to request federal funds for designing, developing, and implementing their systems. According to an OCSE guide, the three primary purposes of the APD process are to (1) describe in broad terms a state\u2019s plan for managing the design, development, implementation, and operation of a system that meets federal, state, and user needs in an efficient, comprehensive, and cost-effective manner, (2) establish system and program performance goals in terms of projected costs and benefits, and (3) secure federal financial participation for the state.

The APD also sets forth the project management plan with a cost-benefit analysis, proposed budget, and prospective cost allocations.

OCSE is also required to review the security requirements, intrastate and interstate interfaces, staff resources, hardware requirements, and the feasibility of the proposed plan. HHS regional staff support OCSE by monitoring states\u2019 development efforts and, at times, assist the states in preparing their APDs and APDUs.

Appendix III provides an overview of typical systems development phases. The key is to identify system risks and problems early in the design, in order to avoid major failures and abandoned projects, and to help ensure that major segments do not have to be extensively recoded or redesigned.", "While states recognize the benefits of using a structured systems development approach and may provide OCSE with information on each of these phases in their APDUs, OCSE does not effectively use this information for determining the adequacy or progress of the systems development projects. APDUs are revised annually, rather than corresponding to major system phases. According to OCSE\u2019s director of state child support information systems, the agency has not monitored the projects using a structured approach because it lacks the technical expertise and resources needed to be involved at critical points in the development process. Recent funding from the welfare reform legislation has allowed OCSE to conduct more frequent reviews; it is critical to assess systems development activities at each phase and to identify problems and any potential risks early, before moving forward to the next phase.", "Further, OCSE has not provided specific guidance describing the information needed in the APDUs to assess different phases of development. For example, while OCSE requires that the states provide schedules of systems development activities, these schedules\u2014formats, descriptions, and structure\u2014vary from state to state and, even within a state, may vary from year to year, making it difficult to effectively assess state progress and monitor systems development. Specifically, some APDUs do not provide information on how much data have been converted, code written, modules produced, nor portions and results of the modules tested, again hindering OCSE\u2019s ability to effectively measure progress.", "While state officials indicated that the APDUs were useful for budgetary purposes, officials at six out of seven locations we visited said that APDUs are not useful in helping them manage their systems developments. \u201cThey are an administrative exercise to justify obtaining funding,\u201d said one.

As a result, more money was spent and systems underwent further development without disciplined, structured systems development approaches, increasing the likelihood of system failures.", "In the case of one state we visited, as shown in figure 4.1, despite three revisions to time estimates for systems testing, OCSE approved each updated estimate. Only after the state officials told OCSE that delays and problems were occurring did the agency, in November 1996 and in February 1997, review systems progress. State officials told us that they wanted the OCSE review to identify that the time for testing was insufficient to support the state in vendor discussions, yet the agency had not, as of March 31, 1997, reported on this matter. According to OCSE\u2019s director of child support information systems, the review focused only on one specific functional requirement and was not a comprehensive systems review, and would not, therefore, address the software testing issue.", "In systems development, building and testing sections of computer code and then using test results to refine the software are critical. Testing results need to be considered in correcting errors and improving identified inefficiencies. Despite this essential need for systems testing, in the example in figure 4.1, OCSE continued to approve the APDUs and fund the project, without assessing the increasing risks. The APDUs also showed that the state was not following a structured systems development approach and was developing software while at the same time attempting to integrate software in preparation for systems testing. According to this state\u2019s systems project director, the project\u2019s costs increased from $30 million to over $50 million, in part because of the poor quality of software developed. If work on a later phase proceeds before an earlier phase is completed, one risks problems from condensing work and truncating the process. Completion of the automated system is now uncertain.", "In another state we visited, OCSE had ample indication that the state\u2019s system was experiencing difficulty, yet failed to act until just recently. In August 1993, the state initially scheduled implementation to last until April 1996\u2014a period of 39 months. The estimated completion date was subsequently extended twice\u2014first in September 1995 by an additional 10 months (to February 1997), and then again in October 1996 by an additional 5 months (to July 1997). These extensions, taken together, prolonged the implementation phase by almost 40 percent, from an initially envisioned 39 months to 54 months. The 1995 updated estimate should have signaled to OCSE that the state\u2019s system needed help. However, not until the state requested a substantial increase\u2014$133 million in project costs\u2014did OCSE, in January 1997, question the state\u2019s systems progress. According to OCSE\u2019s director of child support information systems, the agency should have visited this state sooner to provide technical assistance. Given that the October 1996 update judged implementation to be less than half finished, it is questionable whether the July 1997 target is even realistic.", "OCSE has not effectively provided program oversight by detecting and redirecting states\u2019 approaches that are inadequate and threaten successful systems development. When planning and developing a system, a state must ensure that it meets users\u2019 needs, provides the intended benefits to users and their constituencies, and is developed on time; otherwise, it will not be effective. Gaining commitment and support from key decisionmakers is particularly important for states developing child support systems because they serve a variety of users\u2014district attorneys, county and state officials, and court officers. Key users\u2019 needs should be considered, and general agreement is critical in developing systems\u2019 requirements and design. However, not all states clearly defined their functional requirements and user needs.", "In one state, the system design was insufficient because it did not clearly define functional requirements and did not gain the support and involvement of key county officials. While OCSE reviewed requirements and reported minor deficiencies, it did not mention any serious problems in the state\u2019s systems development approach. Yet just 1 year later, after the state had an independent contractor conduct a risk assessment of the project, state officials acknowledged that the approach needed to be completely revamped. According to OCSE\u2019s director of child support information systems, the agency\u2019s review for this state focused only on whether functional requirements were being met rather than the systems approach being followed. She further noted that the state is responsible for developing the system and obtaining system buy-in from the users. Because of OCSE\u2019s large financial investment in systems\u2014the approval of $154 million for this state alone\u2014and the importance of gaining user acceptance for successful systems development, we believe the state and federal agencies are both responsible.", "Two states we visited also encountered similar problems by not involving all key players\u2014program, systems, and management officials\u2014in the decision-making process. In one state, the information resources management official was not involved in the systems planning and implementation. Later a disagreement occurred in policy decisions related to operating the system, resulting in an abrupt change in management of the system. Consequently, the project\u2019s direction is uncertain and the system conversion progress has been delayed. Another state allowed its child support program office to develop its system without ensuring that key officials with technical program and managerial expertise were adequately involved.

Thus, these reviews are too late to identify problems and redirect approaches. Despite being the predominant stakeholder for over $2.6 billion worth of child support systems, OCSE maintains that its philosophy is to work with the states as opposed to suspending funding until problems are corrected, allowing federally financed projects to proceed when such projects do, in fact, require redirection.", "Two types of reviews are conducted by OCSE: functional and certification reviews. During a functional review, OCSE helps the state work on specific system requirements. For example, it may telephone or visit the state to discuss how to meet automation requirements for the noncustodial parent locating function. The certification review comprises a two-level process, level 1 and level 2. A level 1 review is performed when an automated system is installed and operational in one or more pilot locations. (OCSE created this level of review in 1990 due to state requests for agency guidance prior to statewide implementation.) A level 2 review is conducted when OCSE visits the state to determine if the system meets certification requirements. The certification review normally takes a week to perform; the OCSE review team is made up of headquarters systems officials and HHS regional personnel representing the systems, fiscal, program, and audit functions.", "Prior to a certification review, OCSE provides a questionnaire including questions on how the system meets specific federally required functions (such as case initiation and the detail supporting this function) and a test deck of financial transactions (mainly test cases of different types of child support payment distributions) to be run on the state\u2019s system. OCSE also supports, through federal funds, child support user group meetings so state officials can meet and share related systems experiences.", "OCSE\u2019s reviews\u2014functional and certification\u2014of state systems focus on whether functional requirements are met, while they lack but need comprehensive assessments of the systems\u2019 development approaches and schedules. Since 1991, OCSE has visited, assessed, and reported on 31 states\u2019 system development projects. We reviewed all of these and found that 28 of the 31 functional and certification reviews focused primarily on systems\u2019 functional requirements. Specifically, OCSE determines whether the system can initiate a new case, locate an absent parent, establish a support order, manage cases, enforce cases, perform financial distributions, perform management reporting, and maintain security/privacy. Suggestions for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the systems\u2019 operations are discussed in reports following these reviews. For example, recommendations include having the states consider automating more functions, such as developing an automatic tickler file to remind caseworkers of required actions or an approaching time frame. While suggestions for improved efficiency in automation are valuable, OCSE\u2019s reviews lack a comprehensive assessment of the states\u2019 systems development approach, including the overall design, project management, user involvement, and delays in major milestones and critical tasks. While 3 of the 31 reviews did address systems development approaches and overall project management, OCSE officials noted that they only do this type of review for states that are experiencing delays and significant problems.", "Even though OCSE required states to submit APDs by October 1, 1991, all but 1 of the 31 functional and certification reviews conducted by OCSE were performed in October 1995 or later. Since OCSE only does certification reviews upon state request and toward the end of systems development, much of the federal funding had already been spent.", "Even when OCSE identifies state systems problems and notifies the states, corrective actions do not always follow. In one state, OCSE performed two reviews and noted that the state had serious managerial problems. There was no project manager for extended periods of time, and users did not support the project, despite the fact that a key early step in designing a proposed system is identifying and satisfying users\u2019 needs. Even after the second review was performed and the problems noted in the first review had not been corrected, OCSE took no action to stop or delay the project or to suspend funding. Again, according to OCSE systems analysts, the agency\u2019s main focus is to help states fix problems as they arise; agency officials believe that withholding funds is counterproductive to meeting deadlines. As a result, the federal government has approved over $50 million for this one system; it has been in partial operation\u2014primarily in the smaller counties\u2014since mid-1993, and its expected completion is still not known.", "In another example, OCSE approved a state\u2019s proposal to meet functional requirements by developing a distributed system estimated to cost nearly $178 million to complete and maintain through 2000. This system involves developmental costs for at least 23 county databases, plus additional costs to maintain separate systems. While OCSE questioned the state about the additional costs of personnel, the agency\u2019s certification process does not require that a state receive an approval before moving from one phase of development to the next. By not visiting the project to review critical design documents, the agency was not able to effectively assess the distributed processing strategy and associated costs or to suggest an alternative approach. This state now estimates that the system will cost about $311 million to complete and maintain through 2000. Further, according to state officials, the system will not meet the October 1997 deadline.", "Systems managers from three states we visited indicated their desire that OCSE play a more active role. Systems that are being developed are very sophisticated, and the officials said that it was important for OCSE to assess the management and direction of the project early to avoid or minimize problems later. One state official said that OCSE should see itself as a stakeholder in the development of these systems and not just a reviewer to see if certain requirements were followed. Another official noted that OCSE is scrupulously hands-off with all, especially with the private sector. Another state official told us that because the contractor\u2019s work was so poor and late in delivery, the state had to support the project with more of its own staff, contributing to an increased cost of $20 million.

Some of the more significant state welfare reform systems requirements include establishing, by October 1, 1997, or following the close of the next regular legislative session, a statewide system for tracking paternity orders and acknowledgements of paternity; developing, by October 1, 1997, a new-hire registry on which employers will report information on employees recently hired, with the capability of reporting the information to a national database and issuing wage withholding notices to employers within 2 business days, and making data comparisons with the case registry database by May 1, 1998; developing, by October 1, 1998, a central case registry for all child support cases and support orders established or modified in the state after that date and, as of that date, capable of making data comparisons; and establishing, by October 1, 1998 (or by October 1, 1999, if court administered), a centralized unit to collect and disburse child support payments, and by October 1, 2000, a statewide child support system that meets all requirements.", "To comply with these mandates, many states will not only have to reassess the way child support cases are managed administratively but electronically as well. This may include developing new databases and electronic links to other public and private organizations, including financial institutions; credit bureaus; the Internal Revenue Service; and state agencies\u2014including judicial, corrections, licensing, business ownership, motor vehicle, labor, vital statistics, and Medicaid. For example, the requirement to develop a registry of paternities will likely result in the development of a new database that interfaces with departments or bureaus responsible for tracking statewide births. However, tracking these data electronically may be a challenge since some states have not automated the departments or bureaus responsible for birth certificates.", "The states will also have to develop automated interfaces with the national Federal Parent Locator Service and the yet-to-be-developed federal case registry and new-hire registry databases. The Federal Parent Locator Service is an electronic system that cross-matches data to help locate noncustodial parents across state lines through links with other state systems and existing national databases, such as those of the Internal Revenue Service, Social Security Administration, and Department of Labor.", "Both the new-hire registry and the federal case registry will also need to be designed to receive and compare state data on child support cases and noncustodial parents. The states, in turn, will be required to develop similar databases that electronically interface with these national systems. The federal new-hire and case registry systems must be completed by October 1, 1997, and October 1, 1998, respectively. OCSE has contracted with several vendors to develop the software for these databases and to provide states with technical assistance.", "Many states will have to adapt their existing systems and change laws governing child support operations to implement many of these systems requirements. For example, three states we visited indicated that existing laws governing the child support program and new-hire reporting requirements for employers would have to be amended or rescinded before mandated systems requirements could be implemented. Other states will have to make welfare reform system changes while finishing work on child support systems mandated by the 1988 act."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OCSE Plans to Address Welfare Reform", "paragraphs": ["While OCSE has initiated some steps to identify welfare reform systems issues and plans to change its approach in issuing functional requirements, the agency does not yet know the impact the legislation will have on state systems.

Guidance for developing the new-hire registries had not been completed, even though these registries are due to be in operation by October 1, 1997. However, OCSE does plan to apply lessons learned from technology projects mandated as part of the 1988 Family Support Act and release technical guidance for systems changes required by welfare reform incrementally. The early release of technical guidance should help states decide on systems requirements as soon as possible, minimizing project delays.", "With the increased funding being made available through welfare reform, OCSE plans to conduct more on-site reviews of child support systems projects to help identify and prevent costly systems development problems during earlier stages of the projects. The agency has also supported ACF user groups and established electronic information bulletin boards to identify and share information on systems issues. Further, OCSE is participating in welfare reform work groups with the states to discuss policy and systems-related issues. In January 1997, the agency also created a federal, state, and local government initiative to work with the eight largest states\u2014representing almost 50 percent of the child support cases. This initiative focuses on improving program performance, which may include automated systems issues. In addition, the agency recently queried the states to identify technical support needs and planned to issue, in May 1997, a national plan to better address OCSE technical assistance to the states\u2019 systems activities. Despite these early attempts to work with the states, according to OCSE\u2019s information systems director, the agency does not know the impact the welfare reform will have on the states\u2019 child support systems.

The amount remaining to be spent to bring all states into full legal compliance is unknown. At the time of our review, most states did not yet have fully functional child support enforcement systems. Aside from new requirements resulting from welfare legislation, only 12 states had federally certified child support enforcement systems; as many as 14 states\u2014responsible for about 44 percent of the national caseload\u2014may well miss the October 1, 1997, deadline for completing their automated systems.", "The causes are widespread. States have underestimated the magnitude, complexity, and costs of their projects and operations, and they could have received better guidance and assistance from the federal government, specifically OCSE. The lack of progress in the development of state child support systems also can be partly attributed to the agency\u2019s limited leadership and oversight and some states\u2019 inadequate systems approaches. OCSE\u2019s release of final functional requirements for the state systems was late, which encouraged some states to automate many tasks without adequate requirements management or control. Though ready, some states hesitated to make their systems\u2019 requirements final; it must be remembered that deadlines loomed, with or without final requirements. Another factor was OCSE\u2019s mandated transfer policy, which was premature and poorly implemented. This alone caused long-term problems, increased costs, and delays.", "Against this backdrop, which included the failure to fully implement recommendations we made some 5 years ago, OCSE allowed state systems with serious problems to proceed, thus escalating spending with no assurance that effective, efficient systems would result\u2014and many indicators to the contrary.

It did not require states to follow a structured systems development approach; nor did OCSE assess progress at critical decision points, thereby missing opportunities to intervene and successfully redirect systems development.", "OCSE relied on required annual planning documents, which were optimistic projections and for many states did not relate to the critical phases of system development. Certifications were narrowly focused and conducted only at a state\u2019s request, when the state was ready.

According to statutory requirements, the agency should review, assess, and inspect systems throughout development. Given the significance of state child support enforcement systems to the operation of the program and the magnitude of expenditures, it is critical that these systems be developed correctly and efficiently from the beginning. A philosophy of providing funds, despite serious systems problems and costly mistakes, misses the opportunity to reduce the risk of systems failure and save taxpayer dollars.

Monitoring at critical points in the development process allows earlier intervention and greater opportunity to correct problems before they become more costly. We disagree that this approach constitutes micromanagement; we believe that to do less constitutes lax management. These activities also need not create an administrative burden. OCSE does not have to impose additional reporting requirements on the states; it must simply streamline its existing reporting process to ensure the inclusion of key pieces of information at critical phases.
