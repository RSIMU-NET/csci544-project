Within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Office of Investigations (OI)--part of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)--is the primary federal agency responsible for investigating alien smuggling along the southwest border. As requested, this report addresses, for the southwest border, (1) OI's efforts to counter alien smuggling since 2005, and opportunities, if any, for ICE to use its resources more effectively; (2) the progress DHS has made in seizing alien smugglers' assets since fiscal year 2005 and any promising techniques that could be applied to seize smugglers' assets; and (3) the extent to which ICE has objectives related to alien smuggling and measures to assess progress. GAO interviewed officials in all four OI offices along the southwest border and analyzed data on OI's cases and seizures, from fiscal years 2005 through 2009."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["OI work years spent investigating alien smuggling increased from 190 to 197 from fiscal years 2005 through 2009, and an opportunity exists to better leverage resources. Officials from two of the four OI offices GAO visited said that in addition to conducting criminal investigations, OI has been tasked to respond to calls from state and local law enforcement to process and transport aliens for possible removal, which diverts OI resources from conducting alien smuggling and other investigations. In 2006, the Office of Detention and Removal Operations (DRO), another ICE subcomponent, took over responsibility for responding to state and local law enforcement calls in the Phoenix metropolitan area, through the Law Enforcement Agency Response (LEAR) program. For this program, officials from DRO, not OI, transport and process aliens for removal. From October 1, 2008, to May 24, 2009, the LEAR program processed 3,776 aliens, aliens who OI would have otherwise had to process. By studying the feasibility of expanding the LEAR program, ICE would be in a better position to determine if it could more efficiently direct its OI resources toward alien smuggling and other investigations. OI's alien smuggling asset seizures have decreased since 2005; however, opportunities exist to leverage additional seizure and financial investigative techniques. According to OI data, alien smuggling seizures nationwide increased in value from about $11.2 million in 2005 to about $17.4 million in 2007, but declined to about $12.2 million in fiscal year 2008 and to about $7.6 million in fiscal year 2009. One opportunity to leverage financial techniques to disrupt alien smuggling and seize assets involves assessing the financial investigative techniques used by an Arizona task force. The task force seized millions of dollars and disrupted alien smuggling operations by following cash transactions flowing through money transmitters that serve as the primary method of payment to those individuals responsible for smuggling aliens. An overall assessment of whether and how these techniques may be applied in the context of disrupting alien smuggling could help ensure that ICE is not missing opportunities to take additional actions and leverage resources to support the common goal of countering alien smuggling. ICE has established objectives for its alien smuggling-related enforcement programs, but could do more to better measure progress toward achieving program objectives. For example, one of its components, DRO, has defined the objective of the Mexican Interior Repatriation Program (MIRP) as to remove aliens who are apprehended during the hot and dangerous summer months from the United States to the interior of Mexico to deter them from returning in order to reduce loss of life and to help disrupt alien smuggling operations; however, DRO has not established performance measures to evaluate its progress in meeting its objective consistent with internal control standards. Thus, ICE does not know the effectiveness of its efforts related to MIRP at deterring individuals from illegally returning to the United States."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends, among other things, that DHS evaluate the feasibility of expanding the LEAR program, assess the Arizona Attorney General's investigations strategy, and develop performance measures for MIRP. DHS agreed with four of five recommendations in this report directed to DHS but disagreed with establishing MIRP performance measures because it did not believe such action was appropriate. GAO believes this recommendation is consistent with the program's intent."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Alien smuggling along the southwest border is an increasing threat to the  security of the United States and Mexico as well as to the safety of both  law enforcement and smuggled aliens. One reason for this increased threat  is the involvement of drug trafficking organizations in alien smuggling.  According to the National Drug Intelligence Center\u2019s (NDIC) National  Drug Threat Assessment 2008, the southwest border region is the principal  entry point for smuggled aliens from Mexico, Central America, and South  America. Aliens from countries of special interest to the United States  such as Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, and Pakistan (known as special interest  aliens) also illegally enter the United States through the region. According  to the NDIC assessment, Mexican drug trafficking organizations have  become increasingly involved in alien smuggling. These organizations  collect fees from alien smuggling organizations for the use of specific  smuggling routes, and available reporting indicates that some Mexican  drug trafficking organizations specialize in smuggling special-interest  aliens into the United States. As a result, these organizations now have  alien smuggling as an additional source of funding to counter U.S. and  Mexican government law enforcement efforts against them.", "Violence associated with alien smuggling has also increased in recent  years, particularly in Arizona. According to the NDIC assessment,  expanding border security initiatives and additional U.S. Border Patrol  resources are likely obstructing regularly used smuggling routes and  fueling this increase in violence, particularly violence directed at law  enforcement officers. Alien smugglers and guides are more likely than in  past years to use violence against U.S. law enforcement officers in order to  smuggle groups of aliens across the southwest border. In July 2009, a  border patrol agent was killed while patrolling the border by aliens  illegally crossing the border, the first shooting death of an agent in more  than 10 years. Conflicts are also emerging among rival alien smuggling  organizations. Assaults, kidnappings, and hostage situations attributed to  this conflict are increasing, particularly in Tucson and Phoenix, Arizona.  Communities across the country are at risk since among those individuals  illegally crossing the border are criminal aliens and gang members who  pose public safety concerns for communities throughout the country.", "Within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Office of  Investigations (OI)\u2014part of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement  (ICE)\u2014is responsible for investigating violations of a myriad of  immigration and customs-related laws and is the primary federal agency  responsible for investigating alien smuggling along the southwest border.  In 2005, we reported that the creation of DHS in March 2003 provided new  opportunities to more effectively combat alien smuggling, particularly in  reference to using financial investigative techniques to target and seize the  monetary assets of smuggling and that ICE officials expected asset  seizures to increase. Also within ICE, the Office of Detention and Removal  Operations (DRO) is responsible for detaining aliens who are subject to  removal, including those smuggled into the country, and enforcing their  removal from the United States. The Border Patrol within DHS\u2019s U.S.  Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is responsible for interdicting  smuggled aliens as illegal border-crossing attempts are made between the  ports of entry. CBP maintains several programs that address alien  smuggling and the Border Patrol also collaborates with OI in providing  information for alien smuggling investigations obtained during  interdictions. The Department of Justice (Justice) and its 93 U.S.  Attorney\u2019s offices located throughout the United States are responsible for  prosecuting individuals charged with violations of federal law, including  alien smuggling. Five U.S. Attorney\u2019s offices are located in the southwest  border region.", "In light of the increasing threat of alien smuggling along the southwest  border, you asked us to assess DHS\u2019s efforts to address alien smuggling.  Thus, this report addresses the following questions:    Since fiscal year 2005, what has been the trend regarding the amount of  investigative effort OI has devoted to alien smuggling along the southwest  border, what have been the results, and is there an opportunity for ICE to  use its investigative resources more effectively?", "What progress has DHS made in seizing assets related to alien smuggling  since fiscal year 2005 and what, if any, promising financial investigative  techniques could be applied along the southwest border to target and seize  the monetary assets of smuggling organizations?", "To what extent do ICE/OI and CBP have objectives related to alien  smuggling along the southwest border and to what extent have they  implemented internal controls to measure progress toward these  objectives?", "To address these questions, we conducted site visits and interviews with  officials in all four of the OI special agent-in-charge (SAC) offices along  the southwest border: San Diego, Phoenix, El Paso, and San Antonio. We  also interviewed officials with six of the nine Border Patrol sectors along  the southwest border\u2014San Diego and El Centro, California; Yuma and  Tucson, Arizona; and El Paso and Laredo, Texas. The six Border Patrol  sectors were selected based on their proximity to OI SAC offices we  visited and their varying volumes of removable alien apprehensions. While  the officials\u2019 perspectives that we obtained from the sectors cannot be  generalized to all Border Patrol officials along the southwest border, they  provided us with an overview of how their enforcement programs operate  within and across sectors. We also interviewed officials in all five U.S.  Attorney\u2019s districts along the southwest border.", "In addition, to address OI\u2019s use of investigative resources, we analyzed  data from fiscal years 2005 (the date of our last report) through 2009 from  TECS, the system OI uses to manage its cases. To identify possible  opportunities for ICE to use its investigative resources more effectively,  we analyzed self-reported investigation data from OI\u2019s case management  system from fiscal years 2005 through 2009 to determine the extent to  which investigative resources were spent on OI\u2019s main mission of  conducting criminal investigations. To address the results of OI  investigations, we analyzed data from Justice\u2019s Executive Office of U.S.  Attorneys for the period from fiscal years 2005 through 2009. To address  progress in seizing assets related to alien smuggling, we analyzed OI and  Border Patrol data on seizures made from fiscal years 2005 through 2009.  To determine what, if any, promising financial investigative techniques  could be applied along the southwest border to target and seize the  monetary assets of smuggling organizations we analyzed the federal  interagency 2007 National Money Laundering Strategy and its  accompanying 2005 U.S. Money Laundering Threat Assessment and an OI  report on the results of financial investigations, and interviewed OI  officials and Assistant U.S. Attorneys along the southwest border. In  addition, we interviewed the Arizona Attorney General and officials with  the Arizona Attorney General\u2019s Financial Crimes Task Force and analyzed  relevant court affidavits to obtain information on the results of their  efforts to address alien smuggling in Arizona. To address OI\u2019s alien  smuggling objectives and internal controls to measure progress toward  these objectives, we analyzed ICE\u2019s interim strategic plan and  performance data from fiscal years 2005 through 2009 and Justice  sentencing data on those convicted of alien smuggling from fiscal years  2005 thorough 2009. To address CBP\u2019s alien smuggling objectives and  internal controls to measure progress toward these objectives, we  analyzed program documents related to three CBP programs designed to  address alien smuggling, one former CBP program now managed by ICE,  CBP data on program results for various periods from 2005 to 2009, and  one Homeland Security Institute evaluation of one of these programs.", "To assess the reliability of data collected by ICE, Justice, and Border  Patrol, we conducted interviews with agency officials about data integrity  procedures and the methods by which data are checked and reviewed  internally for accuracy. We determined that despite limitations in certain  data collection and oversight processes discussed later in this report, the  data recorded in selected data fields were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of this report. To assess the reliability of the Homeland Security  Institute evaluation, we reviewed the scope, methodology and findings of  the evaluation with the lead researcher from the institute.

Often, alien smuggling  is conducted in order to obtain a financial or other material benefit for the  smuggler. The alien smuggling process from Mexico into the United States  along the southwest border using the services of a smuggling organization  is generally the same regardless of entry point. For instance, when  individuals travel to populated areas in Mexico just south of the border, a  smuggler representative will market smuggling services in that populated  area, and then the individuals will be moved across the international  border in some fashion (such as crossing a desert area or the Rio Grande  river), usually with a group of other smuggled aliens. Once across the  border, the smuggled aliens typically will be moved to a \u201cstash house\u201d  where they arrange for payment. In general, smuggled aliens do not carry  large amounts of cash when crossing the border for fear of being robbed.  For many smuggled aliens their final destination is a city in the interior of  the United States. To pay for their crossing these smuggled aliens have  arranged in advance for a family member or friend, called a \u201csponsor,\u201d in  the interior city to send the payment to the smuggler, most commonly via a  wire transfer company. Once payment is received, the aliens are moved to  their final destination by the smuggling organization.

ICE focuses on enforcement of immigration and customs laws  within the United States, and its mission is to detect and prevent terrorist  and criminal acts by targeting the people, money, and materials that  support terrorists and criminal networks. OI, among other things, is  responsible for investigating alien smuggling violations at the border and  beyond. In fiscal year 2010, OI had a budget of about $1.7 billion and as of  November 2009 had a staff of about 8,600, which includes investigators  and support staff responsible for all of OI\u2019s investigative areas nationwide.  The types of alien smuggling cases handled by OI can range from reactive  cases, resulting from a particular incident or referrals from other law  enforcement agencies, to proactive cases, resulting from intelligence  gathering or use of financial investigative techniques. According to OI  officials we interviewed, the majority of OI\u2019s alien smuggling investigations  are reactive cases initiated based on referrals from the Border Patrol or  local law enforcement as a result of alien smuggling interdictions made by  these agencies. Responding to these referrals leaves less investigative  resources to initiate proactive investigations. In addition, investigations  can vary in their complexity. For instance, some cases do not require  extensive investigation and investigation is limited to prosecuting the alien  smuggler caught in the act of smuggling aliens. Conversely, a recent  investigation conducted by OI in El Paso led to the indictment of a hotel  owner who devised a plan to smuggle hundreds of aliens into the country  from Mexico and harbor them using his hotel and other locations until  their families or \u201csponsors\u201d paid a fee, usually through a wire transfer  company such as Western Union or MoneyGram.

MIRP was operated and funded by CBP in fiscal years  2004 and 2005. MIRP is a coordinated humanitarian effort between the  governments of Mexico and the United States to return removable aliens  who are citizens of Mexico further into the interior of Mexico in hopes of  deterring them from again attempting illegal entry into the United States.  As a voluntary humanitarian program with no prosecutorial consequence,  candidates for MIRP include those who are identified as \u201chigh risk\u201d when  crossing the border illegally, such as women and children and the elderly  or infirm, as these populations are particularly vulnerable to heat or risk of  victimization by criminals operating in border regions.

OI officials reported that in the San Antonio SAC office,  investigators spent approximately the hours of the equivalent of two full- time investigators each week responding to non-investigation-related calls  from different police departments during fiscal year 2009. For the El Paso  SAC office, OI officials estimated spending 17 staff hours per week  responding to an average of 20 calls per week from local police  departments that are noninvestigative in nature. Officials in the two offices  stated that responding to noninvestigative calls from local police  departments left less time available for investigators to focus on  investigations of alien smuggling and other customs and immigration- related crimes. According to OI officials, to respond to a noninvestigative  police call, investigators need to travel to the location where the aliens are  being detained, which could involve traveling to locations that are several  hours away. OI investigators need to then transport the aliens back to their  office and prepare the paperwork related to the aliens\u2019 arrest and removal,  which in some cases can take up to 4 hours per alien.", "ICE\u2019s DRO is the DHS component primarily responsible for removing  aliens who are subject to removal and has positions for both deportation  officers and immigration enforcement agents that are commensurate with  this responsibility. In 2006, to respond to immigration-related calls for  assistance from state and local law enforcement agencies in the Phoenix  metropolitan area, DRO developed the LEAR program. OI was previously  the primary ICE office providing assistance to state and local law  enforcement agencies in the Phoenix area. From October 1, 2008, to May  24, 2009, the LEAR program processed 3,776 aliens, aliens who OI would  have had to process in the absence of the LEAR program.", "According to the Phoenix SAC, the LEAR program has been highly  successful. For example, the program has allowed his office to focus more  agents and technical resources on the proactive investigation of alien  smuggling cases rather than responding to local police calls. According to  TECS\u2019s self-reported investigation data, Phoenix increased the amount of  work hours on alien smuggling by 11 percent from fiscal year 2007 to fiscal  year 2008, the period subsequent to the implementation of the LEAR  program.", "According to DRO officials, the LEAR program is highly successful in the  Phoenix region because it offers local law enforcement agencies a  mechanism for an immediate federal response for handling aliens who  may be subject to removal. DRO headquarters officials stated that they  have discussed expanding the LEAR program beyond Phoenix but have  yet to conduct an evaluation to identify the best locations for expanding  the program. By studying the feasibility of expanding the LEAR program,  and expanding the program if feasible, ICE would be in a better position to  evaluate alternatives for aligning staff responsibilities to its subcomponent  agency missions and helping ensure that its resources are more efficiently  directed toward alien smuggling and other priority investigations.  According to ICE headquarters officials, OI investigators in the Southwest  would likely work on more alien smuggling cases if the LEAR program  expanded beyond the Phoenix area since alien smuggling is the second  most worked investigative area in all four southwestern SAC locations.  DRO officials estimate the cost of a LEAR program unit to be $7 million  per year for a fully staffed unit in one metropolitan area.", "In addition to its own investigations, OI has taken steps over the last 4  years to participate in or develop coordination efforts, working groups, or  task forces that address alien smuggling. These activities have been  primarily focused on regional border activities where OI has historically  encountered the greatest proportion of alien smuggling violations.  Appendix IV contains more detail on these coordination efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Alien Smuggling Asset Seizures Have Decreased since 2005; Opportunities Exist to Leverage Additional Financial Investigative and Seizure Techniques", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Value of OI Alien Smuggling Asset Seizures Has Decreased since 2005", "paragraphs": ["In 2005 we reported that OI and Treasury\u2019s Executive Office for Asset  Forfeiture anticipated that in fiscal year 2005 and in future years alien  smuggling investigations would result in increasing volumes of asset  seizures as OI applied its financial and money laundering expertise, which  it acquired when elements of legacy INS components and U.S. Customs  merged to form OI in 2003. For alien smuggling asset seizures, OI  collaborates with U.S. Attorney\u2019s office officials, who are responsible for  litigating any contested seizures and CBP, as the agency responsible for  processing seizures. According to data provided by OI, and shown in table  2, the value of alien smuggling seizures nationwide increased from about  $11.2 million in fiscal year 2005 to $17.4 million in fiscal year 2007, but  declined to $7.6 million in fiscal year 2009. According to ICE, alien  smuggling generates illicit revenues estimated to reach billions of dollars  annually. Seizures of currency; means of transporting smuggled aliens,  such as automobiles and boats; and real estate make up the bulk of OI\u2019s  asset seizures. The remainder of seizures is made up of drugs, counterfeit  goods, weapons, and other items, such as computers.", "OI officials attributed the decline in alien smuggling asset seizures from  fiscal years 2007 through 2009 to several factors. First, the declining real  estate market throughout the United States has made homes used as stash  houses for smuggled aliens less attractive for seizure because the homes  generally have little or no equity available. Second, enhanced border  security during this period, according to OI officials, and a corresponding  decrease in alien smuggling activity, may also have led to a decline in  assets seized. For example, the amount of currency seized by OI may be  affected if increased enforcement on the border results in a larger  percentage of alien smuggling loads being interdicted before making their  way to the interior of the United States. These interdictions reduce  criminal alien smuggling proceeds subject to seizure because the smuggled  alien has not had the opportunity to pay the smuggler before being  apprehended. Third, OI officials also cite the declining U.S. economy as  leading to a general decline in alien smuggling activity. According to the  officials, most smuggled aliens are drawn to the United States for  economic reasons. The lack of opportunity for employment during this  period may have affected the decision of aliens to illegally enter the United  States using the services of alien smuggling organizations.", "According to OI officials in all four SAC offices we visited, OI had  increased its efforts to identify and seize assets related to alien smuggling.  Each of the four SAC offices had an asset forfeiture unit that supported OI  investigations, including alien smuggling investigations. This unit, for  example, reviews financial data such as bank records that OI investigators  obtain through a subpoena, to identify potential assets, such as bank  accounts, vehicles, or real estate, that can be seized and also to identify  other individuals who may be involved in the alien smuggling organization.  According to ICE headquarters officials, all OI investigators receive basic  training on financial investigative techniques, which includes the various  resources that are available to investigators. All OI investigators also have  access via their computers to financial information available through a  FinCEN financial transactions database. According to FinCEN officials,  the database allows OI investigators to directly query BSA data such as  suspicious activity reports (SAR) and currency transaction reports (CTR).  FinCEN officials stated that the BSA data housed in this database  represent millions of financial transactions from banks, money  transmitters, insurance companies, and other industries that report  information to FinCEN.", "FinCEN also provides financial analyses upon request by law enforcement  agencies, including OI. These analyses provide FinCEN\u2019s evaluation of  financial records that span various types of financial institutions and can  connect multiple individuals with illicit transactions. Approximately 60  such analysis requests were made of FinCEN by OI investigators related to  alien smuggling cases from August 2004 to April 2009. FinCEN also acts as  a liaison between domestic law enforcement agencies that make requests  for financial information from abroad and foreign entities that maintain  financial information. According to OI officials, OI investigators do not  extensively rely upon FinCEN for this service because the process can  take 45- to 60 days before financial information is returned to the  investigator subsequent to the initial request. According to FinCEN  officials, this 45 to 60-day time period is due to the time it takes for foreign  financial entities to respond, which is beyond FinCEN\u2019s control. Instead,  OI investigators rely upon ICE\u2019s OIA attach\u00e9s, stationed in most foreign  countries, who are able to retrieve financial information needed for  investigations within several days.", "In addition to using financial information to track and seize assets, OI  investigators can use financial information to help convict someone under  those provisions of the alien smuggling statute that carry higher penalties.  When prosecuting an alien smuggling case, evidence that the suspected  smuggler was engaging in the activity for financial gain is necessary in  order to obtain enhanced penalties for alien smuggling convictions. Such  financial information helps connect an alleged smuggler with the crime of  smuggling and also can support enhanced penalties should the smuggler  be convicted.", "OI investigators we interviewed reported that they rely upon a variety of  information sources when tracking financial information associated with  alien smuggling, ranging in level of sophistication. One investigator  described how documents, such as transaction slips from a bank or wire  transfer company that demonstrate that a smuggler received payment for  smuggling services, can be among the most successful pieces of financial  evidence used against smugglers. The investigator also described logs that  list smuggled alien names and payment amounts, often found in stash  houses, as strong financial evidence to use against alien smugglers.  Financial analysis, whereby OI analysts evaluate smugglers\u2019 incomes and  expenses and are able to identify illicit funds (usually in the form of  unexplained income), is also a useful technique, according to another  investigator. An investigator working in another southwest border office  stated that tracking multiple money service bank transactions to one  smuggler\u2019s identity is often the strongest type of evidence that the  investigator can provide for an alien smuggling prosecution. Other  investigators we interviewed stated that much of this information is  gathered through the use of subpoenas, obtained by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s  offices.

According to Border Patrol officials, the Border Patrol has the  legal authority (as do all agencies with enforcement authority under Title  8) to seize vehicles, vessels, aircraft, or other commercial conveyances  that are involved in criminal activity. After a seizure and forfeiture, the  Border Patrol has the option to keep the property or to auction it off and  release the proceeds to the Treasury Forfeiture Fund. Border Patrol  officials in each of the sectors we visited stated that a primary benefit of  seizing alien smuggler assets is that it disrupts their smuggling activities.  For example, Border Patrol officials in one sector stated that when an  expensive vehicle, such as a tractor trailer, is seized, alien smugglers must  expend new resources to replace the vehicle in order to continue  operating. The seizure therefore increases costs to the alien smuggling  business and disrupts the operation until a replacement vehicle is  purchased.", "As shown in table 4, 90 percent of all Border Patrol seizures made during  alien smuggling apprehensions are vehicles. While the volume of vehicles  seized remained relatively constant from fiscal years 2005 through 2006,  the number of vehicles seized declined from fiscal years 2007 through  2009. Border Patrol headquarters officials attribute the decline in alien  smuggling asset seizures to the decline in overall apprehensions since  2006.

Civil asset forfeiture authority allows  federal authorities to seize property used to facilitate a crime without first  having to convict the property owner of a crime. We reported in 2005 that  Justice and ICE headquarters officials said that a concern for investigators  was the lack of adequate statutory civil forfeiture authority for seizing real  property\u2014particularly stash houses used by smugglers that were not  owned by the smugglers. According to Justice, in 2005 analysis of civil and  criminal forfeiture statutes generally led the department to conclude that a  statute that provides only for criminal and not civil forfeiture of facilitating  property will be inadequate in such cases. We recommended that the  Attorney General, in collaboration with the Secretary of Homeland  Security, consider developing and submitting to Congress a legislative  proposal, with appropriate justification, for amending the civil forfeiture  authority for alien smuggling. Justice agreed with our recommendation. In  response to this recommendation, civil asset forfeiture authority for real  property used to facilitate alien smuggling was sought by Justice and  incorporated into several larger bills addressing immigration enforcement  or reform since 2005, but none of these bills had been enacted into law as  of March 2010. According to Justice officials, the current administration  has not yet taken a position on civil asset forfeiture authority for alien  smuggling cases.", "We continue to believe it is important for Justice to submit its views to  Congress as to whether it needs civil asset forfeiture authority to seize real  property used to facilitate alien smuggling in order to combat this crime  effectively. During our site visits along the southwest border, OI  investigators indicated that lack of such authority makes it difficult to  seize real estate involved in alien smuggling activity. For example, in one  OI office, officials pointed to a graphic depiction of over 300 stash houses  the investigators were aware of over the past several years in one  metropolitan area. The officials stated that they were able to seize only  one of those houses and that civil asset forfeiture authority would have  made it easier to seize far more. As we reported in 2005, civil asset  forfeiture laws are designed to strike a balance between the law  enforcement and property interests involved, and a proposal to expand  civil forfeiture for alien smuggling to correspond with that permitted for  drug trafficking or money laundering would need to take this context into  account."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Arizona Attorney General Has Disrupted Alien Smuggling Operations and Seized Assets by Focusing on Money Services Businesses; Opportunities Exist to Leverage These Resources", "paragraphs": ["According to Arizona law enforcement officials and court affidavits we  reviewed, wire transfers through money services businesses (MSB) are a  primary method of payment for smuggled aliens in the southwest border  region. The federal interagency 2007 National Money Laundering Strategy  and its accompanying 2005 U.S. Money Laundering Threat Assessment  identify MSBs as an increasing threat for laundering illicit proceeds.  According to the strategy, MSBs are becoming increasingly attractive to  criminal groups for several reasons. The majority of wire transfers at  MSBs are paid for with cash and therefore MSBs provide excellent  camouflage for the initial introduction of the illicit proceeds into the  financial system. The sheer volume of legitimate cash transactions also  provides an excellent camouflage for money laundering activity in this  placement stage. MSBs offer inexpensive services and often impose less  rigorous anti-money laundering programs and compliance than traditional  financial institutions. Lastly, with offices in thousands of cities around the  world, MSBs allow customers to move funds from nearly any location  directly to any other location. The strategy states that law enforcement  believes that large amounts of funds sent to the southwest border via  MSBs are related to alien smuggling.", "In order to address the threat posed by alien smugglers\u2019 use of MSBs, in  2000 the Arizona Financial Crimes Task Force (the Task Force), composed  of investigators from the Arizona Department of Public Safety, the Arizona  Attorney General\u2019s Office, the Phoenix Police Department, and the former  U.S. Customs Service, implemented a strategy that focused on following  the money flowing through MSBs in Arizona to identify suspected alien  smugglers and those MSBs that may be complicit in laundering proceeds  from alien smuggling. The Task Force\u2019s strategy contained the following  major investigative techniques:    CTRs and SARs. The Task Force began analyzing CTRs in 1999 prior to the  initiation of SAR reporting for MSBs in 2001. Under Arizona law as well  as federal law, an MSB is required to file a SAR if the MSB suspects, for  example, that the transaction is related to a possible violation of law or  regulation. Task Force investigators analyzed these SARs to identify  potential smugglers.", "Geographic targeting orders (GTO). Beginning in June 2003, Arizona  issued a GTO that allows the state to require additional identification or  reporting requirements for certain financial transactions in a geographic  area. Under the GTO, for all person-to-person transactions arriving in high- volume MSB locations in the southern one-third of the state in amounts  over $500, Arizona required MSBs to obtain the receivers\u2019 fingerprints and  signatures.", "Transaction data. According to Task Force officials, the foundation to  their strategy has been their ability to obtain and analyze data from  individual MSB transactions. Each transaction has a unique money  transfer control number and contains, for example, the sender\u2019s name and  address, the amount sent, the sending MSB\u2019s unique identification number,  the receiver\u2019s name and address, the amount received, as well as the  receiving MSB\u2019s unique identification number. Using the Arizona Attorney  General\u2019s subpoena power, the Task Force initially obtained data on all  transactions greater than $750 (in 2003 the threshold changed to $500)  entering or leaving Arizona from all major MSBs in the Phoenix area.  Using computer analytics software, the Task Force searched for data  anomalies that based upon Task Force officials\u2019 experience, could indicate  laundering of alien smuggling proceeds. For example:  Individuals who and MSBs that conducted more transactions and  received larger dollar amounts than the norm.  Individuals who received the same dollar amount consistent with the  going rate for smuggling an alien from numerous senders in different  states.", "MSBs that had a higher ratio of large to normal transactions than the  norm.", "Repetitive wire transfers in large amounts sent to the same receiver  names within a few days.", "Patterns of false information appearing in MSB transaction records,  such as a receiver providing multiple addresses, Social Security  numbers, or telephone numbers for wire transfers received over a  short time (such as a few months).", "Patterns of imbalance in the volume of wire transfers sent to Arizona  from corridor states (states most preferred by smuggled aliens as final  destinations) compared to the volume of wire transfers sent from  Arizona to those corridor states.", "These anomalies were occurring during the time of year when most alien  smuggling was believed to be occurring, what the Task Force called the  \u201cseasonal coyote pattern.\u201d Using criteria such as these, the Task Force  selected a random sample of transactions to determine the extent to which  the criteria could be relied upon to identify potential smugglers, MSBs  involved in alien smuggling, or both. According to a court affidavit filed by  a Task Force investigator, over 90 percent of the transactions selected in  the various samples taken since the Task Force began analyzing these data  were related to alien smuggling, including in some cases those for other  criminal activity, such as drug trafficking. Since the Task Force began  analyzing these data, it has refined its criteria based upon evidence  obtained during its investigations and additional data analysis. According  to Task Force officials, the Task Force has a database containing millions  of transactions and continues to receive transaction data on a weekly  basis from some of the major MSBs in Arizona.", "Seizure warrants. Based upon the above analysis of MSB transaction data  as well as other evidence gathered through traditional law enforcement  actions, the Task Force obtained approximately 20 court-ordered warrants  from the summer of 2001 through 2006 to seize wire transfers it believed  were for the payment of alien smuggling or narcotics trafficking. Under the  warrant, the MSB was ordered to electronically divert into a holding  account wire transfers sent to or from Arizona that matched specifically  targeted names or criteria. When the receiving individuals tried to obtain  the funds, they were told that the funds had been seized by the state and  that they could call a dedicated 1-800 number if they believed the state  erred in seizing their funds. According to Task Force officials, most of the  seizures were not contested.", "According to Arizona law enforcement officials, while alien smuggling into  Arizona has not been eliminated, the above strategy has significantly  disrupted alien smuggling operations in Arizona and has largely eliminated  the ability of MSBs in Arizona to receive smuggling payments. According  to Arizona law enforcement officials, since 2001 they seized about   $17 million in funds transacted through MSBs, arrested over 300 alien  smugglers, and seized 8 car dealerships and 9 travel agencies involved in  alien smuggling. They also shut down approximately 35 MSB outlets in  Arizona for facilitating illicit transactions. Arizona law enforcement  investigators described how their strategy of targeting MSBs led to  disruptions of alien smuggler activities. For example, surveillance of MSBs  suspected to be involved in laundering alien smuggling payments  identified suspected smugglers who were then followed, enabling Task  Force investigators to locate previously unknown stash houses holding  undocumented aliens. In one instance, evidence found at one such stash  house led investigators to identify and eventually prosecute owners of a  travel agency that provided airline tickets to move undocumented aliens  from the border area to the interior to the United States. The evidence led  to the seizure of 6 travel agencies engaged in alien smuggling. According to  Task Force officials, analysis of wire transfer data has resulted in  identifying other criminal activity as well, including narcotics trafficking,  off-shore gambling, criminal activity by members of the Russian Mafia, and  identity theft.", "As shown in figure 5, the dollar amount of wire transfers over $500  declined from a high of over $35 million per month in March 2005 to less  than $10 million by March 2006, and to nearly zero by August 2006.  According to an Arizona Attorney General senior litigation counsel, the  declines in March to April of 2005 and February to March of 2006  coincided with seizure warrants conducted by the Task Force during these  time periods. In June 2006, Western Union, the largest MSB in Arizona and  whose agents were the target of several Task Force investigations,  imposed a limit of $450 on the amount of funds that could be wired into  Arizona from any location, in effect, inhibiting smugglers\u2019 ability to use  Western Union agents since the smuggling fee at that time was at least  $1,800 per person. In addition, in 2008 Western Union was fined $2 million  for, among other things, failure to comply with the Arizona Attorney  General\u2019s GTO, failure to record required customer identification, and  failure to comply with a previous 2006 order that it comply with the  Arizona Attorney General\u2019s GTO and record required customer  identification. In 2006 Western Union was also fined $5 million for failing  to comply with the Arizona Attorney General\u2019s GTO and record required  customer identification.", "As a result of Arizona\u2019s enforcement efforts and the $450 Western Union  limit on wire transfers to Arizona, alien smugglers have adjusted their way  of receiving smuggling payments. According to Task Force officials and  court affidavits, payments for aliens smuggled into Arizona are now wired  to smuggler contacts in Mexico or to contacts in other U.S. states, such as  Nevada. The contacts then notify the smuggler once payment has been  received. Arizona law enforcement officials attempted to obtain a warrant  to seize certain wire transfers sent from other states to Mexico. However,  the Arizona Supreme Court eventually ruled that the state court did not  have jurisdiction to issue such a warrant. According to federal law  enforcement officials in Arizona, alien smugglers also now use \u201cfunnel  accounts,\u201d which are deposit accounts established at traditional banks for  the purpose of holding payments for smuggling services. The officials  provided the example of a large U.S. bank, with a nationwide branch and  automated teller machine (ATM) network. A deposit account would be  opened in Arizona with this bank and sponsors of smuggled aliens could  then deposit payment for smuggling services directly into this account  through an ATM or bank office from anywhere in the United States. The  alien smuggler could then withdraw money from this account.", "According to both OI and Arizona law enforcement officials, one of OI\u2019s  predecessors (the U.S. Customs Service) began as a partner in Arizona\u2019s  seizure activity, and OI continued that role until it withdrew in 2005 after  concerns about alien safety and the legality of the seizure warrants used  by Arizona law enforcement officials. According to OI officials, there was  a concern that alien smugglers might harm or hold hostage the smuggled  aliens once payments for smuggling services were seized. In addition, OI  and Justice officials told us that they had concerns that Arizona\u2019s seizure  warrants that focused on seizing wire transfers based upon their  characteristics (e.g., dollar amount, coming from a specific state, or being  picked up at a specific MSB location) rather than a specific individual  known to be a smuggler may not be allowed under federal law.

OI plans to track as a  performance measure asset seizures across investigative areas and has  implemented a new measure that tracks the dollar value of asset seizures  derived from drug operations. Tracking the use of asset seizures in alien  smuggling investigations as a performance measure could help OI monitor  its progress toward its goal of denying smuggling organizations the profit  from criminal acts. Alien smuggling is the second most resource-intensive  investigative area (next to drug trafficking) in OI\u2019s southwest border  locations. Monitoring the use of alien smuggling asset seizures could also  help assess the worthiness of seizure techniques and help assess  investigative resource needs.", "Although DRO and CBP have defined the objectives of their alien  smuggling-related enforcement programs, they have not yet established  performance measures. For MIRP, while DRO does not currently have  performance measures, the program has had performance measures in the  past. When the former INS established MIRP as a pilot program in 1996, it  established performance measures for the program. According to INS\u2019s  operational plan for the program, the recidivism rate for removable aliens  processed through MIRP should not exceed 5 percent within the first 6  months and should not exceed 20 percent within the first year of initial  processing. The plan noted that after the first year, the recidivism rate  should not exceed 40 percent in order for the program to be considered  successful.", "Although DRO has not established any performance measures to measure  MIRP\u2019s effectiveness, there is evidence that removable aliens processed  through MIRP may be less likely to reenter the United States illegally.  According to a 2005 Homeland Security Institute study, 7 percent of the  removable aliens repatriated through the program were reapprehended  during the following 2-\u00bd-month period while 28 percent of the removable  aliens not repatriated through MIRP were reapprehended during the same  period, as shown in table 6.", "For the OASISS program, CBP officials told us that they are in the process  of developing measures.

CBP officials told us in January  2010 that the final approval of the framework and corresponding  performance measures was pending and they expect to implement  performance measures for the OASISS program during fiscal year 2010.  CBP has not established performance measures for ATEP and Operation  Streamline to assess progress toward achieving program goals. According  to CBP officials, while they have not established ATEP performance  measures for the entire southwest border, measures are in place at the  Border Patrol sector level based upon reapprehensions. However, they  acknowledged that because these measures are not assessing performance  for the entire southwest border, the full effect of ATEP is unknown.  Regarding Operation Streamline, CBP officials agree that there are no  performance measures in place for the program. Without performance  measures for MIRP, the OASISS program, ATEP, and Operation  Streamline, DRO and CBP program officials may lack critical information  with which to track the progress they are making toward program goals.", "The Homeland Security Institute evaluation of MIRP offers insight into  possible performance measures that CBP could use to evaluate the  effectiveness of ATEP and Operation Streamline.

By studying the feasibility of expanding the LEAR program along  the southwest border, ICE would be in a better position to evaluate  alternatives for aligning the duties of its OI staff with OI\u2019s investigative  mission and helping ensure more efficient use of its resources. Assessing  whether the Arizona Attorney General\u2019s financial investigative techniques  could be used and would be useful in disrupting alien smuggling would  better position OI in determining whether it could take advantage of an  opportunity to further its mission. Developing performance measures for  alien smuggling asset seizures would allow ICE to assess progress toward  this particular goal. Reassessing the prior proposal to Congress for civil  asset forfeiture authority in view of current circumstances would help  determine whether amending the civil forfeiture authority for real property  used to facilitate the smuggling of aliens remains necessary. Further, DRO  and CBP manage programs that counter alien smuggling, but have not  developed performance measures for some of their programs.

We  selected these six Border Patrol sectors based on their proximity to the OI  SAC offices we visited and their varying volumes of alien apprehensions.  The Tucson and San Diego sectors had the highest levels of apprehensions  during fiscal year 2008, approximately 320,000 and 160,000 apprehensions,  respectively. In contrast, the Yuma sector had relatively few  apprehensions in fiscal year 2008 after experiencing declines from  approximately 120,000 apprehensions in fiscal year 2006 to about 8,400 in  fiscal year 2008.

While data on the results of the program are limited,  Border Patrol officials we interviewed believed that the program helped  them to disrupt or even remove alien smuggling organizations from their  sectors since smuggled aliens cannot easily return to their original  locations to try and reenter the United States with the help of the  smuggling organizations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Disposition of Alien Smuggling Cases along the Southwest Border", "paragraphs": ["Evaluation of data provided by the Department of Justice (Justice)  provides additional information regarding enforcement consequences for  alien smuggling cases. While OI\u2019s current data system does not capture the  number of cases under a particular statute that are referred to and  prosecuted by U.S. Attorneys, sentencing data provided by Justice contain  information on the overall number of cases received, filed, acquitted,  dismissed, terminated, and sentenced under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324 from fiscal  year 2005 through fiscal year 2009. Table 8 shows that U.S. Attorneys in  the southwest border region received over 3,400 cases from federal law  enforcement agencies under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324 in fiscal year 2009. U.S.  Attorneys also convicted nearly 3,000 defendants under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324 in  fiscal year 2009. According to EOUSA, almost all alien smuggling cases in  the southwest border region are submitted to U.S. Attorneys by either OI  or the Border Patrol.", "As shown in figure 6, the number of alien smuggling cases referred by law  enforcement agencies to U.S. Attorney\u2019s offices along the southwest  border peaked in 2006 and has declined each year since then. The number  of cases filed by U.S. Attorneys and the number of individuals convicted  generally increased from fiscal years 2005 through 2008, but declined  slightly in fiscal year 2009.", "In fiscal year 2009, the majority of alien smuggling convictions resulted in  a prison term of 2 years or less or no prison at all. Table 9 illustrates that  of the 2,980 alien smugglers convicted in one of the southwest border  districts, 14 percent did not go to prison, 71 percent were sentenced to 1 to  24 months, and 15 percent were sentenced to more than 24 months of jail  time. Conviction statistics from previous years show that since 2005 the  majority of alien smugglers received prison terms of 2 years or less or no  prison at all.", "According to OI, many of these convictions are CBP cases that involve  low-level participants in alien smuggling schemes and these individuals  generally receive lower sentences based on current federal sentencing  guidelines. Also, defendants convicted of alien smuggling under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7  1324 may also have been convicted of other charges, which could have  resulted in higher prison sentences."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Immigration and Customs Enforcement Office of Investigations Alien Smuggling Coordination Efforts", "paragraphs": ["ICE\u2019s OI has taken steps over the last 4 years to participate in or develop  coordination efforts, working groups, or task forces that address alien  smuggling. These activities have been primarily focused on regional  border activities where OI has historically encountered the greatest  proportion of alien smuggling violations. The objectives of these activities  and working groups have been to share intelligence and resources and  identify and remove vulnerabilities on the southwest border. Table 10  summarizes the various OI coordination efforts that involve alien  smuggling.", "ICE established the Border Enforcement Security Task Forces (BEST) to  investigate any cross-border criminal activity along the southwest border,  including alien smuggling. The BESTs are tasked with leveraging federal,  state, local, tribal, and foreign law enforcement and intelligence resources  in an effort to identify, disrupt, and dismantle organizations that seek to  exploit vulnerabilities in the border. The task forces include personnel  from ICE; CBP; the Drug Enforcement Administration; the Bureau of  Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; the Federal Bureau of  Investigation; the U.S. Coast Guard; and U.S. Attorney\u2019s Offices along with  relevant state, local, and foreign law enforcement agencies. There are  currently 10 BESTs along the southwest border out of the 15 around the  country.", "The BEST effort has resulted in a number of cases initiated and  convictions. From 2004 through June 2009, the BESTs initiated 515 cases  related to alien smuggling and obtained 395 alien smuggling convictions.  While it is unknown whether these results would have been achieved  without the BESTs, ICE and Border Patrol officials from the locations we  visited cited other benefits to BEST coordination. For example, ICE  officials indicated that prior to the BEST effort, they had limited  coordination on alien smuggling investigations across the law enforcement  agencies involved. However, since the BEST effort began, the officials  stated that they are better able to learn from one another and to  understand the methods used by the various agencies in performing their  missions. Moreover, officials from ICE and Border Patrol offices we  visited told us that agents assigned to the BESTs are usually colocated,  which has facilitated information sharing and assisted in building working  relationships between the two components. Border Patrol officials also  noted that the BESTs allow them to coordinate on a more formal level,  thereby also serving as a built-in conflict resolving mechanism between  the components. Another benefit of the BESTs is having clearly defined  roles and responsibilities among all of the BEST members, according to  ICE officials. This has, in turn, helped ICE decrease chances for mission  creep or performing duplicative efforts. In addition, ICE and Border Patrol  officials told us that they have been able to share staff from each other\u2019s  agencies. For example, officials stated that ICE and the Border Patrol have  each provided staff to augment the other\u2019s operations, allowing for  seamless BEST operations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Comments from the Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Michael P.
