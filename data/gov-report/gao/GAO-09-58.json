Concerns arose that HHS's and DHS's responses to the incidents were delayed and ineffective. GAO was asked to examine (1) the factors that affected HHS's and DHS's responses to the incidents, (2) the extent to which HHS and DHS made changes to response procedures as a result of the incidents, and (3) HHS's and DHS's efforts to assess the effectiveness of changes made as a result of the incidents. GAO reviewed agency documents and interviewed officials about the procedures in place at the time of the incidents and changes made since."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Various factors--a lack of comprehensive procedures for information sharing and coordination and border inspection shortfalls--hindered the federal response to the two TB incidents. GAO's past work and federal internal control standards call for collaborative communication and coordination across agencies; communication flowing down, across, and up agencies to help managers carry out their internal control responsibilities; and effective leadership, capabilities, and accountability to ensure effective preparedness and response to hazardous situations. HHS and DHS finalized a memorandum of understanding in October 2005 intended to promote communication and coordination in response to public health incidents, but they had not fully developed operational procedures to share information and coordinate their efforts. Thus, HHS and DHS lost time locating or identifying the individuals to interdict them at the U.S. border. Also, HHS lacked procedures to coordinate with state and local health officials to determine when to use federal isolation and quarantine authorities, which further contributed to the delay in the federal response to one of the incidents. Finally, DHS had deficiencies in its process for inspecting individuals at the border, which caused delays in locating the individuals with TB. HHS and DHS have subsequently implemented procedures and tools intended to address deficiencies identified by the incidents, consistent with GAO's past work and internal control standards, but the departments could take additional steps to enhance their ability to respond to future TB incidents. Since the 2007 incidents, HHS and DHS have developed formal procedures for HHS to request DHS's assistance, and DHS has (1) developed a watch list for airlines to identify individuals with TB and other infectious diseases who are to be stopped from traveling and (2) revised its border inspection process to include a requirement that individuals with TB identified by HHS be subject to further inspection. DHS has also enhanced its process for creating public health alerts based on some variations of biographic information (e.g., name, date of birth, or travel document information), but has not explored the benefits of creating these alerts based on other variations, which impeded DHS's ability to interdict one of the individuals at the border. In addition, HHS has not yet completed efforts to provide information on changes in procedures to state and local health officials, who typically originate requests for assistance, to help mitigate delays in accessing federal assistance. HHS and DHS identified additional actions that need to be taken to further strengthen their response, but have not developed plans for completing them. HHS and DHS have activities under way to assess the effectiveness of the new procedures and tools, including performance monitoring and cross-agency meetings to discuss and revise the new procedures and tools based on actual experiences. HHS and DHS have coordinated on more than 70 requests for assistance since the 2007 incidents through February 2008; officials said they view each incident as a test of the efficacy of their responses."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["This report is a publicly available version of our report regarding  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Department of  Homeland Security (DHS) attempts to interdict two individuals with drug- resistant tuberculosis (TB) disease at the border so that they could direct  them to treatment. Our original report was designated law enforcement  sensitive because, according to DHS, it contained specific information of a  sensitive nature.", "An estimated 2 billion people\u2014one-third of the world\u2019s population\u2014are  infected with Mycobacterium (M.) tuberculosis, the bacterium that causes  TB, approximately 9 million of whom have transmissible TB disease. In  2007, more than 13,000 cases of TB disease were reported in the United  States. Without proper treatment, TB can be fatal. Moreover, health  officials are concerned that the number of individuals who have TB that is  resistant to many of the most effective medications is increasing  worldwide and these individuals have fewer options for effective  treatment. While the total number of individuals with drug-resistant TB in  the United States is relatively small (116 cases of multiple-drug-resistant  TB were reported in 2006, the most recent year for which such data are  available), these cases require significant human and financial resources to  provide care and treatment. An individual case of drug-resistant TB can  cost an average of $500,000 for in-patient hospital services alone. Because  drug-resistant TB can develop when a patient is nonadherent\u2014unwilling  or unable to follow a treatment regimen\u2014state and local health  departments and federal agencies have a responsibility to work together to  help ensure adherence as part of their effort to prevent the spread of TB in  the United States.", "In general, physicians and local health departments have the primary  responsibility for managing day-to-day care and treatment of individuals  with TB. State and local health departments are responsible for reporting  cases of TB to HHS. In addition to monitoring the occurrence of disease in  the United States, HHS has overall federal responsibility for preventing the  introduction of communicable diseases, such as TB, from foreign  countries. In so doing, HHS is to work with DHS, which is responsible for  reducing the threat of terrorism and natural crises, including bioterrorism.  By statute, U.S. customs officers are to assist in the enforcement of  quarantine rules and regulations. In October 2005, HHS and DHS signed a  memorandum of understanding intended to create a broad agreement for  the departments to share information and work together during public  health incidents.", "In the spring of 2007, HHS requested DHS\u2019s assistance in attempting to  interdict at the border two individuals with drug-resistant TB disease so  that they could direct them to treatment. According to HHS documents, in  May 2007, one of these individuals, a U.S. citizen, traveled abroad against  advice from physicians. When state and local health officials were unable  to find this person and serve him with a written order not to travel, they  requested help from HHS. While he was traveling abroad, HHS located him  and attempted to direct him to treatment. HHS then contacted DHS for  assistance. However, while HHS and DHS were determining a course of  action to attempt to prevent him from traveling further by airplane, he  once again traveled. Furthermore, as the departments were working to  intercept him at the U.S. border, he was able to reenter the country  because a U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer, in violation  of CBP policy, ignored a computerized alert in CBP\u2019s border screening and  inspection system to detain him. In a separate incident, a Mexican citizen  with drug-resistant TB who had a prior history of nonadherence to  treatment crossed the U.S.-Mexico border approximately 20 times during  April and May 2007. HHS and DHS worked together to try to prevent him  from crossing the border, but attempts to identify him in DHS databases  failed on several occasions. According to HHS officials, both individuals  were eventually located and received treatment, and none of the people  who might have been in contact with these individuals were reported to  have contracted TB.", "Both TB incidents required a coordinated federal response\u2014mainly from  HHS\u2019s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and DHS\u2019s  Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and CBP\u2014in order to locate  the individuals and conduct activities to protect their health and the health  of the public. However, HHS was unable to deter the travel of these  individuals and DHS was initially unable to interdict them at the border.  You raised questions concerning HHS\u2019s and DHS\u2019s responses to the TB  incidents. Because of these questions, we examined: (1) What factors  affected HHS\u2019s and DHS\u2019s responses to the two TB incidents? (2) To what  extent have HHS and DHS made changes to response procedures as a  result of the TB incidents? (3) What are HHS and DHS doing to assess the  effectiveness of any operational changes they have made in response to  the TB incidents?", "To determine what factors affected HHS\u2019s and DHS\u2019s responses to the two  TB incidents, we reviewed the policies and procedures each had in place  at the time of the incidents for conducting a coordinated response to a  public health incident, as well as laws and regulations. We interviewed  headquarters officials at HHS, CDC, DHS, CBP, and TSA about their  responses. In addition, we visited a land port of entry that was involved in  one of the incidents\u2014the Bridge of the Americas in El Paso, Texas\u2014and  an air port of entry\u2014Dulles International Airport outside of Washington,  D.C.\u2014to obtain additional information about the procedures in place at  the time of the incidents. We examined whether the existing procedures  for information sharing between HHS and DHS provided for timely  response to the incidents\u2014that is, whether officials were sufficiently  knowledgeable of their roles to respond to the incidents immediately. In  so doing, we compared their responses to the incidents with prior GAO  reports on practices to enhance and sustain agency collaboration and our  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government for guidelines  on internal controls\u2014components of an organization\u2019s management that  provide reasonable assurance that certain objectives, including  effectiveness and efficiency of operations, are being achieved.", "To identify changes made to response procedures as a result of the TB  incidents, we reviewed new and revised policy documents and interviewed  HHS and DHS officials as to whether and how their procedures were  changed and whether new ones were created. We observed the use of new  agency procedures and interviewed HHS and DHS officials at the Bridge of  the Americas and Dulles International Airport. To identify the extent to  which these changes addressed limitations identified by the incidents, we  reviewed agency documents, including HHS\u2019s and CDC\u2019s after-action  reports on the TB incident involving the U.S. citizen. These after-action  reports identified deficiencies in their response to the TB incidents and  made recommendations to improve their response in future incidents. We  also reviewed HHS\u2019s and CDC\u2019s plans and policies for tracking the steps  they are taking to address the recommendations identified in the after- action reports. At the time we conducted our review, DHS and the White  House Homeland Security Council were preparing after-action reports on  the U.S. citizen incident, and DHS and HSC officials separately briefed us  on the content of their after-action reports, including the vulnerabilities  exposed by the incidents and corrective actions taken. We also analyzed  the implementation of new and existing public health tools for homeland  security developed as part of new HHS and DHS procedures.", "To determine what HHS and DHS are doing to assess the effectiveness of  any operational changes they have made in response to the TB incidents,  we reviewed documents, including the departments\u2019 plans to develop a  compilation report of all after-action reports completed annually, to  identify trends in agency response needs and to make further revisions to  procedures as needed. We also interviewed HHS, CDC, and DHS officials  about their plans to monitor the performance of any new procedures and  tools.", "We are not generalizing our findings to other infectious diseases or  broader public health incident response because of the unique nature of  the course of events that unfolded during the two TB incidents and  because the diagnosis, pathology, and treatment of TB disease differ from  those of other diseases. We also did not examine any international factors  that might have affected the response to the incidents, nor did we examine  the potential effect of any changes made by the departments on  international health organizations or coordination for international public  health incident response. We conducted this performance audit from  October 2007 through October 2008 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and  perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a  reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit  objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["M. tuberculosis, the bacterium that causes TB, is spread from person to  person, usually through coughing, sneezing, or speaking. TB disease  occurs when the bacteria actively multiply in the lungs or other sites in the  body. If left untreated, a person with TB disease can spread the bacteria  to an average of 10 to 15 people each year. Also, without proper treatment,  TB can be fatal. Because the bacteria that cause TB are naturally slow- growing, final confirmed diagnosis of TB disease, including a  determination of drug resistance, can take from 6 to 16 weeks, according  to CDC. This lengthy process, along with other factors, makes diagnosis of  TB difficult. (Fig. 1 provides information about the characteristics of TB.)", "TB disease is treated with a combination of TB medications that must be  taken regularly. Individuals who have TB bacteria that are not resistant to  drugs can be treated with 6 to 9 months of the most effective medications.  Those with TB bacteria that are resistant to at least two of the most  effective medications (multiple-drug-resistant TB) require treatment for 18  to 24 months with other TB medications that are much less effective,  usually have more negative side effects, and are more expensive.  Nonadherence to the drug regimen can lead to the development of drug- resistant TB, which can be transmitted from a person with active disease  to an uninfected person in the same way that non-drug-resistant TB is  transmitted. If a person infected with a drug-resistant strain of TB  develops TB disease, his or her strain will be drug resistant as well.", "Because adherence to treatment regimens is essential to prevent TB  bacteria from becoming resistant to available medications, individuals  diagnosed with TB disease in the United States are typically treated via  directly observed therapy. In such therapy, patients take their medications  in the presence of a health care provider, from several times a week to  every day.

According to CDC officials, in an effort to limit disclosure  of individuals\u2019 private medical information, agency staff generally refrain  from sharing identifying information with each other, even when  discussing a potential incident, preferring to refer to people and places as  \u201cthe patient\u201d or \u201chospital A.\u201d On the other hand, CBP and TSA, as a law  enforcement and security agency, respectively, need accurate and  complete identifying information to locate and detain individuals. In the  incident involving the U.S. citizen, CDC officials took several hours to  provide the person\u2019s name and health information after initially contacting  DHS for assistance because they were unsure how the information was  going to be used and protected. CDC\u2019s hesitancy delayed CBP\u2019s  dissemination of a be-on-the-lookout notice and placement of an alert in  TECS. CDC officials indicated that generalized concerns over the  applicability of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of  1996 (HIPAA) and Privacy Act restrictions on the sharing of individual  information contributed to a delay in their sharing this information with  DHS. However, as CDC has concluded, in this instance both laws appear  to permit the disclosure to DHS, without patient authorization, of  individually identifiable health information acquired for the purpose of  controlling the spread of disease. According to CDC, there was a concern  that the lack of procedures for sharing identifying and health information  between agencies resulted in this information being disseminated over law  enforcement channels more broadly than may have been necessary under  the circumstances. In addition, concerns were raised that password  protection for the information disseminated may have been insufficient."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HHS and DHS Lacked Specific Procedures for Information Sharing within Each Department to Respond to the TB Incidents", "paragraphs": ["Along with a lack of comprehensive procedures for information sharing  with each other, HHS and DHS lacked specific procedures for  communicating across their respective component agencies about public  health incidents, which contributed to uncertainty about whether and  when CDC, TSA, or CBP should notify senior officials at HHS or DHS  about potential incidents. According to Standards for Internal Control in  the Federal Government, effective communication should occur in a broad  sense with information flowing down, across, and up organizations.  Lacking specific procedures, HHS and CDC officials used a \u201cstandard of  reasonableness\u201d that involves professional discretion as a basis for  determining whether the individual posed a potential public health threat  and when to notify senior officials. CDC officials told us that using this  standard involves some subjective judgment. According to CDC, its  quarantine station officials initially believed that the two TB incidents  could be resolved locally without notifying senior officials, which led to  delays in the federal response in both incidents. For example, in the U.S.  citizen incident, senior officials at HHS and CDC were not notified by CDC  quarantine station officials at the field office level about the incident early  enough to ensure timely use of federal isolation and quarantine authorities  to deter his travel. In addition, CBP and TSA lacked written procedures for  internal communication regarding how to handle public health incidents  and when to notify DHS senior officials about the efforts of officials in the  field to respond to requests from CDC quarantine station officials. During  this incident, CBP officials at the air port of entry became involved on May  22, but they did not notify DHS senior officials until May 24.

As a result, state and local health  officials responding to the incident involving the U.S. citizen were  uncertain how to request federal assistance and, prior to doing so,  attempted but failed to contact the individual to deter him from traveling,  ultimately contributing to the delay in the federal response. Eight days  (May 10 to May 18) elapsed from when a state health department official  discussed options for restricting the U.S. citizen\u2019s international travel with  a CDC quarantine station official, without confirming that a specific  individual intended to travel, to when the state requested formal  assistance from CDC.

When responding to HHS\u2019s request for assistance to  deter the U.S. citizen from traveling, CBP issued a TECS alert to determine  when the U.S. citizen planned to return to the United States. When he  crossed the border at a land port of entry after having flown into Canada,  the CBP officer queried the individual\u2019s travel documents in TECS to  check against law enforcement systems for outstanding warrants, or  criminal or administrative violations, and to assist with determining  admissibility into the United States. However, the officer ignored the  electronic alert and instructions to refer the individual for further  inspection, in violation of CBP procedures. Instead, the CBP officer  cleared the TECS alert and allowed the individual to enter the country  without the required further inspection. When responding to the incident  involving the Mexican citizen, CDC and CBP officials did not know that  they had received incomplete or inaccurate biographic information or  both. As a result, at the time of the incidents, a TECS database search  would not prompt a \u201cmatch\u201d if incomplete or inaccurate biographic  information was used for a query. According to CBP officials, incomplete  and inaccurate information delayed the identification of the individual by  over 1 month and allowed him to travel into the United States  approximately 20 times after CDC first notified CBP to look for and deter  him.", "According to CBP officials, they realized within a day of initiating the  TECS searches that the identifying information was incomplete because  the searches did not produce a travel history, which typically shows an  individual\u2019s travel in and out of the United States. Also, the searches of  visa databases, which could have provided more information about his  identity, did not produce any information on the individual, who was said  to be a frequent traveler. Once CBP officers realized that the Mexican  citizen\u2019s identifying information was incomplete, they contacted CDC the  next day to confirm the identifying information and told CDC officials that  they suspected that the information was incomplete. According to agency  officials, 4 days after CDC first notified CBP about the Mexican citizen,  CDC notified CBP that some of the biographic information from the  Mexican citizen\u2019s medical records was inaccurate. Using corrected  information, CBP immediately revised the TECS alert and the local be-on- the-lookout notice; however, when a new TECS search still did not  produce information, CBP contacted CDC. Although CDC had made  attempts, it did not obtain accurate and complete biographic information.  On May 31, about 6 weeks after CDC first contacted CBP officials, the  Mexican citizen gave his border-crossing card, a type of visa, to his  physician. CDC was then able to provide CBP with the complete and  accurate biographic information, and DHS took possession of his card,  thus preventing further crossing. With the accurate information from the  Mexican citizen\u2019s documents, DHS officials located his travel history in  TECS on May 31, determined that he had crossed the southern border   21 times from April 16 through May 31, and entered an accurate alert in  TECS."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "HHS and DHS Implemented Procedures and Tools to Address Response Deficiencies, but Could Take Further Steps to Complete Actions Identified as a Result of the 2007 TB Incidents", "paragraphs": ["HHS and DHS have implemented various procedures and tools intended to  address deficiencies identified by the 2007 TB incidents.

To help promote enhanced information  sharing across and within both departments, HHS and DHS developed new  procedures for HHS to request assistance from DHS. These new  procedures are consistent with practices identified in our past work for  enhancing and sustaining agency collaboration and for establishing  leadership, capabilities, and accountability for preparedness and  response. They are also consistent with Standards for Internal Control  in the Federal Government, which calls for management to ensure that  there are adequate means of communicating internally and with external  stakeholders. Under the new procedures, HHS officials at field offices,  such as quarantine stations and ports of entry, are to notify headquarters  officials when a TB or other public health incident develops, whereupon  these officials are to make requests to DHS headquarters to task TSA and  CBP officials at ports of entry with taking action to interdict individuals  with TB and other infectious diseases at the borders. HHS prepares  written requests for assistance that include the information DHS needs to  respond, such as the individual\u2019s name, date of birth, and action to be  taken if the individual is encountered. DHS and HHS have also included  safeguards designed to ensure the privacy of the individual in the request  for assistance process. The request for assistance form is received only by  appropriate HHS and DHS officials responsible for responding to and  completing requests, and officials from both departments send the written  requests via e-mail, as password-protected documents. CDC and DHS  officials said that the new procedures for information sharing are also  intended to allow the agencies to take advantage of existing procedures,  resources, and capabilities while maintaining the close professional  relationships between CDC and CBP officers at ports of entry.", "DHS, particularly TSA and CBP, has also worked with HHS, particularly  CDC, to implement new tools intended to deter the cross-border travel of  individuals with infectious TB. Specifically, TSA modified an existing  tool\u2014the No Fly list\u2014to create a Do Not Board list for infectious air  travelers who are nonadherent with treatment and intend to travel. The Do  Not Board list is a roster of individuals whom CDC requests be denied  boarding onto a commercial airline flight into, out of, or within the United  States because they pose a potential public health threat to passengers, air  carriers, or the transportation system. CDC\u2019s criteria for placement of an  individual on the Do Not Board list include public health officials\u2019 belief  that (1) the individual has an a communicable disease that would  constitute a public health threat if he or she were allowed to travel by  airplane; (2) the individual is unaware of, or will become nonadherent to,  public health recommendations regarding treatment or other instructions;  and (3) the individual intends to travel by airplane. According to CDC  officials, the agency requests removal of an individual from the list when  state or local health officials confirm that the individual has undergone  sufficient treatment to be determined noninfectious. HHS officials said  that the list is reviewed at least monthly. TSA maintains the Do Not Board  list, which is separate from other watch lists for air carriers, such as the  No Fly list used to prevent known terrorists from boarding airplanes, but  functions in a similar manner. TSA sends the Do Not Board list to  domestic and foreign air carriers on a daily basis as an addendum to the  No Fly list. U.S. air carriers are to screen all passengers against the Do  Not Board list (regardless of the flight\u2019s origination or destination).  International carriers are to screen passengers who are arriving in or  departing from the United States but not passengers traveling outside the  United States.", "HHS and DHS officials said they believe that the request for assistance  process and the Do Not Board list could be used to address travelers with  other infectious diseases, though CDC officials said the most likely use  would be for travelers with infectious TB. Although the Do Not Board list  was created in response to the incident involving the U.S. citizen, officials  said that individuals with infectious diseases other than TB, such as  measles, SARS, or a strain of influenza with pandemic potential, could be  placed on the Do Not Board list if they met the criteria. Generally, CDC  expects that it could use the new procedures and tools in instances where  health officials have identified infectious individuals who have a  substantial risk to expose others and there is a strong belief by health  officials that an infected individual intends to travel. However, according  to CDC officials, the use of the Do Not Board list to prevent travel by  individuals with other infectious diseases would be less likely because  they would become ill more quickly and feel too unwell to travel, be more  visibly ill, and recover more quickly than individuals with TB. In addition,  CDC officials said that the Do Not Board list requires careful review of  individual cases. In the event of a large disease outbreak, CDC\u2019s ability to  look at individual cases to place them on the Do Not Board list would be  limited, officials said.", "CBP also created and implemented a new TECS public health alert   (1 week after the U.S. citizen reentered the country) to help ensure that  DHS is able to assist CDC in locating individuals with infectious diseases,  including TB, who are attempting to enter the United States. According to  CBP officials, prior to the TB incidents, TECS public health alerts were  indistinguishable from other types of alerts and information on how to  manage an individual with infectious disease, including TB, was not  prominently displayed in the alert. Now, when CDC requests CBP  assistance for individuals who intend to travel against medical advice, if  the individual\u2019s license, passport, visa, or other identifying document or  biographical information is scanned or manually entered into TECS, the  new TECS public health alert is displayed prominently on the CBP  officer\u2019s computer screen, with specific instructions for the officer to  isolate the individual and contact CDC immediately. As with the Do Not  Board list, federal officials must know an individual has an infectious  disease, including TB, to place a public health alert in TECS. Furthermore,  according to CBP officials, if the identifying information provided to  physicians or recorded in health records does not match the information  entered in visa databases, visas and other travel documents generated  from these databases will not produce a match when queried and CBP  officers will not know to detain the individual, as in the case involving the  Mexican citizen. Furthermore, if an individual\u2019s information (passport or  visa) is not scanned or manually entered into TECS when he or she enters  the United States, officers will not discover the public health alert and will  not detain the individual.", "CBP also took other actions to strengthen TECS computer screening  mechanisms and search capabilities for public health alerts. These  changes were intended to ensure that CBP officers at ports of entry adhere  to agency protocols and instructions for all TECS alerts, either public  health or otherwise. At the time of the incident involving the U.S. citizen,  the CBP officer who admitted the individual into the country was able to  bypass the requirement to refer individuals for further inspection because  there was no supervisory review. According to CBP officials, to prevent  this, CBP upgraded TECS computer programming so that all TECS public  health alert matches are automatically sent to terminals where referrals  receive supervisory review intended to ensure that individuals receive the  required additional inspection and referral to CDC. With this change,  officers are no longer able to override the public health alert in TECS  without first diverting the individual for further screening. The public  health alert can only be overridden in TECS once the individual has  cleared the more detailed inspection (called secondary inspection).", "In addition, CBP enhanced computer search capabilities for TECS public  health alerts. According to CBP officials, in the incident involving the  Mexican citizen, the officer who entered the TECS alert did not use  varying combinations of the biographic information during his search  because he believed that the information CDC provided was accurate.  According to CBP officials, as of May 2008, when a public health alert is  entered into TECS, the system is now programmed to create multiple  public health alerts on variations of specific types of the biographic  information entered. However, CBP officials told us that the TECS  programming changes do not create variations on other combinations of  an individual\u2019s available biographic information. A CBP official told us that  CBP could further modify TECS to create public health alerts using  different combinations of other available biographic information, but CBP  had not explored the feasibility of making this change and had not  examined whether the benefits of conducting these additional searches on  other types of biographic information offset the cost of a possible increase  in the time needed to process individuals through busy ports of entry.  According to CBP, a slight increase in the time needed to conduct  inspections, especially at land ports of entry, can result in substantial  traveler delays and traffic congestion. Nonetheless, without exploring  whether the costs of conducting searches on these other combinations of  biographic information exceed the benefits, DHS may be missing an  opportunity to enhance its ability to detect persons with known cases of  infectious disease and deter them from entering the United States.", "These changes to TECS notwithstanding, CBP\u2019s ability to identify  individuals who are the subject of public health alerts\u2014and ultimately  deter their cross-border travel\u2014largely depends on CBP officers\u2019  compliance with prescribed inspection procedures. In November 2007, we  reported on weaknesses in inspection procedures at U.S. ports of entry.  We said that CBP had taken action to address weaknesses in 2006  inspection procedures, such as not verifying the citizenship and  admissibility of each traveler, that contributed to failed inspections.  However, our follow-up work conducted months after CBP\u2019s actions  showed that weaknesses still existed. In July 2007, CBP issued detailed  procedures for conducting inspections, including requiring field office  managers to assess compliance with these procedures. However, CBP had  not established an internal control to ensure that field office managers  share their assessments with CBP headquarters to help ensure that the  new procedures are consistently implemented across all ports of entry and  reduce the risk of failed traveler inspections. We recommended that CBP  implement internal controls to help ensure that field office directors  communicate to agency management the results of their monitoring and  assessment efforts so that agencywide results can be analyzed and  necessary actions taken to ensure that new traveler inspection procedures  are carried out in a consistent way across all ports of entry. CBP agreed  with our recommendation and stated that it has begun to take action to  address it. A CBP official told us that CBP intends to finalize the results of  field office assessments in October 2008.", "Figure 4 shows the flow of requests for assistance from HHS to DHS,  together with the steps each agency takes to prepare, submit, and  complete these requests. Step-by-step procedures for each agency are  explained in table 1.", "The departments and their component agencies were able to test how the  new procedures worked in practice because information provided by HHS  for the period May 2007 to February 2008 showed that HHS coordinated  with DHS to request assistance for 72 actions to place individuals on, or  remove them from, the Do Not Board list, or to place or remove public  health alerts in TECS. Of these 72 requests, 21 were to add an individual  to the Do Not Board list. Table 2 shows the number of requests for  assistance CDC prepared for HHS to submit to DHS by type of request in  this period.", "All requests were for individuals with TB disease who fit the criteria  jointly established by CDC and DHS. In reviewing these requests for  assistance, we found that actions were typically completed within   24 hours of the time CDC initiated the request. According to DHS  officials, all requests were considered high priority and were addressed.

For  example, CDC has presented information on the Do Not Board list at  various conferences and association meetings, such as the June 2008  meeting of the state epidemiologists association and the November 2007  meeting of its advisory council for TB elimination. Additionally, CDC has  used the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report\u2014a publication CDC  makes available on its Web site at no charge\u2014to provide state and local  officials with information about the criteria for placement on or removal  from the Do Not Board list or TECS. The article describing the criteria was  published in a September 2008 issue. However, other CDC actions to  inform state and local officials have yet to be completed. CDC plans to  publish a companion product to the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly  Report article, which would consist of a letter notifying officials of the  publication and a guidance document describing the new tools and  procedures that would be sent via e-mail to state and local health officials.  According to CDC officials, the companion product will also be posted on  CDC\u2019s Web site, and CDC will host Web-based seminars for state and local  TB programs.", "According to health officials, HHS requests for DHS assistance to deter  individuals with TB from traveling originate primarily with state and local  health officials, such as TB controllers, state and local health department  staff, and public and private physicians, who typically have primary  contact with individuals with TB and are more likely to be aware that an  individual might be planning to travel. Knowledge of the new procedures  and tools among these officials could prevent delays in accessing federal  assistance, as occurred with the U.S. citizen. According to CDC officials,  some health officials should already be familiar with the new procedures  because a number of them helped CDC develop the criteria to determine  whether an individual with TB should be removed from the Do Not Board  list or TECS. Furthermore, CDC officials said they believe that state and  local health department officials should be aware of the changes because  of CDC\u2019s close relationships with their professional associations. These  associations have a role in promoting national policy and serving as  liaisons between local, state, and territorial and federal health  departments. However, an official with one such association said that staff  independently discovered the new procedures and tools, while staff from  another association told us that they were not aware of them.", "Additionally, information about the new procedures and tools may be  especially important for those states with lower relative numbers of TB  cases, which may have less experience in accessing federal assistance.  Moreover, providing information about the criteria for new procedures  and tools can help ensure that state and local health officials can use them  appropriately. For example, in one case, an individual with TB who had  been added to the Do Not Board list presented a letter from county health  officials to airline staff stating that he no longer posed a health risk to  other travelers. Because county health officials did not follow the correct  procedure to notify CDC and request the individual\u2019s removal from the Do  Not Board list, he was not allowed to board his flight."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HHS and DHS Have Not Finalized Plans to Complete Coordination Actions between Federal Agencies", "paragraphs": ["As of September 2008, the two departments had not finalized plans for  completing additional actions they identified that are intended to further  strengthen their ability to respond to incidents involving individuals with  TB who intend to travel.

For  example, according to DHS officials, CDC officials responded to DHS  feedback by increasing the level of detail about the medical condition of  the individual included on requests submitted to DHS while  simultaneously increasing the privacy protections of the identifying  information provided on the forms. Also, after subsequent incidents, CDC  officials determined that it was necessary to specify which agency officials  should participate in the conference calls that include CDC, state, and  local officials to determine whether an individual with an infectious  disease, such as TB, who intended to travel justified a need to request  assistance from DHS. According to HHS officials, the agency\u2019s  coordination with DHS for more than 70 requests for assistance since the  2007 TB incidents also has helped agency officials become familiar with  their roles in the information-sharing process that is outlined in the new  procedures."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The new procedures and tools that HHS and DHS established in the wake  of the spring 2007 incidents involving the two individuals with drug- resistant TB have improved federal interagency information sharing and  coordination for responding to TB incidents and could lay the foundation  for continuing improvement in responding to future TB incidents. In  addition, as a result of the collaboration between HHS and DHS in making  these changes, each department now has a clearer view of how the other\u2019s  mission and approach to public health incidents differs from its own,  which could further enhance their ability to collaborate in responding not  only to similar TB incidents but also to other future public health threats.", "Despite DHS\u2019s progress in enhancing TECS so that CBP officials can better  identify individuals via electronic public health alerts, this enhancement is  applicable only for some types of biographic information, but not others.  Not exploring the costs and benefits of further modifying TECS to create  public health alerts based on variations of additional types of biographic  information may result in missed opportunities to locate persons subject  to public health alerts and deter them from entering the United States.", "Additionally, HHS and DHS have more opportunities to improve their  information-sharing efforts in responding to future TB incidents. For  example, unless state and local health officials are informed and educated  about the new tools and procedures, delays in accessing federal  assistance, like those encountered during the two TB incidents, could  persist. Specifically, without wide dissemination of the procedures for  placing individuals with TB on, or removing them from, the Do Not Board  list, or for placing or removing a public health alert in TECS, state and  local health officials may not be aware of the federal assistance at their  disposal for use in locating individuals with TB who are nonadherent with  treatment and may intend to travel against medical advice. Additionally,  state and local health officials who have limited knowledge of these  changes and no previous experience in working with federal officials at  the field office level may encounter difficulties in using the new  procedures and tools.", "Furthermore, HHS and DHS have identified additional actions that they  need to take to further strengthen their ability to respond to incidents  involving individuals with TB who intend to travel, including some actions  that require cross-agency coordination for completion. However, the  departments have not developed an action plan for ensuring that these  multiagency efforts are accomplished. Absent a clear plan with associated  time frames for completing cross-agency actions, the departments may not  be accountable for taking the corrective actions and ensuring that all  identified deficiencies are mitigated."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To ensure continuing improvements in HHS\u2019s and DHS\u2019s new procedures  and tools developed in response to the 2007 TB incidents and to improve  awareness of these changes, we are making the following three  recommendations.", "We recommend that the Secretary of DHS direct CBP to determine  whether the benefits exceed the costs of enhancing TECS capabilities  when creating public health alerts to include variations on other types of  biographic information that could further enhance its ability to locate  individuals who are subject to public health alerts and, if so, to implement  this enhancement. We also recommend that the Secretary of HHS and the  Secretary of DHS work together to    continue to inform and educate state and local health officials about the  new procedures and tools and   develop plans with time frames for completing additional actions that  require cross-agency coordination to respond to future TB incidents."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We requested comments on a draft of this report from HHS and DHS.

With regard to  our first recommendation on enhancing TECS capabilities to include  variations on other types of biographic information, DHS said that CBP  has completed a cost-benefit analysis and determined that this  enhancement would increase to an unmanageable level the number of  possible alerts requiring further research by CBP officers and increase  delays at ports of entry. However, in response to our recommendation,  CBP is drafting a policy and new procedures that when implemented will  require that officers (1) review an individual\u2019s biographic information  when entering public health alerts to determine whether variations on this  information could produce an accurate public health alert and, if so,   (2) create a new public health alert based on the variation of this  biographic information. CBP believes that this approach will enhance  capabilities without causing delays, although we believe that it will be  important to monitor implementation to ensure that the approach provides  the intended results.", "With regard to our second recommendation, HHS and DHS stated that they  were working together on efforts that, once completed, will help to ensure  that state and local health officials are better informed about the new  procedures and tools. Finally, HHS and DHS stated that they were working  to address our third recommendation to develop plans with time frames  for completing the remaining actions that require cross-agency  coordination, but did not address whether they were developing plans  with time frames for completing the other remaining additional actions.  We believe that absent these plans, there is no guarantee the departments  will complete these actions that are important for ensuring full cross- agency coordination in response to future TB and other public health  incidents.", "In commenting on a draft of this report, HHS stated that it disagreed with  our assessment of \u201cthe lack of agency coordination.\u201d However, we found  that following the incidents HHS and DHS had identified coordination  deficiencies in their responses, which they deemed serious enough to  require the development of new procedures and tools. DHS also raised  two issues regarding our findings related to CBP. First, DHS noted that  CBP field locations often receive and handle requests from CDC regarding  individuals with communicable diseases and that CBP officials at the time  handled the incident involving the Mexican citizen at the local level  according to existing protocols. Second, CBP wished to clarify that  although procedures have been \u201cfine-tuned\u201d since the incident occurred,  CBP believes that the procedures in place at the time of the incidents were  comprehensive. We maintain that the fact that CBP created new standard  operating procedures for communicating with HHS and for restricting  international travel of persons with such public health concerns is  evidence that the protocols and procedures in place at the time were not  comprehensive or effective.", "HHS and DHS also provided technical comments.

Each day, over 1 million individuals, both non-U.S.  citizens and U.S. citizens, seek entry into the United States. In addition to  determining whether these individuals are eligible to enter the country,  CBP officers perform a wide range of law enforcement duties, such as  screening cargo for weapons or illegal goods, preventing narcotics and  agricultural pests from entering the country, and identifying and arresting  persons with criminal warrants. Nearly 75 percent of all border crossings  are at land ports of entry, and nearly 95 percent are at air or land ports.

Officers are trained in customs and immigration law, law enforcement  techniques, and agricultural requirements and must be able to carefully  observe individuals, while using available tools, equipment, and support, in  order to make sound decisions on whether to admit, detain, or deny entry  to a traveler. CBP policies and procedures for inspecting individuals at all  ports of entry require officers to determine the nationality of individuals  and their admissibility, that is, whether they are eligible to enter the  country. Because most individuals attempting to enter the country through  ports of entry have a legal basis for doing so, a streamlined screening  procedure referred to as primary inspection is used to process those  individuals who can readily be identified as admissible.", "Persons whose admissibility cannot be readily determined may be  subjected to a more detailed review called secondary inspection. This  involves a closer inspection of travel documents and possessions,  additional questioning by CBP officers, and cross-references through  multiple law enforcement databases, including the Treasury Enforcement  Communications System (TECS), to verify the traveler\u2019s identity,  background, and purpose for entering the country, and to detect any  violations or risks to the public. In secondary inspection, an officer makes  the final determination to admit the traveler, deny admission, or take other  actions (such as releasing the traveler to another law enforcement entity  for prosecution) based upon the results of the inspection.

This advance manifest information  allows CBP time to conduct prescreening by querying a variety of law  enforcement databases, including TECS and other types of alerts, to detect  lookout records and warnings for various violations before individuals  enter the country. Upon arrival in the United States at an air port of entry,  however, individuals undergo the same general process in primary and  secondary inspection as they do at land ports of entry. During primary  inspection, individuals arriving by air must present documentation of  citizenship and admissibility, such as a U.S. passport, permanent resident  card, or foreign passport containing a visa issued by the Department of  State. CBP officers must take physical possession of identification and  match the photo with the individual, request declaration of residence,  obtain an oral declaration concerning length of stay, ascertain purpose or  intent of travel, and obtain a binding written customs declaration.  However, unlike procedures at land ports of entry, CBP officers perform  TECS queries during primary inspection on all individuals to identify  potential matches to lookouts and warnings that were detected through  the prescreening process.

During primary inspection, CBP officers are directed to  conduct inspections on all travelers. As part of that inspection process,  CBP officers are to perform TECS queries on as many travelers as  feasible. All vehicles are queried in TECS using license plate readers  installed in primary inspection vehicle lanes. For pedestrian lanes, the  traveler\u2019s name can be machine read from the travel document or  manually keyed into TECS by the CBP officer. For vehicles, CBP officers  frequently inspect multiple travelers entering in a single vehicle, and TECS  queries are generally conducted on the individuals and the vehicle data. In  addition, CBP officers visually examine the vehicle and inspect car  passengers, verify license plate information, and monitor for the presence  of radioactive material, among other tasks.
