For example, GAO used agency responses to estimate 100 percent compliance with the requirement to issue a rule explaining to the public why personal information is exempt from certain provisions of the act. In contrast, GAO estimates 71 percent compliance with the requirement that personal information should be complete, accurate, relevant, and timely before it is disclosed to a nonfederal organization. As a result of this uneven compliance, the government cannot adequately assure the public that all legislated individual privacy rights are being protected. Agency senior privacy officials acknowledge the uneven compliance but report a number of difficult implementation issues in a rapidly changing environment. Of these issues, privacy officials gave most importance to the need for further OMB leadership and guidance. Although agencies are not generally dissatisfied with OMB's guidance on the Privacy Act, they made specific suggestions regarding areas in which additional guidance is needed, such as the act's application to electronic records. Besides these gaps in guidance, additional issues included the low agency priority given to implementing the act and insufficient employee training on the act. If these implementation issues and the overall uneven compliance are not addressed, the government will not be able to provide the public with sufficient assurance that all legislated individual privacy rights are adequately protected."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Obtaining government services or fulfilling government obligations\u2014for  example, applying for a small business loan or paying taxes\u2014often requires  individuals to provide federal agencies with detailed personal information  about themselves and their spouses, dependents, and parents. To regulate  the federal government\u2019s use of this personal information, Congress passed  the Privacy Act of 1974. You asked us to evaluate the compliance of federal  agencies with the Privacy Act and other issues. Specifically, as agreed with  your office, our objectives were to determine  key characteristics of systems of records reported by agencies;   the level of agency compliance with the Privacy Act and related OMB   the extent to which agencies report that they maintain personal  information that is not subject to the Privacy Act\u2019s protections.", "To address these objectives, we conducted three surveys at 25 departments  and agencies, which were selected to provide a cross section of large and  small agencies that were likely to have different missions and  organizational structures and, perhaps, different approaches to  implementing the Privacy Act. (App. I identifies the 25 agencies.) Response  rates ranged from 76 to 100 percent. To help verify the accuracy of  answers related to compliance with the Privacy Act, we randomly selected  a sample of agencies\u2019 responses to the surveys and asked officials to  provide documentation or additional narrative explanations to support  their answers for key compliance questions. The results of the verification  work gave us greater assurance about the accuracy of agencies\u2019 survey  responses. We previously briefed your staff on the results of our surveys.", "To better understand the results of our surveys, we invited the 25 agencies  to send a representative (mostly Privacy Act officers) to a meeting in  February 2003 (also referred to as the \u201cforum\u201d), at which we presented our  survey results and asked the agency representatives for their reactions and  to identify barriers to compliance with the act. (A summary of forum  results is presented in app. II.)", "Further details on our scope and methodology are provided in appendix I.

The Privacy Act places  limitations on agencies\u2019 collection, disclosure, and use of personal  information in systems of records. A system of records is a collection of  information about individuals under the control of an agency from which  information is actually retrieved by the name of the individual or by some  identifying number, symbol, or other particular assigned to the individual.  The act does not apply when there is merely a capability or potential for  retrieval by identifier, which is often the case with electronic records.", "Among the major provisions of the Privacy Act are the following:  Collecting only necessary information. Agencies are to maintain  personal information about an individual only when it is relevant and  necessary to accomplish a purpose of the agency required to be  accomplished by statute or executive order of the President. According to  OMB guidance, the goal of this provision is to reduce the amount of  personal information that agencies collect in order to reduce the risk of  agencies\u2019 improperly using personal information.", "Providing public notice. Agencies are to publish a notice in the Federal  Register when establishing or revising a system of records. The notice is to  contain the name and location of the system, the categories of individuals  on whom records are maintained in the system, and each \u201croutine use\u201d of  the records contained in the system.", "Providing for informed consent. Agencies are to inform individuals  whom it asks to supply information of (1) the authority for soliciting the  information and whether disclosure of such information is mandatory or  voluntary, (2) the principal purposes for which the information is intended  to be used, (3) the routine uses that may be made of the information, and  (4) the effects on the individual, if any, of not providing the information.", "Protecting against adverse determinations through maintaining  accuracy of personal information. Agencies are to maintain all records  used in making any determination about individuals with such accuracy,  relevance, timeliness, and completeness as is reasonably necessary to  ensure fairness to the individual.", "Safeguarding information. Agencies are to establish appropriate  administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to ensure the security  and confidentiality of records and to protect against anticipated threats or  hazards to their security or integrity that could result in substantial harm,  embarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness to any individual on whom  information is maintained.", "Accounting for disclosures of records. Agencies are to keep an  accounting of the date, nature, and purpose of each disclosure of a record,  and the name and address of the person or agency to whom the disclosure  is made (except for disclosures within the agency for official purposes or  for disclosures required under the Freedom of Information Act).", "Training employees. Agencies are to instruct persons on the  requirements of the act if they are involved in the design, development,  operation, or maintenance of any system of records or in maintaining any  record.", "Providing notice of exemptions of systems of records. When an  agency uses the authority in the act to exempt a system of records from  certain provisions, the agency is to issue a rule explaining the reasons for  the exemption.", "Providing for civil remedies and criminal penalties for violating the  rights granted by the Privacy Act. The act grants individuals the right of  access to agency records pertaining to themselves; the right to amend such  a record if it is inaccurate, irrelevant, untimely, or incomplete; and the right  to sue the government for violations of the act. There are civil remedies and  criminal penalties for agencies not affording individuals these rights.", "In 1988, Congress amended the Privacy Act through passage of the  Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act, which established  safeguards regarding an agency\u2019s use of Privacy Act records in performing  certain computerized matching programs. Under the act, a written  computer matching agreement is required for any computerized  comparison of two or more automated systems of records for the purposes  of determining the eligibility of applicants for assistance under federal  benefits programs or of recouping payments or delinquent debts under  federal benefits programs. Agreements are also required for any  computerized comparison of federal personnel or payroll systems.", "Computer matching agreements must specify the purpose and legal  authority for conducting the match and how these matches will be  performed. Agency Data Integrity Boards are to approve matching  agreements and assess the costs and benefits of the match. (There are  some exceptions, such as not assessing costs and benefits where the match  is required by statute.)"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "OMB Is Responsible for Guidance on Privacy", "paragraphs": ["Under the Privacy Act, OMB is responsible for developing guidelines and  regulations and providing \u201ccontinuing assistance to and oversight of\u201d  agencies\u2019 implementation of the act. In 1975, OMB issued its initial Privacy  Act implementing guidance entitled Privacy Act Implementation:  Guidelines and Responsibilities. In addition, OMB Circular A-130  (Management of Federal Information Resources) sets forth a number of  general policies concerning the protection of personal privacy by the  federal government:  The individual\u2019s right of privacy must be protected in federal  government information activities involving personal information.", "Agencies shall consider the effects of their actions on the privacy rights  of individuals and ensure that appropriate legal and technical  safeguards are implemented.", "Agencies shall limit the collection of information that identifies  individuals to that which is legally authorized and necessary for the  proper performance of agency functions.", "Agency heads shall periodically review (1) a random sample of agency  contracts for maintaining systems of records to ensure that contractors  are bound by the Privacy Act; (2) routine use disclosures associated  with each system of records to ensure that they are compatible with  their original purpose for collection; and (3) training practices to ensure  that employees are familiar with the Privacy Act and the agency\u2019s  implementing regulation.", "As of April 2003, OMB\u2019s Web site, www.whitehouse.gov/omb, also provides  links to documents characterized as \u201cPrivacy Guidance\u201d and \u201cPrivacy  Reference Materials\u201d  (http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/inforeg/infopoltech.html). Those  documents include the initial Privacy Act guidance, memoranda about  privacy policies on federal Web sites, interagency sharing of personal data,  letters on agency use of Web \u201ccookies.\u201d (See app. III.)", "OMB officials stated that one OMB staff person is dedicated to Privacy Act  issues full time. In addition, according to that one staff person, several  other OMB staff also devote part of their time to this effort. The Privacy Act  staff position is located in the Information Policy and Technology Branch  within the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. According to OMB,  the duties associated with this position include  reviewing agencies\u2019 draft Federal Register notices and systems reports  for new and altered systems of records and computer matches;  answering agencies\u2019 questions about how to implement the act, and  responding to questions from federal employees and the public about  the scope and application of the act;  monitoring court rulings involving the Privacy Act;  developing written guidance to agencies on Privacy Act implementation  issues and federal Internet privacy policy;  leading interagency work groups on Privacy Act issues;  providing input to OMB\u2019s positions on legislation, rules, regulations, and  testimony that have privacy policy implications; and  participating in interagency discussions and activities concerning other  privacy policy issues (consumer fraud/identity theft, do-not-call lists,  medical privacy, financial privacy, etc.).", "One body tasked with addressing federal governmentwide issues such as  privacy and security is the Chief Information Officers (CIO) Council,  chaired by the Deputy Director for Management in OMB. Initially  established in 1996 by Executive Order 13011, the CIO Council was enacted  into law by the E-Government Act of 2002. The council serves as the  principal interagency forum for improving practices in the management of  federal information resources. Among its functions are responsibilities to  develop policy recommendations for OMB, help coordinate multiagency  projects and other innovative initiatives, assist in standards development,  and work with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to address  hiring and training needs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Previous Initiatives and Studies Have Raised Privacy and Security Concerns", "paragraphs": ["Concerns about implementation of the Privacy Act have arisen periodically  since its passage. In 1983, for example, in a report summarizing 9 years  (1975\u20131983) of congressional oversight of the act, the House Committee on  Government Reform (formerly called the Committee on Government  Operations) concluded that OMB had not pursued its responsibility to  revise and update its original guidance from 1975 and had not actively  monitored agency compliance with its guidance. It stated \u201cInterest in the  Privacy Act at  has diminished steadily since 1975. Each successive  Administration has shown less concern about Privacy Act oversight.\u201d", "A subsequent administration initiative addressed the difficulty of assuring  privacy in an increasingly electronic environment. In May 1998, a  presidential memorandum was issued stating that increases in agencies\u2019  use of electronic records permit \u201cthis information to be used and analyzed  in ways that could diminish individual privacy in the absence of additional  safeguards.\u201d Consequently, the heads of executive departments and  agencies were directed to review their Privacy Act systems of records  within 1 year, and OMB was directed, among other things, to issue  instructions to agencies on conducting and reporting these reviews. In its  January 1999 instructions, OMB also asked agencies to identify areas  where they believe further OMB guidance was needed.", "The resulting responses from 72 agencies highlighted a range of issues. For  example, in assessing their own compliance with the Privacy Act, agencies  (1) added 131 systems of records that previously had not been properly  identified, (2) revised 457 systems of records that were not up to date, and  (3) deleted 288 systems of records that were no longer necessary. In  addition, agencies requested centralized, updated guidance, particularly  with regard to new technologies such as E-mail, Web sites, and electronic  records. Further, agencies suggested, for example, that OMB establish an  interagency taskforce on privacy.", "In addition, over the past 3 years, we have issued reports that raised  concerns with the adequacy of selected OMB guidance. In September 2000,  we reported that OMB\u2019s guidance to agencies on Web site privacy policies  was unclear in several respects and contained undefined language. We  recommended that OMB clarify its guidance on privacy policies for  agencies\u2019 Web sites. In another report, issued in April 2001, we said that  OMB\u2019s guidance on agencies\u2019 use of cookies on Web sites was fragmented  and did not provide clear direction. We recommended that OMB clarify its  guidance. Although OMB officials stated that they planned to address these  recommendations, OMB had not yet implemented them as of May 2003.", "We have also consistently reported that security of electronic information  in computer systems is a high-risk area for the government in general, with  potentially devastating consequences if it is not ensured. When controls  over the security of computer systems are not adequate, the privacy of the  personal information in those systems is exposed to potential risks from  unauthorized access or alteration. In April 2003, at the request of Congress,  we testified on our analysis of recent information security audits and  evaluations at 24 major federal departments and agencies. We reported  that although analyses of audit and evaluation reports for the 24 major  departments and agencies issued from October 2001 to October 2002  indicated some individual agency improvements, overall they continued to  highlight significant information security weaknesses that place a broad  array of federal operations and assets at risk of fraud, misuse, and  disruption. We identified significant weaknesses in each of the 24 agencies.  As in 2000 and 2001, weaknesses were most often identified in control  areas for security program management and access controls. All 24  agencies had weaknesses in security program management, which  provides the framework for ensuring that risks are understood and that  effective controls are selected and properly implemented.", "We further testified that there are a number of important steps that the  administration and the agencies should take to ensure that information  security receives appropriate attention and resources and that known  deficiencies are addressed. These steps include delineating the roles and  responsibilities of the numerous entities involved in federal information  security and related aspects of critical infrastructure protection; providing  more specific guidance on the controls agencies need to implement;  obtaining adequate technical expertise to select, implement, and maintain  controls to protect information systems; and allocating sufficient agency  resources for information security.", "Although we continue to report significant weaknesses that place federal  operations and assets at risk, in the past few years agencies and the  administration have taken actions to improve federal information security.  As we reported in our April 2003 testimony, OMB and agency efforts to  implement the information security requirements of the Federal  Information Security Management Act (FISMA) have resulted in  increased management attention to information security and provided an  improved baseline for measuring improvements. FISMA requires federal  agencies to establish agencywide risk-based information security  programs, which must be independently evaluated annually, in order to  protect agency information and information systems from unauthorized  access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction.", "We also reported that the administration has made progress through a  number of efforts, such as OMB\u2019s establishment of requirements for  agencies to report the results of their annual security program reviews and  their plans to correct identified weaknesses, as well as its emphasis of  information security in the budget process and e-government initiatives.  Also, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has issued  additional computer security guidance, including its Security Self- Assessment Guide for Information Technology Systems, which uses an  extensive questionnaire containing specific control objectives and  techniques against which an unclassified system or group of  interconnected systems can be tested and measured."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Most Agencies\u2019 Systems of Records Contain Electronic Records", "paragraphs": ["A key characteristic of agencies\u2019 systems of records is that a large  proportion of them are electronic, reflecting the government\u2019s significant  use of computers and the Internet to collect and share personal  information.

For example, for 100 percent  of agency systems of records, agencies followed the requirement to issue a  rule that explains to the public why a system of records is exempt from one  or more of the act\u2019s privacy protections. However, for other provisions,  agencies have not consistently established the necessary policies and  procedures needed to ensure compliance and followed through on required  actions. Agency privacy officials attending our forum acknowledged this  uneven compliance; they pointed out, however, that implementation of the  Privacy Act in a rapidly changing environment presents a number of  difficult issues. Specifically, these officials identified barriers to improved  compliance that include a need for more OMB leadership and guidance on  the act, low agency priority given to implementing the act, and insufficient  training on the act.

OMB  guidance states \u201cIn simplest terms, information not collected about an  individual cannot be misused.\u201d Accordingly, OMB guidance states that  agencies are to assess the relevance and need for personal information in  the initial design of a new system of records or whenever any change is  proposed in an existing system of records. Seventeen of the 25 agencies  stated that they did have written policies and procedures to determine,  before information systems become operational, whether any personal  information to be collected in a new system is needed, as OMB guidance  requires.

These agencies identified instances since  October 1, 1998, where they decided not to collect or retain unnecessary  personal information because of Privacy Act considerations. For example:  Transportation took steps to reduce the amount of personal information  and its availability in designing (1) a new identification system for  agency employees and (2) a possible Transportation Worker  Identification Credential (TWIC) and associated systems for the  Transportation Security Administration. According to agency officials,  TWIC was initiated at the Department of Transportation, but transferred  to the Department of Homeland Security with the Transportation  Security Administration on March 1, 2003.", "The Treasury\u2019s Financial Management Service decided not to collect or  retain social security numbers for its Pay.gov verification or for the  Intra-Governmental Payment and Collections System.", "The Social Security Administration (SSA) decided not to copy (1) a State  Workers Compensation agency file and (2) a Veterans Benefits  Administration file containing military discharge records, because SSA  would need to access only a small percentage of the records.", "The Department of Defense eliminated a database that contained  information on dependents after finding that the information was  neither relevant nor necessary. Another component destroyed  employees\u2019 tax return information because it was neither relevant nor  necessary.", "As these examples show, following procedures to assess the need for  personal information in systems can effectively avoid privacy risks.  However, without such procedures consistently in place governmentwide,  agencies cannot ensure that only relevant personal information is collected  from individuals.", "Providing public notice. A basic objective of the act is to foster agency  accountability through a system of public scrutiny. Among the provisions of  the act that provide this system of public scrutiny are the act\u2019s  requirements to (1) issue Federal Register notices so that there are no  systems of records whose existence is secret and (2) publish rules in the  Code of Federal Regulations that describe the agency\u2019s procedures for  individuals to determine if they are the subject of a record and to access or  amend their records. In addition, over the course of a year, agencies\u2019 use of  personal information in systems of records may change.

With regard to determinations made about an individual, we  estimate that agencies had procedures in place to ensure that the personal  information about an individual is complete, accurate, relevant, and timely  in 95 percent of systems of records.

Once an agency makes a decision  to collect personal information, safeguarding the information is vital to  complying with the Privacy Act. As discussed earlier, our reports have  consistently found that information security is a high-risk area for the  government in general, with potentially devastating consequences if it is  not ensured. Moreover, the importance of adequate safeguards is  underscored by the types of sensitive personal information most frequently  found in the systems of records: name, social security number, telephone  numbers, home address, work address, and demographic information (e.g.,  marital status).", "OMB\u2019s guidance calls for a detailed assessment of risks and the  establishment of specific administrative, technical, procedural, and  physical safeguards.

(See fig. 2.)", "Protecting personal information that is maintained in automated  information systems is of particular importance. In response to our  surveys, agencies generally did not report incidents of unauthorized  reading, altering, disclosing, or destroying personal information in  automated information systems. However, we also estimate that in 21  percent of about 2,400 systems of records, agencies reported that they did  not have the means to detect when persons, without authorization, were  reading, altering, disclosing, or destroying information in the system. (See  fig. 3.)", "Without appropriate security safeguards and the means to assess them,  agencies cannot ensure that personal information maintained by the  government is protected from unauthorized access, disclosure, and  alteration.", "Accounting for disclosures. Individuals have a right under the act to  know to whom records about themselves have been disclosed outside the  agency, so that (among other purposes) those recipients can be  subsequently advised of any corrected or disputed records. Accordingly,  agencies are to maintain an accounting of the date, nature, and purpose of  each disclosure of a record, and the name and address of the person or  agency to whom the disclosure is made. We estimate that agencies were  able to account for such disclosures in 86 percent of their 2,400 systems of  records but were not able to do so for 14 percent. For systems for which  agencies cannot account for disclosures, agencies cannot advise  individuals of how and by whom their personal information is being used.", "Training employees. The Privacy Act states that agencies are to establish  rules of conduct for persons involved in the design, development,  operation, or maintenance of systems of records and to instruct each  person on those rules, including the penalties for noncompliance. In  discussing the act\u2019s requirement for agencies to issue rules, OMB guidance  states that training employees on the act is important for compliance:  Effective compliance with the provisions of this act will require informed  and active support of a broad cross section of agency personnel. It is  important that all personnel who in any way have access to systems of  records or who are engaged in the development of procedures or systems  for handling records, be informed of the requirements of the act and be  adequately trained in agency procedures developed to implement the act.", "As the table shows, one-third of agencies have not issued the act\u2019s required  rules of conduct for employees, and about one out of five had not  established procedures to ensure adequate training for personnel with  access to systems of records.", "In addition, for an estimated 74 percent of systems of records, agencies  also reported that they provided \u201call or almost all\u201d staff with such training  but did not for an estimated 26 percent. If agency employees have not been  appropriately trained, they may not be aware of their responsibilities under  the act and may not fully comply with its requirements.", "Providing notice of exemptions. The Privacy Act permits certain  categories of records to be exempted from some requirements of the act  (e.g., access to records); according to OMB guidance, agencies can make  exemptions if complying with those requirements could adversely affect  agencies\u2019 conduct of necessary public business. The act contains two  categories of exemptions: (1) general exemptions that include systems of  records maintained by the Central Intelligence Agency or for criminal law  enforcement purposes and (2) specific exemptions for systems of records  that include classified material, statistical records, and certain personnel  investigation and evaluation material. For example, the act allows agencies  to deny a person access to his or her law enforcement files if doing so  would impair an ongoing investigation. Other types of records may be  exempted from the provision in the act that allows individuals to sue for  violations of the act and seek civil remedies and from the provision to  ensure the accuracy of the information disclosed to third parties.", "According to OMB guidance, no system of records is automatically exempt  from any provision of the act. To obtain an exemption for a system from  any requirement of the act, the head of the agency that maintains the  system must make a determination that the system falls within one of the  categories of systems that are permitted to be exempted and publish a  notice on the determination as a rule.

We disagree with OMB that the statements made in our report \u201cborder  on the reckless and irresponsible.\u201d Our survey results represent 25  departments\u2019 and agencies\u2019 compliance with a broad range of Privacy  Act provisions. These 25 cover a broad cross section of small, medium,  and large departments and agencies. In most cases, agencies\u2019 Privacy  Act officers\u2014who had an average of 8 years of experience in that  position\u2014responded to our survey of agencywide practices; we  achieved a 100 percent response rate on this survey. Our survey  concerning a sample representing a population of 2,400 systems of  record was completed by the person the agency deemed as most  knowledgeable of that system of records; we achieved a 96 percent  response rate. These surveys are extremely comprehensive and were  developed over many months with assistance from agency privacy  officials. Moreover, to help verify the accuracy of agencies\u2019 answers  related to compliance, we randomly selected a sample of agency  responses to the surveys and asked officials to provide documentation  or additional narrative explanations to support their answers. We then  invited key senior Privacy Act officials from all 25 agencies to discuss  their responses at an all-day forum, where they had a chance to provide  additional context for us before the preparation of the draft report.  Overall, we consider this report to be a comprehensive and accurate  source of information on agencies\u2019 implementation of the Privacy Act. 2. We disagree that our draft report, by treating the various provisions of  the act as equally important, understates the extent of agency privacy  protections. In passing the Privacy Act, Congress enacted a framework  designed to protect personal privacy. Accordingly, we based our  conclusions on the results of a comprehensive analysis of agency  compliance with a broad range of requirements.", "As OMB suggests, we added to the body of our report a statement that  agencies reported 100 percent compliance with our question  concerning unauthorized access or disclosure of personal information  contained in information systems. However, this response should not  be interpreted as meaning that agencies fully complied with the Privacy  Act\u2019s prohibitions against unauthorized disclosures. The question OMB  cites is focused on information security controls for protecting  personal information contained in information systems\u2014which would  not include the estimated 31 percent of systems of records that were  exclusively paper records. Further, in response to another question,  agencies acknowledged that in an estimated 21 percent of their systems  of records, they did not have the means to detect unauthorized  intrusions into their information systems, drawing into question  whether agencies have adequate means to determine whether or not  there have been unauthorized disclosures. As discussed in our report,  we have reported extensive weaknesses in information security across  government. 3. We disagree that there is inconsistency between the survey responses  on accounting for disclosures. The two questions asked were similar,  but not identical. Therefore, there should be no expectation that the  results would be identical. In our agency survey, we asked agencies a  general question on whether they account for disclosures outside the  agency for all systems of records. In the system of records survey, we  asked agencies about their ability to account for all disclosures for a  specific system of records that we randomly selected from the  population.  4. Regarding our questions on maintaining complete, accurate, and  relevant information, there are again major differences in these two  questions that explain the differing results. One question asks how  agencies maintain complete, accurate, and relevant information for  internal agency determinations about an individual, while the other  asks how this is done when providing information to a nonfederal  organization. We do, however, agree with OMB that the readers of our  report should see the multiple-choice answers that agencies could  choose from in answering these questions and on which our  compliance results are based. We have added them to the report.  5. Regarding OMB\u2019s concerns about questions that ask about particular  activities undertaken in specific time frames, we note that these  questions were directly derived from OMB\u2019s guidance to agencies. For  example, we derived the question concerning reviews of Federal  Register notices regarding systems of records directly from OMB\u2019s  guidance. We support OMB in believing that such reviews help ensure  that the public is informed of the existence and uses of systems of  records and is thus able to access and amend records if necessary. 6. We agree with OMB regarding the question concerning review of  training practices in fiscal year 2001. We removed this question from  the report.  7. We disagree with OMB that there is a fundamental flaw in the draft  report resulting from what is described as \u201cthe extremely limited nature  and scope of the facts that GAO has actually reviewed.\u201d Our survey  results represent 25 departments\u2019 and agencies\u2019 compliance with a  broad range of Privacy Act provisions. Our surveys are extremely  comprehensive, were developed over many months with assistance  from agency privacy officials, and represent the population of 2,400  systems of records covering a broad cross section of small, medium,  and large departments and agencies. Moreover, to help verify the  accuracy of agencies\u2019 answers related to compliance, we randomly  selected a sample of agency responses to the surveys and asked  officials to provide documentation or additional narrative explanations  to support their answers. We then invited key senior Privacy Act  officials from all 25 agencies to discuss their responses at an all-day  forum where they had a chance to provide additional context for us  before the preparation of the draft report. Again, we consider this  report to be a comprehensive and accurate source of information on  agencies\u2019 implementation of the Privacy Act. 8. One of the first steps that we took when beginning this review of the  Privacy Act was to contact agency Inspectors General for reports on  the act. We found only a few reports, which were of limited scope. In  addition, we acknowledge that GAO has not performed a  comprehensive review of the Privacy Act in many years. However, as  discussed in the draft report, we have issued reports over the past 3  years that raised concerns with the adequacy of selected OMB guidance  concerning privacy. These reports contain outstanding  recommendations to strengthen guidance, which OMB has not yet  implemented.  9. One of the first steps we took when beginning this review was to  examine the Privacy Act Overview from the Department of Justice and  to meet with the Justice officials who prepared the overview. We used  the overview, court decisions, and our interview with Justice officials to  help frame some of the survey questions. However, a detailed analysis  of these cases was not within the scope of our review nor necessary to  address the objectives of our study. OMB appropriately pointed out that  the individuals involved have the right to seek judicial review of  agencies\u2019 compliance with the act; we discuss this point in the  background section of our report. 10. In doing this work, our intention was to depict a governmentwide  picture of agency compliance with the Privacy Act and OMB guidance.  Although we present these results in the aggregate, they are based on  reviews of 24 individual agencies and a representative sample of 2,400  systems of records. We will be providing OMB officials with additional  details so that they can follow up with the specific agencies involved  and ensure that deficiencies are corrected. 11. OMB\u2019s 1999 review did not require agencies to review all systems of  records. Instead, OMB directed agencies to focus on \u201c\u2026the most  probable areas of out-of-date information, so that reviews will have the  maximum impact in ensuring that system of records notices remain  accurate and complete.\u201d The difference in the scope of OMB\u2019s review  (selective) and ours (random sample) explains why agencies reported  different results. 12. OMB commented that our draft report does not make clear what  actions they should take because it does not point to any specific  \u201cdeficiencies in compliance\u201d at specific agencies or programs. The draft  report contains specific compliance findings related to a broad range of  Privacy Act requirements. As previously discussed, this information is  presented in aggregate form; we will be providing additional details to  help OMB in its improvement efforts.", "Regarding OMB guidance, the draft report identifies many of the  specific deficiencies that agencies noted. We did not include the  detailed deficiencies that agencies identified in response to OMB\u2019s  January 1999 memorandum because OMB already had this information.  Other specific deficiencies from our survey were previously shared  with OMB officials. Nevertheless, we will be providing OMB officials  with all the additional details on the specific deficiencies in OMB  guidance that agencies identified in both the OMB and the GAO studies.  13. We disagree with OMB\u2019s comment that we never initiated a formal  review with OMB, never requested the opportunity to interview OMB  staff, and declined an invitation to review OMB activities. Consistent  with GAO policy, we held an entrance conference with OMB on May 30,  2001, to initiate this review. At that meeting, we interviewed the key  OMB officials who have Privacy Act responsibilities and asked them  questions covering every aspect of this engagement. During the course  of our review, we offered to share drafts of our surveys with OMB  officials to obtain their views and suggestions; they declined this  opportunity. Since then we have been in frequent communication with  OMB privacy officials to keep them apprised of our progress and, as  OMB\u2019s comment acknowledges, shared with them the draft briefing  slides that contained the interim results from our surveys. We met with  them to discuss the briefing slides on November 14, 2002, and January  7, 2003.", "Consistent with GAO policy, we also held an exit conference on April 3,  2003, to share our preliminary results and conclusions with OMB. At  that meeting, OMB officials provided us with oral comments and stated  that they would provide us with additional comments in writing; these  written comments were not provided. As we began summarizing the  results from our surveys and forum, we had several conversations with  OMB officials, including a meeting on May 28, 2003, to discuss their  concerns about our methodology and preliminary findings; many of the  concerns were addressed as we drafted the final report.", "Overall, OMB had many opportunities to provide us with additional  evidence to support its view that our results and conclusions were  inaccurate; however, it provided little additional information except to  take issue with our study approach.
