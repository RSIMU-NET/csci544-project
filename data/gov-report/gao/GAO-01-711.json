Delinquent taxpayers receiving payments from FMS generally are subject to continuous levy, while those receiving payments directly from federal agencies are not. Although it may prove impractical to treat similarly all delinquent taxpayers who receive federal payments, progress--and substantial additional revenues--could be achieved in this area. FMS plans to include salaries at the U.S. Postal Service and salaries and retirement payments at the Defense Department (DOD) in the continuous levy program. There are similar plans to include all vendor payments from the Postal Service, DOD, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Discussions among FMS, IRS, and the agencies could ensure that all of these payments all included in the continuous levy program as soon as possible. These discussions could also speed the inclusion of some categories of vendor payments. The continuous levy program could also benefit if IRS were to begin sharing with FMS the different names that businesses use for tax purposes--an approach that IRS already uses for individual taxpayers in the program. In the meantime, until the program is expanded to include more direct payments from agencies, IRS could take steps to ensure that all delinquent taxpayers receiving payments are subject to potential collection activity.

These payments are not currently subject to a tax levy through the continuous federal tax levy program, which the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) operates in conjunction with FMS.", "Authorized under the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 the continuous levy program enables IRS to continuously levy up to 15 percent of certain federal payments made to delinquent taxpayers. The program provides IRS with an automated process for serving tax levies and collecting delinquent taxes through FMS, which matches federal payment data against IRS\u2019 accounts receivable data in order to identify payments that IRS could levy. For payments disbursed by FMS, the amount to be levied and credited to IRS is deducted before FMS disburses the payment. For payments disbursed directly by other federal agencies, FMS would have to notify the respective payment agency to deduct the amount to be levied and credited to IRS before the agency disbursed the payment.", "Over half of all non-FMS disbursed federal payments are made by the United States Postal Service (USPS); the Department of Defense (DOD); and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), which disburses Medicare fee-for-service payments. These particular payments constitute a large portion of non-FMS disbursed payments, and thus, you requested that we (1) determine the number of delinquent taxpayers receiving federal payments from USPS, DOD, and CMS that would be affected and the amount of tax debt that might be recovered if they were to be included in the continuous levy program; (2) determine whether these types of payments could be included in the continuous levy program and the timeframes for doing so; and (3) identify other actions that could be taken to enhance IRS\u2019 ability to levy federal payments to delinquent individuals and businesses that are not currently included in the continuous levy program.", "To meet our objectives, we obtained and matched payments made by the three agencies to IRS\u2019 accounts receivable records; discussed whether and when these types of payments could be included in IRS\u2019 continuous levy program with IRS and FMS officials, as well as with officials from the three agencies and Medicare contractors; and discussed the general levy procedures with IRS officials and reviewed the related tax law governing these procedures. Our estimates of the tax debt that might be recovered are understated because Medicare contractors did not provide us with data on over 50 percent of the Medicare vendor payments made for the time period we reviewed. In addition, we were unable to match about $3.4 billion in DOD vendor payments against IRS\u2019 accounts receivable data because the payment records did not contain a taxpayer identification number (TIN).

DOD disbursed over $295 billion in fiscal year 2000, including about $150 billion in contractor and vendor payments and about $100 billion in salary and retirement payments. In addition, Medicare contractors processed over 900 million fee-for-service claims during fiscal year 2000, totaling nearly $175 billion.", "In addition to disbursing payments for various federal agencies, FMS provides centralized debt collection services for most federal agencies. To aid in federal debt collection, FMS has in place the Treasury Offset Program, which uses a centralized database of delinquent debts that have been referred for offset against federal payments. This database includes federal nontax debts and federal tax debts, as well as state tax debts and child support debts. FMS currently matches federal tax refunds, federal retirement and vendor payments, and certain federal salary and social security benefit payments against its database of delinquent debts, and when a match of both TIN and name control occurs, FMS offsets the payment, thereby reducing or eliminating the debt. FMS plans to include some non-FMS disbursed federal salary payments in the Treasury Offset Program in the latter half of 2001.", "A provision included in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 enhanced IRS\u2019 ability to collect delinquent federal tax debt by authorizing IRS to continuously levy up to 15 percent of certain federal payments made to delinquent taxpayers. FMS modified the Treasury Offset Program to enable IRS to electronically serve a tax levy to FMS once IRS has notified the delinquent taxpayer of the pending levy. In July 2000, IRS began adding tax debts to FMS\u2019 database of delinquent federal debts, thus initiating the continuous levy program. For this program, FMS compares federal payee information from agency payment records with IRS\u2019 accounts receivable records. When a match of both the TIN and name control occur, FMS informs IRS of the match and IRS then notifies the taxpayer of the pending tax levy. If the taxpayer fails to make an effort to satisfy the tax debt within 30 days, such as by payment in full or entering into an installment agreement, IRS will then instruct FMS to begin levying 15 percent of subsequent payments made to the taxpayer or the exact amount of tax owed if it is less than 15 percent of the next payment. For payments disbursed on behalf of other agencies, FMS deducts the amount to be levied before making the payment, and the levied amount is then credited to IRS. In an April 2000 report, we estimated that IRS could potentially collect as much as $478 million annually through this program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS Could Recover at Least $270 Million Annually From Delinquent Taxpayers Receiving USPS, DOD, and CMS Payments", "paragraphs": ["Based on matching federal payments made by the agencies to IRS\u2019 accounts receivable data, we estimate that including payments disbursed by USPS, DOD, and CMS in the continuous levy program could result in recovering at least $270 million annually from about 70,000 delinquent taxpayers.

The rest would come from wage and salary payments to employees and retirement payments.", "The amount of delinquent taxes recovered annually could be somewhat lower because some taxpayers might make other arrangements with IRS to resolve their tax debts once they receive a notice of levy. For example, in an effort to avoid a pending tax levy, some taxpayers might contact IRS to arrange to pay their delinquent tax in full or through entering into an installment agreement or submitting an offer-in-compromise.

For example, if taxpayers change their name when they marry, the name used as a single person would be sent to FMS along with their married name. This is not the case for businesses. For vendor payments currently paid by FMS and thus included in the continuous levy program, if a business were to change its name on its federal tax return, IRS would provide FMS with the most current name in its records, but not the prior name.", "When making our overall estimates of delinquent taxes that could be recovered if USPS, DOD, and CMS Medicare vendor payments were included in the continuous levy program, we determined the amount of additional revenue that could be raised if IRS changed its policy and provided FMS with all of the names it has for vendors. In addition to the 70,400 taxpayers whose TIN and name on the payment records exactly matched the TIN and name on IRS\u2019 accounts receivable records, we found 1,228 instances in which the TIN on the vendor payment records exactly matched the TIN on IRS\u2019 accounts receivable records, but the name on the payment records did not exactly match the name on IRS\u2019 records. For 656 of the 1,228 vendors, we found different names used by these vendors in an IRS database that showed they were in fact the delinquent taxpayers. There were no additional names in the IRS database for the remaining 572 vendors. The 656 taxpayers for which there were additional names owed about $26 million in delinquent taxes. We estimate that IRS could recover about $16 million annually if the different names it has for vendors were provided to FMS for the continuous levy program.", "If IRS were to provide FMS with the different names it has for business taxpayers, this would benefit the current continuous levy program by increasing the instances in which FMS could match the name in both records, as required before a levy can be made.

Officials indicated that within about 4 months of FMS\u2019 requesting them to do so, they could likely be ready to provide vendor payments to FMS and to levy payments for which FMS indicates a match with IRS\u2019 accounts receivable data. USPS officials did say that levying vendor payments could present some challenges. For example, USPS vendor payments generally are not made on a particular schedule, but rather, are controlled by terms specified in individual contracts. As a result, unlike biweekly salary payments, USPS disburses vendor payments daily throughout the business week. Therefore, vendor data exchanges between USPS and FMS would likely have to occur with greater frequency than salary data exchanges. However, USPS officials stated that the Prompt Payment Act requires that vendor payments be deferred until the pay cycle immediately preceding the payment due date. This should provide an adequate interval to offset such payments, particularly if the vendor data exchanges with FMS were to occur either weekly or biweekly.", "USPS officials also stated that USPS does not currently offset vendor payments to recover debts owed to USPS, and therefore, specific offset procedures would have to be developed. However, these officials were confident that they could modify the USPS system to enable them to flag any vendor payments requiring offset identified through the Treasury Offset Program. They further stated that such an offset would require manual intervention to make the offset and reconcile the vendor\u2019s account.", "Although USPS officials said that they could make vendor payments available to FMS within about 4 months of FMS\u2019 requesting such data, USPS and FMS officials have not discussed specific arrangements for doing so, such as when FMS could be ready to receive USPS vendor payment data or how long it might take USPS to develop procedures for performing such offsets."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Salary, Retirement, and Some Vendor Payments Could Be Included in the Continuous Levy Program Within 3 Years", "paragraphs": ["FMS is working with DOD to include civilian, military retirement, and military active duty payments in the Treasury Offset Program, thus eventually making these types of payments available for the continuous levy program.

These payments are all made from one payment system maintained at one DOD Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) location and accounted for about 48 percent of all DOD vendor payments made in fiscal year 2000. However, DOD officials have not specifically discussed providing other vendor payments to FMS in the near future, and they have concerns regarding the current capability to make other vendor payments available for the continuous levy program because of DOD\u2019s decentralized vendor payment systems. For example, vendors providing goods and services to three of the military branches\u2013 Army, Air Force, and Navy\u2013are paid from separate vendor payment systems maintained at various DFAS locations. In addition, there are separate vendor payment systems for processing certain specialty items, such as fuels and commissary resale products. DOD officials stated that DFAS staff do not currently have the capability to track multiple payments made from the various vendor payment systems to a particular vendor. As a result, if they were to provide vendor payments to FMS from these decentralized payment systems, DOD officials were concerned that there would be a risk of offsetting more in payments than a vendor might owe in delinquent taxes.", "Although DOD officials expressed concerns about offsetting more in payments than a vendor might owe in delinquent taxes, IRS officials indicated there are controls in the continuous levy program to prevent such overpayments. For example, IRS provides FMS with a weekly file updating the balance due for each account subject to continuous levy. In addition, FMS has the capability to update the balance due for each account after each payment is levied, thus enabling FMS to identify when a tax debt has been reduced to zero. In addition, selected staff in each IRS office are authorized to directly access FMS\u2019 levy database to rescind a levy if necessary, such as for taxpayers subject to a continuous levy that decide to either fully pay the tax debt or enter into an installment agreement. FMS and IRS officials have not discussed these controls with DOD to determine whether they would mitigate DOD\u2019s overpayment concerns and pave the way for other types of vendor payments to be provided to FMS for the continuous levy program, in addition to those vendor payments currently under consideration.", "DOD is currently developing a centralized vendor payment system that could increase its capability to eventually provide all vendor payments to FMS. According to DOD officials, the multiple vendor payment systems currently in use are to be replaced by a single system known as the Defense Procurement Payment System. The latest DOD estimate indicates that the initial phase for implementing the new system will begin in the latter part of fiscal year 2001.

CMS and Medicare contractors we spoke with agreed that including all Medicare payments in the continuous levy program would not be possible for several years owing to the decentralized payment system in which the Medicare program operates. CMS administers the Medicare program through about 50 health care contractors, which process and pay over 900 million fee-for- service claims totaling nearly $175 billion annually. These contractors are responsible for verifying the accuracy of the name and TIN used by health care providers that bill the Medicare program for reimbursement. Thus, the ability to identify and subsequently levy the payments made to Medicare providers who owe federal taxes would depend on establishing effective coordination between IRS and FMS and each of the contractors that pay the claims.", "The possibility of including Medicare vendor payments in the continuous levy program is further complicated because CMS contractors currently use one of six different computerized systems to process and pay claims. Although CMS eventually plans to have all of its contractors use one of three standardized claims processing systems, this consolidation is not expected to be completed before 2004. The contractors responsible for maintaining the three standardized systems believe that integrating a continuous levy process into Medicare claims processing systems is possible, but the systems would likely have to be modified and tested before implementation.", "Planned enhancements to the CMS accounting and provider enrollment systems may improve the likelihood that Medicare vendor payments could be included in the continuous levy program in the future. For example, in order to comply with federal financial management systems requirements, the agency is developing the CMS Integrated General Ledger and Accounting System. As currently envisioned by CMS, this system would contain detailed information on each Medicare claim paid, and as such, might offer FMS and IRS a central point of coordination for continuously levying Medicare vendor payments. Also, CMS is developing a centralized database of updated information on all health care providers that bill the Medicare program. This system is intended to help ensure that only qualified providers with a valid TIN enroll in and receive payments from the Medicare program. Once fully operational, this system is expected to interface with other CMS systems, thereby helping to ensure that the name and TIN used by providers have been validated by IRS. Neither system is scheduled to be fully operational before late 2006.", "Although these new systems may improve the likelihood that CMS vendor payments could be continuously levied in the future, FMS and CMS officials have not held discussions to ensure this result. Medicare contractors already offset payments to vendors for various reasons, such as recovery of previously overpaid claim amounts, which could result from either inadvertent billing errors or intentional misrepresentations.

On the other hand, in order to levy payments under its general levy authority IRS must identify that an agency is making payments to a delinquent taxpayer. Unlike the 15-percent levy amount limitation for the continuous levy program, under its general levy authority, IRS can levy up to 100 percent of a taxpayer\u2019s property and rights to property in some cases.", "IRS currently uses its general levy authority to levy federal salary and retirement payments. However, according to officials, IRS uses its general levy authority less frequently to levy federal vendor payments, partly because IRS has limited ability to identify and serve levies against vendor payments. According to IRS officials, almost all information IRS has on vendor payments comes from annual information returns that federal agencies and contractors are required to file for such payments. It takes IRS several months to process information returns and make them available to collection staff so they can identify potential levy sources. According to IRS officials, information return data are of little use because there is no certainty that an individual or business that received payments in a past year would receive payments in the current year. IRS officials acknowledged that obtaining current information on taxpayers that may be receiving DOD and CMS vendor payments might give IRS collection staff an opportunity to levy such payments under its general levy authority until such time as these payments could be included in the continuous levy program.", "DOD and CMS have databases that could be used to provide IRS with current information concerning individuals and businesses receiving vendor payments.

Information from each of these databases could be useful to IRS for identifying a current source against which to serve a levy under IRS\u2019 general levy authority.

Although some taxpayers might take actions to avoid a continuous levy, we believe our estimates of the tax debt that might be recovered are understated because we did not receive data for over 50 percent of Medicare payments made during the April through June 2000 quarter. In addition, we were unable to match about $3.4 billion in DOD vendor payments against IRS\u2019 accounts receivable data because the payment records did not contain a TIN.", "Based on our prior work involving the continuous levy program, we were aware that problems with information contained in vendor payment records could make such records unsuitable for matching against IRS\u2019 accounts receivable file, thus reducing the amount of tax debt that might be recovered. To identify additional debt that could be collected if problems with vendor payment records were corrected, we analyzed agency payment records to identify instances of a missing or inconsistent payee TIN or name. We selected all instances in which the TIN in the payment records matched the TIN in IRS\u2019 accounts receivable records, but the name in the payment records did not match the name in IRS\u2019 records. For these instances, we then reviewed IRS\u2019 records to determine whether it had additional information to indicate that the payee was in fact the delinquent taxpayer in question.", "To determine whether USPS, DOD, and CMS payments could be included in the continuous levy program and the timeframes for doing so, we interviewed IRS officials responsible for the continuous levy program. We also interviewed Financial Management Service (FMS) officials involved in recent discussions with various agencies in an attempt to include non- Treasury disbursed payments in the Treasury Offset Program. In addition, we interviewed officials from USPS, DOD, and CMS as well as selected Medicare contractors responsible for processing the various types of payments.", "To identify actions that could be taken to enhance IRS\u2019 ability to manually levy federal payments from delinquent individuals and businesses that are not included in the continuous levy program, we discussed this issue with IRS officials and officials from USPS, DOD, and CMS. We identified various agency databases that could be used to provide IRS with updated vendor payment sources. We also discussed IRS\u2019 current levy procedures with IRS officials, and reviewed the related tax law governing these procedures.", "We did our work at IRS, FMS, and USPS headquarters in Washington, D.C.; DOD headquarters in Arlington, VA; CMS headquarters in Baltimore, MD; Defense Finance and Accounting Service Centers in Columbus and Cleveland, OH, and Denver, CO; Defense Manpower Data Center in Seaside, CA; and the CMS Regional Office in San Francisco, CA. We also interviewed Medicare contractors located in Alabama, California, Florida, Maryland, New York, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Wisconsin."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments From the Internal Revenue Service", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s letter dated July 16, 2001."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1.  In response to IRS\u2019 concern that our text may have given the impression that IRS does not levy any federal payments that are not subject to the continuous levy program, we modified footnote 3 to recognize that IRS does levy such payments under its general levy authority. 2.  IRS\u2019 suggested change has been incorporated into the text. 3.  IRS\u2019 suggested change is included in footnote 10. 4.  We deleted \u201cindirect\u201d from our text.  While it is debatable whether the benefit would be direct or indirect, levy notices do sometimes result in taxpayers making other arrangements to resolve their tax liability. 5.  IRS\u2019 suggested change has been incorporated into the text. 6.  In response to IRS\u2019 concern with our use of the term \u201cdisparate treatment\u201d of taxpayers in our conclusions, we have revised our text to state that whether or not taxpayers are included in the continuous levy program is predicated in part on whether their federal payments are made by FMS or directly by other agencies.  We believe that this results in unequal treatment of delinquent taxpayers who receive federal payments and that this will only be corrected when more types of federal payments are available to the program."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments From the Financial Management Service", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments From the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to those named above, Wendy Ahmed, Tom N.
