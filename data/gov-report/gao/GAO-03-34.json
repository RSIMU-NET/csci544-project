Specifically, GAO estimated by race, ethnicity, and gender the number of members of the career SES who will leave government service from October 1, 2000, through September 30, 2007, and what the profile of the SES will be if appointment trends do not change.

About 46 percent of GS-15s and 34 percent of GS-14 workforce will provide agencies the opportunity to select minority members for the SES. Estimates for 24 large agencies showed substantial variation in SES losses in the proportion leaving and the effect on agencies' racial, ethnic, and gender profiles, with 10 agencies with decreases in minority representation and 12 with increases. The 6 agencies GAO visited recognize that the SES needs to be more diverse than GAO's projections estimate and have efforts under way to address SES diversity.

We estimated in an earlier  report that, from fiscal years 1999 through 2006, 15 percent of the  workforce would retire.  The Senior Executive Service (SES) generally  represents the most experienced, and one of the older in age, segments of  the workforce, and retirements are expected to be even higher for SES  members.  This has important implications for government management  and emphasizes the need for good succession planning for this leadership  group.  Racial, ethnic, and gender diversity in the SES corps is important  because they are the people who run the government\u2019s programs, and  diversity in the senior leadership is an important component for the  effective operation of the government.  Diversity can bring a wider variety  of perspectives and approaches to bear on policy development and  implementation, strategic planning, problem solving, and decision making  and can be an organizational strength that contributes to achieving results.", "You asked us to explore the implications for diversity, as defined by race,  ethnicity,and gender, of the expected loss of SES members over the next  several years.  Our objectives were to (1) estimate by race, ethnicity, and  gender the number of members of the career SES who will leave  government service from October 1, 2000, through September 30, 2007, and  what the profile of the SES will be if appointment trends do not change, (2)  make the same estimates for the pool from which the vast majority of SES  replacements will come (i.e., those in the General Schedule (GS) at grades  GS-15 and GS-14), and (3) obtain from the Office of Personnel Management  (OPM), the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), and four  selected agencies their observations on our estimates and on SES diversity  during this time of change.", "To address the objectives, we developed a model to estimate statistically  the number of career SES members by race, ethnicity, and gender who  would leave the government, primarily through retirement but including  other reasons, such as moving to private sector employment and death.    We used actual separation experience from fiscal years 1996 through 2000  as the basis for the model.  We made estimates for both the executive  branch overall and by agency for the 24 Chief Financial Officer (CFO)  agencies.  We then used actual SES appointment data by race, ethnicity,  and gender for fiscal years 1995 through 2000 to project what the SES  profile would be by October 1, 2007, if appointment trends do not change.   We used the same techniques to estimate losses to and replacements for  the GS-15 and GS-14 pool of potential SES replacements.  We asked OPM  and EEOC to comment on our estimates and their implications for diversity  in the SES.  We also asked OPM and EEOC to provide information on any  efforts they had under way or planned to address diversity considering the  magnitude of estimated SES losses.  In addition, we visited four federal  agencies\u2014two with relatively high proportions of women and/or racial and  ethnic minorities in the SES and two with relatively low proportions\u2014and  sought the same information from them as we had from OPM.  Our work  was performed from October 2001 through December 2002 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Details on our  methodology in general and our modeling and projection methods in  particular are presented in appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In a 2001 report, we estimated that by the end of fiscal year 2006 about 31  percent of the 24 CFO agencies\u2019 employees working in 1998, or 493,000  people, will be eligible to retire, and about half of the eligible employees  (236,000 people, the equivalent of 15 percent of the 1998 workforce) would  actually retire.  We included the SES in our analysis, but did not separately  analyze or break out data for the SES.  In 2000, we reported on SES  retirement eligibility and pointed out that because individuals normally do  not enter the SES until well into their careers, SES retirement eligibility is  much higher than for the workforce in general.  Our analysis showed that  71 percent of the almost 6,000 career SES members employed as of  October 1, 1998, would reach regular retirement eligibility by the end of  fiscal year 2005.  We concluded that the retirement eligibility trends of the  SES point to the importance of agencies placing appropriate emphasis and  attention on SES succession planning because SES retirements will result  in a loss of leadership continuity, institutional knowledge, and expertise  among the government\u2019s top career managers.  The importance that we  place on workforce planning, including planning related to employee  retirement, is illustrated by our designation of strategic human capital  management as a governmentwide high-risk area that needs urgent  attention to ensure that the federal government functions economically,  efficiently, and effectively.", "The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 that established the SES states,  among other things, that the policy of the federal government is to ensure  equal employment opportunity in the workforce.  It is generally recognized  that a diverse SES corps can be an organizational strength that contributes  to achieving results.  In fact, we consider diversity so important that we  identify it in our model for federal agencies on strategic human capital  management as one of the eight critical success factors for strategic  management.  The demographics of the public served by the federal  government are changing, and diversity has evolved from public policy to a  business need.  SES losses over the next several years present both a  challenge for the federal government in filling the vacant positions and an  opportunity to affect, through selections to the SES, the diversity of the  corps."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Government Has Important Opportunity To Affect SES Diversity, but Little Will Change If Current Appointment Trends Continue", "paragraphs": ["Because of the wave of retirements and normal attrition for other reasons,  the federal government will have the challenge and opportunity to replace  over half of its SES corps during fiscal years 2001 through 2007.  Our  simulation estimates that almost 3,400 of the 6,100 career SES members as  of October 2000 will have left the service by October 2007.  While a large  portion of the GS-15s and GS-14s who represent the primary pool of  replacements will also have left by October 2007, substantial numbers of  minorities and women will be among the potential SES candidates in that  pool.  However, if current SES appointment trends continue, the proportion  of the SES represented by minorities will remain essentially unchanged.", "Table 1 presents the results by racial, ethnic, and gender groups of our  simulation of SES attrition and projection of SES appointments using  current trends.  The simulation estimates that 56 percent of the SES  members who held positions at the start of fiscal year 2001 will leave  service during the ensuing 7 years.  The table also shows that the  racial/ethnic profile of those SES members who will remain in the service  throughout the 7-year period will be about the same as it was for all SES  members in October 2000.  This is because minorities will be leaving at  essentially the same rate overall as white members.  Thus, any change in  minority representation will be the result of new appointments to the SES.   However, as the last columns of table 1 show, if current appointment trends  continue, the result of replacing over half of the SES will be a corps whose  racial and ethnic profile is virtually the same as it was before.  The outlook  regarding gender diversity is somewhat different because the percentage  represented by white women is estimated to increase by 4 percentage  points and the percentage of minority women minimally by 0.5 percentage  point.  The proportion representing minority men is estimated to be  virtually unchanged, only a 0.2 percentage point increase while white men\u2019s  proportion will decrease by 5 percentage points.", "To ascertain what the racial, ethnic, and gender profile of the candidate  pool for SES replacements will look like, we performed the same  simulations and projections for GS-15s and GS-14s as we did for the SES.   Over 80 percent of career SES appointments of federal employees come  from the ranks of GS-15s.  Similarly, those promoted to GS-15 are GS-14s  over 90 percent of the time.  Table 2 presents the results for GS-15s and  table 3 for GS-14s.  The results for both are similar to those for the SES, but  a somewhat lower proportion will leave because GS-15s and GS-14s are  generally younger and have somewhat different propensities to leave than  SES members.", "Almost half of the GS-15s (24,499, or 47 percent) and about a third of GS- 14s (28,419, or 34 percent) will have left government service by October  2007 according to our simulation.  Minority representation among those  GS-15s who remain will be about the same as it was in fiscal year 2001,  indicating that whites and minorities will leave at about the same rates.   However, the proportion of the remaining GS-14s represented by minorities  will increase somewhat (by 1.5 percentage points) and the proportion of  both grades represented by white and minority women will also increase.   Moreover, if current promotion trends to GS-15 and GS-14 continue,  marginal gains by almost all of the racial and ethnic groups would result.   Our simulation shows that significant numbers of minority GS-15s (4,673)  and GS-14s (10,567) will be employed throughout fiscal years 2000 through  2007, and our projection of promotions also shows substantial numbers of  minorities at the GS-15 (8,957) and GS-14 (15,672) levels.  These numbers  indicate that significant numbers of minority candidates for appointment to  the SES should be available.", "With respect to gender, the percentage of white women at GS-15 is  projected to increase by 2.6 percentage points and at GS-14 by 1.0  percentage point.  The proportions of minority women will increase by 0.9  percentage point for GS-15s and 0.6 percentage point for GS-14s while  those for minority men will increase 0.7 percentage point for GS-15s and 0.5  percentage point for GS-14s.

However, as with the governmentwide numbers discussed in the  previous section, agencies tend to increase the proportion of women in the  SES, particularly white women, and decrease the proportion of white men.   The proportion represented by minorities tended to change relatively little.

The representation of  women ranged from 13.7 percent to 36.1 percent with half of the agencies  having 27 percent or fewer women.  For minority representation, rates  varied even more and ranged from 3.1 percent to 35.6 percent with half of  the agencies having less than 15 percent minorities in the SES.

The effect on  representation of minorities and women in the residual SES also varies but  exhibits little change at most agencies for minorities from the October 1,  2000, profile.  Only 3 agencies exhibited increases in minority  representation of more than 1 percentage point.  Increases for women were  higher once again with only 1 agency having an increase of less than 3  percentage points.  Most of the changes for women were accounted for by  white women.", "Our projection of what the SES would look like if current appointment  trends continued through October 1, 2007, also showed variation with 12  agencies having increased minority representation and 10 having less.   While projected changes for women are often appreciable, with 16 agencies  having gains of 4 percentage points or more and no decreases, projected  minority representation changes in the SES at most of the CFO agencies  are small, exceeding a 2 percentage point increase at only 6 agencies, with  10 agencies having decreases.", "The diversity picture for GS-15s and GS-14s is somewhat better than that  for the SES at most agencies.  The main differences from the SES are that a  smaller proportion of the GS-15 and GS-14 population is estimated to leave  government service and projected representation of minorities tends to be  somewhat greater for those grades compared to the SES.  Even after  considering estimated attrition, agencies tend to have substantial numbers  of minorities and women in the SES replacement pool and projected  promotions to GS-15 and GS-14 increase those numbers.  As mentioned  above, appendix II presents detailed information on GS-15s and GS-14s at  the CFO agencies.  Again, our estimates for the GS-15 and GS-14  populations at individual agencies are likely to be less precise than our  governmentwide figures because of the smaller numbers involved but  should be indicative of what agency profiles will look like in October 2007."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OPM and the Federal Agencies Said That Further Action Is Needed to Promote SES Diversity", "paragraphs": ["OPM has recently reaffirmed its commitment to diversity in the career SES,  and has provided guidance to federal departments and agencies on  maintaining and increasing workforce diversity.

Therefore, one limitation is that our model does not predict with 100  percent accuracy the actual rates of separation, although it is uncommon in  real world applications to find such a high squared correlation as our model  achieved when dealing with behavioral data such as separating from  federal government employment.", "The accuracy of our projections are also limited by the assumptions we  made.  Because the model is based on past trends, the estimates of future  separations and appointments assume that factors affecting past trends  will continue into the future.  If one or more assumptions are incorrect,  then the projections would change.  The model does not account for  possible changes in the future such as substantial pay increases, major  changes in personnel policies, substantial changes in the number of  employees, or large government reorganizations, such as creation of the  Department of Homeland Security.  For example, our past work has shown  that a major increase in SES pay reduces the rate of retirements (and thus  separations) in the first 3 years after the pay hike, followed by an increase  in subsequent years.", "Many nonwork factors can influence an employee\u2019s decision to separate  from the government.  Factors such as an individual\u2019s health or children\u2019s  age/college status may affect the decision of when to separate.  Data for  these other factors were not available to be included in the statistical  model.   Other nonwork factors, such as future stock market performance,  were not included.", "Because we did not include transfers from one agency to another as  separations, the estimated separations for individual agencies are probably  not as precise as separations governmentwide.   Similarly, because we did  not include promotions from GS-14 to GS-15 or appointments to the SES  from GS-14 or GS-15, separations for GS-14s and GS-15s are probably  underestimated.", "We asked OPM and EEOC to comment on our estimates and their  implications for diversity in the SES.  We also asked OPM and EEOC to  provide information on any efforts they had planned or under way to  address diversity, considering the magnitude of estimated SES losses.  In  addition, we visited four federal agencies\u2014two with relatively high  proportions of women and/or racial and ethnic minorities in the SES and  two with relatively low proportions\u2014and sought the same information  from them as we had from OPM.

We also  presented our governmentwide simulation results and projections to the  Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the Equal Employment  Opportunity Commission (EEOC).  SSA and the three departments said our  analysis of their career SES, and GS-15 and GS-14, losses and future  diversity was reasonable.  All of the agencies agreed that improvements  needed to be made in their current SES diversity in at least some minority  and gender groups.  All four also acknowledged that the composition of the  career SES that we projected if present selection trends continued would  not be acceptable and discussed efforts they had made and were planning  to take to promote diversity in general and in the career SES in particular.  These efforts have significant elements in common.  Because almost all  career SES selections come from within the agency with a relative few   selected from other agencies, agency officials generally agreed that the  most effective way to enhance SES diversity is to increase diversity of the  GS-15 and GS-14 feeder pool.  OPM officials also said that if our projections  were the actual result of SES selections through fiscal year 2007, that result  would be unacceptable from a diversity standpoint.
