However, the 35-year-old rail system has experienced safety and reliability problems, including fatal accidents. A 16-member board of directors governs WMATA, setting policies and providing oversight. Recent reports have noted weaknesses in WMATA's governance structure and recommended changing it. GAO assessed WMATA's governance in terms of the board's roles and responsibilities, oversight, and strategic planning. To do so, GAO compiled leading practices from previous GAO work on public and private sector governance, non-GAO transit governance studies, and strategic planning standards; then compared WMATA's approach to those practices. GAO also spoke with six transit agencies selected based on board composition and ridership, among other things."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Although some requirements and guidance for board roles and responsibilities are provided in the WMATA compact and board procedures, WMATA board members, officials, and other stakeholders have reported that sometimes the board focuses on management's day-to-day responsibilities rather than higher level board responsibilities such as oversight and strategic planning. This focus may have resulted from, for example, inadequate delineation and documentation of the board's responsibilities as well as inadequate communication among board members. In addition, while leading governance practices state that effective transit boards monitor the effectiveness of the board's organization, structure, and functioning through a regular board selfassessment, WMATA's board does not do so. As a result, the board lacks a key mechanism for regular, ongoing measurement of its performance. In April 2011, the board released draft bylaws that clarify the roles and responsibilities for the board and propose that the board chair coordinate a board selfevaluation. These draft bylaws represent a good first step toward addressing some of the concerns discussed in this report but will need to be adopted and then effectively implemented to achieve their desired effect. The board's oversight role is supported by the board's committee structure, which provides a communication channel for information to reach the board. Past board practices such as infrequent meetings of the Audit and Investigations Subcommittee and the lack of routine briefings on outside safety recommendations may have impaired the ability of the board to use information about areas in need of improvement regarding the operations and finances of the agency. However, given the variety in other transit agencies' practices and the lack of clear criteria on how often audit committees should meet, there is no clear standard against which to measure WMATA's practices. The board's draft bylaws propose changes to the organization of the board's committee structure. WMATA has developed elements of strategic planning over the past 4 years, but the agency's board and management could enhance their strategic focus and long-term planning processes to improve performance. WMATA acknowledged several failed past efforts at strategic planning. WMATA officials said that prior attempts failed due to a lack of management support, employee buy-in, and specific actions to execute the plans; and a focus on tactical versus strategic decision making. WMATA management has developed several elements of strategic planning, such as a mission statement, goals, objectives, and strategies. However, the agency's strategic planning process could benefit from more board and stakeholder involvement, internal and external environmental assessments, longer time frames, program evaluations, and updated performance metrics. In June 2011, the board launched an effort to overhaul its strategic planning process."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends among other things that the WMATA board of directors follow through with its efforts to clarify the roles and responsibilities of the board; conduct a regular self-assessment of the board's effectiveness; and improve its strategic planning process by actions such as increasing the board's involvement in the process and updating the agency's performance metrics.

However, WMATA\u2019s public rail transit system is 35  years old and has experienced problems related to the safety and  reliability of its services, including fatal accidents, equipment breakdowns,  delays in scheduled service, crowding on trains, and tunnel fires. In  addition, the agency faces challenges in maintaining the aging system  while expanding the system to Dulles International Airport, adding 23  miles and additional riders to the rail transit system. In 2008, WMATA  estimated that it had about $11 billion worth of capital needs over 10  years, or $1.1 billion per year; its capital budget for fiscal year 2011 is  $712.3 million.

The board  sets policies and oversees all of WMATA\u2019s activities, including capital and  operating budgeting, system development and expansion, safety, and  procurement. In 2010, two reports concluded that weaknesses in  WMATA\u2019s governance contributed to the safety and operational reliability  challenges facing the transit system and recommended changes to  WMATA\u2019s governance structure. Our objective was to assess WMATA\u2019s  governance in terms of the board\u2019s roles and responsibilities, oversight,  strategic planning, and governance structure, and identify changes, if any,  that should be made. Specifically, we addressed the following question:  How do roles and responsibilities, oversight, and strategic planning  elements of WMATA\u2019s practices align with leading governance practices?  In addition, we provide information on the appointment of federal  members to WMATA\u2019s board by the General Services Administration  (GSA).", "In conducting our work, we focused on WMATA\u2019s governance in terms of  the board\u2019s structure, communication, policies, practices, and  documentation relating to its oversight of management and  implementation of its organizational mission. We analyzed management\u2019s  role in certain areas, such as strategic planning; however, we did not fully  assess the adequacy of management\u2019s role in effectively operating the  agency.", "To determine relevant governance practices, we compiled practices from  several sources, including those practices used in previous GAO work on  public and private sector governance and non-GAO studies, reports, and  recommendations concerning the governance of transit agencies, other  similar organizations, and corporations. Additionally, we incorporated  strategic planning practices from the Transit Cooperative Research  Program, previous GAO work, and other sources as appropriate. (For a  full list of sources, see app. I.) We then consolidated and categorized  leading governance practices and recommendations along similar themes,  such as structure, oversight, and strategic planning.", "To determine how WMATA\u2019s practices align with these leading governance  practices, we reviewed and compared elements of the composition and  structure of the WMATA board and senior management, communication  between the board and management, policies and other documentation in  place to guide WMATA\u2019s practices, and WMATA\u2019s internal and external  oversight practices to the leading governance and strategic planning  practices that we identified. We conducted semistructured interviews with  WMATA senior management, current board members, local jurisdictions,  oversight agencies, and other groups conducting governance reviews. In  addition, we conducted semistructured interviews with officials from  transit agencies in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, New York, Philadelphia, and  San Francisco. Respectively, we spoke with the Metropolitan Atlanta  Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA), Massachusetts Bay Transportation  Authority (MBTA), Chicago Transit Authority (CTA), Metropolitan  Transportation Authority (MTA), Southeastern Pennsylvania  Transportation Authority (SEPTA), and Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART).  We chose these transit agencies based on similarities to WMATA along  many characteristics, including size and makeup of the board, annual  ridership, services provided, budget issues, and complexity of the service  area.", "We conducted interviews with GSA concerning the appointment of federal  members to WMATA\u2019s board.

The compact, as amended, creates a  16-member board of directors (8 voting and 8 alternate members) to  govern WMATA and designates an appointing authority for each signatory  to appoint 2 voting members and 2 alternate members to the board. (See  table 1.) As of June 2011, GSA\u2014which is responsible for selecting the  board members representing the federal government\u2014had appointed 2  voting members and 1 alternate, but had not appointed a second alternate.  The District of Columbia also has a single vacancy for an alternate  member, leaving board membership at 14. Nine of the 14 active members,  including 7 voting members were appointed between January 2010 and  May 2011. Also, according to the compact, the board must elect a chair at  the beginning of every year. The chair has historically rotated between the  three local jurisdictions each year; however, beginning in January 2011,  board procedures allow for anyone to be elected chair, including the  previous year\u2019s chair or a federal board member.", "The compact also provides the board with broad policy-making authority,  specifically in the areas of planning, budgeting, and financing. To help  carry out these functions, the board has established committees, such as  safety and security, customer service and operations, and finance and  administration. (See fig. 2.) WMATA board procedures allow that alternate  board members can vote in committee meetings, but can only vote in full  board meetings in the absence of \u201ctheir\u201d voting member.", "In addition, the board is responsible for appointing a general  manager/chief executive officer (GM/CEO) and executive leadership team  to manage day-to-day operations and to develop policies and procedures,  draft a budget, and conduct all other tasks related to operating and  maintaining the transit system.

The Riders\u2019 Advisory Council  (RAC) and the Greater Washington Board of Trade and Metropolitan  Washington Council of Governments sponsored Task Force (Governance  Task Force) both issued reports critiquing WMATA\u2019s board and  management. Examples of recommendations from both reports include:  (1) board roles and responsibilities should be more clearly defined and (2)  the board should redefine the general manager position as WMATA\u2019s chief  executive officer and that person should oversee WMATA\u2019s daily  management. (See app. II for additional information on the  recommendations made by these reports.) In addition, a National  Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) report on a fatal June 2009 accident  discussed how shortcomings in WMATA\u2019s internal communications,  recognition of hazards, assessment of risk from those hazards, and  implementation of corrective actions are evidence of the absence of a  safety culture within the organization. The report partially attributes this  situation to WMATA\u2019s governance due to inadequate or deficient oversight  by the board."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Stakeholders Believe Inadequate Delineation, Documentation, Communication, and Self-Assessment of the Board\u2019s Responsibilities Have Led to Occasional Lack of Strategic Focus", "paragraphs": ["WMATA board members, officials, and other stakeholders have reported  that the board sometimes focuses on management\u2019s day-to-day  responsibilities rather than higher level board responsibilities such as  policy, oversight, and strategic planning. This lack of strategic focus may  have resulted from inadequate delineation and documentation of the  board\u2019s responsibilities, as well as inadequate communication among  board members.", "Governance practices based on previous GAO work and other relevant  studies state that an effective transit board:  focuses on policy making, principally specific elements such as guidance  and strategic issues as well as oversight and monitoring of management  and performance;   clearly defines and formally documents its roles and responsibilities and  has a clear view of its role in relationship to that of management. All  activities, such as meetings and agenda items, should focus members on  policy making and away from day-to-day management issues;    delegates day-to-day management of the agency to the GM/CEO and other  informs and educates its members and provides orientation to new board  members; and   acts as a cohesive group, eliminating personal agendas.", "Current and former board members and senior officials with whom we  spoke believed that the WMATA board and individual board members  have sometimes focused on the day-to-day operations of the transit agency  and become involved in areas that should be the responsibilities of  management. Specific cited examples of board involvement in  management\u2019s responsibilities include hiring and firing employees beyond  senior management; approval of a minor personnel policy; and  involvement and debate of specific detailed decisions such as station tiles,  bicycle facilities, and transit car seat colors.", "Consistent with leading governance practices, WMATA board procedures  state, \u201cNo Member individually shall direct or supervise the GM/CEO or  any WMATA employee or contractor managers.\u201d However, WMATA  officials told us that rather than acting as a cohesive group, individual  board members had directed staff to make changes to presentations prior  to board meetings. These officials also reported that some individual  board members had what they believed to be excessive contact with  midlevel managers requesting specific information rather than working  through established channels such as the board chairman, GM/CEO, or  other senior management.", "Several board members and WMATA officials also commented that the  frequency of board meetings can be inefficient and symptomatic of a lack  of a strategic focus by the board. Several board members believed that the  board meets too often, which can be an indication that it is too involved in  running the agency. Officials and board members also stated that  preparing for board activities\u2014while important\u2014can reduce the time staff  have available to conduct day-to-day operations and analysis, or monitor  and improve the performance of the transit system. Between April 30,  2010, and May 1, 2011, the WMATA board met 84 times\u201417 board  meetings and 67 committee meetings or executive sessions. By  comparison, the WMATA board met more frequently than five of the six  transit agencies we visited. Only New York\u2019s MTA\u2014which carries  approximately 8 times the number of daily riders\u2014met more frequently.  (See fig. 4.) (Additional information comparing the six transit agencies  with WMATA is found in app. III.)", "Board members and stakeholders, such as RAC and the Governance Task  Force, told us that the lack of strategic focus by the board may be in part  attributed to inadequate delineation and documentation of board roles,  inadequate communication among board members, and other factors.  Roles and responsibilities for the board are delineated in two primary  documents: the compact and board procedures. As mentioned earlier, the  compact provides the board with specific tasks and authorities such as  developing a mass transit plan, capital and current expense budgets, and a  financing plan; selecting a GM/CEO, an independent auditor, and an audit  committee; and adhering to legal requirements such as the Davis-Bacon  Act. The compact also states that \u201csubject to policy direction by the  board,\u201d the GM/CEO \u201cshall be responsible for all activities\u201d of WMATA. In  addition, board procedures further delineate that the board \u201cdetermines  agency policy and provides oversight for the funding, operation and  expansion of safe, reliable, and effective transit service within the Transit  Zone.\u201d", "Although the compact and board procedures provide some guidance, there  is a perception among WMATA officials, some board members, and other  stakeholders that the described roles and responsibilities are too broad  and not clearly defined. The Governance Task Force found that \u201cthe lack  of delineation of responsibilities has created an environment where there  is no clear understanding of who is accountable for issues such as day-to- day management, communication, operations, and safety.\u201d In addition,  some board members we spoke with told us that while the existing  documentation generally provides clarity, it should be improved. For  example, throughout the history of WMATA, the board has made specific  delegations of authority to the GM/CEO covering such issues as  procurements and personnel policies. However, according to board  members and WMATA\u2019s general counsel, these delegations\u2014and other  board resolutions\u2014are not organized or readily accessible to the board.", "Inadequate board communication including failure to orient, inform, and  educate new and existing board members has also contributed to the lack  of a strategic focus of the board, according to board members. For  example, in the past, orientation for new board members has been  informal, driven primarily through the initiative of the new board members  themselves. In comparison, officials at four of the six transit agencies we  visited told us that they provide a formal orientation for new board  members. For example, as a result of MARTA\u2019s orientation process, a  MARTA official stated that roles and responsibilities for the board are  clear and well-defined. Their orientation includes (1) presentations by the  senior executive team on subjects such as the MARTA Act and its specific  criteria and allowances as well as the bylaws, (2) discussion of the roles  and responsibilities of board members, (3) an explanation of meeting  structure, and (4) a tour of key facilities. In contrast, at WMATA, we  observed that current efforts to inform and educate board members, such  as discussion during meetings, have not consistently proven to be effective  in informing board members of their role relative to management\u2019s role in  day-to-day operations.", "Other factors might have also contributed to the lack of a strategic focus  for the board. For example, in the past, WMATA\u2019s board procedures were  subject to change by the annually rotated chairperson. One senior WMATA  manager told us that each time the procedures change it takes time for the  board members to adjust. In addition, the Congressional Research Service  noted that the model of the WMATA board\u2014which is closer to a public  utility model than a private sector model\u2014requires action in decisions  such as fare setting, route selection, and frequency of service  determinations that are normally viewed as day-to-day decisions in the  private sector. The WMATA compact delineates that the board should  develop and adopt a mass transit plan that includes specific elements such  as routes, schedules, and fares. In contrast, officials at SEPTA told us that,  although the SEPTA board also plays a role in approving budgets, service  plans, and some procurements, SEPTA\u2019s enabling legislation articulates  that the board\u2019s focus is to be on long-term planning and policy rather than  the day-to-day administration of the agency\u2019s business.", "Additionally, WMATA\u2019s board does not conduct a self-assessment.  According to leading governance practices, effective transit boards  monitor their progress on an annual basis and conduct a thorough self- assessment every 3 to 5 years. Such an assessment would not only  evaluate progress in terms of the transit system\u2019s performance, but also  evaluate the effectiveness of the board\u2019s organization, structure, and  functioning, and its impact on performance. The WMATA board does not  do this type of an assessment; two board members with whom we spoke  pointed out that the only form of board assessment is the replacement of  board members by their appointing authorities. As a result, the board is  lacking a key mechanism for regular, ongoing measurement of its  performance. By comparison, New York\u2019s MTA board is required by law to  complete an annual board self-assessment whereby the board as a whole  and each of the committees, individually, assesses its effectiveness. In  addition, MTA\u2019s Office of Inspector General (OIG) has statutory authority  that makes it permissible for it to audit and investigate the board of  directors, or its members if the need arises; past oversight efforts have  included reviewing the board\u2019s oversight of MTA capital mega-projects.  MTA\u2019s Inspector General told us that the ability to use such a broad,  general authority in this manner is an important oversight mechanism for  MTA. By comparison, the WMATA board has not adopted procedures to  allow the WMATA OIG to investigate claims against the board, including  alleged wrongdoing by board members or alleged instances of the board  not following procedures or protocols.", "Some WMATA board members agreed that the board should focus on  policy making and should have a role in setting goals, strategic planning,  budgeting, oversight, and monitoring performance. Specifically, these  board members commented that the board should be more focused on  setting and evaluating performance metrics based on a strong strategic  planning process, an area that has been lacking in the past. Starting in  December 2010, the board and management began taking steps to further  identify and delineate roles and responsibilities including the  establishment of the Governance Committee. Additionally, in April 2011,  the board released draft bylaws intended to be permanent and amendable  only by a majority vote of the board. If adopted and then effectively  implemented, the draft bylaws would address some of the issues described  above. For example, the draft bylaws    assign roles and responsibilities for the board, board members, and the  chair and mandate an orientation program, a self-evaluation of the board,  and standardization of communication procedures and conduits. require the board to act as a cohesive group, focusing on policy making,  strategic planning, and oversight, as well as its specific roles in creating  and adopting a budget, determining a fare structure and service levels, and  developing a business plan.   clarify that the GM/CEO has been delegated the authority and is primarily  responsible for the overall administration and operation of WMATA  subject to policy direction and oversight from the board.", "In addition, the board has requested that WMATA\u2019s general counsel  organize and catalog board resolutions that delegate authority to the  GM/CEO. The board has also organized a new, more formal, orientation  program for new board members and plans to draft amended board  procedures and a revised code of ethics."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "WMATA\u2019s Board Is Structured to Receive Information That Could Facilitate More Effective Oversight of the System", "paragraphs": ["To help carry out its role as an oversight body, WMATA\u2019s board is  structured to have access to information that could help facilitate effective  oversight of management and the agency\u2019s operations. According to  leading governance practices, a board needs to have an effective oversight  process, supported by timely and accurate information and clear  communication channels. The types of oversight information available to  the board are important because they can provide the board with  understanding about areas in need of attention and improvement  regarding the operations and finances of the agency. However, past board  practices such as infrequent meetings of the Audit and Investigations  Subcommittee and the lack of routine briefings on the status of  recommendations from outside parties may have impaired the ability of  the board to use this information to effectively carry out its oversight role.", "The board receives or has access to several key sources of information  related to finance, operations, and safety that could facilitate effective  oversight. For example, in 2006, WMATA established the OIG to conduct  and supervise audits, program evaluations, and investigations. The  inspector general is appointed by the board and reports directly to it. The  board also receives information that could facilitate effective board  monitoring and oversight from two important external entities. At the  federal level, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) conducts a  triennial review, a procurement systems review, and a financial  management review. In the most recent series of these reviews, in 2007  and 2008, FTA recommended improvements in several areas, including  preventative maintenance; internal controls related to real property,  facilities, and equipment; procurement policies and procedures; and  WMATA\u2019s cost allocation plan and grant budget accounting. FTA officials  stated that these types of findings and recommendations were typical of  those found at other transit agencies.", "Additionally, the Tri-state Oversight Committee was created in 1997 by  state-level agencies in Virginia and Maryland and the District of Columbia  to jointly oversee rail safety and security at WMATA. In 2007, the  committee made several findings and observations, many of which dealt  with updating agency documentation or policies, such as the system safety  program plan. More recently, in 2010, the committee reported that  WMATA has worked to resolve outstanding safety issues and findings from  previous internal and external safety reviews and investigations.  Additionally, there are other mechanisms for the board to obtain relevant  information from stakeholders, including RAC, the Jurisdictional  Coordinating Committee (JCC), and a regular public comment period  during board meetings.", "Internally, the board\u2019s six committees provide procedures and  communication channels to facilitate the flow of guidance and oversight  information to the board in areas such as finance, safety, security, and  customer service. For example, one of the board\u2019s key governance areas is  its responsibility to annually adopt a capital budget for the agency. The  Finance and Administration Committee\u2014with its overall responsibility for  monitoring the financial integrity and viability of WMATA\u2014recommends  capital and operating budget approval to the board, monitors capital and  operating budget implementation and management, develops budget  preparation guidance, and recommends proposed budgetary changes to  the board. Additionally, the committee recommends policies for fare  setting and oversees the operation and development of fare collection  mechanisms, among other things.", "The Audits and Investigations Subcommittee, which is part of the Finance  and Administration Committee, serves as the main avenue for information  that can be used to facilitate the board\u2019s oversight of financial reporting  and audit processes\u2014including the financial reporting and related audits  and OIG reports\u2014which are reported or otherwise available to the board.  According to the subcommittee chair, the subcommittee provides input,  along with management, into an internal audit plan developed by the OIG  each year prior to the adoption of the annual budget and uses the OIG\u2019s  quarterly reports to monitor the status of corrective actions taken by  WMATA on outstanding OIG recommendations. The subcommittee chair  also noted that the subcommittee uses an independent auditor\u2019s report on  WMATA\u2019s financial statements and single audit report to facilitate its  oversight of the quality and integrity of WMATA\u2019s internal controls,  compliance systems and accounting, auditing, and financial reporting  processes. Furthermore, the subcommittee chair explained that the board  also uses this information to monitor the status of corrective actions taken  on past recommendations made by the external auditor.", "The board\u2019s Audits and Investigations Subcommittee is the board\u2019s main  channel for audit information and provides the opportunity for financial  oversight information to reach the board. However, the subcommittee has  met relatively infrequently. The subcommittee met once in 2008 and twice  in both 2009 and 2010\u2014including meeting with the OIG to discuss safety  and investigative matters and to discuss and accept the external auditor\u2019s  annually required report on the audit of WMATA\u2019s financial statements.  Additionally, the current placement of the subcommittee within a full  committee differs from other transit agency practices. By comparison,  some transit agencies we visited had an audit committee that met more  often and had the audit and financial reporting function elevated to a  committee. For example, the audit committees at SEPTA and New York\u2019s  MTA met four and seven times, respectively, over the last year; while  Boston\u2019s MBTA met less often. However, given the variety in other transit  agencies\u2019 practices and the lack of clear criteria on how often audit  committees should meet, there is no clear standard against which to  measure WMATA\u2019s practices.", "According to the board procedures, the Safety and Security Committee is  responsible for providing safety and security policy direction; oversight to  assure that all facilities, equipment, and operations of the transit system  are safe and secure; and safety and security goals for the GM/CEO and the  agency. To carry out its duties, the committee reviews WMATA\u2019s system  safety program plan for consistency with safety goals and receives  periodic reports from the Tri-State Oversight Committee. It also works  with FTA and NTSB, as appropriate, to review the status of WMATA safety  with the goal of assuring that all safety recommendations from any  internal or external safety review or investigation are handled  expeditiously and effectively. The committee has met regularly since  October 2010, according to the agency.", "A 2010 report by NTSB highlighted problems with the flow of safety  oversight information. That report states that the WMATA board  chairman told NTSB that prior to the June 2009 accident the board did not  receive routine briefings on safety recommendations or corrective action  plans; rather the board counted on the GM/CEO to identify relevant issues  that required the board\u2019s attention. In response, NTSB recommended that  the board evaluate actions taken in response to recommendations and  corrective action plans from NTSB, FTA, and the Tri-State Oversight  Committee. WMATA has several offices, including the OIG, tasked with  internal and external recommendation tracking. The Safety and Security  Committee receives regular reports from the agency\u2019s Chief Safety Officer  and Chief of Police on the status of the responsiveness of the agency to  internal and external safety findings, including the status of corrective  action plans, as well as any significant accidents or incidents. WMATA  officials told us that they are developing an updated safety  recommendation tracking system, and NTSB has closed this  recommendation as implemented. Additionally, NTSB concluded that,  before the June 2009 accident, the board did not exercise oversight  responsibility for the safety of the WMATA system, leading it to  recommend that the board elevate its safety oversight role by developing a  policy statement to explicitly and publicly assume the responsibility for  continual oversight of system safety. WMATA has implemented this  recommendation.", "The board\u2019s other committees have additional oversight responsibilities.  For example, the Customer Service and Operations Committee is  responsible for overseeing transit system performance and service  standards; the quality of operations programs and procedures; and  customer service, communication, and outreach activities, including  public and media relations. The objective of the committee is to help  ensure that WMATA operational activities and programs are designed to  provide reliable, effective and clean transit service, responsive to  customer needs. The Policy, Program Development and Intergovernmental  Relations Committee is responsible for coordination of regional planning  issues and planning for transit service, access, and system expansion,  among other things.", "As mentioned earlier, in April 2011, the recently created Governance  Committee released draft bylaws which, if adopted, would elevate the  Audits and Investigations Subcommittee to a full committee, streamline  board communications by standardizing communication procedures and  channels, and formalize the board\u2019s relationship with advisory committees  such as JCC and RAC.", "While there is no single approach to best support all transit agency  oversight, officials at MTA noted that they also used additional ways to  support their oversight functions that they believed had benefits. For  example, officials told us that, pursuant to state statute, the agency uses  an independent engineer to evaluate key technical or capital-intensive  projects, assess risk, and act as a control on those projects. One WMATA  board member indicated a desire to have access to independent expertise  for consultation, noting that such resources could improve the board\u2019s  effectiveness.", "Additionally, the Governance Task Force and RAC have recommended  that WMATA change elements of its board structure\u2014such as increasing  the size of the board and changing the role of alternates\u2014to improve its  governance. Our analysis, however, indicates that most of the  recommended changes have trade-offs\u2014there are both benefits and  drawbacks to them. We compared the various recommendations to  leading governance practices, approaches taken by other transit agencies,  and the views of board members and stakeholders. Board members and  stakeholders indicated that proposed changes to the board\u2019s structure and  processes\u2014such as eliminating alternate board members, changing the  size of the board, or eliminating the jurisdictional veto\u2014have trade-offs,  and we did not find consistent support among leading governance  practices or other transit agencies that these changes would improve  governance. Some other proposed changes such as uniform compensation  and coordinated board member appointments will require action by the  three jurisdictions. To accomplish that task, the Governance Task Force  recommended that the signatories and the appointing authorities form a  WMATA Governance Commission to make improvements to the  authority\u2019s governance structure and hold the board accountable for its  performance. Such an additional oversight body could help facilitate  coordination among the jurisdictions. However, we did not identify  governance leading practices, or find other transit agencies with a  comparable oversight board over a board of directors. Furthermore, such  a commission was viewed by some stakeholders we spoke with as  redundant because it would be comprised of most of the same  membership that is responsible for appointing the board of directors.

Leading organizations  that we have analyzed use strategic planning to articulate a comprehensive  mission as well as to identify and achieve long-range goals and objectives  for all levels of the organization. While strategic planning practices may  vary among organizations according to agency-specific needs and  missions, according to leading strategic planning practices we identified,  effective strategic planning generally includes a mission statement, long- term goals and objectives, and strategies to achieve the goals; covers the  major functions and operations of an agency; and establishes a multiyear  time frame and performance metrics for gauging progress. According to  the literature, the process for strategic planning should also include  assessing the organization\u2019s external and internal environments,  conducting a stakeholder analysis and involving the board and key  stakeholders in the strategic planning process, identifying key strategic  issues facing the organization, developing a process for implementing and  managing these issues, and reassessing the strategic planning process.", "WMATA has not succeeded in past attempts at strategic planning. WMATA  officials acknowledged several failed efforts at strategic planning, which  they said occurred because of a lack of management support and  employee buy-in, a lack of specific actions to execute the plans, and a  focus on tactical versus strategic decision making.", "According to a senior WMATA official, however, the agency is in the  process of developing a strategic planning and performance management  system, which consists of a strategic framework, a GM/CEO\u2019s annual  execution plan, and internal departmental execution plans. The strategic  framework is a one-page document, available on WMATA\u2019s Web site,  which outlines the agency\u2019s mission statement, along with 5 goals and 12  objectives. The agency\u2019s departmental execution plans are internal  documents\u2014not available on the Web site\u2014that identify actions,  measures, targets, and responsibility for meeting WMATA\u2019s strategic goals  and objectives. The final component of WMATA\u2019s strategic planning  system is the GM/CEO\u2019s execution plan, which a senior WMATA official  told us identifies annual safety, operational, and financial performance  measures and targets. According to a senior WMATA official, as of May  2011, this document was being reviewed by the board. It was not made  available to us.", "WMATA has developed several elements of effective strategic planning  through its strategic framework and execution plans, such as a mission  statement, goals, objectives, strategies, and metrics. The agency\u2019s strategic  framework includes a mission statement for the agency, which was  approved by the board, along with goals and objectives for the programs  and operations of the agency. WMATA also has developed some processes  for implementing and managing its strategic issues through departmental  execution plans. These plans contain strategies for key actions that are  linked to the strategic goals and objectives. WMATA has also linked the  prioritization of its capital needs to its strategic goals and objectives, as  part of aligning its activities to support the agency\u2019s goals. Furthermore,  the departmental execution plans also include performance metrics and  targets for tracking progress on the agency\u2019s key actions for achieving its  goals and objectives, some of which are publicly available and regularly  reported to the board."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "WMATA\u2019s Strategic Planning Process Lacks Board and Stakeholder Awareness and Involvement", "paragraphs": ["WMATA\u2019s strategic planning and performance management system does  not include some strategic planning elements of leading organizations that  we have studied, such as stakeholder awareness and involvement,  environmental assessments, a long-term time frame and regular updating,  program evaluations, and up-to-date performance metrics. Specifically:  Board and stakeholder awareness and involvement are lacking.  According to strategic planning practices we identified, a strategic  planning process at a transit agency should be driven by the board, as part  of its role in setting the direction and priorities of the organization. Board  involvement in the strategic planning process allows the board to help the  system identify and maintain focus on strategic priorities. Board  leadership can also help implementation of strategic actions proceed more  effectively by providing support from an agency\u2019s highest level.  Furthermore, boards can help an agency identify and assess external  opportunities and challenges as part of their responsibility for relating an  organization to its external environment. Several other major transit  agencies we studied use board-driven strategic planning processes to  establish the direction of the agency. For example, the strategic goals and  plan for San Francisco\u2019s BART are formally adopted by the agency\u2019s board  and serve as the guiding document for the agency\u2019s budget process.", "WMATA\u2019s strategic framework was not developed with board input and  did not include a process to identify priorities and direction from the  board. For example, several WMATA board members told us that the  board has not been involved in strategic planning. Some board members  also were not aware of the agency\u2019s strategic planning efforts, as several  members told us they were not clear on the nature of WMATA\u2019s strategic  planning process or if the agency had a strategic plan at all. As discussed  earlier, the board\u2019s documented roles and responsibilities also do not  delineate a role for the board in strategic planning. Board members  expressed an interest in being more involved in strategic planning and  setting the direction of the agency. WMATA\u2019s Governance Committee has  also cited strategic planning as an upcoming task for the board. A senior  WMATA official also told us the board is in the process of reviewing and  approving the GM/CEO\u2019s 2011 execution plan. However, without prior  board involvement, WMATA\u2019s strategic planning process may not  appropriately reflect the views of parties potentially affected by or  interested in the agency\u2019s activities.", "WMATA has also not fully communicated its strategic planning process to  some of its internal stakeholders. Strategic planning processes can be  important tools for communicating an organization\u2019s intentions internally  and ensuring the entire organization is moving in the same direction,  according to strategic planning practices we identified. Further, a strategic  planning process that affects an entire organization should involve an  organization\u2019s key decision makers. WMATA\u2019s strategic plans have not  been communicated to all key decision makers. For example, a senior  WMATA official noted that the agency\u2019s strategic planning efforts did not  account for workforce attrition and he was unaware of the internal  execution plan for WMATA\u2019s Human Resources department, which  includes actions to identify retirement forecasts for employees. Without  good communication, WMATA cannot ensure its strategic planning  process fully articulates the agency\u2019s mission, goals, and objectives to its  internal stakeholders.", "A lack of transparency also exists among some external stakeholders,  such as the jurisdictions and the general public, in terms of understanding  the agency\u2019s strategic actions, priorities, and vision. According to strategic  planning practices we identified, stakeholder analysis and involvement are  important aspects of an effective strategic planning process. A  stakeholder analysis can help an organization identify and incorporate the  various criteria their external stakeholders use to judge the organization  and how the organization is performing against those criteria. A senior  WMATA official told us that JCC, which consists of representatives from  the three local jurisdictions, was consulted on the agency\u2019s strategic goals,  performance measures, and reporting, but some officials from the  jurisdictions told us they were not aware of the agency\u2019s strategic planning  efforts and did not believe the agency engaged in any strategic planning.  Such awareness may be hindered because, of the three components of  WMATA\u2019s strategic planning process, only the one-page strategic  framework is publicly available. More publicly available information on  WMATA\u2019s strategic planning process could improve awareness of the  agency\u2019s efforts and challenges among external stakeholders. In  commenting on a draft of this report, WMATA noted that in June 2011 it  launched a new strategic planning initiative that will include input from  external stakeholders.", "Senior officials at several transit agencies told us or have stated publicly  that stakeholder involvement and awareness of their strategic planning  efforts have created greater external understanding and support for the  agency and helped regional stakeholders understand their decisions and  needs. For example, officials with New York\u2019s MTA told us that regional  stakeholder awareness of the agency\u2019s strategic planning efforts and  future needs have increased stakeholder buy-in for the agency\u2019s planning.  Research on transit agency strategic planning has also shown that  stakeholder awareness of strategic planning can help define the agency\u2019s  core role and responsibilities to the community. Additionally, if an  organization does not understand and effectively meet its stakeholders\u2019  performance criteria, then the agency may not satisfy its stakeholders and  could receive less support from them.", "Internal and external environmental factors that could affect goals are  not clearly assessed. WMATA\u2019s strategic planning and performance  management system does not clearly state key internal and external risk  factors that could significantly affect the achievement of its goals and  objectives. We have previously reported that for strategic planning to be  done well, organizations must assess their internal and external  environments. An agency should study its internal environment to  identify strengths and weaknesses of the organization. Organizations  should also identify external opportunities and challenges, as many  external forces that fall beyond an organization\u2019s influence can affect its  chances for success. Some of the external factors that may be identified in  these assessments could be economic, demographic, social, or  environmental and may be stable, predictable, or variable. Other transit  agencies we studied take into account factors that may affect the  achievement of their goals. For example, the strategic plan for SEPTA in  Philadelphia includes an analysis of the internal and external factors, such  as a potential loss of dedicated funding and unfunded mandates for the  agency, that could impact the agency\u2019s strategic objectives. SEPTA\u2019s plan  states that this assessment helps the agency identify the strengths,  weaknesses, opportunities, and threats to the agency from its  environment.", "While WMATA has taken into account threats to its capital program by  assessing the potential risks for the delivery of its capital projects, it has  not conducted an external environment assessment for the rest of its  strategic planning and performance management system, though a  WMATA official told us the agency has plans to do so in the future.", "Without such assessments, WMATA may not be able to respond effectively  to changes in its environment.", "Time frame and updating of strategic plan are unclear. WMATA\u2019s  strategic planning efforts do not clearly establish a long-term, multiyear  outlook and do not include a schedule for updating or revising the  agency\u2019s strategic goals, objectives, and strategies. While strategic  planning practices we identified vary on prescribing a specific time frame  necessary for strategic plans, the ones that did identify a time frame state  that strategic planning efforts should look at least 4-6 years into the future.  Several other transit agencies, such as BART and MTA, have multiyear  plans and regularly update their strategic plans. For example, MTA  officials told us they plan 4 and 5 years into the future and annually review  the agency\u2019s priorities. MTA officials said this process helps the agency\u2019s  board focus on long-term issues and avoid short-sighted decisions. In  commenting on a draft of this report, WMATA noted that its new strategic  planning process will develop a multiyear vision and multiyear business  and operational plans.", "WMATA uses a 10-year plan for its capital program linked to the agency\u2019s  strategic goals and objectives. But it is not clear from our review of the  strategic framework or departmental execution plans if WMATA planned  several years into the future for all of its major operations and  departments. For example, WMATA does not include any multiyear goals  or actions in its departmental execution plans that extend beyond fiscal  year 2012. In addition, WMATA officials told us that, as a result of  insufficient long-term planning, priorities such as new technology, staff,  and capital needs are approved\u2014and sometimes underfunded\u2014during the  annual budget process rather than planned for strategically. In terms of  regular updating, senior WMATA officials told us that the GM/CEO\u2019s  execution plan will include performance metrics and targets the board will  annually review. The agency\u2019s strategic framework and departmental  execution plans do not include procedures for regular review and update.  Ensuring a multiyear time frame and regular updating of the agency\u2019s  strategic planning system can encourage the board and staff to have a  more long-range view in decision making and priority setting.", "Long-term planning and regular updating could help WMATA address  some problems with the transit system. According to senior WMATA  officials, board members, and other stakeholders, WMATA has historically  concentrated on system expansion and has not sufficiently focused on the  long-term maintenance of the system. The agency has well-documented  maintenance issues, such as problems with the system\u2019s escalators  breaking down frequently. Additionally, WMATA\u2019s GM/CEO has stated  publicly that the agency lacks a long-term, systematic plan for its track  rebuilding program and is unable to plan major track maintenance for  more than 6 months in advance. One WMATA official told us that certain  maintenance projects and technological upgrades undergo an inefficient  and lengthy process from conception to implementation.", "Program evaluations are not systematic. While WMATA does perform  some evaluations that assess the effectiveness of its programs, these  evaluations are not conducted on a regular basis or uniformly across the  agency and the agency\u2019s strategic planning documents do not describe or  identify any program evaluations used for establishing or revising the  agency\u2019s goals and objectives. We have previously reported that program  evaluations can be a potentially critical source of information in assessing  the appropriateness and reasonableness of goals, the effectiveness of  strategies, and the implementation of programs. A systematic evaluation  of how a program was implemented can also provide important  information about the success or failure of a program and suggest ways to  improve it. A senior WMATA official told us that the agency conducts  performance spotlights on areas with negative performance indicators, as  a way of evaluating and identifying the causes and possible solutions to an  indicator\u2019s performance. However, the agency\u2019s strategic planning  documents and comments from a senior official do not describe or identify  any program evaluations used for establishing or revising the agency\u2019s  goals and objectives or for evaluating the progress towards achieving  those goals.", "Some performance metrics are outdated and were not developed with  board involvement. WMATA has made significant progress in performance  management, but some weaknesses remain. Strategic planning practices  we identified state that strategic planning processes should be linked to  performance measurement and include metrics for gauging progress  toward the attainment of each of the plan\u2019s long-term goals. This is  necessary for monitoring whether goals are being achieved and if changes  are necessary. To its credit, WMATA created an Office of Performance in  2010 to develop a performance management framework for the agency\u2019s  operations through enhanced performance measurement and reporting.  The office has created a \u201cvital signs\u201d report, which is a scorecard of 12 key  performance indicators for WMATA. The board also receives regular  reports from the office on the agency\u2019s performance. Additionally, the  office has worked to establish consistency throughout the agency by  standardizing the tracking of information for performance measurement.  Further, WMATA\u2019s performance metrics and targets are linked to the  agency\u2019s strategic goals and objectives.", "Although WMATA board members and officials indicated that the office is  a good start to improving the performance management of the agency,  some of WMATA\u2019s performance metrics and targets are out of date and the  board has not been fully involved in assessing the metrics and their  criteria. As part of its strategic planning efforts, WMATA has established  performance metrics and targets in its departmental execution plans for  measuring each key action for achieving the agency\u2019s goals and objectives.  Performance metrics and targets need to be updated to anticipate changes  in the agency\u2019s resources and operating environment. Senior WMATA  officials have acknowledged that some of the agency\u2019s performance  metrics and targets are based on data and information that is out of date.", "To address this issue, in May 2011, a senior WMATA official told us  management has proposed revised performance targets to the board\u2019s  Customer Service and Operations Committee. According to leading  strategic planning practices, as part of a board\u2019s role in overseeing the  agency and monitoring progress towards the achievement of strategic  goals, a board should review an agency\u2019s performance measures on a  regular basis. For example, BART\u2019s board works with management to  revisit goals and performance metrics on an annual basis. By comparison,  the WMATA board has not conducted a comprehensive assessment of the  criteria used for setting the agency\u2019s performance measures. A senior  WMATA official has told us that the agency\u2019s performance targets will be  reevaluated by the board on an annual basis or if operating conditions  change.
