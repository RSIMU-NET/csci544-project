The benefits have been enormous.  Vast amounts of information  are now literally at our fingertips, facilitating research and government  services. Financial and other business transactions can be executed almost  instantaneously, and electronic mail, Internet Web sites, and computer  bulletin boards allow us to communicate quickly and easily with virtually  an unlimited number of other individuals and groups.  However, this  widespread interconnectivity also poses enormous risks to our computer  systems and, more importantly, to the critical operations and  infrastructures they support, such as telecommunications, power  distribution, national defense, and critical government services.", "To reduce these risks, in 1998, the President issued Presidential Decision  Directive 63 (PDD 63), which describes a strategy for cooperative efforts  by government and the private sector to protect critical, computer- dependent operations.  A key element of this strategy is the establishment  of the National Infrastructure Protection Center (NIPC) as \u201ca national focal  point\u201d for gathering information on threats and providing the principal  means of facilitating the federal government\u2019s response to computer-based  incidents.", "To determine how effectively the NIPC is addressing current and future  cyber threats to our national security, the Subcommittee on Technology,  Terrorism, and Government Information, Senate Committee on the  Judiciary, asked that we examine the NIPC\u2019s progress in developing  national capabilities for analyzing data about, issuing warnings on, and  responding to computer-based attacks.

Attacks can come from anywhere in  the world, over the Internet, other networks, and dial-up lines.  By  launching attacks across a span of communications systems and  computers, attackers can effectively disguise their identity, location, and  intent, thereby making them difficult and time-consuming to trace.", "Such attacks could severely disrupt computer-supported operations, compromise the confidentiality of sensitive information, and diminish the integrity of critical data. A significant concern is that terrorists or hostile foreign states could launch computer-based attacks on critical systems to severely damage or disrupt national defense or other critical operations or steal sensitive data, resulting in harm to the public welfare. According to the National Security Agency, foreign governments already have or are developing computer attack capabilities, and potential adversaries are developing a body of knowledge about U.S. systems and about methods to attack these systems. Figure 1 provides an overview of the various types of risks.", "While cyber-based attacks have not yet caused devastating disruptions, the  number of attacks is increasing.  Complete summary data are not available  because many incidents are not reported.  However, the number of  reported incidents handled by Carnegie-Mellon University\u2019s CERT  Coordination Center has increased from about 1,300 in 1993 to about 9,800  in 1999 and to over 21,000 in 2000.  Similarly, the Federal Bureau of  Investigation (FBI) reports that its caseload of computer intrusion-related  investigations more than doubled from 1998 to 2000.  This greater number  of attacks increases the risk of incidents with devastating consequences.", "According to the FBI, the following threats have been observed: Criminal groups. There is an increased use of cyber intrusions by criminal  groups who attack systems for purposes of monetary gain.", "Foreign intelligence services. Foreign intelligence services use cyber tools  as part of their information gathering and espionage activities.", "Hackers. Hackers sometimes crack into networks for the thrill of the  challenge or for bragging rights in the hacker community.  While remote  cracking once required a fair amount of skill or computer knowledge,  hackers can now download attack scripts and protocols from the Internet  and launch them against victim sites.  Thus, while attack tools have become  more sophisticated, they have also become easier to use.", "Hacktivists.   Hacktivism refers to politically motivated attacks on publicly  accessible Web pages or e-mail servers.  These groups and individuals  overload e-mail servers and hack into Web sites to send a political message.", "Information warfare.

The working group identified  critical infrastructures, characterized threats to them, and  recommended creating a commission to investigate such issues.", "In February 1996, the National Defense Authorization Act required the  executive branch to provide a report to the Congress on the policies and  plans for developing capabilities, such as warnings of strategic attacks  against the national information infrastructure.  Later that year, the  Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Senate Committee on  Governmental Affairs, began to hold hearings on security in cyberspace.   Since then, congressional interest in protecting national infrastructures  has remained strong.", "In July 1996, the President\u2019s Commission on Critical Infrastructure  Protection was established to investigate the nation\u2019s vulnerability to  both cyber and physical threats.", "Since 1997\u2014most recently in January 2001\u2014we have designated  information security as a governmentwide high-risk area, in reports to  the Congress.", "In October 1997, the President\u2019s Commission issued its report, which  described the potentially devastating implications of poor information  security from a national perspective.

The directive called  for a range of activities to improve federal agency security programs,  establish a partnership between the government and private sector, and  improve the nation\u2019s ability to detect and respond to serious attacks.  The  directive established critical infrastructure protection as a national goal,  stating that, by the close of 2000, the United States was to have achieved an  initial operating capability and, no later than 2003, the capability to protect  the nation\u2019s critical infrastructures from intentional destructive acts.", "To accomplish its goals, PDD-63 designated the National Coordinator for  Security, Infrastructure Protection, and Counter-Terrorism, who reports to  the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, to oversee  national policy development and implementation.  The directive also  established the National Plan Coordination staff, which became the Critical  Infrastructure Assurance Office, an interagency office that is housed in the  Department of Commerce and is responsible for planning infrastructure  protection efforts.  In addition, the directive designated \u201clead agencies\u201d to  work with private-sector and government entities in each of eight  infrastructure sectors and five special function areas.  For example, the  Department of the Treasury is responsible for working with the banking  and finance sector, and the Department of Energy is responsible for  working with the electric power industry.  Similarly, regarding special  function areas, the Department of Defense (DOD) is responsible for  national defense, and the Department of State is responsible for foreign  affairs.  To facilitate private-sector participation, PDD 63 encouraged  creation of Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISAC) that could  serve as mechanisms for gathering, analyzing, and appropriately sanitizing  and disseminating information to and from infrastructure sectors and the  NIPC.

According to the Attorney General, the  NIPC was to become the government\u2019s lead mechanism for responding to  infrastructure attacks.", "In May 1998, PDD 63 authorized the FBI to expand the NIPC and directed  the NIPC to gather information on threats and coordinate the federal  government\u2019s response to incidents affecting infrastructures.  According to  the NIPC legal counsel, the NIPC was placed in the FBI because of the  bureau\u2019s broad legal authority to collect, retain, and share information  about potential cyber threats to the nation\u2019s critical infrastructures.  In  addition, the NIPC benefited from the FBI\u2019s jurisdictional authority and  investigative capability, including conducting and coordinating criminal  and foreign counterintelligence investigations within the United States.   The directive further assigned the NIPC, operating under these authorities,  specific responsibilities for  issuing timely warnings on threats and attacks;  providing comprehensive analyses on threats, vulnerabilities, and   facilitating and coordinating the government\u2019s response to cyber   providing law enforcement investigation and response;  mitigating cyber attacks;  monitoring reconstitution efforts; and   promoting outreach and information sharing.", "The following documents provide additional detail on the NIPC\u2019s mission  and operational requirements:   The FBI\u2019s National Infrastructure Protection and Computer Intrusion  Program Plan, issued in April 1999 and updated in October 2000,  outlines specific goals and strategies aimed primarily at developing a  national investigative and response capability, especially as they relate  to FBI field office activities.", "The unclassified version of the Attorney General\u2019s Five-Year Interagency  Counterterrorism and Technology Crime Plan, issued in September  1999, stresses the need for the NIPC to interact with other federal  counterterrorism and law enforcement efforts and provides specific  details on NIPC programs, objectives, and requirements, such as  analysis and warning operations, crisis management responsibilities, the  Key Asset Initiative, and the InfraGard Program.", "The President\u2019s National Plan for Information Systems Protection,  issued in January 2000, reiterates much of what was contained in the  FBI\u2019s April 1999 program plan and the Attorney General\u2019s plan.   However, it contained a broader description of governmentwide efforts  and described how other federal entities might interact with the NIPC.", "PDD 63 covered both physical and computer-based threats.  However, the  NIPC\u2019s efforts have pertained almost exclusively to computer-based  threats, since this was an area that the leaders of the administration\u2019s  critical infrastructure protection strategy viewed as needing attention.  For  example, the FBI 1998 Strategic Plan identified the protection of the  national information infrastructure as one of the Bureau\u2019s highest  priorities.  The President\u2019s issuance of the National Plan further illustrated  the administration\u2019s interest in this area.  In addition, other components of  the FBI had a lead role in addressing physical threats.  Specifically, the  Attorney General\u2019s 1999 plan noted that in the event of physical attacks on  key infrastructures, the investigative response would be handled by FBI  criminal investigative or counterterrorism components.  In such cases, the  NIPC would serve in a supporting role, providing relevant information  about the victim infrastructure and other focused analytical or intelligence  products.", "Currently, the NIPC is located in the FBI\u2019s Counterterrorism Division,  which is 1 of 11 FBI headquarters divisions headed by assistant directors  who report to the FBI Director.

The fourth field office, in  Pittsburgh, had a NIPC team and the only interagency task force for  investigating computer intrusions.  During these visits, we observed  operations related to investigating and responding to computer-based  incidents and met with FBI agents involved in these activities.", "To determine the NIPC\u2019s progress in outreach and information sharing with  government and private-sector entities, we interviewed officials from the  NIPC\u2019s Training, Outreach, and Strategy Section and from the three  Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISAC) that had been established  at the time of our review.  (A fourth ISAC for the information technology  industry, announced in January 2001, was not covered by our review.)   These centers pertained to the financial services industry, the  telecommunications industry, and the electric power industry.  In addition,  we observed a meeting sponsored by the FBI\u2019s Washington, D.C., field  office to promote participation in the NIPC\u2019s InfraGard information-sharing  program, and a training session on collaborative efforts by the North  American Electric Reliability Council and the NIPC.

Analysis and warning capabilities are needed to improve the  government\u2019s ability to recognize changes in threat conditions, detect  impending attacks, or effectively warn government and industry of such  attacks in time to prevent serious damage.", "Since it was established in 1998, the NIPC has issued a variety of analytical  products.  Most of these products have been based on the work of others,  with some original NIPC analysis.  The majority of the NIPC\u2019s original  analysis has been tactical analysis performed in support of investigations of  individual incidents.  Progress in developing strategic analysis to assess the  broader, long-term implications of such threats has been impeded because  there is no generally accepted methodology for threat analysis, adequate  staff and expertise have not been supplied, and data on infrastructure  vulnerabilities have not been provided by industry sectors.  Overcoming  these obstacles will require significant interagency efforts and resources.", "The NIPC has developed rudimentary capabilities for issuing warnings.   From February 1998 through December 2000, it issued 81 alerts, advisories,  and assessments.  However, most of these warnings pertained to attacks  already underway and, therefore, may have been too late for recipients to  take mitigating action.  The NIPC\u2019s efforts to develop a more robust  warning capability have been impeded by a lack of staff expertise and  because a governmentwide or nationwide framework for promptly  collecting and analyzing incident information has not been established.  In  addition, issuance of timely warnings has been hindered by the need to  protect sensitive information and verify the accuracy and significance of  reported incidents before issuing related warnings.", "Further, two fundamental problems make it difficult to measure the NIPC\u2019s  progress and determine its needs for developing more substantive analysis  and warning capabilities.  First, the NIPC\u2019s roles and responsibilities have  not been fully defined and are not consistently interpreted by other federal  agencies responsible for critical infrastructure protection, and these  entities have not provided the NIPC the support envisioned by PDD 63.   Second, the NIPC has not developed a comprehensive and integrated,  multiyear plan of action to prioritize and guide its analysis and warning  efforts and to identify needed resources.", "NIPC officials are aware of these problems and have taken some steps to  address them.

Tactical support involves providing current  information on specific factors associated with incidents under  investigation or specific identified vulnerabilities.  Examples of tactical  support include analysis of (1) a computer virus delivery mechanism to  issue immediate guidance on ways to prevent or mitigate damage related to  an imminent threat or (2) a specific computer intrusion or set of intrusions  to determine the perpetrator, motive, and method of attack.", "In contrast, strategic analysis looks beyond one specific incident to  consider a broader set of incidents or implications that may indicate a  potential threat of national importance.

Twelve of these situation reports were associated with  investigations of denial-of-service attacks that affected numerous Internet  entities, including E-Bay and Yahoo, in February 2000.  In addition to  efforts resulting in written products, the AISU has assisted in investigations  of other incidents that were quickly resolved and did not result in formal  reports.  For example, in July 2000, AISU analysts spent several days  supporting efforts to monitor an incident associated with a classified  system that did not evolve into a significant incident and, therefore, did not  result in a written report.", "In addition, since 1998, the AISU has provided analytical support related to  a counterintelligence investigation, which involves a complicated series of  computer intrusions into federal agencies, universities, and private-sector  systems.  As of December 2000, this effort had resulted in 12 analytical  documents, which, unlike most of the AISU\u2019s other efforts, included both  tactical and strategic analyses.  NIPC officials say that these analyses have  provided valuable experience that the AISU is using to develop improved  methods for identifying perpetrators and understanding their actions.  For  example, the NIPC initiated Project La Resistance, which is a strategic  effort to analyze information gathered from disparate sources, including  law enforcement and intelligence agencies, private industry, and other  open sources, to identify linkages and commonalties among incidents and  perpetrators.", "The AISU has also issued a variety of publications, most of which were  compilations of information previously reported by others with some NIPC  analysis.

CyberNotes is  presented in a summary table format that includes pertinent information on  each vulnerability, such as vendor and operating system, software name,  potential impact, remedies, and an indication of whether any attacks have  actually exploited the vulnerability or attack technique.  The NIPC also  produces and broadly distributes the Daily Watch, a listing of daily  developments affecting infrastructures, which is compiled from a range of  sources.

As a  result, information on individual incidents or groups of incidents has not  been fully taken advantage of to assist in identifying broader, longer-term  risks. For example, in October 1999, the NIPC issued an advisory on a  Trojan-horse program dubbed  \u201cRingZero,\u201d describing it as an \u201caggressive  reconnaissance technique\u201d used to obtain detailed information on systems  that could be used to facilitate future attacks. The NIPC advisory was  based on analyses obtained from the Systems Administration, Networking,  and Security (SANS) Institute, which is a cooperative research and  education organization, and the Naval Surface Warfare Center.  These  analyses highlighted the possible malicious uses of RingZero for  anonymously performing large distributed attacks.  However, the NIPC  made no attempt to determine the potential strategic implications of  RingZero and more thoroughly understand the related risks to national  infrastructures.  Additional analysis was not performed because, according  to the Chief of the AISU, staff were diverted to other incidents of more  immediate concern.", "NIPC officials told us that the RingZero analysis was an example of how  their efforts to develop strategic analysis capabilities had been limited  because the AISU\u2019s analysts were fully engaged in supporting a growing  stream of new and ongoing investigations of computer-based incidents.   This point was corroborated in an October 2000 National Infrastructure  Protection and Computer Intrusion Program Plan, issued by the FBI\u2019s  Counterterrorism Division, which stated that, while over 1,000 computer  crime investigations were underway, the NIPC could only provide regular  analytical support to fewer than a dozen of the most important cases."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Impediments to Developing More Substantive Analytical Capabilities", "paragraphs": ["The experts we interviewed at the NIPC and other federal agencies agreed  that developing substantive capabilities for analyzing computer-based  threats is a formidable task, especially in the area of strategic analysis.

Although the FBI  has investigative capabilities, it acknowledges that it lacks staff who are  experienced in critical infrastructure operations and intelligence analysis.   The NIPC Director told us that the use of detailees was intended to be a  means of rapidly assembling an analytical capability from existing  expertise within the federal government and that, in his view, it was  important for the NIPC to draw on the expertise and diverse perspectives  of personnel from other agencies.  Accordingly, the chief of the Analysis  and Warning Section, which includes the AISU, and the AISU chief, at the  time of our review, were detailees from the intelligence community.", "NIPC officials also attribute the limited progress of the Analysis and  Warning Section and the AISU to sustained leadership vacancies.   According to NIPC records, the Chief of the Analysis and Warning Section  position, which was to be filled by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA),  was vacant for about half of the NIPC\u2019s 3-year existence.  Similarly, NIPC  records show that a National Security Agency detailee position was vacant  for approximately 17 months between May 1998 and April 2000.   As a  result, the NIPC could not fully benefit from the experience of these  intelligence community officials in developing the required capabilities.", "In addition, fewer detailees have been provided for other AISU positions  than were originally anticipated, and most positions have been filled with  FBI analysts.  Since its creation in 1998 through the end of fiscal year 2000,  the AISU has operated with an average of about 13 analysts. Ten of these  positions have been held by FBI analysts, and three positions have been  held, sometimes on an intermittent basis, by detailees from other federal  agencies or from international partners, such as Canada and the United  Kingdom.  An additional three detailee positions were designated by the  NIPC but were not staffed by the other involved federal agencies.   In  August 2000, the Analysis and Warning Chief estimated that the AISU  needed about 24 analysts to provide a foundation for building adequate  analytical capabilities.  This would allow the NIPC to devote about three  analysts to each of the eight industry sectors identified in PDD 63.", "Through interviews with NIPC officials and individuals from other federal  agencies who had been detailed to or otherwise associated with the NIPC,  we identified two factors that contributed to agencies\u2019 not providing the  number of experienced detailees originally anticipated.  First, federal  employees with experience in computer security and information  technology management are in short supply, and agencies need those  available to support their own operations.  As a result, agencies are  reluctant to provide such valued staff to the NIPC.  Second, of the 25  individuals we interviewed who had been detailed to the NIPC, 16  expressed negative comments about their work experience there.  In  particular, the detailees noted that FBI procedures prevented them from  being involved in decisionmaking and limited their access to information.   Some of the detailees felt that they were not provided the same level of  respect and support as were the FBI agents who were assigned to the  NIPC.  For example, one detailee assigned to the NIPC for almost 18  months during 1999 to 2000, observed that detailees had different badges,  could not access some computer systems, and could not sign procurement  orders.  However, by the summer of 2000, the situation had improved;  detailees were given badges similar to FBI personnel, increased access to  computer systems, and authority to sign some procurement forms.", "Although NIPC officials cited a need for more personnel, they also cited a  need for personnel with more experience and expertise in computers,  infrastructure operations, and intelligence analysis.  NIPC officials said that  most of the FBI employees assigned to the AISU have had limited expertise  in these areas and have lacked the skills necessary to perform the assigned  functions. The FBI\u2019s 1998\u20132003 Strategic Plan corroborated these  assertions, noting that FBI analysts often have had little or no training in  intelligence analysis and lack experience in the subject matter for which  they are responsible.  According to one NIPC manager, additional expertise  could be obtained by hiring analysts from outside of the FBI.  However,  NIPC officials say they have been precluded from doing so because the  NIPC must stay within the authorized FBI staffing levels.  NIPC officials  said that this shortage of expertise and skills has especially limited the  NIPC\u2019s ability to establish a viable strategic analysis capability, since this  requires sustained efforts over a period of time. FBI and NIPC officials are  aware of this problem and, in 1998 and 2000, the Attorney General and the  FBI director wrote to agency heads requesting detailees. Also, in November  2000, the FBI Director sent a letter to the Assistant to the President for  National Security Affairs stating that \u201cwithout additional support from  other federal agencies, our ability to effectively detect, warn of, and  respond to cyber attacks will not be adequate to address the ever growing  threat.\u201d   In addition, NIPC officials told us they were developing a plan and  budget justification that detailed the need for an increase in NIPC staff."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Inadequate Data on Infrastructure Vulnerabilities", "paragraphs": ["The AISU\u2019s strategic analysis capabilities depend to a large extent on the  availability of technical infrastructure assessments that provide industry- specific data on factors such as critical system components, known  vulnerabilities, and interdependencies.

For example, the Department of Transportation  was directed to work with the transportation industry, and Commerce was  to work with the telecommunications sector to develop their respective  sector technical assessments.", "According to the National Plan, the NIPC was to use these assessments in  combination with foreign intelligence information, information from law  enforcement investigations and operations, and voluntary private-sector  reports, to develop comprehensive strategic assessments of risk.   According to the Attorney General\u2019s plan, such comprehensive  assessments are important because they are to form the basis for  identifying indicators of potentially malicious or damaging activity and  developing related intelligence collection requirements.  In addition, these  assessments provide input for a variety of NIPC products, including alerts  and advisories.", "Most of the industry assessments have not, however, been performed, and  none have been provided to the NIPC.  NIPC officials told us that  assessments had been at least partially performed for the electric power,  transportation, and water sectors.  However, they had received no detailed  written assessments and, as a result, could not benefit from their findings.   In addition, in 2000, NIPC initiated assessments of telecommunications and  electric power.

While some  warnings have been issued in time to avert damage, most of the warnings,  especially those related to viruses, have pertained to attacks that were  already underway.", "Several factors, some of which are beyond the NIPC\u2019s control, have  hindered the NIPC\u2019s ability to provide advance warnings.  Specifically, no  comprehensive governmentwide or nationwide data-collection and  analysis framework has been established to provide the NIPC with  information on unusual or suspicious computer-based activity before the  occurrence of actual incidents.

Other alerts  were targeted to specific industries or individual organizations that the  NIPC deemed to be at special risk.", "The NIPC categorizes its warnings as follows.  The most serious is an  \"alert,\" which provides information on a major threat or on imminent or in- progress attacks targeting specific national networks or critical  infrastructures.  The second most serious type of warning is an \"advisory,\"  which provides information on significant threats or incidents and suggests  that organizations strengthen their readiness posture.  The third and least  serious type of warning is an \"assessment,\" which provides broad, general  incident or issue awareness information that is both significant and current  but does not necessarily suggest immediate action.  Before March 2000, the  NIPC issued notifications referred to as \u201cwarnings,\u201d which were similar to  what it now refers to as alerts.  The NIPC deleted this category and added  the assessment category so that its warning system would more closely be  aligned with the FBI\u2019s system for warnings about terrorist acts.  In some  cases, multiple warnings are issued that pertain to only one type of attack  or incident.  For example, in May, June, and August 2000, the NIPC issued  nine alerts on the ILOVEYOU virus and related variations.  The number and  type of warnings issued by the NIPC in 1998 (February - December), 1999,  and 2000 are summarized in table 1.", "Most of the NIPC\u2019s warnings illustrated in table 1 pertained to attacks  underway; few preceded an imminent attack.  One senior NIPC official  noted that the NIPC currently lacks the information and the necessary  understanding to identify discrete indicators that might be precursors to a  computer-based attack.  As a result, most of its warnings are based on  reports of attacks in progress.  However, in late 1999 and 2000, there were  several instances when the NIPC was able to provide warnings before an  attack was actually launched.  These included the following examples:  In April 2000, the NIPC obtained information from a law enforcement  investigation that 478 serious (root-level) compromises had been  perpetrated globally in an effort to create a distributed denial-of-service  attack.  The NIPC coordinated efforts to warn victims, individually, by  working with 11 FBI legal attach\u00e9s located abroad and through the FBI  field offices in the United States.  According to the NIPC, many victims  had been unaware of their systems\u2019 compromise before the warning.", "In December 1999, multiple reports of the presence of distributed  denial-of-service tools on computer systems in the United States  prompted the NIPC to issue an alert, its most urgent warning.   According to the NIPC, these tools were capable of generating sufficient  network traffic to congest targeted networks or systems, thus rendering  them inoperable.  The NIPC supplemented its alert with a software  program that system administrators could use to detect the presence of  denial-of-service attack tools on their systems.", "While the NIPC has issued warnings directly to hundreds of individuals and  entities, and made many of its alerts, advisories, and assessments publicly  available through its Web site, it does not have any reliable information on  the effectiveness of these warnings.  For example, NIPC does not develop  statistics on the number of visitors to its Web site or routinely solicit  feedback on the effectiveness of its warnings from industry or the public.   NIPC officials told us that they informally solicit feedback and had received  a great deal of unsolicited feedback on NIPC products.

According to the 1996 Report of the Defense Science Board Task Force on  Information Warfare Defense, it took the United States over four decades  to identify the indicators for nuclear and conventional attacks and optimize  the collection and reporting systems to perform analysis needed for watch  and warning.  Defense officials told us that developing reliable indications  of impending computer-based attacks would be even more difficult  because attacks can be launched by small, loosely aligned groups.  Such  planned attacks are difficult to identify because the perpetrators do not  always have the bureaucratic organization or command and control  structure that allows their doctrine, organization, and capability to be  observed in advance of an attack.  In addition, the ability of such groups to  quickly develop networks and maintain anonymity makes it very difficult to  create the types of predictive methodologies that have evolved for  monitoring traditional, noncyber threats.", "Several federal efforts are planned or underway to develop warning  indicators and mechanisms for promptly communicating alert data.  For  example, the NIPC and the electric power industry have developed a  voluntary set of reporting requirements and thresholds for voluntary  information sharing and data analysis.

For example,  officials assert that approximately 20 to 30 new computer viruses are  disseminated daily, with over 50,000 known viruses being in existence.   From their experience, NIPC officials determined that most of these  viruses did not warrant a public warning because they were not very  damaging, did not propagate easily, or were readily detected by existing  antivirus software.", "Issuing too many warnings on incidents that ultimately do little or no harm  would diminish the NIPC\u2019s credibility, and computer users might begin to  ignore important warnings.

The  procedures defined by the NIPC in August 2000 state that analyzing a  potential threat, determining the need for a warning, and disseminating the  warning can take several hours and involve a wide range of contacts with  NIPC personnel and outside entities, including computer incident response  centers and software manufacturers.", "The NIPC\u2019s ability to perform such analyses in a timely manner is closely  linked to the extent of technical and analytical expertise that it has  available on a 24-hour basis.

Before  disseminating national security or intelligence information, the NIPC  works with the originating agency to delete sensitive information, which is  a process often referred to as sanitizing the information.  For example, to  release information from a classified source, such as an intelligence report,  the NIPC obtains permission from the analyst who wrote the report.  Then,  according to NIPC officials, they must submit a draft of the sanitized  version to the originating intelligence analyst for review and release.  This  process can involve several exchanges of drafts, thereby slowing the  warning process.", "Sanitizing law enforcement information can also cause delay.  According to  NIPC officials, while there is a common understanding about procedures  for handling classified information and the punishments for mishandling it,  there is no legal framework detailing how law enforcement sensitive  information is to be handled.  As a result, many in the law enforcement  community are hesitant to share information with officials in the defense  and intelligence communities or with the private sector.

This lack of cooperation impedes efforts to identify key assets that  merit special protective efforts and identify and address vulnerabilities,  and it increases the risk that a broad computer-based attack would not be  detected or mitigated until significant damage had occurred.

The Director noted that each component in  infrastructure protection operates under internal and external constraints  on information sharing, which are based on important considerations in  each component\u2019s mission.  In this regard, he stated that Justice and the  NIPC have worked, and will continue to work, to develop effective  protocols for information sharing within the bounds of each component\u2019s  legal and policy structures and provide a level of certainty that shared  information will be appropriately protected.  He asserted that, through  such protocols, information necessary for protecting infrastructures can be  effectively shared on a timely basis.  He further cited several reasons why  some private-sector organizations have been reluctant to share information  with the government, including the NIPC.  The reasons cited include (1) a  lack of understanding or confidence in the exceptions found in the  Freedom of Information Act, (2) concerns about whether Justice would  pursue prosecutions at the expense of private-sector business interests,  and (3) concerns about disclosing proprietary information to an entity  beyond their control. The Director said that, to address these concerns, the  NIPC has reached out to communities across the nation to build trust and  educate the public on the legal and security aspects of information sharing  and protection, citing the InfraGard Program and the NIPC\u2019s successful  information-sharing relationship with the electric power ISAC.  In addition,  he cited two specific instances in which NIPC advisories were coordinated  in advance with private-sector entities, including three ISACs, as evidence  of the growing cooperative arrangement between the NIPC and the private  sector.  The Director did not specifically address our recommendations to  the NIPC regarding the need to formalize relationships with other federal  entities or ensure that the Key Asset Initiative is integrated with other  similar federal activities.", "The NIPC\u2019s comments reiterate many of the points made in our report  regarding the challenges associated with building productive information- sharing relationships between private and public-sector entities, and they  provide some additional specific detail.  We agree that the underlying  factors that inhibit information sharing are important, and our report cites  our July 2000 testimony, which provides a much more detailed discussion  of the related challenges.  We also agree that the NIPC has taken a number  of steps to address these concerns through the InfraGard Program and by  establishing cooperative relationships with the electric power ISAC and  others.  It is important that these efforts continue.  In addition, as our  report states, it is important that the NIPC strive for improved cooperative  relationships with other federal entities involved in critical infrastructure  protection.", "In commenting on a draft of this report, the Special Assistant to the  President and Senior Director for Legislative Affairs at the National  Security Council said that the administration will consider our  recommendations as it reviews federal cyber activities to determine how  the critical infrastructure protection function should be organized.
