The transition into greater reliance on managed care has left hospitals and physicians less willing to provide charity care for those who lack insurance. Children are particularly vulnerable to the lack of health insurance. Although a healthy group, they need preventive and acute care for their optimum development. If they do not get care when they need it, their health can be affected for the rest of their lives.", "As we have reported earlier, private health insurance coverage for children decreased between 1987 and 1993. Expanding children\u2019s coverage through the publicly funded Medicaid program helped to cushion the effect of this decrease. The Medicaid expansion increased health insurance coverage for poor children. However, it did not lead to an overall increase in the percentage of children covered because children above the poverty level lost private coverage but were less likely to be eligible for Medicaid. Since our earlier report, the Congress has considered restructuring the Medicaid program, including children\u2019s eligibility for coverage. It has also considered proposals that would change the private insurance marketplace. In addition, the shift toward managed care in the health care marketplace has continued, which reduces providers\u2019 willingness to care for uninsured patients.", "Concerned about these issues and their impact on children, you asked us to provide you with updated information for 1994 on whether health insurance coverage for children had increased and in particular how poor children were affected. You also asked us whether more children in working families were depending on Medicaid than had previously been reported, how many uninsured children might be eligible for Medicaid but not enrolled in 1994, and why families of uninsured but Medicaid-eligible children might not be seeking Medicaid coverage for their children.", "To answer these questions, we analyzed the Bureau of the Census\u2019 March 1995 Current Population Survey (CPS), which can be used to estimate health insurance coverage for children from birth through 17 years old in 1994. The methodology for the CPS questionnaire and data collection had been improved for the March 1995 CPS. In addition, the sample frame or sample selection process for families had been updated by using 1990 census information. While these changes provide better estimates of insurance coverage for 1994, in our opinion and that of Census Bureau officials, some estimates for 1994 are not comparable to prior years\u2019 estimates of insurance coverage primarily because of these methodological changes. In this report, we highlight comparisons of 1994 and earlier estimates that we think are most comparable. (See app. I.) Our work was conducted between January and May 1996 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Studies have shown that uninsured children are less likely than insured children to get needed health and preventive care. The lack of such care can adversely affect children\u2019s health status throughout their lives. Without health insurance, many families face difficulties getting preventive and basic care for their children. Children without health insurance or with gaps in coverage are less likely to have routine doctor visits or have a regular source of medical care. When they do seek care, they are more likely to get it through a clinic rather than a private physician or health maintenance organization (HMO). They are also less likely to get care for injuries, see a physician if chronically ill, or get dental care. They are less likely to be appropriately immunized to prevent childhood illness\u2014which is considered by health experts to be one of the most basic elements of preventive care.", "The Medicaid program is the major public funding source for children\u2019s health insurance. It is a jointly funded federal-state entitlement program that provides health coverage for both children and adults. It is administered through 56 separate programs, including the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. territories. States are required to cover some groups of children and adults and may extend coverage to others. Children and their parents must be covered if they receive benefits under the Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC) program. Children and adults may also be eligible for the program if they are disabled and have low incomes or, at state discretion, if their medical expenses are extremely high relative to family income.", "Beginning in 1986, the Congress passed a series of laws that expanded Medicaid eligibility for pregnant women on the basis of family income, and for children on the basis of family income and age. Before these eligibility expansions, most children received Medicaid because they were on AFDC. Before 1989, coverage expansions were optional for states, although many states had expanded coverage. Starting in July 1989, states had to cover pregnant women and infants with family incomes at or below 75 percent of the federal poverty level. Two subsequent federal laws further expanded mandated eligibility for pregnant women and children. By July 1991, states were required to cover (1) pregnant women, infants, and children up to 6 years old with family income at or below 133 percent of the federal poverty level and (2) children 6 years old and older born after September 30, 1983, with family income at or below 100 percent of the federal poverty level. Current law expands the group of poor children over 6 years old eligible for Medicaid year by year until all poor children up to 19 years old are eligible in the year 2002. In addition, states may expand Medicaid eligibility for infants and children beyond these requirements by either phasing in coverage of children up to 19 years old more quickly than required, by increasing eligibility income levels, or both. (See table II.2 for current eligibility levels in states.)", "These expansions partially fueled the increase in Medicaid costs in the 1990s, but children still represent less than one-fourth of Medicaid expenditures. In 1994, nondisabled children represented a large percentage of Medicaid recipients\u201449 percent\u2014compared with the percentage of Medicaid expenditures for medical care that they accounted for\u201416 percent. Nonetheless, Medicaid\u2019s overall cost and the rate of cost increases have raised concerns about the program\u2019s impact on the federal budget. Medicaid costs are projected to increase from about $156 billion in 1995 to $243 billion by the year 2000, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The Congress has recently considered different options to lower the cost of the program, including removing guaranteed eligibility for some types of current recipients and giving capped funding to the states as block grants."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Health Insurance Coverage for Children at Lowest Reported Level Since 1987", "paragraphs": ["In 1994, the percentage of children with private health insurance reached the lowest level reported in the last 8 years\u201465.6 percent or 46.3 million children.

First, low-income families may not know that their children could be eligible for Medicaid even if a parent works full-time or if the family has two parents. A study that interviewed current AFDC recipients and former recipients who had begun working found that 41 percent of AFDC recipients and 23 percent of former recipients did not understand that a parent could work full-time and receive AFDC for his or her children and an even larger percentage did not understand that children in two-parent families could be eligible for Medicaid.", "Families participating in other programs for low-income persons also have low rates of Medicaid enrollment. In 1992, only 48 percent of the women, infants, and children enrolled in the Special Supplemental Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) were enrolled in Medicaid, even though over 72 percent were in families with incomes below 130 percent of the federal poverty level. In 1993, only 68 percent of children in Head Start, an early childhood education program for low-income children, were enrolled in Medicaid.", "Second, getting enrolled in Medicaid is difficult for low-income families. In a previous report, we found that many Medicaid applicants never complete the eligibility determination process and about one-half are denied for procedural reasons; that is, applicants did not or could not provide the basic documentation needed to verify their eligibility or did not appear for eligibility interviews. Finally, some families may not seek Medicaid until they face a medical crisis or may not want to enroll in Medicaid because they consider it a welfare program and therefore stigmatizing.", "States can obtain federal matching funds to conduct outreach programs about the Medicaid program. States determine their own outreach programs\u2014both the amount and the focus. According to one Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) official, Medicaid outreach to children\u2019s families has focused more on encouraging the use of preventive care by enrolled children than on informing nonenrolled families that their children might be eligible. Some states do try to inform low-income families that they can get health insurance for their children through Medicaid\u2014either by using informational billboards, 800 telephone referral numbers, or other means. In addition, HCFA and the Agency for Children and Families have developed a cooperative agreement to work together and with states and localities to improve outreach to families of potentially eligible low-income children, particularly those enrolled in federally funded child care and Head Start programs.", "Fiscal pressures may have made some states less interested in expanding the number of children receiving Medicaid than they were several years ago. Even though children represent a relatively small percentage of Medicaid expenditures (about 16 percent of expenditures are for nondisabled children under 21 years old), growth in the number of children on Medicaid has contributed to program expenditure increases. Medicaid spending increases have become one of the largest budget problems for states\u2014representing 19.4 percent of state expenditures in 1994."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Private health insurance is overwhelmingly employment-based in the United States, but many children do not get this benefit even if their parents work. Health insurance is less likely to be offered in the firms that employ low-income workers. If health insurance is available through work but is costly for workers, it is less likely to be affordable for low-income workers.", "Part of the reason that families with children may have difficulty affording health insurance is that many children live in low-income families. Twenty-four percent of children lived in poor families in 1994, and another 21 percent lived in families with income between 101 and 200 percent of the federal poverty level. Moreover, families with employer-sponsored health insurance have faced sharply rising costs over the last decade to purchase family coverage through their employer. These rising costs may prove to be much more of a burden for lower-income families.", "Private health insurance coverage has continued to decrease for children. As private coverage has decreased, Medicaid has become a more important source of health insurance coverage, especially for children in working families. Nevertheless, despite the expansion in public insurance funding, 10 million children were uninsured in the United States in 1994. Even more notable, the largest percentage of uninsured children were in families with a working parent or parents. In addition, at least 30 percent of uninsured children were eligible for Medicaid, which means that many uninsured children are not getting the advantage of publicly funded insurance.", "As long as private coverage continues to decrease for children, the number of children uninsured or on Medicaid will continue to grow. This strains public resources\u2014either to pay for Medicaid coverage or to provide direct care or subsidies to hospitals to care for the uninsured. In the past, providers have had various sources of funds to recoup some of the cost of caring for the uninsured patient. In the era of managed care and cost-cutting, it is becoming more difficult for hospitals and physicians to care for patients without insurance. As these trends continue, it will likely become even more difficult to get care without insurance.", "Medicaid cost increases are pressuring states and the federal government toward different types of program changes. Changes to the Medicaid program that remove guaranteed eligibility or alter the financing and responsibilities of the federal and state governments may strongly affect health insurance coverage for children in the future.

The previous CPS questionnaire asked first whether a person had any private insurance, then if that person was the policyholder. Only after that did the questionnaire ask whether the insurance was obtained through an employer or union. The new questionnaire first asks directly whether a person has private insurance through an employer or union.

However, the number of people who report that their private insurance came from an employer or union has increased, while the number who report that their private insurance was individually purchased has decreased. Therefore, because these apparent differences may be due to the questionnaire change rather than actual changes in the composition of private insurance coverage, comparisons of employment-based or private individual coverage in 1994 to previous years may not be appropriate to understand trends in coverage. This is why we compared private coverage rather than employment-based coverage of children over time in this report.", "In addition, we are using a different definition of children on Medicaid for this report than our previous report and correspondences. For this report, our group of children on Medicaid are children with any Medicaid coverage, even if they also have employment-based coverage. Previously, we had excluded children with Medicaid coverage who also had employment-based insurance in the same year from the Medicaid group. We considered employment-based insurance their primary source of coverage and included them in that group. But defining insurance coverage this way led to a lower overall number and percentage of children with Medicaid coverage. Therefore, for this report, we are including children with both private and Medicaid coverage reported in both categories.

Even if the CPS underreported Medicaid enrollment, consistent estimates can be useful to follow overall insurance trends over time. However, the calendar year 1994 CPS estimates of Medicaid coverage for children are lower than the calendar year 1993 estimates. This is puzzling to some researchers who have used the CPS in the past because HCFA data on Medicaid program enrollment showed an increase in coverage between fiscal year 1993 and fiscal year 1994. The apparent drop may be partially due to a reported drop in the number of children enrolled in AFDC and it may also be due to the change in the CPS sampling frame.", "Between 1993 and 1994 the percentage of children who were reported to be receiving AFDC or other assistance dropped from 10.6 percent to 9.6 percent\u2014about 600,000 fewer children. Because children on AFDC are entitled to Medicaid coverage, Census assigns Medicaid coverage to AFDC children even if their parents do not report them as receiving Medicaid. This partially explains why Medicaid coverage may have appeared to decrease. Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 data also show a small drop in the average monthly enrollment of children in AFDC between calendar years 1993 and 1994, although because of the differences between months included in calendar years and fiscal years, the drop does not show up in fiscal year data until fiscal year 1995. In fiscal year 1995, average monthly enrollment of children continued to drop.", "Medicaid coverage also may have appeared to decrease because Census changed the sample frame\u2014or types of families that Census interviews\u2014from one based on the 1980 census to one based on the 1990 census. Because the March 1995 CPS was a transitional one for the sample frame, half the families were chosen based on the 1980 frame and half were chosen based on the 1990 frame. The percentage of children on Medicaid was lower in the half chosen from the 1990 frame (22.3 percent) than the half chosen from the 1980 frame (23.4 percent). While the sample chosen from the 1990 frame should be a more accurate report of Medicaid coverage, the differences between the two parts of the sample indicate that reported differences between 1993 and 1994 Medicaid coverage levels may be due in part to sampling frame changes rather than actual changes in coverage.", "Other types of health insurance coverage did not appear to be affected much by sampling frame differences.

Last year, Census officials discovered some children appeared to be miscoded as receiving Medicaid. Census officials attempted to fix this through editing the CPS data tape, but the edited 1993 data tape may still contain inadvertently included data that show some children in the group with Medicaid who should not be in that group.
