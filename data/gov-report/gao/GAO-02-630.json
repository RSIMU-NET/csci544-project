It now faces what it considers to be serious imbalances in the skills and experience of its remaining workforce and the potential loss of highly specialized knowledge if many of its acquisition specialists retire. In view of this concern, DOD created the Acquisition 2005 Task Force to study its civilian acquisition workforce and develop a strategy to replenish personnel losses. The Task Force made a series of recommendations to DOD in October 2000. On March 1, 2002, in response to the mandate in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002, DOD reported on its plans to implement these recommendations.The same mandate required us to assess, within 60 days of the date DOD submitted its report, the status of DOD\u2019s reported plans to reshape the workforce and to specifically examine the reported status of its efforts to implement the task force\u2019s recommendations. Because of the time frames involved, we did not evaluate the effectiveness of DOD\u2019s reported efforts.", "As required by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002, DOD\u2019s report summarizes its actions and plans to implement the task force\u2019s recommendations.

For example, DOD is working to remove barriers to its strategic planning initiative; continuing with an effort to test various human capital innovations; and has begun making significant changes to its acquisition workforce-training program. We did not assess the effectiveness of these initiatives, but they do target key Task Force concerns. Additionally, DOD recognizes the need as well as the substantial challenges involved in implementing a strategic approach to shaping the acquisition workforce. Consequently, DOD views implementation of these initiatives as long-term efforts with specific outcomes taking years to achieve.", "Regarding DOD\u2019s efforts to implement the Task Force\u2019s specific recommendations, DOD\u2019s report generally provides information about actions taken to implement them and their status.

The Department spends about $100 billion annually to research, develop, and acquire weapon systems and tens of billions of dollars more for services and information technology. Moreover, this investment is expected to grow substantially. At the same time, DOD, like other agencies, is facing growing public demands for better and more economical delivery of products and services. In addition, the ongoing technological revolution requires a workforce with new knowledge, skills, and abilities.", "Between 1989 and 1999, DOD downsized its civilian acquisition workforce by almost 50 percent to about 124,000 personnel as of September 30, 1999. These reductions resulted from many DOD actions including the implementation of acquisition reforms, base realignments and closures, and congressional direction. DOD estimates that as many as half of the remaining acquisition personnel could now be eligible to retire by 2005.", "DOD believed that these actual and projected reductions could be exacerbated by increased competition for technical talent due to a full- employment economy and a shrinking labor pool. As a result of the years of personnel reductions and the increasing competition for replacement talent, DOD concluded that its acquisition workforce was on the verge of a crisis\u2014a retirement-driven talent drain.", "In responding to this concern, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (USD/AT&L) created the Acquisition 2005 Taskforce in April 2000 to examine how the acquisition workforce could be reshaped. The Task Force consisted of representatives from the military services, defense agencies, and offices of the secretary of defense supported by contractor teams to help collect information and it sought input from the acquisition community as well as outside experts. The Task Force identified new initiatives as well as existing DOD programs that were considered innovative approaches to recruiting, developing, and retaining its future acquisition workforce. Specifically, the Task Force recommended 31 new initiatives, 8 ongoing initiatives that it believed should continue to be fully supported, and 7 innovative programs that it identified as best practices to be implemented throughout DOD\u2019s acquisition organizations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Challenges Involved in Reshaping a Workforce", "paragraphs": ["Reshaping a workforce is challenging for any agency. As we have previously reported, because mission requirements, client demands, technologies, and other environmental influences change rapidly, a performance-based agency must continually monitor its talent needs. It must be alert to the changing characteristics of the labor market. It must identify the best strategies for filling its talent needs through recruiting and hiring and follow up with the appropriate investments to develop and retain the best possible workforce. This includes continuously developing talent through education, training, and opportunities for growth. In addition, agencies must match the right people to the right jobs and, in the face of finite resources, be prepared to employ matrix management principles, maintaining the flexibility to redeploy their human capital and realigning structures and work processes to maximize economy, efficiency and effectiveness.", "A key to overcoming these challenges is to develop and sustain commitment to a strategic, results-oriented approach to human capital planning\u2014one that incorporates financial management, information technology management, and results-oriented goal-setting and performance measurement. Within high-performing organizations, this begins by establishing a clear set of organizational intents\u2014mission, vision, core values, goals and objectives and strategies\u2014and then integrating human capital strategies to support these strategic and programmatic goals. Taking a strategic approach to human capital planning can be challenging in itself. First, it requires a shift in how the human resource function is perceived, from strictly a support function to one integral to an agency\u2019s mission. Second, agencies may also find that they need some of the basic tools and information to develop strategic plans, such as accurate and complete information on workforce characteristics and strategic planning expertise."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD Is Making Progress in Addressing Acquisition Workforce Size and Structure Concerns", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s report to the armed services committees shows progress in its efforts to revitalize the workforce.

Part of this long-term effort will involve making a cultural shift\u2014from viewing human capital as a support function to a mission function\u2014as well as developing better data on the work and models to project needs and potential shortfalls.", "DOD reports that it is establishing a workforce data management strategy to improve the collection and storage of personnel data. The intent is to identify new data requirements and information needs for strategic planning. DOD is also working to develop more sophisticated modeling tools. Such tools are intended to help DOD components to identify gaps between future workforce requirements and the expected workforce inventory\u2014a critical part of the process needed for addressing acquisition workforce size and structure issues such as recruiting, training, and career development. DOD also has taken steps to link its planning effort to its budget process. For example, DOD\u2019s report states that it is developing a new budget exhibit that will identify workforce requirements during the budget process and improve DOD\u2019s ability to fund those requirements. Such actions are intended to enable DOD to identify and obtain the necessary funding to implement programs needed to close the gaps.", "Though DOD is taking good steps toward developing a strategic plan, it may well find that additional effort is needed to provide planners with effective tools. For example, DOD reports that it has provided more planning guidance, such as the updated Defense Planning Guidance and Quadrennial Defense Review, to help planners identify future workforce requirements during its second strategic planning cycle.
