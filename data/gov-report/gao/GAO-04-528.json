Examples of these actions include identifying program goals, tailoring services to meet the needs of participants, and collecting data on program results. The actions can be taken during program design, service delivery, and program monitoring and evaluation. USDA programs providing nutrition education that we reviewed--the Food Stamps Program; the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC); the National School Lunch Program; the Child and Adult Care Food Program; and the Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program--generally incorporated the key program design actions likely to contribute to success. For example, the USDA programs identified nutrition education goals and target populations. However, the programs' administrative structures hinder coordination among the USDA nutrition education efforts. We found that the USDA programs incorporated the service delivery actions likely to contribute to successful nutrition education in different ways and to varying extents, but they faced similar challenges that affected their ability to fully incorporate these actions. The challenges included limited resources and systems for providing nutrition education and competing program requirements that took time or resources away from nutrition education. For example, WIC officials said they had limited time for nutrition education because of competing requirements, such as providing information on drug and alcohol counseling. USDA's nutrition education efforts did not fully incorporate the monitoring and evaluation actions that contribute to success, such as collecting data on the types of nutrition education provided and the outcomes of the efforts.

Furthermore, between 1999 and 2000, two out of every  three adults were obese or overweight. In addition to having negative  health outcomes, children with poor nutrition may have a harder time  concentrating and succeeding in school than other children. As a result,  the nation is focusing more attention on the importance of good nutrition.", "The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the lead agency for the  nation\u2019s nutrition education efforts, funds and administers a variety of  nutrition education efforts. One program, the Expanded Food and  Nutrition Education Program (EFNEP), is designed specifically to provide  nutrition education. In addition, four of USDA\u2019s largest nutrition  assistance programs, while designed primarily to ensure that eligible  individuals have access to low-cost or free food, also include nutrition  education components. These programs are the Food Stamp Program  (FSP); the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants,  and Children (WIC); the National School Lunch Program (NSLP); and the  Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP). Together, they reached one  in five Americans, from infants to the elderly, in 2002. Each of these  programs has its own administrative structure, resources, and guidelines  for providing nutrition education.In addition, two different USDA  agencies oversee the programs; the Cooperative State Research,  Education, and Extension Service (CSREES) oversees EFNEP, and the  Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) oversees the four nutrition assistance  programs. Only two of the programs have legislative requirements to  provide nutrition education\u2014EFNEP and WIC. Together, resources for  nutrition education in these programs totaled about $472 million in fiscal  year 2002. Depending on the program, nutrition education funds ranged  from nearly $10 million to almost $250 million in fiscal year 2002, and  programs spent between $0.20 and $103 per participant on nutrition  education in that same year, according to USDA officials.", "In view of the importance of good nutrition, you asked us to answer the  following questions: (1) What key actions can officials take to increase the  likelihood of success in nutrition education?

(See table 1.) USDA initiated the  program in fiscal year 1969 to help low-income families better understand  nutrition and manage their food resources. EFNEP is administered at the  state level by Cooperative Extension offices, which oversee the allocation  of federal EFNEP funds.

WIC is federally funded,  and most of the program\u2019s resources are allocated for providing  participants with paper vouchers in exchange for approved foods at  grocery stores, including milk, juice, and cereal. However, federal program  regulations require that each state expend at least one-sixth of its nutrition  services and administration grants on nutrition education.

While there is no legislative mandate for nutrition education, states  have the option to use administrative funds to provide nutrition education  as a component of the FSP known as Food Stamp Nutrition Education  (FSNE). In order to provide nutrition education, the state agency  administering FSP is responsible for submitting a state nutrition education  plan for FSNE. However, state agencies that determine food stamp  eligibility generally do not have the professional staff and experience to  provide nutrition education. Therefore, the traditional providers of  nutrition education under FSNE have mostly been affiliated with the  Cooperative Extension Service, the same entity that administers EFNEP.  In addition, state Nutrition Networks, which include government,  nonprofit and business organizations, have cooperative agreements with  FNS to identify and respond to nutrition problems at the state level.", "The NSLP and CACFP programs provide nutritionally balanced meals at  low or no cost. (See table 4.) NSLP provides nutritionally balanced,  federally subsidized meals for all children in public and nonprofit schools  and residential child care institutions, with the size of the subsidy  dependent on the income level of participating households. Similarly,  CACFP provides nutritious meals and snacks to children in nonresidential  child care and chronically impaired adults or adults age 60 or older in  nonresidential day care facilities. FNS administers both programs at the  federal level. At the state level, state education agencies typically  administer and monitor the program. For NSLP, funding flows to the local  school food authorities\u2014offices responsible for managing the meals  program. For CACFP, funding flows to sponsoring agencies, generally  nonprofit agencies. Neither program has a legislative requirement to  provide nutrition education, and unlike EFNEP and the other FNS  programs, neither NSLP nor CACFP has funding specifically to support  nutrition education.

During service delivery, nutrition  educators need to assess participants\u2019 needs and tailor services to meet  those needs. Providing consistent messages through multiple delivery  channels is also beneficial to encouraging a positive change in a  participant\u2019s nutritional behavior. Last, during program monitoring and  evaluation, officials need to collect and monitor program service and  participant data, assess outcomes, and evaluate whether the nutrition  education has had the desired impact. Research indicates that, along with  these key actions, environmental factors can have a significant positive or  negative influence on the results of nutrition education and should be  considered when designing, delivering, and monitoring and evaluating  nutrition education efforts."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Key Actions in Nutrition Education Can Increase the Likelihood of Success", "paragraphs": ["We identified several key actions presented in general nutrition education  research, prior GAO reports, and other documents on performance-based  management that program officials should take during any nutrition  education program. These actions reflect an ideal. However, if seriously  addressed, these actions will increase the likelihood that the nutrition  education will achieve its goals. These actions occur at three separate  stages in a nutrition education program: program design, service delivery,  and program monitoring and evaluation. However, the framework does  not prescribe a single method of program design, service delivery, or  program monitoring and evaluation; broad principles underpin these  actions, which allows for flexibility, multiple approaches to nutrition  education delivery, and various contexts in which nutrition education can  take place. Figure 2 depicts these actions and the three stages in which  they occur.", "According to this framework, during program design officials need to  identify their specific targeted population, set clear program goals, and  conduct strategic planning, which together provide the necessary  foundation to help guide the rest of the actions. Identifying the target  population can help program officials focus their goals and planning  efforts appropriately. Program goals should be clear and measurable, so  officials can determine whether the program is succeeding. Next, program  officials need to conduct strategic and other planning efforts that detail  how they intend to meet their nutrition education goals. For example,  strategic plans should include the program goals, plus objectives,  performance measures, and strategies that they will use to achieve the  goals and objectives. In addition, plans should also include information on  how program officials will coordinate and plan crosscutting efforts with  other related federal programs.", "During service delivery, nutrition educators need to assess the needs of  participants, tailor services to meet those needs, and deliver services of  appropriate frequency and duration to meet program goals. In assessing  participant needs, nutrition educators need to identify the nutritional,  health, and learning needs of the participants and tailor the nutrition  education activities to address those needs. For example, in providing  services to non-English-speaking pregnant women, nutrition educators  would need to provide services that addressed the nutritional and health  needs associated with pregnancy as well as provide those services in the  participant\u2019s native language. Programs should support needs assessments  of the targeted population receiving nutrition education services. Research  indicates that individual participant assessments can be a powerful tool in  providing services and are particularly important when the participant has  a high level of nutritional risk, such as in cases of low hemoglobin levels.  However, programs may also assess the needs of a selected group of  participants, such as low-income women living in a given community, and  tailor services to meet the group\u2019s needs. These broader assessments can  also increase the likelihood of a program\u2019s success, and are often present  in efforts that employ social marketing, an audience-centered approach  that features multiple and reinforced channels of communication along  with public policy and environmental changes to influence behavior. In  addition, educators who live in the community in which they teach,  referred to as paraprofessionals in the EFNEP program, may have an  enhanced understanding of participant needs.", "Finally, nutrition educators also need to deliver services with an  appropriate frequency and duration to ensure the content of the nutrition  education services is sufficient to meet the program\u2019s goals. Experts agree  that positive nutritional behavior change requires active and sustained  participation for a duration that is significantly longer than what is needed  for a gain in nutritional knowledge. Nutrition educators can help ensure  that participants receive a sustained and consistent message by delivering  services through multiple channels. By doing so, nutrition education  messages are supported and emphasized, and also can increase the  likelihood of services reaching participants who may not be able to come  into a traditional classroom to receive the nutrition education.", "During program monitoring and evaluation, program officials need to  collect data and evaluate program impact to monitor their nutrition  education efforts and evaluate the program\u2019s influence on participant  behavior. Output data, such as how many participants received services  and what services the program provided, enable officials to monitor  general program operations. Outcome data, such as pre- and postprogram  dietary behavior, provide valuable information on whether a participant\u2019s  knowledge or behavior has changed following the nutrition education.  Finally, program evaluations with an experimental or quasi-experimental  design help determine whether it is the nutrition education that caused the  knowledge or behavior changes, rather than other factors. Officials can  use all this information to review their successes and failures, diagnose  problems, and explain results. Officials can then use this information to  retool the program design or service delivery to further increase the  chances of success."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Environmental Factors Can Challenge or Support Nutrition Education Efforts", "paragraphs": ["A complex set of factors, including circumstances in the participant\u2019s  environment outside the classroom, contributes to an individual\u2019s  decisions about dietary behavior. Research indicates that these factors can  influence the results of education efforts. For example, food advertising,   lack of support from family members, and easy access to unhealthful  foods can make it more difficult for participants to make the healthy  choices presented in their nutrition education classes. For example, some,  but not all, foods sold in schools separate from the regulated school meals  program are high in fat, sodium, or added sugars. These foods are  available in many schools and can compete with the more healthful foods  available in schools. Outside of the school environment, participants face  additional challenges if healthy foods, such as fruits and vegetables, are  not readily available in local stores. Poverty and unstable monthly incomes  can also affect a family\u2019s ability to routinely eat nutritious foods.", "Program officials also described situations when environmental factors  may support nutrition education efforts. For example, one official said the  increasing health concern regarding obesity has generated more  community support for healthy eating choices. In addition, nutrition  education participants in rural communities with an abundance of locally  grown produce and vegetables may find it easier to incorporate some of  the lessons from their programs into their daily diets.", "When nutrition education activities address environmental factors that can  work against healthy eating choices or leverage environmental factors that  support healthy choices, they may be more likely to improve participants\u2019  dietary behavior. Social marketing often addresses environmental factors.  For example, through a social marketing approach, local public agencies  could work in partnership with private business to establish produce  sections in convenience stores located in low-income neighborhoods that  do not have grocery stores.

One program, FSP,  grants waivers to state agencies allowing FSNE to target a broader  population than that of people receiving food stamps. However, states are  required to demonstrate that these nutrition education efforts are  generally targeted to program recipients and that the majority of FSNE  participants are low-income.", "All five of the USDA programs that provide nutrition education also share  the overall nutrition education goal to improve nutritional knowledge and  dietary behavior, as shown in appendix II. Officials from each of these  programs told us that state officials have flexibility to set more specific  nutrition education goals. For example, in addition to setting the federal  FSP goal, state FSNE officials in a number of states set the specific goal of  increasing the consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables.", "While USDA sets goals for its nutrition education efforts, the department  does not include measures that specifically assess its nutrition education  efforts. For example, both USDA and FNS have strategic plans that include  the goal of improving the nation\u2019s nutrition and health. However, neither  strategic plan includes measures for assessing the effects of the nutrition  education efforts. To assess progress toward its goals, USDA uses a broad  national index\u2014the Healthy Eating Index\u2014a measure of diet quality  among Americans with incomes under 130 percent of poverty and children  in households under 185 percent of poverty. Although this measure is  helpful in tracking changes in the diet quality of the target population, it is  not tied to participation in nutrition education efforts. Therefore, it is  difficult to determine whether changes in participant behavior are  influenced by program nutrition education efforts or other factors.

On one hand, overlap creates the  potential for unnecessary duplication of, or gaps in, service delivery as  well as administrative inefficiencies. On the other hand, overlap between  agencies or programs that administer similar functions is sometimes  necessary to meet federal priorities, and in the case of nutrition education,  participants can benefit from hearing the message from several sources.  To be effective, the messages across programs must be consistent with  one another, which requires established linkages across programs.", "USDA recognizes the value of coordinating efforts among these programs;  in practice, the programs coordinate in various ways. FNS and EFNEP  staff participate in multiple committees and initiatives within USDA and  with other federal and nongovernmental organizations to work together on  specific nutritional issues. For example, officials from USDA and the  Department of Health and Human Services participate in a working group  to ensure that dietary guidance from both departments accurately reflects  the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the Food Guide Pyramid.", "In addition, the programs work with the Food and Nutrition Information  Center (FNIC) at the National Agricultural Library to provide a forum for  the exchange of nutrition education information among programs and with  state and local officials and nutrition educators. However, FNS materials  are separate from EFNEP\u2019s. FNIC has a memorandum of understanding  with FSNE, WIC, and Team Nutrition to support their nutrition education  materials through FNIC\u2019s Web site. The Web site houses a wide array of  nutrition education materials, including multiple databases containing  nutrition education curricula. For example, the Web site supports the  Food Stamp Nutrition Connection database, which provides a forum for  nutrition educators to share curricula, participant materials, and other  resources with personnel providing nutrition education activities to food  stamp participants, applicants, and other low-income individuals likely to  be eligible for FSP. Similarly, the Healthy School Meals Resource System  provides information to persons working in USDA\u2019s child nutrition  programs. In addition, FNIC also supports links to discussion groups that  allow providers of nutrition education to communicate and exchange  ideas. While there is useful information available through FNIC, we do not  know the extent to which nutrition educators use these resources.  Furthermore, FNIC\u2019s Web site does not include either the database of  nutrition education materials created primarily by EFNEP or a link to this  database. Instead, CSREES supports the Nutrition Education for Diverse  Audiences database, which contains nutrition education curricula and  other related material on its Web site. These materials can be a valuable  resource for those individuals who take advantage of them; however,  USDA does not systematically ensure coordination or the sharing of  materials among the programs, particularly between FNS and EFNEP.", "FNS has identified the need to take additional steps to strengthen the  overall linkages among its programs. For example, as part of the  department\u2019s strategic goal to promote healthier eating habits and  lifestyles, it has listed a strategy to support an integrated, cross-program  nutrition education effort to address health-related problems, such as  obesity. However, the plan does not describe the specific means,  mechanism, or responsible authority to implement this strategy. In  addition, FNS has recognized the need for a more integrated, cross- program approach in its 1999 report to Congress, the President\u2019s fiscal  year 2005 budget request, and other documents. For example, in its report  to Congress, FNS states that its goal is to ensure that nutrition education  is fully integrated into all FNS programs; specifically, FNS says the  changes needed to enhance nutrition behaviors can only be achieved  through a nutrition education effort that allows flexibility for integrated,  cross-program interventions. In the report, FNS suggests that funding be  authorized for such cross-program coordination. In the budget request,  FNS is requesting a total appropriation of $2.5 million for cross-program  nutrition education efforts, including establishing a cross-program  nutrition framework with the goal of ensuring a comprehensive,  integrated, and family-oriented approach in all FNS nutrition assistance  programs. The funds would support increased coordinating efforts, such  as the formulation of curricula, the sharing of best practices across FNS  program participants, and the fostering of collaboration among state  agencies.", "Despite these initiatives and proposals, overall, we found limited evidence  of a department-wide unifying strategy to build and support effective  linkages among the FNS programs and EFNEP that would ensure  consistency of message, efficient use of resources, and planning for  service delivery and program development at the federal level. Increasing  coordination efforts and building strong linkages between EFNEP and  FNS may be challenging because they are administered by two different  USDA agencies. For example, we identified missed opportunities to share  data collection tools and software that could have helped with both  program efficiency and effectiveness. However, some federal officials we  spoke with have recognized the need to improve linkages between the two  USDA agencies. An FNS official said that FNS has begun to focus efforts  on ways to ensure that nutrition messages are coordinated across its  programs. However, it has not yet worked with EFNEP on this issue. An  EFNEP official said that FNS and CSREES are beginning to see the need  for enhanced coordination and have begun to discuss activities that could  go in a memorandum of understanding.", "Distinct administrative structures can also create coordination challenges  and fragmented service delivery at the state level and local level.", "Specifically, state and local officials are hindered by the different  administrative structures of each of the programs, including the funding  streams, personnel, and requirements for designing and delivering  nutrition education for their target populations. For example, in one state  we visited, USDA programs were administered by five different agencies,  ranging from social service and health departments to a Cooperative  Extension office. Moreover, states often lack a process or a central focal  point to help coordinate planning efforts among the programs. In our  report on NSLP, we noted that not all states had established a state focal  point for leadership or had begun collaboration among state agencies to  provide nutrition education in schools. In the past, the Nutrition  Education and Training Program helped to fund this central focal point by  providing the manpower and resources needed for state and local officials  to coordinate child nutrition programs with nutrition education activities  in schools and child care centers. Despite the lack of a central focal point,  we did find instances of local coordination across some programs, but this  coordination was sporadic and generally involved two programs rather  than all of them.", "USDA has taken some steps to encourage and facilitate linkages between  some of its programs that provide nutrition education. At the state level,  FNS established cooperative agreements with 22 states to establish  Nutrition Networks, which can act as the collaborative agent at the state  level to help identify and highlight nutrition problems, such as obesity.  Nutrition Networks are state-level organizations that can expand,  coordinate, and integrate innovative nutrition education messages across  programs. California\u2019s Nutrition Network, for example, includes over 300  government, nonprofit, and business organizations, including the state  Departments of Health Services, Social Services, Education, and Food and  Agriculture, and the state\u2019s Cooperative Extension system. State officials  said that one of the many goals of its network is to identify service gaps  across nutrition education efforts. USDA also recently began an initiative  to promote collaboration, known as the State Nutrition Action Plans  initiative. This initiative encourages state agencies to work together  toward a more integrated approach to planning and delivering nutrition  education. When the initiative was launched at its national conference,  FNS asked state officials to work together to identify goals for  collaboration and specific objectives and steps to achieve the goals.

These assessments provided  instructors with important indicators of nutrition and dietary behavior.  States had the option of gathering additional information from  participants. For example, California added two more questions to the  assessment form that determined participants\u2019 fruit and vegetable intake.  In addition, EFNEP uses paraprofessionals to deliver nutrition education,  and their presence in these communities may augment their ability to  assess local needs. An EFNEP official in Michigan, for example, stated that  having EFNEP paraprofessionals who lived in a Native American  community enhanced their ability to determine the needs of that  community.", "The EFNEP program has a core curriculum that includes classes on  dietary practice, nutrition quality, food safety, food security, and resource  management. However, EFNEP officials we spoke with stated that the  program allows educators to tailor parts of the curriculum to address  participants\u2019 needs. For example, Michigan EFNEP officials told us their  paraprofessionals developed an individual plan for participants tailored to  each participant\u2019s responses to questions from the formal needs  assessment. The individual plans included the core curriculum of the  particular program but also included areas for emphasis or  supplementation within the curriculum. Similarly, California EFNEP  introduced a nutrition program into public schools called EatFit. With the  goal of increasing nutrition and health among school children, the program  included participant self-assessments, which drove the specific curriculum  and messages provided through the program\u2019s series of classes. The  children received tailored interventions, based on the assessments, with  goals such as increasing fruit intake at lunch and increasing physical  activity throughout the school day.", "EFNEP officials told us they delivered frequent and ongoing nutrition  education. Specifically, EFNEP educators provided a series of  interventions, which varied in number from 6 to 16, generally in the form  of small group classes over the course of approximately several months to  a year, depending on the number of interventions. EFNEP educators  provided nutrition education through various sites, such as WIC clinics,    4-H clubs, community centers, and other key sites in the community.  Research indicates that providing nutrition education through various  sites is beneficial to participants. However, officials noted that while the  delivery of classes over the course of several months helped ensure  participants benefited from the services, this benefit could diminish after  the nutrition education ended.", "A federal program official told us that resource constraints and funding  formulas presented challenges for equitable service delivery. Given its  current resources, the program is currently able to fund services in  approximately 700 to 800 of the nation\u2019s 3,150 counties. This is, in part,  because EFNEP funding has declined in constant dollars over several  decades despite a general increase in the number of people eligible for  EFNEP services. Furthermore, an EFNEP official said the funding formula  for allocating program resources among states is outdated. It is based on  census data from the 1960s. As a result, states such as California, where  the low-income population has increased over the last two decades, had  less to spend per eligible participant than states with more stable low- income populations. For example, while California spent roughly 65 cents  per eligible participant in 2003, South Dakota spent over $5.00 per eligible  participant.", "Some state and local EFNEP providers delivered nutrition education in  collaboration with other USDA nutrition education programs to broaden  their reach, according to officials with whom we spoke. For example, in  Michigan, EFNEP officials told us they leveraged program resources by  working with the local FSNE initiative to ensure that the geographic areas  where they provided services did not overlap."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "WIC\u2019s Ability to Incorporate the Key Service Delivery Actions May Have Been Limited by Competing Program Requirements and Resource Constraints", "paragraphs": ["WIC provides nutrition education services as a part of the program\u2019s  overall nutrition assistance mission, but officials we spoke with told us  several competing program requirements and resource constraints limited  the program\u2019s ability to fully incorporate all of the service delivery actions.  WIC staff we met with told us their educators, usually nutritionists or  dieticians, routinely assessed participant needs and usually tailored the  services to the needs of the WIC population in general.  However, WIC  had a limited ability to deliver frequent and ongoing nutrition education. In  addition, other program requirements restricted the time and resources  available for nutrition education.", "WIC officials told us that by requiring participants to complete an intake  form that helped providers identify their nutritional intake and dietary  behaviors, WIC routinely assessed participants\u2019 needs. WIC providers,  which included local public and private nonprofit health clinics and  nonprofit agencies, used these forms to identify high-nutritional-risk  participants, who, according to federal officials, were slated for more  intensive, one-on-one nutritional counseling. Some WIC providers we  spoke with also used the intake forms to collect data on the characteristics  and dietary needs of the program participants overall. Michigan has  developed a computer system for collecting and tracking participant needs  that, according to state officials, assisted the state\u2019s local providers in  knowing what nutrition education services were most needed, the number  of nutrition education interventions, the number of participants who  refused WIC nutrition education, and the number of participants enrolled  in other programs such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families  (TANF) and Medicaid.", "Federal WIC officials told us that WIC providers try to tailor nutrition  education to participant needs when possible, although in most cases,  participants received nutrition education tailored to the needs of the  overall WIC population. For example, a Michigan official stated that her  staff designed nutrition education classes that were appropriate for the  general WIC community, and participants generally received whatever pre- designed class happened to be offered on the day they were in the clinic.  WIC officials told us that local WIC providers use participant data to help  tailor services. For example, a Maryland WIC official said the state  database included several data elements that are helpful in tracking local  participant health trends, which allowed local clinics to adjust and develop  their overall curriculum to address the needs of the local participants.  Several officials stated that given the limited resources and time for WIC  nutrition education, it was impossible to ensure participants received  nutrition education that addressed their particular needs except for  participants at the greatest nutrition risk.", "Federal, state, and local WIC officials we interviewed said the WIC  program had a limited ability to provide frequent and ongoing nutrition  education because of competing program requirements. According to  program rules, WIC providers are required to offer nutrition education to  participants. However, those who do not attend nutrition education  activities cannot be denied the other WIC benefits for their lack of  participation. Moreover, the cost of nutrition education in WIC is a part of  each local agency\u2019s administrative expenses, which, according to FNS  officials, forces nutrition education activities to be in competition for  resources with other administrative requirements and duties. For  example, WIC providers were required by law to provide services  unrelated to nutrition education, such as voter registration and drug and  alcohol counseling. Because of these competing demands on time and  resources, the average WIC participant received approximately less than  20 minutes of nutrition education twice every 6 months. WIC participants  usually receive WIC services over the course of several years, which  allows a more sustained participation in nutrition education services,  according to FNS officials. However, WIC officials in both California and  Michigan stated that there was little reason to believe such a limited  exposure to nutrition education would produce meaningful changes in a  participant\u2019s nutritional knowledge and dietary behavior.", "In response to these challenges, FNS and the states we studied were  developing technology-driven approaches to nutrition education. FNS, in  partnership with other organizations, established the WIC Works Resource  System in January 2000. This Web-based system includes an on-line  searchable database of materials developed for WIC audiences and  downloadable materials from the childhood obesity prevention initiative,  Fit WIC. At the state level, Michigan officials told us they were trying to  improve access to services by providing some participants with the option  of receiving services through self-paced Internet classes. In addition, state  WIC officials have collaborated with other USDA efforts to deliver  nutrition education. State officials we interviewed cited examples of WIC  officials working with other programs, such as EFNEP, to develop  nutrition education curricula, but again time, resources, and other  program priorities limited their efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FSNE\u2019s Incorporation of the Service Delivery Actions Varies Widely, and Food Stamp Recipients May Not Be Receiving FSNE Services", "paragraphs": ["Designed as an optional service for states to provide in conjunction with  other food stamp services, FSNE service delivery varies widely from state  to state. Services in FSNE can range from one-on-one counseling to small  group classes, to broad social marketing campaigns that reach large  numbers of people at a low cost per participant. All of these delivery  methods could incorporate the key delivery actions if implemented  properly. However, not enough is known about the services delivered to  determine whether the service delivery actions are consistently  incorporated across the nation. Moreover, federal and state officials do  not know whether FSNE services are provided to food stamp recipients,  the original intended beneficiaries of the services.", "Federal FSNE officials stated that local FSNE educators have the option of  conducting individual needs assessments or of assessing the needs of  larger targeted populations. However, FNS does not provide standard  needs assessment tools. In some cases, according to the same officials,  local FSNE educators are able to use needs assessment tools they  developed in their state or locality. In the states we studied, the state  Cooperative Extension offices that administered EFNEP also administered  FSNE. In these cases, FSNE used a service delivery model similar to  EFNEP, which included individual needs assessments using either a food  behavior checklist or other questionnaire. In California, the State Director  of EFNEP told us these tools might ask about what the participant had  eaten in the past 24 hours. FSNE educators reported using information  from similar assessment tools in Michigan to help determine what  nutrition education content participants needed and to identify what  nutrition trends were present in the participant community. In some cases,  FSNE used paraprofessionals to deliver nutrition education services,  according to officials from two states.", "On the basis of our site visits and conversations with officials, we found  that FSNE efforts generally tailored most services to the needs of a  targeted group. For example, Michigan FSNE officials told us their  educators went to migrant farm communities to hold classes late at night,  from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m., to accommodate the working and living  circumstances of migrant families. Similarly, FSNE educators went to a  Detroit homeless shelter to teach food safety and preparation relevant to  individuals without stable housing. In California, FSNE officials reported  that their educators tailored the interventions to meet the needs of non- English-speaking participants by providing information and giving cooking  demonstrations in Vietnamese.", "FSNE officials in the states we visited told us FSNE services typically  came through one-time-only interventions. According to FNS officials, a  series of classes provided through classroom instruction was not the usual  form of delivery. Services provided via one-time-only methods can include  media campaigns and other forms of nutrition education designed to reach  participants through multiple channels. These efforts may incorporate the  key service delivery actions, when implemented properly. However,  federal FNS officials told us states\u2019 program plans vary widely in their  quality and level of detail, and federal FNS officials did not have a clear  picture of what services local officials provided.", "FNS officials expressed concerns over the rapid growth in FSNE funding  in recent years, combined with states\u2019 broad flexibility in implementing the  program. In particular, from 1992 to 2002, the federal funds dedicated for  FSNE services have increased, overall, more than for the other programs.  Moreover, every state FSNE provider has at least one approved waiver to  allow the provision of nutrition education to non-food stamp recipients,  according to FNS officials. While this waiver permits states to provide  services to a wider range of low-income individuals and eliminates the  administrative burden of checking for Food Stamp Program eligibility, it  also limits any assurance that Food Stamp Program recipients receive  FSNE nutrition education. In fact, FNS officials recognized that at the  state and local level Food Stamp Program officials did not rely on, or  coordinate with, FSNE efforts or officials in any systematic way.", "FNS officials said they are currently in the process of proposing changes  to FSNE to address these issues. One of the proposed changes would set  clear policies and strategies for the delivery of services. This change  includes developing a policy framework that describes the intended  structure, target populations, and key behavior changes that FSNE intends  to promote among participants. This policy framework would also set  clear roles for the administrators and stakeholders of FSNE services at the  federal, state, and local levels.

In  addition, principals, teachers, and other officials have stated that teachers  focus classroom time almost entirely on making sure that students meet  state academic standards, leaving little time to include subjects or  information not included on the state academic standards test. Moreover,  because NSLP and CACFP have no systems or infrastructure in place to  support nutrition education delivery at the local level, nutrition education  efforts in schools can often depend on the leadership of only a few  individuals.

FNS officials also pointed out that conducting large- scale impact evaluations would be a very costly and difficult endeavor. We  agree with this point and have not recommended that USDA conduct  numerous large-scale evaluations. Instead, we believe that USDA can more  carefully develop a longer-term evaluation strategy that includes plans to  conduct periodic and complementary evaluations of the various programs.", "Finally, FNS officials raised concerns over our discussion of the benefits  of program consolidation and the need for more coordination in the draft  report. They pointed out that each program has its own broad mission, and  it would be difficult to pinpoint opportunities for consolidation. Also,  officials highlighted a number of ways that they coordinate on nutrition  education message, resources, and so forth. In response, we included  additional examples of coordination. However, although FNS has taken  measures to increase coordination efforts and strengthen linkages  between its programs, we believe opportunities exist for increased  coordination efforts and stronger linkages among the FNS programs and  between FNS and EFNEP. For example, USDA could encourage EFNEP  and the FNS programs to take a more systematic approach to planning and  program development, as well as compiling and sharing nutrition  education curricula and lessons learned. Coordination at the state level  also poses ongoing challenges. Our recommendation provides the  department with flexibility to determine the most appropriate means to  strengthen coordination and improve linkages.", "On April 14, 2004, we also received oral comments from the National  Program Leader for EFNEP on behalf of CSREES. CSREES agrees with  our recommendations, and stated that the report provides a balanced and  useful account of the five key nutrition education programs. CSREES also  noted that we clearly articulated the similarities and differences between  the programs, noting the variation in size, longevity, administrative  oversight, funding, and degree of local adaptation among the programs.  CSREES also particularly noted the relationship between FSNE and the  state and local Cooperative Extension Service, stating that a substantial  portion of FSNE\u2019s required 50 percent match comes from universities and  the Cooperative Extension Service. Also, CSREES has taken several steps  to enhance the coordination and accountability of FSNE when its services  are administered through Cooperative Extension offices, including  providing training to FSNE providers and developing a tool to enhance the  communication and evaluation of nutrition education efforts.", "In addition, FNS and CSREES also provided us with technical comments,  which we incorporated where appropriate.", "We will send copies of this report to the Secretary of Agriculture,  appropriate congressional committees, and other interested parties. In  addition, the report will be available at no charge on GAO\u2019s Web site at  http://www.gao.gov.", "If you or your staff have any questions or wish to discuss this material,  please call me at (415) 904-2272 or Kay E.

Specifically, in our review of nutrition education research, we relied  primarily on one comprehensive research review of 217 nutrition  education studies at the recommendation of USDA officials and academic  nutrition education experts. We also relied on additional input of several  nutrition education experts. Finally, we reviewed GAO reports and other  documents on performance-based management in order to identify  program design and evaluation strategies related to successful program  management.", "To answer the questions related to USDA\u2019s nutrition education efforts and  program planning elements, we conducted interviews with federal officials  from each of the five USDA programs, examined program reports and  studies, and reviewed relevant laws and regulations. We also conducted  interviews with cognizant state and local officials from each of the five  programs in three states; we conducted site visits in Maryland and  California and conducted telephone interviews with Michigan officials. We  selected these states because they represented a range of geographic  locations and received a range of funding resources for nutrition  education. Our observations on the delivery of nutrition education are  primarily based on our site visits and cannot be generalized to the  programs nationwide.", "To identify recent studies that evaluate nutrition education within the five  USDA programs we reviewed, we searched relevant databases through  September 2003, such as Agricola, ABI/Inform, Food Science &  Technology, Educational Resources Information Center, and National  Technical Information Service, and reviewed related GAO reports. We also  spoke with nutrition education experts to identify relevant research. While  these programs all offer services in addition to nutrition education, our  report focuses on the nutrition education components of the evaluations.", "In order to focus on recent research on the nutrition education  components of the USDA programs and to target articles for detailed  review, we identified studies that met the following criteria:    The document is an original research study or an analysis of research  data, not only a descriptive study, evaluating nutrition education in one  or more of the five programs.", "The document has been published in a refereed medium (for example,  a journal article, book or book chapter, or USDA-issued report).", "The document\u2019s publication date is 1994 or later.    The document is in English.", "We also asked USDA officials to identify any research assessing whether  the five programs were meeting their nutrition education goals. We then  compared the lists they provided with our own list of studies to ensure  that all studies meeting our criteria were included in our review.", "Altogether, 20 items met our criteria for review. Many of the items we  eliminated were published prior to 1994 and therefore do not satisfy our  definition of recent studies. Some items were eliminated because they  were published as reviews or summaries of original research but did not  include any original research. Other items provide descriptive information  about nutrition education recipients and staff but do not evaluate the  nutrition education efforts.", "We then conducted detailed reviews of the 20 studies. These reviews  entailed an evaluation of each study\u2019s research methodology, including its  research design, sampling frame, selection of measures, data quality,  limitations, and analytic techniques, as well as a summary of its major  findings. We also assessed the extent to which each study was relevant to  assessing whether a program was meeting its nutrition education goals.", "One-quarter (5) of the 20 studies had major research design limitations  that prevented us from including their conclusions in our report. For  example, a number of studies included the use of inappropriate  comparisons and comparison groups, and some studies failed to analyze  data collected both before and after nutrition education was provided. For  example, one study of WIC nutrition education in New Mexico was based  on data collected after, but not before, nutrition education was provided,  allowing a comparison of different delivery methods but not an evaluation  of overall effectiveness. A study of FSNE in Texas used pretest data  collected retrospectively, at the same time as post-test data, limiting the  validity of the data.
