During this period, CS's budgets remained essentially flat as per capita personnel costs and administrative costs increased. However, CS leadership did not recognize the long-term implications of these changes because it lacked key financial and workforce information and risk analysis necessary for good management control. CS continued to pay fees associated with positions it maintained in U.S. embassies that were vacant but not officially eliminated. As CS's financial constraints grew, officials delayed their impact by using a variety of financial management practices. For example, the International Trade Administration (ITA), CS's parent agency, attributed some of CS's centralized costs to other units. However, as the availability of offsetting funds declined and costs continued growing, CS leadership failed to recognize the risks from these changes in accordance with good management controls, and reached a \"crisis\" situation in 2009. Officials froze hiring, travel, training, and supplies, compromising CS's ability to conduct its core business. CS's workforce declined by about 14 percent from its peak level in 2004 through attrition--affecting the mix and distribution of personnel. CS intends to rebuild its workforce but lacks key planning elements for doing so, and its budget request has weaknesses that could affect its ability to meet its goals. CS will have a central role in implementing the NEI. The President's 2011 budget requested $321 million for CS, $63 million more than its 2010 appropriation. The budget would fund a major staff increase. CS is allocating $5.2 million of its 2010 appropriation to begin recruiting new staff. However, as new executive-level leadership was arriving, GAO found that CS lacked key planning elements, including a clear sense of strategic direction and an analysis to determine its workforce needs. Also, it had not updated its workforce plans to address staffing gaps since fiscal year 2007. Adding more staff could be delayed because CS's human resources office is itself understaffed and because CS requires up to 2 years to hire and train new Foreign Service Officers. GAO also found that the 2011 budget request, though sound in many respects, has weaknesses; it lacks some documentation, and it lacks risk analysis and contingency plans for highly variable program costs, which could lead to cost overruns."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends to the Secretary of Commerce that CS (1) strengthen management controls, (2) improve workforce planning, and (3) improve cost estimating related to CS's budget estimate.

Effective organizations integrate human capital  approaches as strategies for accomplishing their mission. They stay alert  to emerging mission demands and human capital challenges and remain  open to reevaluating their human capital practices in light of their  demonstrated successes or failures in achieving the organization\u2019s  strategic objectives.", "According to a senior CS official, the lack of political leadership hampered  efforts to analyze and make decisions regarding the organization\u2019s longer  term workforce needs and to ensure its ability to undertake its mission  and achieve its goals. Instead, CS\u2019s recent workforce planning efforts have  primarily focused on short-term responses to its constrained budget  situation, such as not hiring new staff, and extending FSO tours at some  posts to avoid the cost of moving them to different posts.", "While ITA and CS experienced key leadership vacancies for more than a  year, CS now has new executive-level leaders who are focused on  determining CS\u2019s direction and resource needs. In February 2010, the new  Assistant Secretary for Trade Promotion and Director General of the U.S.  and Foreign Commercial Service was confirmed, and in March 2010, the  new Undersecretary for International Trade was sworn in. In addition,  Commerce announced the creation of a new Director\u2019s position to  coordinate and direct the Department\u2019s NEI efforts, filling the position in  April 2010. The new Assistant Secretary is currently reviewing all of CS\u2019s  budgets, activities, and personnel to determine what its structure should  be to accomplish its goals, including those of the NEI.", "CS has also lacked a clear sense of strategic direction. For example, the  Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee did not issue a 2009 National  Export Strategy, which has a role in directing the nation\u2019s export  promotion priorities and goals of CS; the last National Export Strategy was  issued in October 2008 by the previous administration. A plan to carry  out the NEI is due in September 2010.

Our prior human  capital work has found that a fact-based, performance-oriented approach  to human capital management is crucial for maximizing the value of  human capital as well as managing risk. High-performing organizations  identify their current and future human capital needs, including the  appropriate number of employees, the key competencies and skills mix for  mission accomplishment, and the appropriate deployment of staff across  the organization and then create strategies for identifying and filling gaps.  Valid and reliable data are critical to assessing an agency\u2019s workforce  requirements and heighten an agency\u2019s ability to manage risk by allowing  managers to spotlight areas for attention before crises develop and  identify opportunities for enhancing agency results. Although the costs of  collecting data may be significant, the costs of making decisions without  the necessary information can be equally significant. In preparing its 2011  budget request, CS did not make staffing decisions based on an overall  analysis of its needs, according to CS officials. Rather, it made decisions  based on anecdotal information about the demand for services.", "Additionally, CS only recently began to systematically monitor how many  vacancies it had and how many positions it might need to carry out its  mission in the future.

A  Commerce official told us that the number of staff requested in the 2011  budget request was not based on vacancies.", "CS\u2019s lack of a workforce needs analysis also has implications for staff  placement. Whereas CS\u2019s strategic focus has been on priority markets  such as Brazil, China, and India as well as emerging markets in countries  such as Azerbaijan and Qatar, staff placements may change under the NEI.  As mentioned above, CS\u2019s budget request includes a list of 22 countries  that are \u201ccandidates currently being considered for new overseas offices,\u201d  where CS is considering placing staff.

For example, salaries were calculated separately for several different  types of employees rather than using one salary cost as the basis for all the  calculations, and the cost of replacing 37 vehicles was identified  separately.

The guide identifies 12 practices that  are the basis for effective cost estimation, including cost estimation for  annual budget requests. It associates these practices with four  characteristics: accurate, well documented, comprehensive, and credible.  The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) endorsed this guidance as  being sufficient for meeting most cost-estimating requirements, including  for budget formulation. If followed correctly, these practices should result  in reliable and valid budgets that (a) can be easily and clearly traced,  replicated, and updated; and (b) enable managers to make informed  decisions. As table 7 illustrates, we found that CS\u2019s budget development  methods substantially met two, partially met one, and minimally met one  of these four practices. After conducting this assessment, we identified  major strengths and weaknesses of the 2011 budget request.", "The following explains the definitions we used in assessing ITA\u2019s methods  for estimating costs in its annual budget submission:    Met\u2014ITA provided complete evidence that satisfies the entire criterion.", "Substantially met\u2014ITA provided evidence that satisfies a large portion of  the criterion.", "Partially met\u2014ITA provided evidence that satisfies about half of the  criterion.", "Minimally met\u2014ITA provided evidence that satisfies a small portion of the  criterion.", "Not met\u2014ITA provided no evidence that satisfies any part of the criterion.", "The sections that follow highlight the key findings of our assessment."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "2011 Budget Substantially Met Characteristics for Comprehensiveness", "paragraphs": ["Best practices for comprehensiveness include an estimating plan that  includes sufficient resources, an estimating approach with standard cost  elements broken down to sufficient detail, and clear identification of  ground rules and assumptions.", "Estimating plan.

The budget used a standard cost element structure  that defined all cost elements and addressed relevant costs. CS broke  down pertinent costs to an acceptable level of detail.

Consistent with best practices, CS used historical data to estimate  key operational costs.

However, although they were aware that salaries were their  largest cost driver, they used an overly simplistic averaging approach to  reflect likely new staff salaries at hiring. Additionally, since CS did not  perform a risk analysis, it is not possible to know whether its point  estimate was the most likely actual reflection of costs, or was overly   optimistic or conservative. We found no mathematical mistakes in the  request, and CS validated the request by looking for errors.
