Due to the significance of the federal debt held by the public to the governmentwide financial statements, GAO has also been auditing the Bureau of the Public Debt's (BPD) Schedules of Federal Debt annually. The audit of these schedules is done to determine whether, in all material respects, (1) the schedules are reliable and (2) BPD management maintained effective internal control relevant to the Schedule of Federal Debt. Further, GAO tests compliance with a significant selected provision of law related to the Schedule of Federal Debt. Federal debt managed by BPD consists of Treasury securities held by the public and by certain federal government accounts, referred to as intragovernmental debt holdings. The level of debt held by the public reflects how much of the nation's wealth has been absorbed by the federal government to finance prior federal spending in excess of federal revenues. Intragovernmental debt holdings represent balances of Treasury securities held by federal government accounts, primarily federal trust funds such as Social Security, that typically have an obligation to invest their excess annual receipts over disbursements in federal securities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In GAO's opinion, BPD's Schedules of Federal Debt for fiscal years 2007 and 2006 were fairly presented in all material respects and BPD maintained effective internal control relevant to the Schedule of Federal Debt as of September 30, 2007. GAO also found no instances of noncompliance in fiscal year 2007 with the statutory debt limit. As of September 30, 2007 and 2006, federal debt managed by BPD totaled about $8,993 billion and $8,493 billion, respectively. Total federal debt increased over each of the last 4 fiscal years. Total federal spending has exceeded total federal revenues which have resulted in increases in debt held by the public. Further, certain trust funds (e.g., Social Security) continue to run cash surpluses, resulting in increased intragovernmental debt holdings since the federal government spends these surpluses on other operating costs and replaces them with federal debt instruments. These debt holdings are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government and represent a priority call on future budgetary resources. As a result, total gross federal debt has increased about 33 percent between the end of fiscal years 2003 and 2007. On September 29, 2007, legislation was enacted to raise the statutory debt limit by $850 billion to $9,815 billion. This was the third occurrence since the end of fiscal year 2003 that the statutory debt limit had to be raised to avoid breaching the statutory debt limit. During that time, the debt limit has increased by over $2.4 trillion, or about 33 percent, from $7,384 billion on September 30, 2003, to the current limit of $9,815 billion."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The accompanying auditor\u2019s report presents the results of our audits of the  Schedules of Federal Debt Managed by the Bureau of the Public Debt  (BPD) for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2007 and 2006.  The  Schedules of Federal Debt present the beginning balances, increases and  decreases, and ending balances for (1) Federal Debt Held by the Public and  Intragovernmental Debt Holdings, (2) the related Accrued Interest  Payables, and (3) the related Net Unamortized Premiums and Discounts  managed by BPD.", "The auditor\u2019s report contains our (1) opinion on the Schedules of Federal  Debt for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2007 and 2006, (2) opinion on  the effectiveness of relevant internal control as of September 30, 2007,   (3) conclusion on compliance in fiscal year 2007 with a selected provision  of law we tested, and (4) conclusion on the consistency between  information in the Schedules of Federal Debt and the accompanying  Overview on Federal Debt Managed by the Bureau of the Public Debt.", "As of September 30, 2007 and 2006, federal debt managed by the bureau  totaled about $8,993 billion and $8,493 billion, respectively, for moneys  borrowed to fund the federal government\u2019s operations.  As shown on the  Schedules of Federal Debt, these balances consisted of approximately (1)  $5,049 billion as of September 30, 2007, and $4,843 billion as of September  30, 2006, of debt held by the public and about (2) $3,944 billion as of  September 30, 2007, and $3,650 billion as of September 30, 2006, of  intragovernmental debt holdings.", "The level of debt held by the public reflects how much of the nation\u2019s  wealth has been absorbed by the federal government to finance total prior  federal spending in excess of federal revenues.  It best represents the  cumulative effect of past federal borrowing on today\u2019s economy and the  federal budget.  To finance a cash deficit, the federal government borrows  from the public. When a cash surplus occurs, the annual excess funds can  then be used to reduce debt held by the public. In other words, annual cash  deficits or surpluses generally approximate the annual net change in the  amount of federal government borrowing from the public.", "Intragovernmental debt holdings represent balances of Treasury securities  held by federal government accounts, primarily federal trust funds (e.g.,  Social Security), that typically have an obligation to invest their excess  annual receipts over disbursements in federal securities.  Most federal trust  funds invest in special U.S. Treasury securities that are guaranteed for  principal and interest by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.   The federal government uses the trust funds\u2019 invested cash surpluses to  assist in funding other federal government costs. The transactions relating  to Treasury securities held by the federal government accounts net out on  the federal government\u2019s consolidated financial statements because under  current U.S. generally accepted accounting principles they essentially  represent loans from one part of the federal government to another.  These  securities are nonmarketable; however, they represent a priority call on  future budgetary resources.", "While both are important, debt held by the public and intragovernmental  debt holdings are very different.  Debt held by the public approximates the  federal government\u2019s competition with other sectors in the credit markets.   Federal borrowing absorbs resources available for private investment and  may put upward pressure on interest rates.  In addition, interest on debt  held by the public is paid in cash and represents a burden on current  taxpayers.  It reflects the amount the federal government pays to its outside  creditors.  In contrast, intragovernmental debt holdings perform an  accounting function but typically do not require cash payments from the  current budget or represent a burden on the current economy.  In addition,  from the perspective of the budget as a whole, interest payments to federal  government accounts by the Treasury are entirely offset by the income  received by such accounts. This intragovernmental debt and the interest on  it represents a claim on future resources and hence a burden on future  taxpayers and the future economy. Specifically, when trust funds redeem  Treasury securities to obtain cash to fund expenditures, Treasury usually  borrows from the public to finance these redemptions. Such borrowings  result in competition with the private sector and thus an effect on the  economy.", "We have audited the Schedule of Federal Debt since fiscal year 1997. Over  this period, total federal debt has increased by 73 percent.  During the last 4  fiscal years, managing the federal debt has continued to be a challenge as  evidenced by the growth of total federal debt by $2,210 billion, or 33  percent, from $6,783 billion as of September 30, 2003, to $8,993 billion as of  September 30, 2007.  As a result of the increasing debt, again this past year,  Congress enacted a bill to increase the debt limit to avoid breaching the  statutory debt limit.  On September 29, 2007, the President approved the  bill to increase the statutory debt limit from $8,965 billion to $9,815 billion.   This was the third occurrence since the end of fiscal year 2003 that a law  has been enacted to raise the statutory debt limit, with the debt limit  increasing over $2.4 trillion, or about 33 percent, from $7,384 billion on  September 30, 2003, to $9,815 billion, over that period.", "Over the last several years, we have noted a trend in the amount of  Treasury securities held by foreign and international investors. According  to amounts reported in the September 2007 Treasury Bulletin, Treasury  estimates that the amount of Treasury securities held by foreign and  international investors has increased $837 billion, from $1,383 as of June  30, 2003, to $2,220 billion as of June 30, 2007. As of June 30, 2007, this  represents an estimated 45 percent of debt held by the public, up from  about 36 percent as of June 30, 2003. The United States benefits from  foreign purchases of Treasury securities because foreign and international  investors fill part of the U.S. government\u2019s borrowing needs. However, to  service this foreign-held debt, the U.S. government must send interest  payments abroad, which adds to the incomes of residents of other  countries rather than to the incomes of U.S. residents. In addition, this  increasing reliance on foreign and international investors to finance the  deficits of the U.S. government presents potential risk to the U.S. economy,  especially since the U.S. gross national saving rate is low by U.S. historical  standards.", "Another trend we have observed is the decline in annual budget deficits. As  widely reported last month, the fiscal year 2007 budget deficit of $163  billion represents the third consecutive decline in budget deficits, down  from last year\u2019s deficit of $248 billion. Certainly lower short-term deficits  are better than higher short-term deficits. However, our nation\u2019s real  challenge is not short-term deficits, rather it\u2019s the U.S. government\u2019s  impending longer-term structural deficits and related debt burdens. Indeed,  what we call the longer-term fiscal challenge is not in the distant future.  The first of the baby boomers become eligible for early retirement under  Social Security on January 1, 2008\u2014only two months from now\u2014 and for  Medicare benefits just 3 years later. The budget and economic implications  of the baby boom generation\u2019s retirement have already become a factor in  Congressional Budget Office\u2019s 10-year baseline projections and will only  intensify as the baby boomers age.  GAO\u2019s long-range fiscal policy  simulations show that the nation\u2019s current fiscal condition is but a prelude  to a much more daunting long-term fiscal challenge.  Simply put, our  nation is on an imprudent and unsustainable long-term fiscal path that is  getting worse with the passage of time.  Absent significant changes on the  spending and/or revenue sides of the budget, these long-term deficits will  encumber a growing share of federal resources and test the capacity of  current and future generations to afford both today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s  commitments.", "As discussed earlier, federal debt managed by the bureau totaled about $9  trillion at the end of fiscal year 2007.  However, that number excludes many  items, including the gap between scheduled and funded Social Security and  Medicare benefits, veterans\u2019 health care, and a range of other commitments  and contingencies that the federal government has pledged to support.  If  these items are factored in, the total burden in present value dollars is  estimated to be about $53 trillion.  Stated differently, the estimated current  total burden for every American is nearly $175,000; and every day that  burden becomes larger.  Given the size of the projected imbalance, the U.S.  government will not be able to grow its way out of this problem; tough  choices will be required.  Our report, 21st Century Challenges:  Reexamining the Base of the Federal Government, is intended to support  Congress in identifying issues and options that could help address these  fiscal pressures.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Chairmen and Ranking Minority  Members of the Senate Committee on Appropriations; the Senate  Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs; the Senate  Committee on the Budget; the Subcommittee on Financial Services and  General Government, Senate Committee on Appropriations; the  Subcommittee on Federal Financial Management, Government  Information, Federal Services, and International Security, Senate  Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs; the House  Committee on Appropriations; the House Committee on Oversight and  Government  Reform; the House Committee on the Budget; the  Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government, House  Committee on Appropriations; and the Subcommittee on Government  Management, Organization, and Procurement, House Committee on  Oversight and Government Reform.

As of September 30, 2007 and 2006, outstanding gross federal debt managed by the bureau totaled $8,993 and $8,493 billion, respectively.  The increase in gross federal  debt of $500 billion during fiscal year 2007 was due to an increase in gross intragovernmental debt holdings of $294 billion and an  increase in gross debt held by the public of $206 billion.  As Figure 1 illustrates, both intragovernmental debt holdings and debt held  by the public have steadily increased since fiscal year 2003.  The primary reason for the increases in intragovernmental debt holdings  is the annual surpluses in the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund, Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund, and Military Retirement Fund.  The increases in debt  held by the public are due primarily to total federal spending exceeding total federal revenues.

The  primary components of interest expense are interest paid on the debt held by the public and interest credited to federal government  trust funds and other federal government accounts that hold Treasury securities.  The interest paid on the debt held by the public affects the current spending of the federal government and represents the burden in servicing its debt (i.e., payments to outside creditors).  Interest credited to federal government trust funds and other federal government accounts, on the other hand, does not  result in an immediate outlay of the federal government because one part of the government pays the interest and another part  receives it.  However, this interest represents a claim on future budgetary resources and hence an obligation on future taxpayers.  This  interest, when reinvested by the trust funds and other federal government accounts, is included in the programs\u2019 excess funds not  currently needed in operations, which are invested in federal securities.  During fiscal year 2007, interest expense incurred totaled $433 billion, interest expense on debt held by the public was $239 billion, and $194 billion was interest incurred for  intragovernmental debt holdings.

Nearly all the federal debt has been issued by the Treasury with a small portion being issued by other federal government agencies.

Large budget deficits emerged during the  1980\u2019s due to tax policy decisions and increased outlays for defense and domestic programs.
