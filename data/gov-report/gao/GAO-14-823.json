First, the inclusion of a tactile feature will require a redesign of currency, but it is not known when this will occur. Because BEP makes changes to currency to stay ahead of counterfeit threats, redesign occurs as needed and not at regular intervals. Second, BEP has faced difficulties developing a raised tactile feature, falling behind its internal schedule. Third, senior BEP and Federal Reserve officials told us that they have discussed the Federal Reserve's concerns about the potential cost impact of a tactile feature and whether technological changes since the 2008 court order could provide alternative options to BEP's current approach. BEP officials stated that they have not yet determined how these concerns might be addressed.

Most commonly,  countries use different-sized notes and color to distinguish different  denominations. Among nine major foreign countries surveyed by  economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, eight used those  two features in their currency. In addition, all nine used a tactile feature  or large, high-contrast numerals, or both. For example, the European  Union uses different-sized notes, different primary colors for each  denomination, and large numerals. The \u20ac200 and \u20ac500 notes also include  a tactile feature. Canada has incorporated a raised tactile feature in its  currency since 2001 and uses different colors and large, high-contrast  numerals.

The court required Treasury to provide  meaningful access no later than the date of the next currency redesign for  each of the denominations. The order also requires Treasury to submit semi-annual reports so that the court can monitor Treasury\u2019s progress.  The order remains in effect until Treasury fulfills the requirement.", "In 2010, BEP proposed a three-pronged approach consisting of three  elements it believes will provide meaningful access to currency: 1) large,  high-contrast numerals to allow low vision individuals to determine the  denomination of currency, 2) currency readers that can indicate a note\u2019s  value, and 3) a raised tactile feature to allow visually impaired persons  to denominate currency by touch. According to BEP, it chose this  approach because no single solution would enable all segments of the  diverse visually impaired population to denominate currency with 100  percent accuracy.

Each redesign involved changes to a family of notes\u2014the $5,  $10, $20, $50 and $100 notes\u2014and included design elements required  by statute as well as features to deter new counterfeit threats. Under  current law, the Department of the Treasury is not permitted to use  appropriated funds to redesign the $1 note. Redesigned notes retained  familiar characteristics of the notes they replaced, but included new  features or new versions of existing features that make each note distinct.  For example, while the size and location of the portrait on a note  changed, the portrait is of the same person. Figure 1 shows different  versions of portraits on the $100 note.", "BEP has increasingly used distinctive features to enhance a note\u2019s  appearance and resistance to counterfeiting. For example, BEP added a  series of individual features known as symbols of freedom to notes, such  as two images of the Statue of Liberty\u2019s torch on the $10 note. Security  features, like the bell in the inkwell on the most recent $100 note, make  it easier for the public to identify an authentic note and are difficult for  counterfeiters to reproduce. The development of these individual and  security features occurs separately from the overall design of the note,  which includes the note layout and artwork. Once the features and the  overall design receive interagency approval, they are combined to  achieve a final product. The length of time required to redesign a note  depends mostly on the length of time it takes to research, develop, and  test new security features. For example, BEP spent nearly 10 years  developing security features for the most recent $100 note. Developing  individual features involves a less rigorous process because BEP does  not rely on them for counterfeit protection. The redesign process may also  be lengthened if the Secret Service, the Federal Reserve, or industry  members, such as banks, identify problems with the test notes they  receive before full production. If there is a problem with the test notes,  such as if notes do not function correctly in the automated high-speed  currency-counting equipment used by the Federal Reserve and many  banks, the design of a note would need to be adjusted and resubmitted  for interagency review. Although the development of features and the  development of the overall design use separate processes, agency  officials said that information is shared between the processes on an  ongoing basis. Figure 2 describes the steps in the development  processes for a redesigned note and an individual feature. The raised  tactile feature BEP plans to add to currency is following the process BEP  uses for developing an individual feature.", "The Federal Reserve determines when newly redesigned notes are  placed into circulation based on the needs of the Federal Reserve Banks  and depository institutions. As a result, there may be some time between  when a redesigned note is produced by BEP and when it enters  circulation. After redesigned notes enter circulation, they co-circulate with  the previously designed notes for many years because of the notes\u2019  longevity. For example, the Federal Reserve estimates that a $5 note  remains in circulation for almost 5 years and a $100 note for 15 years.

BEP projects  spending about $35 million on the currency reader program over the next  3 years. The need for currency readers will likely continue for many years  because BEP estimates the first note with a tactile feature will not likely  be issued before 2020. BEP expects future notes to be issued, as they  have historically been, one denomination at a time over several years and  expects that notes without tactile features will co-circulate with tactile- enhanced notes for many years.", "BEP officials described steps they have taken, or plan to take, to evaluate  the currency reader program\u2019s effectiveness. For example, they solicited  feedback from the organizations for visually impaired and their members  and established a toll-free phone number for people to call with questions  or concerns about the program or address issues or problems with  devices. While these efforts are useful, they are incomplete because they  do not provide BEP information on other aspects of the currency reader  program. For example, BEP does not plan to evaluate how well the  program provides visually impaired persons with a means to  independently denominate currency. Further, BEP does not plan to  evaluate program costs or time frames, even though BEP anticipates  spending tens of millions of dollars for many years. According to BEP  officials, BEP has been focused on implementing the program instead of  evaluating it. GAO\u2019s prior work on federal agencies that have used  program evaluation for decision making has shown that program  evaluation can allow agencies to understand whether a program is  addressing the problem it is intended to and assess the value or  effectiveness of the program. The results of an evaluation can be used  to clarify BEP and others\u2019 understanding of how the program does or  does not address a problem of interest and to assist BEP in making  changes to improve the design or management of an existing program.  Without such an evaluation, BEP cannot determine whether the currency  reader program is reaching users as intended and providing them with  appropriate access to currency.", "In general, advocates for visually impaired persons support the currency  reader program because it can help some members of the visually  impaired community. However, some advocates pointed out that many  people who are visually impaired carry several assistive devices, such as  a cane or magnification devices. A currency reader requires a visually  impaired person to carry an additional device, which can be cumbersome.  For example, representatives from one organization stated that it would  be difficult for a person to hold a wallet, banknotes, and a currency reader  device to determine the denomination of a note. In addition, some  advocates told us that because of the time it takes to use a reader, the  device does not enable a visually impaired person to identify notes as  quickly and easily as a tactile feature. Representatives from two advocacy  organizations told us their members had mixed reactions to the currency  reader devices distributed at the annual conferences.

The PAC noted, however, that the core team used a different  time interval when testing the application methods. The PAC directed the  core team to update the requirements for the tactile feature and revise the  test methods used to ensure they address the updated requirements.

Because banknotes  already include some raised printing and have  overt and covert security features, the  introduction of a tactile feature could interfere  with the other features.  As a result, the  introduction of a tactile feature would require a  major currency redesign.", "BEP has faced difficulties developing a raised tactile feature, and it has  fallen behind its estimated schedule. Developing a durable-raised tactile  feature has proved challenging internationally and for BEP. A 2009 study  BEP commissioned showed that the tactility of features used by several  other countries diminishes over time as the notes circulate. BEP has not  developed a raised tactile feature before, so it had to create an internal  structure and process for testing and evaluating potential features.  Officials stated that BEP had to test some options for application methods  externally because it did not have the equipment. This lack of equipment  lengthened the time to make a recommendation on an application  method. As discussed previously, BEP did not make a recommendation  until 3 months after its milestone date of December 2013. According to  BEP, it now anticipates finalizing an application method, which is needed  to move forward on a tactile feature, by March 2015.", "BEP has had challenges in the past with the design and production of  new features, challenges that have led to significant changes to BEP\u2019s  processes. Specifically, in 2010 BEP began producing the new $100  note, which included, among other new features, a plastic 3-D security  ribbon woven into the paper. This composite of paper and plastic is unlike  any other denomination of U.S. currency. After full production began, BEP  officials found creases in some of the notes. The creasing occurred on a  sufficient number of notes that BEP suspended production 9 months after  it had started. Testing found that there were several contributing factors,  including the paper\u2019s moisture content, the amount of recycled material in  the paper, and the amount of time between paper manufacture and  printing. However, BEP did not discover these problems until over a year  after the problem occurred. The Treasury Inspector General determined  that BEP did not sufficiently validate its ability to produce the notes in  normal production, which may have identified technical problems earlier.  Instead, the creasing issue was not discovered until BEP had produced  1.4 billion notes, including an unknown quantity of defective notes. The  problem delayed the issuance of the $100 note by 2 years and was  resolved with assistance from the currency quality assurance program  (CQA). This program, which is funded by the Federal Reserve, seeks to  prevent the types of problems that arose with the $100 note through  formal development programs for note design, which include interagency  reviews. The development of the tactile feature is one of the pilot projects  under the CQA program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "BEP and Federal Reserve Officials Have Discussed Federal Reserve Concerns about the Current Approach", "paragraphs": ["BEP has indicated that the Federal Reserve has raised concerns about  its current three-pronged approach to provide access to currency for  visually impaired persons. While the three-pronged approach has been  approved by the Secretary of the Treasury, who is on record as still  pursuing this approach, the court order does not require this or any other  specific approach. The Secretary has discretion over how to comply with  the court order and could modify the current approach. Senior BEP and  Federal Reserve officials stated, however, that Treasury and BEP would  need to consult the Department of Justice to determine whether any  revised approach would satisfy the requirements of the court order. ACB  would also retain the ability to challenge whether a modification continues  to comply with the court order.", "Senior BEP and Federal Reserve officials told us that they have  discussed the Federal Reserve\u2019s concerns about the potential cost impact  of a tactile feature and whether the extent of technological changes since  the 2008 court order could provide alternative options to its current  approach; however, they remain committed to providing access through  their three-pronged approach. Specifically, senior BEP and Federal  Reserve officials told us they have discussed whether high contrast  numerals, a currency reader program, and the EyeNote smartphone  app\u2014without including a raised tactile feature on currency\u2014could meet  the requirements of the 2008 court order. Federal Reserve officials  expressed concerns about the potential cost impact of a tactile feature on  those who handle large amounts of currency, including banks and ATM  manufacturers. They stated that meaningful access should be provided in  a way that meets the needs of visually impaired persons while being  mindful of cost. However, senior BEP and Federal Reserve officials also  stated that they are committed to providing meaningful access to  currency, and in June 2014, the BEP Director reiterated that the  development of a durable tactile feature is a priority for the agency.  Furthermore, senior BEP officials stated that BEP would need to take  multiple steps before it could consider altering the current approach. For  example, the officials said that BEP would have to fully implement its  currency reader device program to understand the efficacy of the  program. They also said that BEP would need to collect data on the  production requirements and costs of a raised tactile feature. BEP  officials clarified that while there was a discussion of the option to provide  access to currency without adding a tactile feature, no decision has been  made.", "Advocates for visually impaired persons have concerns about excluding a  tactile feature. Most advocates we spoke with told us that high-contrast  numerals, a currency reader, and a smart phone app are beneficial to  some, but these efforts are not as important as a tactile feature.  According to these advocates, a tactile feature is the most effective  method to allow a visually impaired person to denominate currency  independently and quickly. In July 2014, one advocacy organization  passed a resolution stating that a currency reader device program should  not be a replacement for a tactile feature."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The visually impaired community is diverse, and there is no single way to  ensure access to currency for all visually impaired persons. In recognition  of this diversity, BEP developed a three-pronged approach to make  currency accessible to visually impaired persons. In particular, BEP has  incorporated high-contrast, large numerals on some denominations of  notes, and plans to continue incorporating them in future redesigns; it has  launched the initial phase of its currency reader program; and it has been  developing a tactile feature to be incorporated in the next family of  redesigned notes. In addition, BEP has created a free currency reader  smartphone app, which is currently available.", "While these are positive steps, there is no date set for the introduction of  a tactile feature, and it will be at least several years until there is a tactile  feature on U.S. currency. Even when a tactile feature is introduced, notes  with a tactile feature will co-circulate with notes that do not have a tactile  feature. As a result, U.S. currency without a tactile feature will be in  circulation for many years. Given this time frame, it is important for the  currency reader program to be an effective interim step to provide access  to currency for visually impaired persons.", "BEP has taken some initial steps to evaluate the effectiveness of the  currency reader program, a key component of its three-pronged  approach; however, these efforts do not provide BEP with complete  information about important parts of the currency reader program such as  how well the program provides visually impaired persons with a means to  independently denominate currency. Program evaluation is a critical  strategy that can allow agencies to understand whether a program is  addressing the intended problem, to assess the value or effectiveness of  the program, and to make changes to improve the design or management  of an existing program. Without a complete evaluation of the program,  BEP cannot determine whether the currency reader program is reaching  users as intended and providing them with appropriate access to  currency. The lack of knowledge means that BEP may not be in the best  position to make any necessary adjustments in the deployment of the  next 2 phases of a program that will be needed for many years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To determine the extent to which the currency reader program provides  assistance to visually impaired persons while a tactile feature is being  developed and integrated into the next currency redesign, we recommend  that the Director of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing take the  following action:", "Evaluate the currency reader program to include facets such as how  well the program provides visually impaired persons with a means to  independently denominate currency."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to BEP, the Federal Reserve, and the  Secret Service.
