We were unable to determine the reliability of the data provided. However, we used these data for the limited purpose of estimating that between 72,000 and 171,000 civilians may have worked for the U.S. government in Vietnam between 1964 and 1974. Our ability to provide more accurate information on the size of this workforce was limited because most agency records maintained during this period were not computerized, and because so much time has elapsed that many paper records have been destroyed and many agency personnel knowledgeable of the period are no longer working at these agencies. For the 32 Agent Orange-related claims identified (12 from federal civilians and 20 from contract employees), we found that these claimants faced many difficulties and delays because of a lack of readily available information on how to file a claim, their Vietnam era employers, and their exposure to Agent Orange, as well as processing delays caused by employers, insurance carriers, and Labor. Both Labor and private insurance carriers had difficulty identifying the number of claims they had received, largely because they do not assign a unique code to Agent Orange claims that would enable easy identification. Most of the claims we identified were filed in the past 10 years, and most have been denied. Denials of the claims stemmed, in part, from the fact that under the laws governing these claims, claimants must demonstrate a causal link between their exposure to Agent Orange and their medical conditions, which is difficult to prove so many years later. If Congress chooses to address this issue, several legislative options could be considered to attempt to improve access to compensation for civilians who were exposed to Agent Orange and developed medical conditions as a result, although they could have significant cost and policy implications. Congress could amend current law authorizing benefits for veterans to cover certain civilians or set up a separate program to cover them. Another option is for Congress to amend the GI Bill Improvement Act of 1977, which allows DOD to retroactively grant military status and authorize full VA benefits to certain civilian groups that support the military during armed conflicts. However, it is difficult to assess the potential costs of these options because of the limited data available on the number of civilians and their claims for compensation. Despite the difficulty of assessing the potential costs, before any of these options are pursued, their fiscal impact and the precedent-setting implications for individuals involved in other wars and conflicts since the Vietnam era should be carefully considered."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["During the Vietnam War, U.S. civilians, along with military personnel, were  in the country when Agent Orange, an herbicide containing dioxin, was  used as a defoliant. Civilians\u2014both federal and contract employees\u2014 performed a variety of jobs in support of the military, including helicopter  maintenance, road building, and cargo handling. After many years of  controversy, in 1991 Congress passed the Agent Orange Act to provide  military veterans who developed medical conditions related to dioxin  exposure in Vietnam with easier access to compensation, such as  payments for medical expenses. The act associates dioxin exposure with  latent illnesses, including several forms of cancer. The act also includes  several presumptions, including the presumed exposure to Agent Orange  of any military service member who was in Vietnam and developed a  dioxin-related disease. While civilians who worked for the U.S.  government in Vietnam are not covered under the Agent Orange Act,  workers\u2019 compensation programs are available to restore lost wages and  pay medical expenses of those who are disabled by an occupational  illness. Federal employees file claims for workers\u2019 compensation with  their employing agency, which refers the claims to the Department of  Labor (Labor) under the Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation Act (FECA).  Workers\u2019 compensation coverage for employees who work under contract  to the U. S. government outside the United States is provided under the  Defense Base Act (DBA), which extends the Longshore and Harbor  Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. These individuals file claims through their  employers with the employers\u2019 insurance carriers.", "Concerned about difficulties civilian employees have had in obtaining  workers\u2019 compensation benefits for diseases that may be related to their  exposure to Agent Orange in Vietnam, you asked us to determine (1) what  is known about the number of civilians who served in Vietnam, both those  employed directly by the U.S. government and those employed by  companies that contracted with the government; (2) what is known about  the number, processing, and disposition of claims filed by these civilians;  and (3) what options are available to Congress if it chooses to improve  access to workers\u2019 compensation and benefits for civilians exposed to  Agent Orange in Vietnam who developed illnesses as a result of their  exposure, and what are their cost implications?", "To determine the number of civilian employees working in Vietnam during  the war, we relied on interviews with and reports from the Departments of  Defense (DOD), State, Agriculture, and Treasury as well as the Central  Intelligence Agency (CIA), the Census Bureau, and the National Archives.  To determine the number and disposition of workers\u2019 compensation  claims filed by federal employees, we reviewed the policies and  procedures of Labor\u2019s Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs  (OWCP), interviewed agency officials and claims examiners, and reviewed  claim files. For claims filed by contract employees, we contacted  employers and the insurance carriers that provided a majority of the  workers\u2019 compensation coverage during the Vietnam War to obtain  information on the number of claims filed and the disposition of these  claims. We also interviewed Labor officials and examined files for claims  filed by contract employees that were referred to Labor after being denied  by the insurance carriers. To identify options for improving access to  workers\u2019 compensation and other benefits for civilian employees, we  reviewed relevant laws and policies and discussed possible options and  estimates of the potential costs with Labor and Department of Veterans  Affairs (VA) officials. We conducted our work in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards between June 2004 and  March 2005."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Agent Orange is one of several herbicides sprayed by the U.S. government  in Vietnam in the 1960s and 1970s as a defoliant. It contains  tetrachlorodibenzo-para-dioxin (dioxin), a chemical that the  Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupational Safety and Health  Administration have classified as highly toxic and carcinogenic. DOD  sprayed an estimated 11 million gallons of Agent Orange in Vietnam during  the war. In the ensuing years, dioxin has been a focus of research and has  been associated with a number of latent illnesses, including cancer and  most recently diabetes, which have developed among people who have  been exposed to the chemical. The use of Agent Orange has also spawned  much litigation over the years, including suits against the manufacturers of  the product and against the United States.", "Until 1991, when Congress passed the Agent Orange Act, military veterans  who believed their illnesses were caused by dioxin exposure had limited  success in obtaining medical benefits and other compensation. Previously,  the VA had denied benefits to most veterans who claimed adverse health  effects from the herbicide because poor records made it difficult for many  of them to demonstrate where and when they had come into contact with  the chemical, and because VA had not accepted proof of a direct link  between certain illnesses and dioxin. The Agent Orange Act subsequently  authorized awards on the presumption that any veteran who served in  Vietnam and who develops certain diseases identified by the National  Academy of Sciences\u2019 Institute of Medicine (IOM) and accepted by VA had  been exposed to Agent Orange. The act also gave VA responsibility for  providing information to veterans about health conditions related to Agent  Orange exposure and assistance in preparing their claims.", "Over time, the body of research on the health effects of dioxin exposure  has grown, and in recent years, research organizations such as IOM have  learned more about positive associations between exposure and certain  medical conditions. Further, both the National Institutes of Health and the  Environmental Protection Agency consider dioxin a carcinogen on the  basis of studies showing associations between exposure and medical  conditions such as lung cancer. Under the Agent Orange Act, IOM is  required to review and analyze all medical research on dioxin exposure  every 2 years and advise VA on the degree to which it believes Agent  Orange is associated with certain health conditions. On the basis of this  research, VA has accepted a number of medical conditions associated with  Agent Orange exposure. Most of these conditions are types of cancers,  such as non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and soft-tissue sarcomas, or skin  disorders, such as chloracne. More recently, prostate cancer and diabetes  were added to the list after research showed a higher than expected rate  of these conditions among those exposed to dioxin. (See fig. 1.)", "Federal employees and employees who worked under contract to the U.S.  government in Vietnam are not covered by the Agent Orange Act. Rather,  federal employees who are injured or become ill as a result of their  employment, including those who worked in Vietnam, may file a claim  under FECA, a comprehensive workers\u2019 compensation law for federal  employees. To obtain benefits under FECA, claimants must show that   (1) they were employed by the U.S. government, (2) they were injured  (exposed) in the workplace, (3) they have filed a claim in a timely manner,  (4) they have a disabling medical condition, and (5) there is a causal link  between their medical condition and the injury or exposure. Unlike  veterans, federal employees who file claims under FECA based on Agent  Orange exposure must demonstrate that they were personally exposed to  Agent Orange while in Vietnam and that their medical conditions were  \u201cproximately caused\u201d by this exposure, (i.e., that there was a causal link  between the exposure and their condition). Labor has primary  responsibility for processing all FECA claims and has assigned the  processing of special types of claims, such as those for Agent Orange  exposure, to specific OWCP offices. Labor also processes all appeals from  claimants regarding claims that were denied. Claimants have three levels  of appeal: (1) reconsideration by an OWCP claims examiner, (2) a hearing  or review of the written record by OWCP\u2019s Branch of Hearings and  Review, and (3) a review by the Employees\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board.  Either a request for reconsideration by a senior claims examiner not  involved in the initial decision or a hearing request is generally the first  level of appeal, followed by an appeal to the Employees\u2019 Compensation  Appeals Board. A decision of the Employees\u2019 Compensation Appeals  Board is final\u2014claimants cannot appeal Labor\u2019s decisions in federal court.  However, if new evidence becomes available after the decision, the  claimant can request the claim be reopened for reconsideration and  further review by Employees\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board.", "Workers\u2019 compensation coverage for employees who work under contract  to the U. S. government outside the United States is provided by the  employing contractor under DBA. Under DBA, individuals who can show  that they were harmed and that working conditions could have caused this  harm are entitled to a presumption that their claims are work-related and  valid. Claimants must also establish that their claim was filed timely and  show proof of employment, exposure to Agent Orange, a disabling medical  condition, and that their condition arose naturally out of employment (i.e.,  that their condition was related to their employment in Vietnam). Under  DBA, Labor is required to license the insurance carriers that provide the  employers\u2019 workers\u2019 compensation coverage. To prevent employers and  insurance carriers from an undue financial burden for insuring employees  during a time of armed conflict, Congress enacted the War Hazards  Compensation Act, which allows insurance carriers to obtain  reimbursement from Labor when a claim is paid for an injury or death  caused by a \u201cwar-risk hazard.\u201d Contract employees who are injured file  workers\u2019 compensation claims directly with their employers and their  employers\u2019 private insurance carriers. The insurance carrier may either  accept or \u201ccontrovert\u201d (deny) the claim. Claimants may request that  OWCP review the insurance carrier\u2019s decision and may ask for a hearing  with one of Labor\u2019s administrative law judges. The administrative law  judge issues a decision and order awarding or denying benefits. Claimants  may appeal an administrative law judge\u2019s decision to Labor\u2019s Benefits  Review Board.

Although  Labor has a code for injuries caused by exposure to chemicals and toxins,  this code is used for many claims involving toxins other than dioxin and  therefore was not useful in identifying Agent Orange claims. In addition,  this code was not used for several of the Agent Orange claims identified.  Unable to locate claims using Labor\u2019s database, we asked the claims  examiners in OWCP assigned to review Agent Orange claims from federal  employees if they could recollect how many of these claims they had  processed. They identified 12 claims using information from e-mails,  personal notes, and personal recollections of information about the  claims. However, we were unable to confirm that they had identified all  Agent Orange claims from federal employees. Of the 12 claims identified,  most were filed in the past 10 years, although 2 were filed in 1988 and 1 in  1991.", "In addition, inaccurately coded claims and inconsistent coding procedures  prevented identification of Agent Orange claims. For example, for 9 of the  12 claims identified by the claims examiners, the \u201ccause of injury\u201d code  recorded in Labor\u2019s database was \u201c99\u2014cause unknown,\u201d a catch-all code  used to identify the type of injury when the cause of injury reported by the  claimant on the claim form is not clear. Other fields in the database, such  as the type of medical condition, were not useful in identifying Agent  Orange claims because such exposure could cause more than one type of  condition, and because most of the medical conditions associated with  Agent Orange exposure could also have other causes. One clerk who  codes the claims told us she was sometimes uncertain which codes should  be used for Agent Orange claims and that she received limited guidance on  how to code them. For example, two of the claims files showed that Labor  coded the same condition, diabetes, with two different nature of injury  codes, \u201ccardiovascular disease\u2014other\u201d for one, and \u201cblood disorder\u201d for  the second claim. In addition, the agency has no procedures for checking  for data entry errors, and our review of Agent Orange claims identified  errors. For example, one claim coded as \u201cexposure to chemicals and  toxins\u201d was actually a heart condition. One Agent Orange claim for breast  cancer was coded \u201csprain/strain of ligament, muscle, tendon, not back.\u201d  Claims examiners told us that although they can request that the clerks  who entered the codes go back and correct coding errors, there is little  incentive for them to request that errors be corrected because it does not  affect their ability to process claims."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Claims from Contract Employees", "paragraphs": ["Labor and representatives from insurance carriers had difficulty  identifying Agent Orange claims filed by contract employees under DBA  largely because they did not have a unique code to identify these claims.

Labor located 5 claims by\u2014upon  our request\u2014querying its database for claims where the date of injury was  during the Vietnam War (January 1, 1964, through December 31, 1975) and  the nature of the injury was an occupational disease, and then reviewing  the list of claims produced to identify claims they remembered as being  related to Agent Orange. In addition, Labor officials remembered the  names of 3 claimants that were not identified in their query of the  database.

Our review of the files showed that several claimants had little information  about the claims process because their first point of contact, their former  employer, was difficult to locate.", "Although claims processing for both federal and contract employees  begins with their former employer, the process differs thereafter. As  shown in figure 2, federal employees obtain the appropriate forms and  documentation from their former employers and file claims with those  agencies or departments, which then forward the claims to Labor for a  decision. As shown in figure 3, contract employees also obtain the  appropriate forms and documentation from their former employers but file  their claims with their employer\u2019s insurance carriers.", "Our review of the claims files showed that federal and contract employees  sometimes filed their claims incorrectly because they were unable to  locate their former employers in order to obtain information about the  filing process. Although the first source of information in filing workers\u2019  compensation claims is the employer, since the Vietnam War, some  employers have reorganized or are no longer in business. Of the claims we  reviewed, 6 claimants had difficulty locating their former employer. Even  federal employees can have difficulties locating their employer because of  the many government reorganizations over the 30 years since the end of  the Vietnam War. For example, one claimant who worked for DOD in  Vietnam had difficulty determining which office to send his claim to  because the workers\u2019 compensation office of his former employer, the U.S.  Army Audit Agency, had been renamed and relocated. He initially filed his  claim with his current DOD employer, the Defense Finance and  Accounting Service, which advised him to send the claim to the  Department of the Army\u2019s Personnel and Employee Services, the office  that now handles claims for former employees of the U.S. Army Audit  Agency.", "Our review of the claims files also showed that contract employees and  Labor had difficulty locating the responsible insurance carriers because of  industry mergers, changes in carriers over time, and lack of easily  accessible records. Some employers changed insurance carriers over time,  so their current carrier was not the one that had provided coverage during  the Vietnam War. Although Labor licensed the insurance carriers that  provided coverage for contract employees during the war, the agency does  not track information about the carriers in a format that is easily  researchable. Labor officials told us that they keep the information on the  licensed insurance carriers on handwritten 3 x 5 cards that are filed by  employer name in filing cabinets. Searching for a carrier is a time- consuming effort because there are hundreds of cards for multiple policies  covering various periods of time. In addition, Labor does not track  historical changes in the ownership of the insurance carriers over time,  and companies may have been acquired by other companies\u2014a common  practice in the insurance industry, according to Labor officials. For  example, an insurance company that provided coverage for contract  employees for 3 of the claims we reviewed was purchased by another  company, which could not locate claims for these individuals from the old  company\u2019s records. Labor had no information about the company being  purchased by another company and had difficulty locating the insurance  carrier liable for payment.", "Difficulties identifying insurance carriers can add up to extensive delays  for claimants. Of the 10 claims we reviewed from contract employees,   4 claimants had difficulty locating their insurance carrier. For example,  one contract employee\u2019s claim was delayed 13 months before the correct  carrier was identified. Initially, the claimant mistakenly sent his claim  directly to Labor instead of his employer and the employer\u2019s insurance  carrier. Once notified by Labor of the claim, the employer requested  Labor\u2019s assistance in locating the carrier. One of OWCP\u2019s district offices  searched its paper records (the 3 x 5 cards it retains on the carriers it  licenses) and identified the correct carrier. At the same time, however, the  employer asserted that another carrier was the responsible party. The  claim was filed with this carrier, who later denied the claim, asserting that  it was not the employer\u2019s carrier during the period when the claimant  worked for the employer. During the months that this carrier was deciding  the claim, another of OWCP\u2019s district offices, apparently unaware of the  other district office\u2019s efforts, identified yet a different carrier as the  responsible party. When presented with the claim, this carrier also denied  it because the carrier had not been the employer\u2019s carrier during that time.  Over a year since the claim was first filed, the employer correctly  identified the correct carrier. The claim was filed with the correct carrier  and was ultimately denied (see table 1).", "Employer and insurance carrier processing errors and difficulty locating  records further delayed employees\u2019 claims. For the claims we reviewed,  several employers had difficulty verifying the claimant\u2019s employment  because they were unable to locate personnel records for employees who  had worked in Vietnam. For example, one employer denied that the  claimant had been one of its employees, although the claimant provided  copies of pay stubs, employee identification documents, and several  letters of recommendation from the company. Eventually, Labor  interceded on behalf of the employee and insisted that the employer  recognize the claimant as an employee. Insurance carriers also had  difficulty determining if they had provided coverage to employers and  claimants because of difficulties locating old records. Even federal  employees can experience difficulty finding their employers and locating  records. For example, one federal employee\u2019s claim was delayed over   2 years while the Department of Agriculture determined that he was an  employee during the Vietnam War but was on detail to the Department of  State. In its reply to Labor regarding the delay, the Department of  Agriculture noted that it no longer had records for the period in question.  Another federal employee, who was unable to obtain relevant medical  records from his employer or the National Personnel Records Center,  eventually withdrew his claim stating \u201cat this time, I am under Hospice  care and have not the energy to fight you anymore.\u201d", "Once claims were submitted to Labor, both federal and contract  employees faced additional delays because of processing errors at Labor,  including claims being sent to the wrong office and information on the  claims forms being typed incorrectly. For example, for one claim from a  federal employee, Labor incorrectly processed the claimant\u2019s request for  reexamination of the written record by Labor\u2019s Branch of Hearings and  Review (typically, a claimant\u2019s second level of appeal), instead sending it  to the Employees\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board (a claimant\u2019s final level of  appeal). This error created confusion and delayed processing of the claim  for 11 months while the error was identified and the claim sent to the  correct location. For the same claim, Labor continued to send notices to  the claimant\u2019s former federal employer at the wrong address for over a  year, even though the post office returned these letters stamped  \u201cundeliverable\u201d and the employer notified Labor of the correct address."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Claims Filed under FECA Require Proof of a Causal Link, and to Date, Labor Has Denied All but One Claim", "paragraphs": ["Of the 12 claims filed by federal employees for medical conditions related  to Agent Orange exposure, Labor denied 11 of them for failure to meet at  least one of FECA\u2019s five requirements, and 1 claim was withdrawn by the  claimant.

Of those that were appealed, Labor upheld the denial of   4 claims, and a decision is still pending on 1 claim. All of the claims that  were appealed were initially denied because of the claimants\u2019 failure to  prove a causal link between exposure and their medical conditions. Three  of the 5 claimants requested reconsideration of their claims by a claims  examiner.

The third claim for which a reconsideration  was requested is still pending. Of the 2 remaining claims that were  appealed, one of the claimants requested an oral hearing; the denial was  upheld. The other claimant sought redress through both a written review  by the Branch of Hearings and Review and an appeal to the Employees\u2019  Compensation Appeals Board. The board upheld Labor\u2019s decision.", "Almost all of these claims from federal employees\u201410 of the 11 claims\u2014 were denied because the claimants failed to prove a causal link between  their medical conditions and exposure to dioxin. Under FECA, to prove  causation, claimants must provide \u201cmedical evidence establishing that the  employment factors identified by the claimant were the proximate cause  of the condition for which compensation is claimed, or, stated differently,  medical evidence establishing that \u2026 the diagnosed condition is causally  related to the employment factors identified by the claimant.\u201d To  determine whether a claimant has shown proximate cause, Labor\u2019s claims  examiners and hearings representatives told us that they examine the  medical research and the \u201crationalized medical opinions\u201d provided by the  claimants\u2019 doctors to demonstrate an explicit cause and effect relationship  between the medical conditions and alleged exposure. Claims examiners  and hearing representatives told us that the claimants\u2019 doctors may use  medical literature to support these rationalized opinions, but the doctors  must apply this research to the claimants\u2019 specific circumstances.", "Claimants, however, have faced three challenges to proving a causal link  between their medical conditions and their exposure to dioxin. First, some  of the claimants\u2019 doctors are not familiar with the link between dioxin  exposure and the development of some illnesses. In one case file we  reviewed, one of the claimant\u2019s doctors stated: \u201cI have very little training in  epidemiology and cannot tell you much about the coincidence of Agent  Orange exposure with the development of prostate cancer,\u201d and another  said he was \u201ccertainly unable to provide any kind of expert opinion\u201d on the  relationship between Agent Orange and the development of prostate  cancer.", "Second, according to Labor, some of the claimants\u2019 doctors relied on  general medical research to support their opinions without applying the  research to the individual claimant. For example, in one case, the  claimant\u2019s doctor stated that he had reviewed the research on Agent  Orange, relying primarily on the IOM biennial report that showed an  association between prostate cancer and exposure to dioxin to support his  opinion that the claimant\u2019s prostate cancer was related to his exposure to  Agent Orange. Labor denied the claim because the doctor failed to give his  opinion but rather inferred a connection by presenting an excerpt from an  article published by the National Academies Press. The decision letter  also stated that Labor has long established that causality cannot be  inferred and publications are of no evidentiary value, as they are not case  specific.", "The third challenge the claimants faced is ruling out other factors that  could have caused their medical conditions. For long-latency illnesses,  such as the cancers associated with dioxin exposure, it is difficult for the  claimants\u2019 doctors to definitively rule out other factors that could have  caused the medical condition during the intervening years between Agent  Orange exposure and the development of the medical condition. For  example, in one case that was denied by Labor, five different doctors\u2014 including one doctor to whom the claimant was referred by Labor\u2014 asserted an association between the claimant\u2019s medical condition and his  exposure to Agent Orange. The doctor to whom the claimant was referred  by Labor stated that \u201cit is reasonable to assume that his exposure to Agent  Orange and to other herbicides are the causative agent for his transitional  cell carcinoma .\u201d Another doctor provided his opinion  that the claimant\u2019s bladder cancer was a consequence of his exposure to  dioxin and other environmental toxins during his tenure in Vietnam. A  third doctor stated in his written opinion that \u201cchemical exposures in the  course and scope of his duties as a federal employee are the cause of his  bladder cancer.\u201d However, the claim was denied because Labor  determined that the claimant failed to submit medical evidence that  attributed his bladder cancer to his exposure to herbicides in Vietnam. The  decision letter stated that although one of the doctors provided a medical  opinion stating a cause and effect relationship between the claimant\u2019s  medical conditions and his federal employment, the doctor \u201ccannot state  with certainty that non-work related factors have no connection to the  claimed conditions. Specifically, he admits that cigarette smoking and  exposure to asbestos are also bladder carcinogens. Therefore, his opinion  is considered speculative and equivocal in nature, and has little probative  value.\u201d The claimant requested four different reconsiderations by OWCP\u2019s  claims examiners, and after his death, his widow requested a fifth  reconsideration; Labor\u2019s decision was upheld each time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Labor Identified Few Claims from Contract Employees, but Insurance Carriers Initially Denied Most of the Claims Identified", "paragraphs": ["Although Labor and the insurance carriers identified a total of 20 claims  from contractor employees, we were not able to include 10 of them in our  analysis of the disposition of the claims because Labor identified them too  late for us to include them.

Noting VA\u2019s presumption  that any veteran who served in Vietnam and developed certain medical  conditions associated with Agent Orange had been exposed, the claims  examiner stated that it would be difficult for Labor to take a contrary  position. This claim was also accepted for reimbursement under the War  Hazards Compensation Act.

For example, Congress passed the  Radiation Exposure Compensation Act in 1990 to provide payments to  individuals who contracted certain cancers and other serious diseases as a  result of their exposure to radiation released during nuclear weapons tests  or as a result of their employment in the uranium mining industry.

In 1977, Congress specifically recognized the service of that  group as active military duty and directed DOD to issue regulations under  which similarly situated groups could be recognized. In 1987, a federal  court determined that DOD had failed to clarify the factors and criteria  used in implementing this statute. As a result, DOD clarified the rules for  accepting groups and issued DOD Directive 1000.20. Under this directive, a  group must submit an application showing that it meets the criteria,  including the criterion that it provided service to the U.

As these are historical  reports, we were unable to assess the reliability of these data for several  reasons: Most records were not computerized in the 1960s or 1970s, most  paper records have either been destroyed or were not organized in a way  that would facilitate the identification of personnel, and most officials who  were knowledgeable about employees in Vietnam are no longer with the  agency.

On the basis of these assumptions, we estimated that these  four agencies employed about 24,000 workers in Vietnam during the war.", "Although DOD officials were unable to locate information on the number  of federal employees who had worked for the agency during the Vietnam  War, we located historical reports of civilian personnel strength by year at  DOD\u2019s Directorate for Information, Operations, and Reports and used  these data to develop estimates of the number of federal civilian  employees who worked for DOD in Vietnam. These data provide a count  of the number of employees for one point in time during the year.  However, DOD officials told us that civilians likely stayed in Vietnam for a  2-year rotation before returning to the United States, so totaling these  annual counts would overestimate the total number of employees. To  obtain an unduplicated count, we used the annual civilian personnel  strength data and assumed a 2-year rotation. For example, in 1964 DOD  had 44 federal employees in Vietnam, but in 1965 had 51 employees\u2014an  addition of 7 new employees. In 1966, DOD had a total of 444 federal  employees. However, assuming the 44 employees from 1964 had  completed their 2-year rotation and returned home, they would not be  included in this count. Therefore, the 444 is composed of the 7 employees  who arrived in 1965 and 437 new employees who arrived in 1966. Using  this methodology, we estimated that about 4,600 DOD employees were in  Vietnam during the war (see table 3). We obtained the personnel strength  data from published DOD reports but were unable to assess the reliability  of the data for several reasons: Most records were not computerized in the  1960s and 1970s, most paper records have either been destroyed or were  not organized in a way that would facilitate the identification of personnel,  and most officials who were knowledgeable about employees in Vietnam  are no longer with the agency.", "DOD was unable to provide information on the number of contract  employees it had working in Vietnam during the war.

DOD  officials told us that service contracts were the most likely type of contract  to be used to pay salaries to contract workers, as opposed to other types  of contracts that would have been used to purchase items such as  equipment and supplies. We were unable to assess the reliability of these  data for reasons similar to those noted for the data we obtained for federal  employees. In addition, the data are further limited because we were  unable to determine if the service contracts would have been for salaries  to U.S. citizens or foreign nationals and because 3 years of data (1964,  1965, and 1975) were not available.", "Using the limited data available, we divided these annual amounts by a  range of \u201cburdened labor rates\u201d to estimate the number of employees  represented by these contracts each year. DOD officials told us the  burdened labor rate\u2014-salary, subsistence expenses, company overhead,  profit, insurance, travel, and other costs that would have been included in  the total contract amount\u2014-could vary among contracts. However, a DOD  official with experience administering contracts advised us that doubling  an employee\u2019s annual salary would approximate this burdened labor rate.", "However, DOD was unable to provide us with information on the range of  salaries paid to contract employees in Vietnam.
