GAO reviewed the 10 FSA and SBA disaster assistance programs that become available following a natural disaster and that provide direct financial assistance or loans to these producers, interviewed agency officials and industry representatives, and reviewed agency documents and regulations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Farm Service Agency (FSA) and the Small Business Administration (SBA) have 10 disaster assistance programs that small agricultural producers and businesses that support agriculture can use to recover from natural disasters. These programs serve largely different populations but leave few gaps in the disaster assistance available to most small agricultural producers. Aquaculture and nursery producers could be eligible for six of these programs, but their participation is limited by awareness and eligibility issues.", "GAO identified three factors that may limit small aquaculture and nursery producers' participation in the 6 disaster assistance programs for which they could be eligible. In particular, the producers are often not aware of the programs, have other options for assistance, or do not qualify because they do not meet certain program requirements. Both FSA and SBA conduct outreach related to their disaster assistance programs, but neither agency has specifically targeted its efforts toward small aquaculture and nursery producers. As a result, eligible producers are missing opportunities to obtain assistance that could help them maintain a viable business after experiencing a natural disaster.", "FSA and SBA engaged in some informal efforts to collaborate in providing disaster assistance to small aquaculture and nursery producers. However, the efforts were limited because FSA field staff know little about SBA's disaster assistance programs, and SBA staff know little about the factors that affect whether an agricultural loan will be repaid. GAO has reported that agencies with complementary programs can enhance the value of these programs through interagency collaboration. Without more formal collaboration, small producers may not be consistently referred by one agency to the other, leading to fewer opportunities for these small producers to get assistance for which they otherwise might qualify."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that USDA and SBA target outreach to small aquaculture and nursery producers, for example, by building on existing outreach, and develop a strategy to formally collaborate on disaster assistance for such producers. USDA and SBA generally concurred with GAO's recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Farmers and other agricultural producers are exposed to natural  disasters, such as droughts, floods, hurricanes, and tornadoes. Small  agricultural producers, which the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)  describes as a diverse group that produces a range of food and fiber and  that can include family farms, commodity producers, aquaculture (such as  farmed fish and shellfish) producers, nursery producers (such as trees  and plants), and other farmers and ranchers. These producers are  particularly vulnerable to disasters because they tend to have less control  over their economic security than larger producers, and natural disasters  can exacerbate this economic insecurity. In the aftermath of such natural  disasters, federal disaster assistance programs can provide an important  safety net for these producers. However, after past natural disasters,  some small agricultural producers, particularly aquaculture and nursery  producers, reported challenges in obtaining this assistance. For example,  following the Gulf Coast hurricanes in 2005 and 2006 and other natural  disasters, some crawfish, oyster, and catfish producers whose operations  were severely damaged reported that they did not have the safety net that  they expected.", "Both USDA, through its Farm Service Agency (FSA), and the Small  Business Administration (SBA) are major sources of disaster assistance,  but there is little overlap in the populations served by the FSA and SBA  programs. Specifically, FSA provides financial assistance in the form of  cash payments and reimbursements, as well as loans to help agricultural  producers recover from damages sustained in natural disasters. It  provides this assistance for producers who have sustained crop and  livestock losses resulting from natural disasters through five supplemental  disaster assistance programs authorized under Title XV of the 2008 farm  bill, as well as three other programs.incurred as a result of a disaster that occurred on or before September  30, 2011, but payments are currently being made for disaster losses  incurred from January 1, 2008, through September 30, 2011. A new farm  bill was being debated as of August 2012, and the final bill may  reauthorize some of these programs and may include retroactive  assistance for damages resulting from natural disasters occurring after  September 30, 2011. In addition, while SBA disaster loans primarily serve  nonagricultural entities, SBA also has authority to and does provide loans  to help some small agricultural producers and businesses that support  agriculture recover from disasters. However, after past natural disasters,  some stakeholders, including certain industry groups and others, raised  concerns that some small agricultural producers, including aquaculture  and nursery producers, have been found ineligible for both agencies\u2019  disaster assistance programs. In addition, it is not clear whether FSA and  SBA are collaborating effectively to ensure that these producers are  served.", "These programs only cover losses  In this context, you asked us to examine the disaster assistance  programs available to small agricultural producers. In this report, our  objectives were to (1) examine FSA and SBA disaster assistance  programs and the coverage they provide small producers; (2) identify the  main factors, if any, that may limit small aquaculture and nursery  producers\u2019 participation in disaster assistance programs from FSA and  SBA; and (3) examine FSA and SBA efforts to collaborate in providing  disaster assistance to small aquaculture and nursery producers.", "To address these objectives, we reviewed the 10 FSA and SBA disaster  assistance programs we identified for agricultural producers and  businesses that support agriculture that become available following a  natural disaster and that provide direct financial assistance in cash  payments, reimbursements, or loans to agricultural producers and  businesses that support agriculture that have experienced natural  disasters. We use the term \u201cagricultural producers\u201d to refer to family  farms, commodity producers, aquaculture producers, nursery producers,  and other farmers and ranchers. Businesses that support agriculture  refers to businesses that provide support activities for agriculture that do  not lead to agricultural production. Examples of support activities include  such duties as cotton ginning, soil preparation, planting, and breeding  services for animals. Our primary focus was on small agricultural  producers as described by USDA. We included family farms and other  farmers and ranchers whose size makes them particularly vulnerable to  natural disasters and in turn to economic insecurity. We used available  FSA- or SBA-established agricultural producer size criteria for program  eligibility in our review. To determine the types of small agricultural  producers the 10 FSA and SBA programs cover, we reviewed agency  documents, authorizing statutes, and implementing regulations to obtain  information about each program, including eligibility requirements, and  interviewed FSA and SBA officials. When analyzing whether any gaps in  coverage exist, we analyzed major categories of agricultural producers  involved in the production of food and fiber, including commodities such  as wheat, feed grains, cotton, rice, oilseeds, and peanuts; specialty crops  such as fruits, vegetables, tree nuts, and nursery crops including  floriculture; livestock; and aquaculture. We believe that this analysis of  major categories allowed us to reasonably identify where any gaps in  coverage may be present. However, we recognize that we may not have  detected additional gaps in coverage that may exist. We focused our  second objective on the factors limiting small aquaculture and nursery  producers\u2019 participation in these disaster assistance programs because  aquaculture and nursery producers are covered by at least one of the  disaster assistance programs offered by both FSA and SBA. Other  agricultural producers are not covered by the SBA programs. To identify  any factors limiting small nursery and aquaculture producers\u2019 participation  in these disaster assistance programs, we reviewed the eligibility criteria  for the programs that pertain to them and interviewed FSA and SBA  officials. We assessed the agencies\u2019 outreach policies and practices  against our prior reports on reaching a program\u2019s intended recipients.", "We also interviewed state-level FSA officials and industry representatives  in seven selected states about the main factors that may limit participation  in disaster assistance programs from FSA and SBA. We selected these  states because the nursery and aquaculture industries have a significant  presence in them. In selecting them, we also considered the geographic  distribution of the states to ensure that a variety of places experiencing  different types of natural disasters was included. Because we selected a  nonprobability sample of states, the information we collected from them  cannot be generalized to all states; however, the information provides  useful examples of the factors that may limit participation in disaster  assistance programs from FSA and SBA in those states. The states we  selected were California, Florida, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, North  Carolina, and Washington. To determine how FSA and SBA collaborate  to provide disaster assistance to small nursery and aquaculture  producers, we reviewed FSA and SBA documents and interviewed  national- and state-level agency officials to obtain information about the  agencies\u2019 policies and practices for collaborating on disaster assistance.  We also examined the degree to which the agencies\u2019 collaborative efforts  reflected key practices we previously identified that can help enhance and  sustain collaboration among federal agencies. Appendix I provides more  information on our objectives, scope, and methodology.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2011 to  September 2012 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards.

Congress has historically supplemented these ongoing  programs in an ad hoc manner by providing one-time payments through  disaster assistance programs that compensate producers for disaster- related crop and livestock losses they sustained. The aquaculture and  nursery industries are two growing agricultural industries covered by  federal disaster assistance."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal Crop Insurance and Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Programs Provide a Basic Safety Net for Agricultural Producers", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Crop Insurance Program and the Noninsured Crop Disaster  Assistance Program (NAP) offer agricultural producers protection against  crop losses if they enroll in the programs prior to experiencing a loss.  Federal crop insurance, administered by USDA\u2019s Risk Management  Agency (RMA), protects participating farmers against financial losses  because of production risks\u2014droughts, floods, and other natural  disasters\u2014as well as other risks. Under the Federal Crop Insurance  Program, farmers can choose various levels and types of insurance  protection: they can insure against losses caused by poor crop yields,  declines in crop prices, or both, for each insurable crop they produce.  These crops include major crops\u2014such as corn, cotton, soybeans, and  wheat, which accounted for three-quarters of the acres enrolled in the  program in 2011\u2014as well as nursery crops and certain fruits and  vegetables. RMA is also conducting pilot aquaculture crop insurance  projects for clams and oysters. For crops for which federal crop insurance  is not available, farmers can obtain coverage through FSA\u2019s NAP, which  provides cash payments to producers when natural disasters are  responsible for low crop yields or loss of value or prevent planting from  occurring. NAP is limited by statute to include crops for which the  catastrophic risk protection level of crop insurance is not available and  that are grown for food and fiber, and other crops such as floriculture,  ornamental nursery, Christmas tree crops, turfgrass sod, and  aquaculture.", "Disaster declarations are required to trigger some federal disaster  assistance programs. For agricultural disaster assistance programs,  disaster declarations can be made by the President, the Secretary of  Agriculture, or the SBA Administrator. The Robert T. Stafford Disaster  Relief and Emergency Assistance Act authorizes the President to issue  major disaster or emergency declarations in response to catastrophes in  the United States that overwhelm state and local governments. Such  declarations result in the distribution of a wide range of federal aid to  individuals and families, certain nonprofit organizations, and public  agencies (see app. II). The Federal Emergency Management Agency  (FEMA), in the Department of Homeland Security, is responsible for  coordinating federal response and recovery efforts under presidential  disaster declarations. FEMA works with other federal, state, and local  agencies to assist individuals after major disasters, and volunteer  organizations, such as the American Red Cross, also participate in these  efforts.disaster recovery centers where individuals can meet with representatives  from federal agencies, including FSA and SBA; obtain information about  the recovery process; and register for federal disaster assistance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Disaster Assistance Programs That Become Available to Agricultural Producers and Businesses That Support Agriculture Following a Natural Disaster", "paragraphs": ["In addition to crop insurance and NAP, which are purchased before a  disaster, FSA provides eight disaster assistance programs that become  available to producers after a natural disaster.

A 2012 Congressional Research Service  report stated that, until recently and with a few exceptions, U.S.  aquaculture has been considered a minor industry. USDA\u2019s 2005  Census of Aquaculture reported that U.S. sales of aquaculture products  were approximately $1.1 billion. Aquaculture crops include fish for human  consumption, such as catfish, salmon, and trout; crustaceans such as  crawfish; mollusks such as oysters and clams; and ornamental fish and  baitfish. Fish for human consumption and baitfish are normally grown in  freshwater. Crawfish are grown in freshwater, and farm-raised oysters  and clams are grown in coastal areas of the United States.", "Nursery producers grow a variety of trees and plants, such as oak trees,  shrubs, and potted plants, with some producers growing hundreds of  varieties.

Third, some  producers applied but did not qualify because they did not meet certain  program requirements. Table 4 shows the six disaster assistance  programs\u2014four cash assistance and two loan programs\u2014that small  aquaculture and nursery producers could apply for.", "Many small aquaculture producers and some small nursery producers did  not apply for disaster assistance because they were not aware of FSA\u2019s  or SBA\u2019s programs, according to aquaculture and nursery industry  representatives and FSA and SBA officials we interviewed. According to  most state-level aquaculture industry representatives and, to a lesser  extent, nursery industry representatives, aquaculture and nursery  producers in their states were generally not aware of FSA\u2019s or SBA\u2019s  disaster assistance programs or that they could be eligible for financial  assistance through these programs. For example, a representative of a  state-level aquaculture association said its members were either not  aware they could be eligible for, or were misinformed about, FSA disaster  assistance programs and did not use SBA programs. Several FSA and  SBA officials told us that both small aquaculture and nursery producers  fall outside of their usual customer bases and may not be aware of their  disaster assistance programs. In general, these producers do not have a  past or current relationship with FSA or SBA. However, in two states  where aquaculture producers also grow other crops and participate in  other FSA programs, FSA officials said these producers were more likely  to become aware of FSA\u2019s disaster assistance programs. For example,  FSA officials in one large aquaculture state told us that some of the  state\u2019s small aquaculture producers are aware of FSA because they grow  other crops covered by FSA\u2019s agriculture support programs. In addition, a  catfish producer we spoke with had worked with FSA on other issues and  was familiar with FSA disaster assistance programs but was not aware of  SBA Economic Injury Disaster Loans. In contrast, a representative of a  state nursery industry association said that he had not considered going  to FSA for nursery-related matters, despite having experience working  with FSA on matters affecting other types of agricultural producers. He  also said that nursery producers in his state may not be aware of disaster  assistance programs and do not identify themselves as agricultural  producers, so do not think of FSA as a resource when a disaster occurs.", "Participation among small aquaculture and nursery producers was low in  certain FSA disaster assistance programs, according to FSA officials, and  few aquaculture producers applied for SBA\u2019s Economic Injury Disaster  Loan Program, according to SBA officials. For example, FSA officials we  interviewed in one state with aquaculture and nursery farms numbering in  the top 10 compared with other states, as of 2009 and 2007, respectively,  reported receiving only 1 aquaculture and 3 nursery applications out of a  total of nearly 2,500 applications for SURE between January 2011 and  June 2012. In addition, they reported receiving only 2 aquaculture and 2  nursery applications out of a total of nearly 2,750 for Emergency  Conservation Program assistance during 2011. FSA national-level loan  officials also said that they received few applications for Emergency  Loans from aquaculture and nursery producers. For example, FSA  officials from a state with large aquaculture and nursery industries  reported that they did not receive any Emergency Loan applications from  aquaculture producers and only 7 applications from nursery producers in  fiscal years 2010 through 2011. Similarly, SBA officials told us, as of July  2012, they had received only 3 Economic Injury Disaster Loan  applications from aquaculture producers since the Small Business Jobs  Act of 2010 extended eligibility to aquaculture producers.", "We have reported that reaching a program\u2019s intended recipients is an  important measure of program performance.", "Outreach is one approach  to increasing awareness of federal programs among intended recipients.  Both FSA and SBA conduct outreach related to their disaster assistance  programs, but their methods do not help to ensure that small aquaculture  and nursery producers are aware of their potential eligibility for the  programs. Therefore, aquaculture and nursery producers may be missing  opportunities to receive assistance that could help them maintain a viable  business after experiencing a natural disaster. Specifically, FSA\u2019s  outreach activities include notifying local media outlets; minority, civic,  and business organizations; and FSA\u2019s existing customers about FSA\u2019s  disaster assistance programs. In addition, FSA national-level officials told  us that the public may sign up for disaster assistance e-mail updates on  the FSA website. However, FSA national-level officials told us FSA\u2019s  outreach approach does not directly target aquaculture and nursery  industry organizations. In addition, aquaculture and nursery producers are  often not in FSA\u2019s customer database, so they would not receive FSA  newsletters that contain information about disaster assistance. For  example, FSA officials in a state with a large nursery industry said that  they do not conduct outreach to the nursery industry, although they reach  out to other agricultural producers. Therefore, aquaculture and nursery  producers may not see all information FSA releases. In addition, those  who receive disaster assistance information may not realize they could be  eligible for assistance from FSA because some do not identify as a part of  the agriculture industry.", "Similarly, SBA provides information to disaster victims; current SBA  customers; media outlets; Small Business Development Centers;  Chambers of Commerce; and federal, state, and local officials about SBA  disaster loans. SBA national-level officials told us they have not contacted  small aquaculture or nursery producers or their industry representatives  directly about SBA disaster loans. While SBA developed postdisaster  procedures that include contacting aquaculture industry associations,  officials told us that, as of July 2012, they had not contacted any  aquaculture industry associations. They told us there has been little  disaster activity affecting aquaculture producers since they became  eligible for SBA Economic Injury Disaster Loans, but that they would  follow these procedures for future disaster declarations. As a result,  aquaculture and nursery producers may not be aware they could be  eligible for SBA disaster assistance.", "FSA and SBA have indicated a willingness to help aquaculture and  nursery producers seek disaster assistance when asked. Several  representatives of state-level aquaculture and two nursery industry  associations said they have requested and received help from FSA field  offices on numerous occasions about disaster assistance eligibility and  payment issues. Of these, most noted they have a good relationship with  the agency. For example, one state\u2019s aquaculture association  representative noticed that his producers were not aware they could be  eligible for, or were misinformed about, FSA disaster assistance. He  requested FSA\u2019s help in educating producers about disaster assistance.  As a result, FSA may participate in the industry\u2019s annual conference to  increase producers\u2019 familiarity with FSA services. Similarly, SBA national- level officials told us they were interested in helping aquaculture  producers obtain access to SBA\u2019s Economic Injury Disaster Loans and  have taken steps to bring these producers to SBA. For example, SBA\u2019s  disaster loan announcements specify that aquaculture producers are  eligible for their Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Some Producers Do Not Apply for Disaster Assistance Because They Have Other Options", "paragraphs": ["Some small aquaculture and nursery producers may not apply for FSA or  SBA disaster assistance programs for which they could be eligible  because they have other options for assistance, including other federal  grant programs and other federal or private loans, according to FSA  officials and industry representatives. FSA national-level officials told us  that one reason they had received few applications for ELAP from  aquaculture producers to cover disaster-related feed losses was because  many aquaculture producers had received assistance for historically high  feed costs through FSA\u2019s Aquaculture Grant Program, which was active  in 2008 and 2009. Aquaculture producers who receive 2008 or 2009  Aquaculture Grant Program payments are not eligible for aquaculture  feed losses under ELAP for the same species for which the grant benefits  were received because producers cannot receive duplicate payments for  the same loss under multiple programs. FSA officials also noted that  SURE covers physical losses for the majority of aquaculture species,  while ELAP only covers physical losses of game fish and baitfish.  Therefore, FSA received few ELAP applications from aquaculture  producers. In addition, some small nursery producers in particular do not  apply for FSA Emergency Loans or SBA Economic Injury Disaster Loans  because they apply for other loans or prefer not to take out a loan,  according to most loan officials and several nursery representatives. For  example, some FSA officials said that some small nursery producers  choose to apply for FSA Operating Loans rather than Emergency Loans.  According to FSA national-level officials, Operating Loans may be more  attractive to these producers because their interest rates are currently  lower than Emergency Loans, and they do not require applicants to  document disaster losses. The Operating Loan interest rate has been  below the Emergency Loan interest rate since November 2008\u20141.25  percent as of July 2012 and 3.75 percent since January 1994,  respectively. However, as previously noted, USDA announced in July  2012 that the Emergency Loan rate would be reduced to 2.25 percent.  The Operating Loan rate is tied to the government\u2019s cost of borrowing,  and FSA officials told us it is historically low because of the economic  downturn. However, FSA officials noted that Emergency Loans remain an  important option for some producers who have exhausted their Operating  Loan statutory term limits by receiving an Operating Loan in 7 different  years or have reached the statutory loan size limit of $300,000 and need  additional funds. SBA officials said that some aquaculture producers\u2019  disaster losses may be covered sufficiently by insurance or they may  seek out grants rather than loans. In addition, two nursery industry  representatives said that small nursery producers affected by disasters  may take out private loans because they are familiar with their local  banks. Another nursery industry representative said that other small  nursery producers do not take out any loans because they do not want to  take on more debt."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Small Producers Do Not Meet Certain Requirements for Disaster Assistance", "paragraphs": ["Some small aquaculture and nursery producers did not receive disaster  assistance from FSA or SBA primarily because (1) their losses were less  than the required minimums, (2) they did not meet the crop insurance or  NAP coverage requirement, or (3) they did not meet loan eligibility  requirements. First, three programs available to aquaculture and nursery  producers\u2014SURE, TAP, and the Emergency Loan Program\u2014set  minimum loss requirements as a condition of receiving assistance. As a  result, some small aquaculture and nursery producers did not experience  the required levels of losses. Several FSA officials told us this was  primarily because they tend to have more control over their operating  conditions relative to other types of agricultural producers, which tends to  limit damage from a disaster. For example, FSA officials in a state with a  large aquaculture industry told us that catfish ponds tend to experience  little damage from flooding. In addition, FSA officials in another state  denied five of six SURE applications from nursery and aquaculture  producers last year because controlled operating conditions limited  disaster losses. Therefore, these applicants did not meet the SURE  requirement that they experience at least a 10 percent crop loss on at  least one crop of economic significance on their farm if they were located  in a declared disaster county or a county adjacent to a disaster county or,  at least a 50 percent loss of the normal production on their farms from a  natural disaster if they were not located in a declared disaster county or  contiguous county. Similarly, FSA national-level officials told us that small  nursery producers often do not qualify for TAP because their trees or  plants were damaged but not destroyed in a disaster. Only trees that are  destroyed or damaged such that it would be more cost-effective to  replace them are considered in determining whether the loss threshold is  met and, therefore, whether an applicant will receive a payment. As  previously mentioned, to qualify for TAP, a producer must have sustained  a loss in excess of 15 percent of the trees, bushes, or vines in an  individual stand\u2014a contiguous acreage of the same type of plant\u2014after  adjusting for normal mortality or damage.", "Furthermore, because aquaculture and nursery producers have more  control over their operating conditions compared with other types of  agricultural producers, FSA expects these producers to follow certain  management practices to decrease their risk of disaster losses. If they fail  to do so, FSA may deny a request for assistance. For example, according  to FSA officials in one state, they did not approve an application for SURE  from a tilapia producer because they determined that the producer could  have prevented the tilapia losses. That is, the tilapia died because the  water in their tank was too hot, and the producer could have controlled  the water temperature. Similarly, FSA disaster assistance programs  typically do not cover nursery losses from drought because irrigation is a  standard practice for nursery producers. FSA officials in a state with a  large nursery industry also told us that nursery producers can control the  location of their potted trees and plants. As such, producers could avoid  losses from a freeze by moving the pots indoors.", "Second, several representatives from state-level nursery industry  associations said that small nursery producers often did not receive  disaster assistance because they did not enroll in crop insurance. As  previously mentioned, enrolling in crop insurance or purchasing NAP are  generally prerequisites for several FSA disaster assistance programs.  FSA officials in some states in which we conducted interviews also said  that nursery producers often do not meet this requirement. FSA national- level officials told us that because crop insurance coverage is widely  available to nurseries, there are few instances when nurseries would use  NAP. National-level officials from USDA\u2019s RMA told us that nursery  producers may not enroll in crop insurance because they see little risk of  disaster losses because they operate under controlled conditions. In  addition, RMA officials told us that both aquaculture and nursery  producers continuously plant and harvest their crops, reducing their risk  of losing an entire year\u2019s crops to a single natural disaster. According to  one state\u2019s nursery industry representative, some producers do not  realize that crop insurance is a prerequisite for receiving disaster  assistance under several of the FSA programs. FSA national-level  officials said that because disaster assistance programs only recently  included crop insurance or NAP enrollment as a eligibility requirement,  many producers are just beginning to see the connection between having  crop insurance and obtaining disaster assistance. Small aquaculture  producers\u2019 participation in crop insurance and NAP tended to vary by  state, according to state aquaculture representatives.", "Third, some small aquaculture and nursery producers did not meet the  requirements of FSA\u2019s Emergency Loan or SBA\u2019s Economic Injury  Disaster Loan Programs. According to most FSA state-level loan officials,  small aquaculture and nursery producers did not receive assistance from  the Emergency Loan Program primarily because they could not  demonstrate an ability to repay the loan. The program requires that  applicants submit a farm operating plan as part of their loan application to  demonstrate their ability to pay back the loan according to a set schedule.  The farm operating plan includes applicants\u2019 projected cash flow budget  reflecting production, income, expenses, and loan repayment plan. FSA  reviews the farm operating plan along with other application documents. If  FSA officials determine the plan is not feasible, they will deny the loan  request. For example, an FSA loan official in one state with a large  nursery industry told us that the small nursery producer applicants who  were denied Emergency Loans were often in tenuous financial positions  prior to the disaster and, once the disaster hit, did not have the means to  repay a loan.", "Federal  barrier resource area. The third application was withdrawn by the  applicant before SBA began processing it."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FSA and SBA Efforts to Collaborate on Disaster Assistance to Small Aquaculture and Nursery Producers Are Limited", "paragraphs": ["FSA and SBA engaged in some efforts to collaborate in providing disaster  assistance to small aquaculture and nursery producers, but the efforts  were limited to referring producers from one agency to the other without  identifying the assistance that may be available to these producers.  Specifically, FSA officials told us that when they collaborate with SBA, it is  at the local level on a disaster-by-disaster basis or when a disaster event  is concentrated and losses are immediate. These collaborative efforts  generally are limited to presidentially declared disasters, where, both SBA  and FSA officials told us, the agencies have participated in multiagency  disaster recovery centers established by FEMA. According to SBA  officials and as provided by SBA\u2019s website, the agency also has taken  steps on its own to inform agricultural producers (including small  aquaculture and nursery producers) that FSA provides disaster  assistance. SBA posts some information on its website showing that FSA  administers and manages disaster assistance and loan programs through  a network of federal, state, and county offices and that producers eligible  for SBA assistance should also consider getting assistance from FSA.  SBA also mentions FSA and USDA in the disaster notices it publishes  following a Secretary of Agriculture-declared disaster. In addition,  according to SBA officials, SBA advises applicants orally and in writing to  check with FSA for assistance when they have been declined SBA  assistance because their affected businesses were primarily agricultural  and not covered by the statutes that extended eligibility to aquaculture  and nursery producers. However, SBA typically does not provide  producers information about the type of FSA disaster assistance.", "We identified one primary reason for FSA\u2019s and SBA\u2019s limited  collaboration. Both FSA national-level officials and state-level Emergency  Loan officials told us that FSA field staff know little about SBA\u2019s disaster  assistance programs, and SBA staff know little about what factors affect  whether an agricultural loan will be repaid. According to FSA national- level officials, the FSA Emergency Loan and SBA disaster loan programs  have little in common, but FSA\u2019s limited knowledge of SBA\u2019s programs  may reduce the abilities of both agencies to meet the needs of small  aquaculture and nursery producers affected by disasters. FSA national- level officials said that their loan officers at the state and county levels  may have some general knowledge of SBA\u2019s disaster assistance  programs, but that those loan officers may not know the programs in  enough detail to inform a producer about them. They also said that FSA  does not expect its county officials to be familiar with SBA\u2019s disaster  assistance programs. Consequently, the national-level FSA officials said  that any knowledge their loan officers might have about SBA\u2019s programs  is likely to occur in local FSA offices that know more about SBA. Similarly,  several state-level FSA loan officials we spoke with said that they were  aware that SBA had disaster assistance programs but were not  necessarily familiar with them. Also, FSA\u2019s national-level office has not  provided any guidance explaining SBA\u2019s programs to its staff. In contrast,  SBA national-level officials told us that they and their customer service  representatives were generally familiar with FSA\u2019s disaster assistance  programs; however, they also told us that they have a limited  understanding of the factors that might lead small aquaculture and  nursery producers to repay their loans, which could make it challenging to  serve them. SBA officials also told us that, historically, SBA has not  focused on providing disaster assistance to aquaculture and nursery  producers because SBA is prohibited by law from providing disaster loans  to other agricultural producers. Consequently, the officials told us, SBA  has not provided disaster assistance to many small aquaculture and  nursery producers. Similarly, the FSA officials said that they and SBA  understand the small aquaculture and nursery industries differently, giving  them little reason to collaboratively provide assistance. However, both  FSA and SBA provide assistance to aquaculture and nursery producers  that is complementary, but they have not established compatible policies,  procedures, and other means to coordinate their programs. In the  absence of such practices, collaboration between FSA and SBA has been  informal.", "GAO, National Security: Key Challenges and Solutions to Strengthen Interagency  Collaboration, GAO-10-822T (Washington, D.C.: June 9, 2010). work collaboratively by articulating their roles and responsibilities in  formal documents to facilitate decision making. Such formal documents  can include memoranda of understanding, interagency guidance, or  interagency planning documents, signed by senior officials in the  respective agencies. These documents can clarify which agencies will be  responsible for particular activities and how they will organize their joint  and individual efforts. As we reported in October 2005, agencies that  have complementary programs can enhance the value of these programs  through interagency collaboration.  Among the key practices we  identified were (1) defining and articulating a common federal outcome;  (2) establishing strategies that are mutually reinforcing or joint to help the  agencies align their activities, core processes, and resources to  accomplish their common outcome; (3) agreeing on roles and  responsibilities; (4) establishing compatible policies, procedures, and  other means to operate across agency boundaries; and (5) including  collaboration competencies in designing performance management  systems and set performance expectations for collaboration to reinforce  individual accountability for collaborative efforts. In the absence of such  practices, collaboration between FSA and SBA has been based on limited  information and not guided by any formal collaborative policy, guidance,  or process. FSA and SBA have not adopted formal or written memoranda  of understanding or interagency policies regarding their collaboration on  disaster assistance programs. Both FSA and SBA national-level officials  told us that they have no central guidance in place to facilitate  collaboration with SBA on implementing their assistance programs. The  SBA officials added that they did not see any need for written guidance  because, in their view, the FSA and SBA disaster assistance programs do  not overlap, and thus there are no \u201cgray\u201d areas that would require formal  collaboration.", "With limited information and no documented approach or policy to guide  their collaboration, FSA and SBA personnel have not consistently referred  applicants for disaster assistance to the other agency and, in turn, there  has been little opportunity for small aquaculture and nursery producers to  get assistance for which they may qualify. FSA national-level officials told  us that they have discussed SBA disaster assistance with FSA field staff  but have not provided written guidance on when or how its staff should  refer producers, including aquaculture and nursery producers, to SBA.", "Further, FSA officials from two states said that, while they had referred  large agricultural producers to SBA for other assistance, they had not  done so for disaster assistance. They also said that because of their  limited understanding of SBA\u2019s disaster assistance programs and little  contact with SBA, they were not clear about the circumstances under  which they should refer producers to SBA. Officials from four FSA state  offices also told us that such referrals are either few and decreasing or  not made in their states. Similarly, SBA national-level officials told us that  while their loan officers may advise applicants to check with FSA for  assistance, they do not routinely refer applicants to FSA. Consequently,  small aquaculture and nursery producers likely have had less of an  opportunity to get the disaster assistance for which they may qualify than  they would have if FSA and SBA consistently referred producers to the  other agency. In addition, several representatives of the aquaculture and  nursery industries told us that they were not sure whether or how FSA  and SBA coordinated their disaster programs, and a representative from  another nursery association was not aware of any nursery producers that  had been referred by either agency to the other. However, a  representative from another nursery association noted that SBA had  referred some producers to FSA, and the representative of another  nursery association recalled that FSA had referred producers to SBA.  Officials with one FSA state office told us that nursery producers who  sought assistance from FSA or SBA could get bounced back and forth  between the agencies while they determined whether the producers were  eligible for assistance. Without more formal collaboration, applicants for  disaster assistance may not be consistently referred by one agency to the  other, leading to fewer opportunities for these small producers to get  assistance for which they otherwise might qualify, and the value of these  disaster assistance programs is diminished for aquaculture and nursery  producers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["FSA\u2019s and SBA\u2019s 10 disaster assistance programs serve largely different  populations but can provide an important safety net to help small  agricultural producers recover from disasters. However, even though six  FSA and SBA disaster assistance programs are open to small  aquaculture and nursery producers, these producers are missing  opportunities to receive such assistance. Small aquaculture and nursery  producers are not using these programs as much as other agricultural  producers, in part, because of their unique operations, such as the  controlled growing environments that inherently mitigate disaster losses.  Furthermore, they are not fully aware of the opportunities that exist.  Because they do not apply for and receive assistance for which they  could be eligible, small aquaculture and nursery producers\u2019 disaster  losses have the potential to significantly affect their ability to maintain a  viable business. Both FSA and SBA conduct outreach related to their  disaster assistance programs, but their methods do not help to ensure  that small aquaculture and nursery producers are aware of their potential  eligibility for the programs. In addition, FSA and SBA engaged in some  efforts to collaborate in providing disaster assistance to such producers,  but the efforts were limited. Moreover, FSA\u2019s general lack of awareness  about SBA\u2019s disaster assistance programs and SBA\u2019s limited  understanding of the factors that might lead small aquaculture and  nursery producers to repay their loans reduce both agencies\u2019 abilities to  fully serve these producers. Without a more formal collaborative approach  between the agencies such as through a memorandum of understanding  and further education of staff about the other agency\u2019s disaster  assistance programs, applicants for disaster assistance may not be  consistently referred by one agency to the other, leading to fewer  opportunities for these small producers to get assistance for which they  otherwise might qualify."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help ensure that small aquaculture and nursery producers are aware  of the disaster assistance programs available to them, we recommend  that the Secretary of Agriculture and the Administrator of the Small  Business Administration direct FSA and SBA officials to take the following  two actions:", "Conduct targeted outreach to small aquaculture and nursery  producers, for example, by building on existing agency outreach  programs.", "Develop a strategy to better formalize collaboration through means  such as developing a memorandum of understanding on interagency  collaboration and educating staff about the other agency\u2019s disaster  assistance programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided the Secretary of Agriculture and the Administrator of the  Small Business Administration with a draft of this report for review and  comment.

We reviewed these 10  programs because they become available to agricultural producers and  businesses that support agriculture following a natural disaster and  provide direct financial assistance in the forms of cash payments and  reimbursements, as well as loans to agricultural producers and  businesses that support agriculture that have experienced losses due to  disasters. We use the term \u201cagricultural producers\u201d to refer to family  farms, commodity producers, aquaculture producers, nursery producers,  and other farmers and ranchers. Businesses that support agriculture  refers to businesses that provide support activities for agriculture that do  not lead to agricultural production. Examples of support activities include  such duties as cotton ginning, soil preparation, planting, and breeding  services for animals. Our primary focus was on small agricultural  producers. While there is no one definition that covers all small  agricultural producers, we included family farms and other farmers and  ranchers whose size makes them particularly vulnerable to disasters  because they tend to have less control over their economic security in  general, and disasters can exacerbate that insecurity. When FSA or SBA  established specific size criteria for program eligibility, we used those  criteria in our review. FSA administers 8 of the 10 programs, including the  5 disaster assistance programs that were authorized by Title XV of the  2008 farm bill, the Emergency Forest Restoration Program, the  Emergency Conservation Program, and the Emergency Loan Program. The programs authorized by Title XV of the 2008 farm bill are the  Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honeybees, and Farm-raised Fish  Program, the Livestock Forage Disaster Program, the Livestock  Indemnity Program, the Supplemental Revenue Assistance Payments  Program, and the Tree Assistance Program. SBA administers the  remaining two disaster assistance programs, including the Economic  Injury Disaster Loan and Physical Disaster Loan Programs. We also  reviewed documents about the USDA Risk Management Agency (RMA)  crop insurance program and FSA Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance  Program and interviewed RMA and FSA officials about how these  programs interact with the disaster assistance programs in our study.", "To determine the types of small agricultural producers the FSA and SBA  programs cover, we reviewed agency documents, authorizing statutes,  and implementing regulations to obtain information about each program,  including eligibility requirements, and interviewed FSA and SBA officials.  When analyzing whether gaps in coverage exist, we reviewed and  analyzed FSA technical program handbooks and SBA program  summaries and interviewed FSA and SBA officials. We analyzed major  categories of agricultural producers involved in the production of food and  fiber, including commodities, specialty crops, orchard and nursery  products, and livestock, including aquaculture producers. We believe that  this has enabled us to identify gaps in coverage, but we recognize that  there could be additional gaps that we did not detect in this analysis.", "We focused our second objective on the factors limiting small aquaculture  and nursery producers\u2019 participation in these disaster assistance  programs because aquaculture and nursery producers are covered by  both FSA and SBA disaster assistance programs. Other agricultural  producers are not covered by the SBA programs. We identified the  factors limiting small nursery and aquaculture producers\u2019 participation in  these disaster assistance programs by reviewing the eligibility criteria for  the programs that pertain to them and by interviewing FSA and SBA  officials about eligibility criteria and outreach policies and practices. We  also interviewed state-level FSA officials and industry representatives in  seven states about the factors that may limit small aquaculture and  nursery producers\u2019 participation in disaster assistance, including program  participation and outreach practices. We assessed the agencies\u2019 outreach  policies and practices against prior GAO reports on reaching a program\u2019s  intended recipients. The industry representatives we selected for  interviews were heads of aquaculture or nursery industry associations or  others who could represent the views of producers in their states. The  states we selected were California, Florida, Louisiana, Michigan,  Mississippi, North Carolina, and Washington. We selected these states  because they have a significant nursery industry or aquaculture industry  presence based on the number of nursery and aquaculture farms and  annual sales, as reported by the 2007 USDA Census of Agriculture. We  also considered the geographic distribution of the states to ensure that a  variety of places experiencing different types of natural disasters was  included. We did not conduct a nationwide study on this issue.", "To determine how FSA and SBA collaborate to provide disaster  assistance to small nursery and aquaculture producers, we reviewed  authorizing statutes and FSA and SBA documents and interviewed FSA  and SBA officials to obtain information about the agencies\u2019 policies and  practices for collaborating on disaster assistance.
