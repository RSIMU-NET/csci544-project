Since 2008, the U.S. government has helped Central America and Mexico respond to these threats and in 2010 established CARSI solely to assist Central America. CARSI's goals are to create safe streets, disrupt criminals and contraband, support capable governments, and increase state presence and cooperation among CARSI partners. GAO reported on CARSI funding in January 2013 and was asked to further review CARSI and related activities in Central America.", "This report (1) provides an updated assessment of U.S. agencies' funding and activities that support CARSI goals; (2) examines whether U.S. agencies took steps to consider partner country needs, absorptive capacities, and U.S. and non-U.S. investments when selecting CARSI activities; and (3) examines information on the extent to which U.S. agencies reported CARSI results and evaluated CARSI activities. GAO analyzed CARSI and complementary non-CARSI funding; reviewed documents on CARSI activities, partner country needs, and CARSI results; interviewed U.S. agency officials about CARSI and related activities; and observed CARSI activities in three countries."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Since fiscal year 2008, U.S. agencies allocated over $1.2 billion in funding for Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI) activities and non-CARSI funding that supports CARSI goals. As of June 1, 2013, the Department of State (State) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) obligated at least $463 million of the close to $495 million in allocated funding for CARSI activities, and disbursed at least $189 million to provide partner countries with equipment, technical assistance, and training to improve interdiction and disrupt criminal networks. Moreover, as of March 31, 2013, U.S. agencies estimated that they had allocated approximately $708 million in non-CARSI funding that supports CARSI goals, but data on disbursements were not readily available. U.S. agencies, including State, the Department of Defense (DOD), and the Department of Justice, use this funding to provide equipment, technical assistance, and training, as well as infrastructure and investigation assistance to partner countries. For example, DOD allocated $25 million in funding to help Guatemala establish an interagency border unit to combat drug trafficking.", "State and USAID took a variety of steps--using assessment reports, outreach meetings with host governments and other donors, and interagency meetings--to help identify and consider partner countries' needs, absorptive capacities, and related U.S. and non-U.S. investments when selecting CARSI activities. For example, State used an assessment report on crime scene investigation and forensic programs and capacities of six partner countries to inform decisions on selecting CARSI activities. In addition, USAID officials used assessment reports to help identify and consider partner country juvenile justice and community policing needs and absorptive capacities; these assessment reports included specific recommendations for designing and selecting juvenile justice and community policing projects in partner countries. Also, in one partner country, embassy officials used donor outreach meetings to identify another donor's significant investment in police intelligence in the partner country; the embassy consequently reduced funding for CARSI activities in that area.", "While U.S. agencies have reported on some CARSI results, they have not assessed progress in meeting interagency objectives for Central America. State and USAID have reported some CARSI results through various mechanisms at the initiative, country, and project levels. For example, one embassy reported that its CARSI-supported anti-gang education project had expanded nationwide and taught over 3,000 children over 3 years of the program. However, U.S. agencies have not assessed their performance using the metrics outlined in a 2012 interagency strategy for Central America that were designed to measure the results of CARSI and related non-CARSI activities. GAO recognizes that collecting performance data may be challenging and that the metrics could require some adjustments. Nevertheless, assessing progress toward achieving the strategy's objectives could help guide U.S. agencies' decisions about their activities and identify areas for improvement. In addition to ongoing assessments of progress, GAO has concluded in prior work that evaluations are important to obtain more in-depth information on programs' performance and context. USAID is conducting an evaluation of its CARSI crime prevention programming to be completed in 2014. State officials said that they are planning to conduct an evaluation of some of their CARSI activities beginning in fiscal year 2014."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that State and USAID work with other agencies to assess progress in achieving the objectives of the interagency strategy for Central America.

These groups have reportedly  been able to operate with virtual impunity and the situation threatens both  the stability and security of Central American countries, as well as the  national security of the United States, as drugs, violence, and crime  spread across borders. The U.S. government established the M\u00e9rida  Initiative in 2008 to help Mexico and Central American countries respond  to these threats. In 2010, the U.S. government established a new  initiative, solely for Central American countries, called the Central   CARSI funds U.S.  America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI).assistance activities in Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala,  Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama (hereafter referred to as \u201cpartner  countries\u201d).", "The Department of State (State) and the United States Agency for  International Development (USAID) both implement CARSI activities  using an integrated approach to support judicial reform, community  policing, and corrections efforts, as well as crime prevention, law  enforcement, and counternarcotics programs. Given the range of  challenges facing partner countries and limited U.S. resources, State and  USAID pursue a mix of activities in an effort to maximize results and best  achieve CARSI goals. U.S. agencies such as the Departments of  Defense (DOD), Homeland Security (DHS), Justice (DOJ), and the  Treasury (Treasury)\u2014along with State and USAID\u2014have also used non- CARSI funding to support complementary activities and programs in  Central America. In 2012, the National Security Staff approved an  interagency citizen security strategy for Central America designed to help  coordinate and focus the U.S. government\u2019s CARSI and complementary  non-CARSI activities in the region.", "You asked us to review several issues related to CARSI. In January  2013, we issued a report with information on the status of funding for  CARSI activities, including the amount that was disbursed to support  partner countries during fiscal years 2008 through 2011, and information  on amounts allocated, obligated, and disbursed by year of appropriation.  This report (1) provides an updated assessment of U.S. agencies\u2019 funding  and activities that support CARSI goals; (2) examines whether U.S.  agencies took steps to consider partner country needs, absorptive  capacities, and related U.S. and non-U.S. investments when selecting  activities to fund under CARSI; and (3) examines information on the  extent to which U.S. agencies reported CARSI results and evaluated  CARSI activities.", "To examine CARSI funding and activities, we collected data from State  and USAID on funds allocated, obligated, and disbursed for CARSI  activities from fiscal year 2008 through June 1, 2013, and reviewed  documentation on CARSI-funded activities. As agencies may use slightly  different funding terms, we provided them with definitions from GAO\u2019s A  Glossary of Terms Used in the Federal Budget Process and worked with  agencies to obtain data that met these definitions, to the extent possible.In providing technical comments on a draft of this report, State officials  reported an amount of almost $10.6 million in additional International  Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement (INCLE) funding that was  allocated for CARSI activities in fiscal year 2010 that had not been  previously reported to GAO. State officials also said that they could not  provide obligation or disbursement information related to this amount  because these INCLE funds are centrally managed and State\u2019s financial  systems do not allow them to track such funds by region or country.   According to State officials, that is why these funds were not previously  reported to GAO. We confirmed with State officials that the funds had  been applied to CARSI activities and documented the programs toward  which the funds had been applied. Although State officials were not able  to track the obligation or disbursement of these funds, we have included  this amount in the total allocated for CARSI activities. We made note of  this discrepancy in presenting these data in the report. To examine non- CARSI funding and activities that support CARSI goals, we collected data  and reviewed documentation on non-CARSI activities from State and  USAID, as well as DOD, DOJ, DHS, and Treasury, for fiscal year 2008  through the first half of fiscal year 2013. To assess the reliability of the  CARSI and non-CARSI data provided, we requested and reviewed  information from agency officials regarding the underlying financial data  systems and the checks, controls, and reviews used to generate the data  and ensure their accuracy and reliability. We found the data sufficiently  reliable for our purposes. At the time of reporting, the most recent data  available on funding for CARSI were as of June 1, 2013, and the most  recent non-CARSI funding data available were as of March 31, 2013.  However, we found no change in the total CARSI allocations between  March 31, 2013, and June 1, 2013. Thus, it is possible to compare CARSI  and non-CARSI funding allocations.", "To examine steps U.S. agencies used to help identify and consider key  factors when selecting activities to fund under CARSI, we reviewed  documentation from State and USAID, including U.S. agency  assessments of partner countries, as well as written statements provided  to us from embassies in partner countries and from State and USAID on  the steps they utilized. To examine the extent to which U.S. agencies  reported CARSI results and evaluated CARSI activities, we reviewed  State, USAID, and other agencies\u2019 documentation on CARSI activities  and the results of these activities. We also compared U.S. agencies\u2019  actions to assess and report their progress toward achieving the  objectives in the interagency strategy for Central America against key  considerations that we identified in 2012 for implementing interagency  collaboration mechanisms. In our previous work, we found that one key  feature in the successful implementation of such mechanisms is the  development of a system for monitoring and reporting on results. In  addition, we compared agencies\u2019 activities against leading practices GAO  identified in 1996 for performance management of federal programs.", "To support work on all three objectives, we conducted interviews with  State, USAID, DOD, DOJ (and its components), DHS (and its  components), and Treasury officials in Washington, D.C. In addition, we  visited three partner countries\u2014Belize, Guatemala, and Panama. We  selected these three countries as a sample considering the following  elements\u2014the scope of the citizen security problem; the amount of  funding for CARSI activities received from fiscal year 2008 to 2012; the  range of CARSI activities undertaken; the extent of non-CARSI U.S.  government activities that support CARSI objectives; and the extent of  host government or other donor citizen security efforts in these countries.  In these three countries, we met with U.S. agency officials as well as host  government, international organization, and other donor government  officials. We also visited CARSI and non-CARSI activity locations during  these visits.

Efforts to counter illicit trafficking in Colombia and Mexico created  an environment that became increasingly inhospitable to drug trafficking  organizations, forcing criminal groups to displace operations into Central  America where they could exploit institutional weaknesses. Recognizing  this situation, the United States has sought to develop collaborative  security partnerships with Central American countries. As part of this  effort, in 2010 the United States split off the Central America portion of  the M\u00e9rida Initiative and established a new initiative named CARSI.  According to State, CARSI is designed as a collaborative partnership  between the United States and Central American partner countries. Its  focus is on improving citizen security within the region, taking a broad  approach to the issues of security beyond traditional counternarcotics  activities. Figure 1 shows the CARSI partner countries in Central  America.", "According to State, CARSI\u2019s five primary goals are to disrupt the movement of criminals and contraband to, within, and  create safe streets for citizens in the region;  between the nations of Central America;  support the development of strong, capable, and accountable Central  American governments;  re-establish effective state presence and security in communities at  risk; and  foster enhanced levels of security coordination and cooperation  among nations in the region.", "Funding for CARSI activities has come from a combination of four U.S.  foreign assistance accounts\u2014the INCLE account; the Economic Support  Fund (ESF) account; the Nonproliferation, Anti-Terrorism, Demining, and  Related Programs (NADR) account; and the Foreign Military Financing  (FMF) account. General descriptions of how these accounts are used  globally are provided below.  the INCLE account is used to provide assistance to foreign countries  and international organizations to assist them in developing and  implementing policies and programs that maintain the rule of law and  strengthen institutional law enforcement and judicial capabilities,  including countering drug flows and combating transnational crime;  the ESF account is used to assist foreign countries in meeting their  political, economic, and security needs by funding a range of  activities, including those designed to counter terrorism and extremist  ideology, increase the role of the private sector in the economy,  develop effective legal systems, build transparent and accountable  governance, and empower citizens;  the NADR account is used to fund contributions to certain  organizations supporting nonproliferation, and provides assistance to  foreign countries for nonproliferation, demining, antiterrorism, export  control assistance, and other related activities; and  the FMF account is used to provide grants to foreign governments  and international organizations for the acquisition of U.S. defense  equipment, services, and training to enhance the capacity of foreign  security forces.", "State manages the INCLE, NADR, and FMF accounts, and shares  responsibility with USAID to manage and administer the ESF account.

Established in  2012, the strategy sets up CARSI and its five goals as the national policy  framework for all U.S. government citizen security efforts in Central  America and states that agencies\u2019 activities in the region should link to  one or more of the CARSI pillars. Agency officials noted that because the  goals of CARSI are broad, a wide array of activities can be seen as  supporting the goals, and agencies have sought to align their own  strategy documents with the interagency strategy and five pillars of  CARSI. Officials from some U.S. agencies, including DOD and the Drug  Enforcement Administration (DEA), noted that the CARSI goals reflect the  types of activities that their agencies were already undertaking in the  region. The largest shares of non-CARSI funds allocated are from State,  USAID, and DOD (see table 4).", "U.S. agencies reported using their non-CARSI funding to implement a  range of activities that supported CARSI goals, including providing  training, technical assistance, equipment, infrastructure, and investigation  and operational support to partner countries.

State identified 11 offices that  support complementary citizen security activities in Central America with  non-CARSI funds. For example, according to State officials, State\u2019s  Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations funded mediation and  community dialogue activities in Belize to reduce gang violence that  complemented a related CARSI-funded activity. State\u2019s Bureau of  Political-Military Affairs used non-CARSI FMF funding to provide boats to  Panama\u2019s Coast Guard to assist in conducting drug interdictions in  Panama\u2019s territorial waters. USAID used non-CARSI Development  Assistance funds to support a variety of activities in the rule of law and  human rights, good governance, political competition and conflict  resolution, and education areas. For example, USAID is using non-CARSI  Development Assistance funds in Guatemala to help strengthen its  security and justice sector institutions, according to USAID officials.", "In addition, DOD, DHS, and DOJ also use funding other than CARSI to  implement activities in Central America that support CARSI goals.

For example, Treasury has used non-CARSI funding to pay for the  salaries and other costs associated with posting its personnel in several  partner countries to serve as resident advisors. These advisors work with  the partner countries to improve their ability to detect and prevent money  laundering and have used funding for CARSI activities to implement  regional programs. In addition, the FBI\u2019s Criminal Investigations Division  has not directly funded non-CARSI activities in partner countries;  however, it has assigned personnel to Transnational Anti-Gang Units that  have been set up in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.

Similarly, State officials reported that they used  comprehensive assessment reports on the firearms regulations,  oversight, investigative, and forensic capabilities of Central American  governments produced by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and  Explosives to determine that firearms interdiction activities could assist in  reducing the trafficking of arms into the region.", "USAID officials also used assessment reports to help identify and  consider partner country needs and absorptive capacities when selecting  activities to fund under CARSI. For example, USAID officials reported that  they used assessment reports to help identify and consider partner  country juvenile justice and community policing needs and absorptive  capacities; these assessment reports included specific recommendations  for designing and selecting juvenile justice and community policing  projects in partner countries. According to USAID officials in Washington,  D.C., and at U.S. embassies, USAID staff used information from these  and other assessment reports to help select and design CARSI activities  in partner countries. In addition, both State and USAID officials used  country-specific CARSI assessment reports\u2014produced by embassy staff  in November 2009 and covering all seven partner countries\u2014to help  identify and consider partner country needs and absorptive capacities  when selecting activities to fund under CARSI. These country-specific  assessment reports included information on (1) the partner country\u2019s  security environment, (2) embassy and host government perspectives on  the effectiveness of activities implemented to date, (3) partner country  strengths and weaknesses and opportunities and threats, and (4) the  partner country\u2019s regional and bilateral security engagements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Outreach Meetings Used to Help Identify and Consider Partner Country Needs, Absorptive Capacities, and Non-U.S. Investments", "paragraphs": ["State and USAID officials also used outreach meetings with host  government officials to help identify and consider partner country needs,  absorptive capacities, and non-U.S. citizen security assistance  investments in partner countries when selecting activities to fund under  CARSI. Outreach meetings included both routine interactions between  U.S. agency and host government officials\u2014at the subject matter expert  level\u2014and broader, high-level meetings, typically at the ambassador and  head of host government level. At these meetings, topics such as the  status of current CARSI activities and the future of CARSI programming,  including potential future CARSI activities, can be discussed. For  example, embassy officials in one partner country reported that they held  an ambassador/head of host government-level meeting with a delegation  from the host government in June 2010. At this meeting, the U.S.  government and the host government agreed to pursue bilateral,  multiagency efforts to combat identified threats from transnational illicit  trafficking and criminal organizations. Following this high-level meeting,  embassy and host government officials established bilateral working  groups to identify and develop activities in the partner country in areas  such as border security, counternarcotics operations and strategy, gang  prevention and law enforcement, community development, asset seizure,  and investigation and prosecution. These bilateral working groups  provided input on selecting activities to fund under CARSI and are now  coordinating information-sharing efforts and progress updates on those  activities.", "State and USAID officials also used outreach meetings with other donor  governments and international organizations to help identify and consider  non-U.S. citizen security investments in partner countries when selecting  CARSI activities. For example, in one partner country, embassy officials  reported that they held numerous meetings with other donor  governments. Through these outreach meetings, embassy officials were  able to identify one donor government\u2019s investments in police intelligence  in the partner country and consequently reduced funding for CARSI  activities in that area. Also, through regular outreach meetings, embassy  officials in the same partner country reported that they were able to  identify another donor government\u2019s investments in ballistic imaging  systems in the partner country. Embassy officials subsequently redirected  funding for CARSI activities that would otherwise have been spent in that  area.", "State and USAID officials also used meetings with other donor  governments through the Group of Friends of Central America\u2019s Security  Experts Group to help identify and consider non-U.S. citizen security  assistance investments in partner countries when selecting activities to  fund under CARSI. For example, through Group of Friends and other  donor meetings, State reported that they worked with another donor  government to coordinate an anti-crime capacity-building activity for a  partner country by de-conflicting donor purchases and leveraging  investments between the U.S. and the other donor government. In  addition, both USAID and State reported that they utilized a donor  database on third-country and multilateral assistance hosted by the Inter- American Development Bank (IDB) to help identify and consider non-U.S.  investments. The database includes information on projects sponsored by  other donors and international organizations in partner countries, such as  when the project started, when it is scheduled to be completed, and the  total project cost.

For example, embassy  officials in one partner country reported that they used interagency  meetings to discuss the partner country\u2019s needs for a digital radio  communication network to connect the host government\u2019s police, military,  and related agencies and the ability of the partner country to absorb such  assistance. State and DOD officials used information from the  interagency meetings to help design and select a digital radio  communication project using both CARSI and non-CARSI funding.  According to agency officials, by involving DOD in the project selection  process, embassy officials leveraged DOD\u2019s contribution to help meet the  partner country\u2019s needs and help the partner country conduct joint  operations with the United States. In another partner country, embassy  officials reported that they used interagency meetings to identify and  consider partner country needs, absorptive capacities, and related U.S.  agency non-CARSI investments to support the host government\u2019s efforts  to regain control over a conflict-ridden portion of the country. According to  agency officials, through the interagency meetings, U.S. agencies  identified and considered these factors and coordinated the use of CARSI  and non-CARSI funding to support the host government\u2019s efforts.", "State and USAID officials also reported that they used high-level  interagency meetings, such as those of the Central America Interagency  Working Group (IAWG) in Washington, D.C., to help identify and consider  partner country needs and coordinate related U.S. agency non-CARSI  investments in partner countries when selecting activities to fund under  CARSI. The IAWG was launched in February 2012 and includes  representatives from State and USAID, as well as representatives from  other agencies engaged in citizen security efforts in Central America,  including DHS, DOD, DOJ, and Treasury. According to State, from March  2012 through April 2013, the IAWG and its associated subgroups held 21  meetings. Through interagency meetings, State officials were able identify  and consider non-CARSI proposed investments when selecting activities  to fund under CARSI; for example, according to State, officials identified  and considered non-CARSI proposed border management and migration  projects for the region. State officials coordinated the disbursement of  CARSI and non-CARSI funds to support the implementation of these  border management and migration projects, while avoiding duplication  among activities. In addition, through interagency meetings, agency  officials were able to review various CARSI and non-CARSI land border  security and interdiction activities and identified land border security  short-to-medium-term capacity deficits. Consequently, agency officials  are working to focus U.S. land interdiction security assistance on a limited  number of high-impact engagements designed to increase seizures of  contraband. By continuing to coordinate CARSI and non-CARSI  investments through these interagency meetings, State officials said they  will produce a more coordinated and integrated U.S. response to the  region, with the goal of increasing seizures of contraband and supporting  partner country border security initiatives."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "U.S. Agencies Reported on Some CARSI Results, but Not on Progress toward Interagency Objectives, and Efforts Are Under Way to Evaluate CARSI Activities", "paragraphs": ["Using various mechanisms, State and USAID have reported on some  CARSI results at the initiative, country, and project levels.

Initiative-level reporting addresses CARSI results across the different  CARSI accounts and the seven partner countries. Country-level reporting  describes CARSI results in a particular partner country. Project-level  reporting describes the results of individual CARSI projects.", "According to State and USAID officials, the primary source of  consolidated information on CARSI results at the initiative level\u2014across  accounts and countries\u2014is State\u2019s Bureau of Western Hemisphere  Affairs\u2019 (WHA) annual Performance Plan and Report. State and USAID  use the annual Performance Plan and Report to monitor the performance  of foreign assistance activities in the region. In its 2012 report, WHA  provides information on some CARSI-wide results using a number of  performance metrics that measure outputs against WHA\u2019s established  targets. For example, WHA uses metrics such as narcotics seizures and  the establishment of local crime prevention groups to measure CARSI  results. To produce the information on CARSI results in the report, WHA  aggregated data on activities funded through all CARSI accounts and in  all seven partner countries.", "We do not provide more detailed information on the CARSI results discussed in the  2012 Performance Plan and Report because the document is labeled \u201cSensitive But  Unclassified.\u201d specific metric, State did not establish a fiscal year 2012 target against  which to measure CARSI results. WHA noted that in its fiscal year 2012  report there are eight additional metrics that included combined results  information on CARSI and other initiatives in the Western Hemisphere,  but these metrics did not provide separate results information for CARSI- funded activities. For example, WHA reported that CARSI and other  initiatives in the region together exceeded their target for a metric related  to the training of foreign law enforcement officers by almost 75 percent in  fiscal year 2012.", "State and USAID also report on CARSI results at the country level.  According to State and USAID officials, monthly CARSI implementation  reports produced by the embassies in each partner country are one of the  key ways in which they monitor and report on CARSI results at the  country level. State and USAID officials stated that these implementation  reports are part of their ongoing effort to monitor the impact and  effectiveness of CARSI and related non-CARSI assistance. State requires  embassies to include in the reports a section discussing the impact of  CARSI and related activities. These impact sections do not provide  information on performance relative to established CARSI metrics or  specific goals, but instead consist of descriptions of the results of various  activities taking place in the partner countries over the course of the  month. For example, one embassy reported in May 2013 that the host  government used a body scanner purchased with CARSI funds to  successfully detect a man attempting to smuggle narcotics onto a plane  bound for the United States. A different embassy reported in April 2013  that a CARSI-supported anti-gang education and training program had  been successfully expanded nationwide and had taught over 3,000  children over 3 years of the program. The 55 monthly reports we  reviewed included a range of other results from CARSI-funded activities  that were identified by embassies, but we also found that some  embassies did not always link some of the reported results to specific  U.S. assistance activities. For example, a number of reports noted  seizures or arrests made by the host government, but the reports did not  provide any information on how CARSI or related U.S. non-CARSI  assistance had facilitated these efforts.", "State officials identified INL\u2019s annual end-use monitoring reports as a  second mechanism for monitoring and reporting on CARSI activities at  the country level, although these end-use monitoring reports are not  specific to CARSI. State officials said that these end-use monitoring  reports are used to monitor all INCLE-funded items that have been  provided to the partner country to ensure that items are accounted for and  used in accordance with the terms agreed to by the U.S. government and  the partner country. As part of the end-use monitoring reports, State  requires embassy officials to include a discussion of the impact of any  INCLE-funded equipment, infrastructure, training, or other services that  have been provided, including under CARSI. The reports from partner  countries for fiscal years 2009 through 2012 identified a number of  positive results from CARSI assistance. For example, the embassy in El  Salvador stated in its 2012 end-use monitoring report that trucks provided  to the national police had a significant impact on the number of cases  investigated and improved the national police\u2019s response capabilities.  However, the reports also identified some issues related to upkeep,  maintenance, and use of CARSI-funded equipment. For example, the  embassy in Guatemala reported in 2012 that 11 motorcycles provided to  the National Police became inoperable as a result of a lack of proper  maintenance and funding; State then covered the cost of refurbishing the  motorcycles.", "Finally, USAID officials noted that annual portfolio reviews conducted by  USAID missions in partner countries are an important tool for reporting  CARSI results at the country level. USAID first began requiring its  missions to conduct such reviews in November 2012. According to  USAID guidance, portfolio reviews should, among other things, examine  the mission\u2019s progress in achieving its objectives over the past year. The  portfolio reviews that we examined included varying levels of information  about CARSI results. For example, one review did not provide any results  information, but instead provided a general description of the types of  activities funded under the USAID mission\u2019s portfolio. However, in other  cases, the USAID missions did provide specific results information. For  example, one mission reported that one of its programs had provided  access to vocational training to improve job competitiveness for 1,763  young people either at risk of becoming gang members or trying to leave  gangs. In some cases, the portfolio reviews did not specify whether  certain results were from CARSI or related non-CARSI projects.", "State and USAID officials also stated that they perform certain monitoring  and reporting on CARSI results at the project level. State\u2019s INL conducts  quarterly desk reviews of INCLE-funded CARSI activities to track the  progress of projects over time. INL requires these quarterly desk reviews  to include a discussion of the project objectives, measure project results  against established performance metrics, and identify success stories.  For example, INL reported in the quarterly desk review for one CARSI  project that, as of the end of 2012, it had trained 259 host government  investigators, prosecutors, and judges on the use of forensic evidence in  court proceedings. In another quarterly desk review, INL reported that the  project implementer had successfully developed an improved case  management system to assist the Costa Rican Attorney General\u2019s Office  in conducting drug trafficking prosecutions. USAID also conducts  quarterly reporting on its CARSI projects. USAID\u2019s quarterly reports  include information on the project\u2019s accomplishments for the quarter and  progress that had been made relative to the project\u2019s established  performance metrics. For example, in a report for the second quarter of  fiscal year 2013, the implementer of USAID\u2019s crime prevention program in  Panama reported that it had met or exceeded its targets for 20 of the  project\u2019s 26 metrics, including its target for the number of municipalities  that had set up municipal crime prevention committees."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "U.S. Agencies Have Not Assessed and Reported Progress toward Objectives Outlined in the U.S. Interagency Strategy for Central America", "paragraphs": ["While State and USAID have reported on some CARSI results, U.S.  agencies have not assessed and reported on their results using the  performance metrics identified in the February 2012 interagency citizen  security strategy for Central America.

In the interagency strategy,  U.S. agencies outlined five metrics for measuring the performance of U.S.  government citizen security programming, including CARSI activities, in  achieving the strategy\u2019s objectives. For example, the strategy includes a  metric to reduce homicide rates each year from 2012 through 2017.", "According to State and USAID officials, the strategy and the metrics it  identifies were developed through an iterative, interagency process that  included other agencies such as DOD, DOJ, and DHS.

However, in our previous work we concluded that monitoring  activities do not take the place of program evaluations. As we previously  concluded, monitoring is ongoing in nature and measures agencies\u2019  progress in meeting established objectives, typically using performance  metrics. Evaluations are individual, systematic studies that typically  examine a broader range of information on program performance and its  context than is feasible to monitor on an ongoing basis. Thus, evaluations  allow for overall assessments of whether a program is working and what  adjustments need to be made to improve results.", "USAID officials stated that they will also conduct evaluations of other CARSI activities  that meet the criteria established in USAID\u2019s 2011 evaluation policy. USAID\u2019s evaluation  policy requires each USAID operating unit to evaluate all projects that equal or exceed the  average project size for that operating unit, at least once during the project\u2019s lifetime. preliminary results from El Salvador show that murder and robbery rates  have been reduced in communities receiving USAID assistance under the  program.", "USAID officials identified a range of ways that they expect the crime  prevention programming evaluation to assist them, once it is completed.  For example, they expect the evaluation to provide evidence of the extent  to which USAID\u2019s crime prevention program reduced crime victimization  and perceptions of insecurity in at-risk communities. USAID officials also  anticipated that they would be able to use the evaluation\u2019s findings as a  tool to encourage partner countries to make their own investments in  crime prevention activities.", "State officials noted that they are currently working on a scope of work for  an evaluation of CARSI activities. In 2012, State issued an evaluation  policy that requires bureaus to evaluate two to four programs, projects, or  activities every 2 years, starting in fiscal year 2012, with all \u201clarge\u201d  programs, projects, and activities required to be evaluated at least once in  their lifetime or every 5 years, whichever is less. The policy also  requires all State bureaus to complete a bureau evaluation plan and to  update it annually. According to State officials, given other priority areas,  INL did not select CARSI for evaluation in its first bureau evaluation plan,  covering fiscal years 2012 through 2014, although CARSI qualifies as a  large program for INL. Nevertheless, INL officials stated that they intend  to conduct an evaluation of their CARSI activities beginning in fiscal year  2014, as CARSI approaches its 5-year point. INL officials stated that they  are currently working on a scope of work for this evaluation, which will  cover CARSI programming across the partner countries. INL officials  stated that their intention is to issue a solicitation by the end of 2013 for a  contractor to conduct the CARSI evaluation. However, INL officials noted  that many decisions have not yet been made about the scope or  methodology for the evaluation and that funding has not yet been secured  for the evaluation. In regard to WHA, State officials noted that the bureau  manages only a small percentage of State\u2019s funding for CARSI activities.  Given the small percentage of CARSI funding WHA manages, State  officials said that WHA does not have any plans to conduct a separate  CARSI evaluation from the one INL intends to do.", "Our guidance on evaluation design indicates that State could increase the  value of any future evaluation it conducts by ensuring that it  systematically plans the evaluation. As we have previously concluded,  systematically planning for evaluations is important to (1) enhance the  quality, credibility, and usefulness of evaluations and (2) use time and   In our earlier work on evaluation design, we  resources effectively.recommended that agencies take five steps to effectively design an  evaluation, as shown in table 5.", "Evaluations of CARSI activities, such as the one that INL has stated it  intends to undertake, could provide State with important information to  help it manage and oversee CARSI. As State\u2019s evaluation policy notes,  evaluations are essential to documenting program impact and identifying  best practices and lessons learned. Among other things, an evaluation  could help State as it seeks to identify successful CARSI activities and  determine how best to replicate them in other locations.", "State officials noted that designing a CARSI evaluation will be challenging  because CARSI involves a diverse set of activities that are being  implemented in seven different countries. Thus, State officials stated that  one challenge they will face in evaluating CARSI is selecting a mix of  activities to evaluate that are sufficiently representative of their various  CARSI activities that conclusions can be drawn about the broader impact  of their CARSI efforts.

We obtained the data  from each bureau at State that administers those accounts: International  Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL), Western Hemisphere  Affairs (WHA), International Security and Nonproliferation,  Counterterrorism, and Political-Military Affairs. We also obtained data  from USAID, which also allocates and implements the ESF account. In  particular, State and USAID provided data on the status of allocations,  unobligated balances, unliquidated obligations, and disbursements for the  ESF account; State also provided these data for the INCLE and NADR  accounts. State\u2019s bureaus and USAID administer the accounts separately  and utilize their own data collection systems and budgeting terms.", "To address differences between their systems, we provided State and  USAID with the definitions from GAO\u2019s A Glossary of Terms Used in the  Federal Budget Process and requested that State and USAID provide the  relevant data according to those definitions. To the extent possible, we  worked with agencies to ensure that they provided data that met these  definitions. However, the Department of Defense budgets and tracks FMF  funds in a different way than the other foreign assistance accounts that  support CARSI. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) and  the Defense Financing and Accounting Service (DFAS) are responsible  for the financial systems that account for FMF funds, as well as tracking  the implementation and disbursement of those funds. DSCA\u2019s system can  only track FMF uncommitted and committed amounts, not unliquidated  obligations or disbursements. DFAS tracks disbursements using the  Defense Integrated Finance System; however, there is no direct link  between the DSCA and DFAS systems and the DFAS system does not  track funding for specific initiatives, such as CARSI. Therefore, State was  not able to provide data on unliquidated obligations or disbursements, but  it was able to provide us with data on CARSI FMF allocations and  commitments.", "In providing technical comments on a draft of this report, State officials  reported an amount of close to $10.6 million in additional INCLE funding  that was allocated for CARSI activities in fiscal year 2010 that had not  been previously reported to GAO. State officials also said that they could  not provide obligation or disbursement information related to this amount  because these INCLE funds are centrally managed and State\u2019s financial  systems do not allow them to track such funds by region or country.  According to State, that is why these funds were not previously reported  to GAO. We followed up with State officials to confirm that the funds had  been applied to CARSI activities and to document the programs toward  which the funds had been applied. Although State officials were not able  to provide information for the obligation or disbursement of these funds,  we have included this amount in the total allocated for CARSI activities.", "We made note of this discrepancy in presenting this data in the report.", "We also interviewed officials from each of State\u2019s bureaus and USAID on  their budgeting process and terms to determine the best method for  collecting comparable data across accounts.

Furthermore, to identify  equipment, training, and other related activities supported by funding for  CARSI activities, we reviewed program documentation and interviewed  relevant officials from State and USAID regarding the status of program  implementation and the types of equipment, training, and other activities  provided to partner countries to date. In addition, we visited three partner  countries\u2014Belize, Guatemala, and Panama. We selected these three  countries as a sample considering the following elements\u2014the scope of  the citizen security problem; the amount of funding for CARSI activities  received from fiscal years 2008 to 2012, the range of CARSI activities  undertaken, the extent of non-CARSI U.S. government activities that  support CARSI objectives, and the extent of host government or other  donor citizen security efforts in these countries. In these three countries,  we met with U.S. agency officials as well as host government,  international organization, and other donor government officials. We also  visited CARSI and non-CARSI activity locations during these visits.", "To determine how much non-CARSI assistance has been allocated for  partner countries that supported CARSI goals, we collected data from  State and USAID as well as DOD, the Department of Justice, the  Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of the Treasury  for fiscal year 2008 through the second quarter of fiscal year 2013. Data  on disbursements of non-CARSI funding were not readily available for  some agencies because of the complexity and challenges associated with  how these agencies track their disbursement data. In collecting allocation  data, we asked agencies to provide funding data only for activities that  they determined supported one or more of the five pillars of CARSI. In  addition, we asked agencies to provide only data on non-CARSI funding  that directly assisted partner countries, such as funding for training,  equipment, infrastructure, and operational or investigative support. To  avoid double-counting across agencies, we asked agencies to provide  data only on activities funded through their own appropriations. We  requested non-CARSI data from all the agencies in a standardized  format, but given differences in the agencies\u2019 missions, budget  processes, and data systems, there were variations in the responses we  received. We worked with the agencies to resolve these discrepancies.  For example, some agencies provided data on funding for the salaries of  U.S. government employees, or the operation of U.S. equipment, such as  aircraft. We determined that these types of funding did not constitute  direct assistance to the partner countries and did not include these  funding amounts in our totals. In addition, in certain cases, agencies  reported that they did not allocate non-CARSI funding to activities  supporting CARSI goals in advance, but that they disbursed resources to  programs that supported CARSI goals as needs arose. In these cases,  we worked with the agencies to determine whether or not the disbursed  amounts could be considered as equivalent to the allocation amounts  given the nature of how the agencies\u2019 programming was executed and  made adjustments accordingly.", "To assess the reliability of the non-CARSI data provided, we collected  information from agency officials regarding their methodology for  determining what non-CARSI funding to include as supporting CARSI  goals and the process they used for generating the data. We worked with  agencies to make adjustments to these methodologies if we identified  concerns. As part of this effort, we gathered information from the  agencies on potential risks of underestimates or overestimates of the  allocation amounts they reported and how we might mitigate any potential  overestimates. We then took steps to mitigate these issues to the extent  possible. For example, some agencies provided us with funding data for  regional programs that benefited both partner countries and non-CARSI  countries. In these cases, we worked with the agencies to determine if  there was an appropriate way of apportioning a percentage of the costs to  the partner countries versus the other non-CARSI beneficiary countries. If  possible, we adjusted the numbers accordingly; if adjustments were not  feasible, we did not include the funding amounts in our totals. As part of  our data reliability assessments, we also reviewed information on the  underlying data systems used to produce the data and the checks,  controls, and reviews the agencies perform to ensure the accuracy and  reliability of data in these systems. There are certain inherent limitations  in the data we collected because agencies were asked to make  determinations, using their own judgments, about what portions of their  non-CARSI funding supported CARSI goals. However, we believe that  the steps we have taken mitigate these limitations, to the extent possible.  Given this, we determined that, for the purposes of this report, the data  were sufficiently reliable to provide estimates of agencies\u2019 non-CARSI  funding that supported CARSI goals. To determine the types of activities  that this non-CARSI assistance funded, we reviewed documentation from  U.S. agencies and also conducted interviews with agency officials at  headquarters and in our three site-visit countries.", "To examine whether U.S. agencies took steps to consider partner country  needs, absorptive capacities, and related U.S. and non-U.S. investments  when selecting activities to fund under CARSI, we interviewed State and  USAID officials at headquarters and at the embassies in the three partner  countries we visited. In addition, we submitted specific written questions  to two bureaus at State and USAID at headquarters and received written  response documents on the steps State and USAID officials used to help  identify and consider these key factors when selecting activities for  funding under CARSI. We also worked with State officials at headquarters  to develop written questions for the embassies in all seven partner  countries on the steps they used to help identify and consider these key  factors when selecting CARSI activities. We received comprehensive  written response documents from the embassies in all partner countries  with information cleared at the Deputy Chief of Mission level. We  reviewed and analyzed the written response documents we received from  two bureaus at State and USAID at headquarters and from embassies in  all seven partner countries. Using these various data sources, we  identified specific steps that State and USAID officials used to consider  partner country needs, absorptive capacities, and investments when  selecting CARSI activities. We also reviewed additional available written  documentation on the steps State and USAID used to help identify and  consider key factors, such as various assessment reports produced by  State, USAID, and other agency officials; trip reports and status reports  produced by agency officials; summary agendas from interagency  meetings held at embassies and in headquarters; and documentation on  the management and coordination of CARSI activities. We did not assess  the extent or effectiveness of the steps that State and USAID took to  identify and consider partner country needs, absorptive capacities, or  U.S. and non-U.S. investments.", "To examine information on the extent to which U.S. agencies reported  CARSI results and evaluated CARSI activities, we interviewed State and  USAID officials at headquarters and U.S. officials at the embassies in the  three partner countries we visited. In addition, we submitted questions  and received written responses from State and USAID headquarters, as  well as from the embassies in all seven partner countries, which provided  additional information on agencies\u2019 results reporting and evaluation of  CARSI activities. Using this information, we identified the key  mechanisms State and USAID use for reporting CARSI results at the  program, country, and project level. At the initiative level, we reviewed the  WHA annual Performance Plan and Reports for fiscal years 2009 through  2012 and the interagency strategy for citizen security in Central America  and assessed the types of CARSI results identified in these documents.  At the country level, we analyzed a non-probability sample of 55 monthly  CARSI implementation reports produced by embassies in the partner  countries. We selected this sample to ensure that we obtained a mix of  old and recent reports from all 7 countries. This sample contained eight  reports from each of the seven partner countries, except for Nicaragua,  which provided seven reports, and included the three most recent reports  produced by each embassy as of May 2013, as well as reports from  earlier years going back to fiscal year 2009. At the country level, we also  reviewed completed INL annual End-Use Monitoring Reports from each  of the seven partner countries for fiscal years 2009 to 2012 and a USAID- selected sample of five portfolio reviews from USAID offices in partner  countries. Finally, we analyzed five INL Quarterly Desk Reviews and six  USAID project reports to determine the types of CARSI results identified  in project-level reporting. These reports were selected by State and  USAID respectively as examples of their project-level reporting.", "We also compared U.S. agencies\u2019 actions to assess and report their  progress toward achieving the objectives in the interagency strategy for  Central America against key considerations that we identified in 2012 for  implementing interagency collaboration mechanisms. work, we found that one key feature in the successful implementation of  such mechanisms is the development of a system for monitoring and  reporting on results. In addition, we compared agencies\u2019 activities against  leading practices we identified in 1996 for performance management of  federal programs.", "We developed this list of considerations through a review of relevant literature on  collaboration mechanisms, interviews with experts on collaboration, and a review of  findings from a number of our previous reports on collaboration in the federal government.
