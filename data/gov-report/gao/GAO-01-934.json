In school year 1999\u2013 2000, the total enrollment was 47,080 students in the 171 schools funded by BIA. BIA schools are located in 23 states; however, over 70 percent of the schools are in four states\u2014Arizona, New Mexico, North Dakota, and South Dakota (see fig. 1). The schools are located primarily in rural areas and small towns and serve Indian children living on or near reservations. Individual school enrollments range in size from 14 to over 1,000 students, but a little over half of the schools enroll fewer than 250 students; most are combined schools spanning both elementary and secondary grades. A unique feature of the BIA school system is that almost one-third of the schools have a residential component; that is, they board at least a portion of the students who attend the school. In total, about 17 percent of BIA students reside in school dormitories. Some students board because their homes are so far away or inaccessible that daily transportation is impractical. However, an increasing proportion of students reside in the dormitories for other reasons; for example, some students live in boarding schools to separate them from dysfunctional or severely impoverished home environments.", "Education programs and activities of BIA schools are administered by the BIA\u2019s Office of Indian Education Programs (OIEP); however, in general, the organization of BIA schools is highly decentralized. Each school is governed by its own independent school board, which has authority over functions such as hiring personnel, adopting budgets, and setting policy. Another important aspect of the BIA school system is the agency\u2019s support and encouragement of tribal control of school programs. In school year 1999\u20132000, 108 schools, or about two-thirds of all BIA-funded schools, were operated by tribes or tribal organizations under grants, contracts, or compacts with BIA; the remainder were operated by BIA.", "In fiscal year 2001, BIA received a total of $777.6 million to support the operations of its schools and address educational facility needs. This represented a substantial (30 percent) increase over fiscal year 2000 funding levels. Nearly all of the increase was for repair or replacement of school facilities; funding for school operations increased only moderately.Like many public schools, BIA schools also receive funding from Education programs, such as Title I and Safe and Drug Free Schools and Communities. Funds from these programs are provided to BIA and passed through to schools. Fiscal year 2000 funding from Education programs totaled $132 million. BIA schools also participate in the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) child nutrition programs, such as the National School Lunch and Breakfast programs, which provide free or reduced- price meals for children living in families earning below certain income levels."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Schools", "paragraphs": ["DOD operates schools for the children of military and civilian DOD personnel overseas and on certain military bases in the United States.

A little over two-thirds of DOD schools are located overseas, concentrated in several countries in Europe and in Japan, Korea, and Cuba (see figs. 2 and 3). About 74,280 students were enrolled in DOD overseas schools in school year 1999\u20132000.

The proportion of students who have special needs is much higher in BIA schools than DOD schools. For example, according to agency records, about 1 in every 5 BIA students is enrolled in special education, compared with 1 in every 12 DOD students; and nearly 60 percent of BIA students have limited English proficiency compared with just 6 percent of DOD students. Students in the two systems also differ in terms of their economic need. Eligibility for the USDA\u2019s free or reduced-price lunch programs is often used as an indicator of poverty. While data on the proportion of children eligible for free or reduced-price lunch were not complete for BIA schools, available data for 123 of the 171 schools showed that over 80 percent of students were eligible, compared with about one- third of students at DOD schools.", "Specific information on the education levels and employment status of parents of BIA and DOD students was not available, but other information suggests significant differences between the two. For example, unemployment on or near Indian reservations is very high\u2014over 40 percent in 1999. In contrast, students attending DOD schools are generally military dependents and, by virtue of that fact, have at least one parent who is employed. With respect to education, about one-third of Indian adults do not have high school diplomas, according to Census Bureau data for 1990; in contrast, nearly all DOD active military personnel have completed high school. Moreover, a number of factors can affect parental involvement in BIA schools, including long distances between home and school, language barriers, and parents\u2019 poor associations with schools due to past federal policies emphasizing the assimilation of Indian children. In comparison, military communities have a tradition of supporting military families, and this support extends to their schools. Parental involvement is highly emphasized in DOD schools, with some base commands providing release time to military personnel to volunteer in schools."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Need for BIA and DOD Schools", "paragraphs": ["At various times, the Congress has considered the question of whether there is a need for BIA and DOD schools in locations where public school systems are close by. Since 1794, when the first treaty providing for any form of Indian education was signed, the federal government has provided education services for Indian children, and has carried it out almost exclusively through the BIA. However, in the 20th century, the states began providing for Indian education and currently provide schooling for the majority of Indian elementary and secondary students. During the latter part of the 1970s, the Congress reviewed the need to construct certain BIA schools close to public schools to determine if BIA was properly ranking schools on its school construction list. Though Indian families can choose where to send their children to school, BIA\u2019s policy at that time was to have children attend nearby public schools with adequate facilities instead of building new BIA schools to serve these students. However, in 1988, the Congress decided that proximity to a public school could not be the primary reason for rejecting a BIA school construction project.", "The need for DOD domestic schools also has been reviewed a number of times, specifically to determine whether transferring schools to nearby public school districts is feasible. DOD domestic schools were established to provide education to military children in communities where the local schools were deemed unable to provide a suitable education. After 1950, schools were added to the system to allow military children to attend integrated schools in locations where local schools remained segregated. Since that time, however, more and more schools have been transferred to public school districts, in part because of the integration of public schools and Education\u2019s emphasis on state and local responsibility for the education of military children. Thus, while at one time there were about 100 installations with DOD-operated schools, now there are 14 located in the 50 states.

BIA students have greater access to computers and Internet connections than public school students generally, though a smaller proportion of BIA schools than public schools has technology support staff to maintain equipment and assist teachers in integrating technology into classrooms. BIA administrators report extensive facilities problems and agency records show a deferred maintenance and repair backlog approaching $1 billion. Estimated per-pupil expenditures vary widely among different types of BIA schools, such as boarding schools and day schools, and are higher than per-pupil expenditures at public schools. It is difficult to draw conclusions about differences in expenditure levels between BIA and public schools, in part because of cost factors that affect some BIA schools, such as higher proportions of students who have special needs, broader infrastructure responsibilities, longer distances to transport children, and the cost of residential programs in boarding schools."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Academic Performance of Many BIA Students is Below That of Public School Students", "paragraphs": ["In school year 1999\u20132000, BIA students scored far below public school students on state assessments in North Dakota, South Dakota, and Arizona\u2014three states with large numbers of BIA schools. As shown in table 1, the average national percentile rankings for BIA students on North Dakota\u2019s statewide assessment, for all grades and subject areas tested, ranged from the 25th to the 33rd percentiles in school year 1999\u20132000. (By definition, the national average on the norm-referenced tests used in North Dakota and South Dakota is the 50th percentile.) The corresponding averages for public school students in North Dakota ranged between the 64th and 71st percentiles. Similarly, in South Dakota, the average national percentile rankings for BIA students on South Dakota\u2019s statewide assessment were much lower than the averages for public school students in the state, both overall and for specific skill areas such as language arts, reading, and math. Finally, in Arizona, a smaller proportion of BIA students met state standards than public school students. In school year 1999\u20132000, in reading, writing, and math, at each grade level tested, the proportion of BIA students who met or exceeded the standards was far lower than the proportion of public school students. (See table 1.)", "For Arizona and North Dakota, data for public school students by ethnicity were available. These data indicate that Indian students in public schools in these two states score below state averages but higher than BIA students in those states.", "In addition to standardized testing, BIA schools assess students\u2019 proficiency in language arts and math using a combination of other measures including \u201cauthentic assessment.\u201d Authentic assessment involves evaluating student achievement based on a review of multiple items such as portfolios illustrating students\u2019 work, grades, and work samples as well as teacher observations. Many school districts and states have been incorporating aspects of authentic assessment into their student assessment programs. Authentic assessment often requires students to demonstrate problem-solving skills and is thought to reflect real-world situations. Some researchers consider authentic assessment more appropriate for minority students than standardized testing because standardized tests have been criticized as being culturally biased. In particular, because of the diversity of languages and cultures among Indian students, some educators have found these authentic assessment methods more useful. These assessments are reported annually by all BIA- funded schools. Using authentic assessment approaches, about half of BIA students have been assessed as proficient or advanced, in both math and language arts, each year over the last 3 years.", "Other measures often used as indicators of students\u2019 academic success include dropout rate, college admissions test scores, and the proportion of students planning to attend college. On these measures, BIA students perform less well than public school students. For example, in their annual reports, BIA high schools report dropout rates\u2014the proportion of high school students who leave school and do not enroll in another school during the year\u2014averaging about 10 percent. This is higher than the national average dropout rate (about 5 percent) and slightly higher than dropout rates for other ethnic minority groups. In addition, BIA students score significantly below national averages on college admission tests. As shown in table 2, BIA students who take the Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) and the American College Test (ACT)\u2014two widely used college entrance examinations\u2014score below students nationally in both verbal/English and math assessments. They also score below students from low-income families on these tests.  Finally, in our survey, BIA school officials estimated that about 28 percent of their graduates planned on enrolling in college after graduation, about evenly split between 4-year and 2-year colleges. Nationally, in 1999, a little less than two-thirds of high school graduates were enrolled in college the year after they completed high school\u2014about 40 percent in 4-year colleges and 24 percent in 2-year colleges. For students from low-income families, the percentage who were enrolled in college the year after they graduated was around 50 percent.", "While the academic achievement of BIA students is low relative to students nationally, to some extent the performance of BIA students may be associated with conditions that are beyond a school system\u2019s control. Higher student outcomes have been strongly associated with higher educational and income levels of parents. BIA students come from environments where family education levels are low and unemployment and poverty rates are high. For example, 1990 Census Bureau data show that one-third of Indians age 25 or older do not have high school diplomas compared with one-quarter of all adults nationally; and for Indians living on reservations or trust lands, the proportion of adults who are not high school graduates is over 45 percent. Indians living on or near reservations also experience high rates of unemployment. Data from BIA\u2019s Indian Labor Force Report show that 43 percent of the potential labor force living on or near reservations remained unemployed in 1999. Poverty rates are also high among Indian families, with 27 percent having incomes below the poverty level, compared with 10 percent of all families. Other data suggest that the proportion of families with incomes below the poverty level is even higher for those living on reservations and trust lands. Finally, the issue of alcohol and substance abuse is significant for Indian communities; the death rate due to alcoholism is about 7 times higher for Indians than for all races.  Parental substance abuse has been identified as an environmental risk factor associated with learning problems, learning disabilities, and developmental delays in children. In a previous Education survey, almost 60 percent of BIA teachers considered parental alcohol or drug abuse a serious problem in their schools, compared with about 13 percent of teachers in public schools with low Indian student enrollment.", "BIA officials noted that the agency has developed programs to begin to moderate the influences of economic and family conditions on students\u2019 academic performance.  These include early childhood and family literacy programs as well as a therapeutic residential model aimed at achieving positive changes in attitude, behavior, and the academic performance of students attending boarding schools.  In addition, in its Annual Performance Plan, BIA has established several goals that address student academic performance.  These goals concern student proficiency in language arts and math, student attendance, teacher proficiency in new assessments and technology, school accreditation, and number of degrees conferred on Indian students at tribally controlled community colleges and at BIA\u2019s two post-secondary schools."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Teacher Staffing at BIA Schools Is Comparable to That of Public Schools Despite Some Recruiting Difficulties", "paragraphs": ["According to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), one of the major elements that characterizes teacher quality is teacher preparation and qualifications. This refers to certification, education, and continuing learning. Results from our survey indicate that nearly all teachers in BIA schools were certified in school year 1999\u20132000. Typically, about 95 percent of teachers in BIA schools were fully certified in the subjects or grades they taught and another 3 percent had temporary or provisional certification. About 92 to 93 percent of public school teachers in general were fully certified in the subjects they taught. Teachers in BIA-operated schools were slightly more likely to be fully certified than teachers in tribally operated schools. In addition to certification, teachers are being encouraged to pursue advanced degrees in order to gain a more advanced understanding of their discipline. About one-fourth of teachers in BIA schools had advanced degrees, compared to about 46 percent of public school teachers generally. The proportion of teachers with advanced degrees in BIA-operated schools was about 33 percent, while in tribally operated schools it was about 21 percent.", "BIA teachers have access to various kinds of professional development and BIA schools support professional development in several ways. For example, 93 percent of the BIA schools that responded to our survey reported that the majority of their teachers received in-service training provided by the school during the 1999\u20132000 school year. Other types of training widely used included in-service training provided by the agency and workshops provided by professional associations, as shown in figure 5.", "BIA schools facilitate their teachers\u2019 professional development in a variety of ways. The following supports were each reported by nine out of ten survey respondents: permitting time off to participate in training, setting days aside for training, paying travel or per diem for training, and paying tuition or fees. Such training and supports for professional development are comparable to the situation for public school teachers generally, nearly all of whom report having some professional development in the previous year with similar kinds of support from their schools.", "While nearly all teachers at BIA schools were certified, officials at some schools we visited, particularly tribally operated schools, recounted some difficulties recruiting and retaining qualified staff. At one tribally operated school in Washington, the chief school administrator said it was difficult to attract teachers because the school could not compete with compensation packages offered by nearby urban districts. The 2000\u20132001 school year was the first year the school was able to pay teachers at the state salary scale, but the school offered limited retirement benefits. As a result, the administrator said the school tended to attract beginning teachers or retired teachers who had pensions from their public school careers. Other officials noted that the remote locations of some schools hinder recruiting. Many BIA schools are located in settings with few amenities to attract teachers and other staff. For example, at one school we visited in Arizona, the closest town offering major shopping and banking services was 96 miles away, and the principal said the community\u2019s isolation and lack of amenities contributed to teacher turnover. In many locations, basic housing is not even available for staff to purchase or rent, so BIA has constructed employee quarters for which staff pay rent.   About one-third of all BIA schools and 45 percent of tribally operated schools had teacher turnover rates of 25 percent or higher in school year 1999\u20132000; the average turnover rate was 18 percent. Nationwide, about 87 percent of full-time public school teachers remain at the same school from one year to the next, implying a turnover rate of about 13 percent.", "A teacher\u2019s ability to effect student learning may be influenced by the number of students in the classroom, and various studies have associated smaller class sizes with higher student achievement. Class sizes reported by BIA administrators are generally smaller than national averages, with tribally operated schools reporting smaller classes than BIA-operated schools. Nationally, in 1998 the average class size for general elementary classrooms was 23 students and in departmentalized settings (those in which a teacher\u2019s main assignment is in one particular subject area, such as English or social studies) it was 24 students. The median number of students per classroom reported by BIA-operated schools was about 20 to 22 in grades K through 8 and about 17 in grades 9 through 12. Tribally operated schools had about 17 to 18 students per classroom in grades K through 6 and about 16 students per classroom in grades 7 through 12. Our survey did not ask specifically about multiple grades in a classroom. However, some BIA schools are very small and have fewer full-time teachers than grade levels taught in the school. For example, there are five BIA schools with 51 or fewer students in grades ranging from K to 6 and K to 12. Four of these five schools have fewer full-time teachers than the number of grades in the school, suggesting that multiple grades are being taught in some classrooms."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Access to Computers and the Internet Reported by BIA Schools Is Greater Than Public Schools, but Technology Support Is More Limited", "paragraphs": ["BIA schools appear to be in step with schools around the country in making technology available as an integral tool for learning.

BIA administrators reported having about 1 instructional computer for every 3.5 students overall, although access levels varied somewhat from school to school, ranging from 1 computer for every student to 1 computer for every 18 students. In comparison, the national average for public schools is 1 computer for every 5 students, as reported by NCES for 2000. A major goal set by Education is that schools have 1 modern multimedia computer for every 5 students. We do not know about the quality or capacity of the computers in BIA or public schools, but 46 percent of the computers in BIA schools were reported to be 3 years old or older.", "In some respects BIA schools provide their students with greater access to the Internet than public schools. According to a BIA official, all 171 BIA schools are connected to the Internet. Nationally, nearly all public schools now have Internet access. However, BIA school officials reported that 1 computer with Internet access was available for every 4.3 students, a ratio appreciably better than the 1 to 7 ratio for public schools nationwide. Some policymakers have stressed the importance of not only connecting every school to the Internet but eventually connecting every classroom. A little over 80 percent of BIA instructional rooms have at least one computer with a connection to the Internet. This number is also slightly above the national average for public schools. However, as with some public schools, some BIA schools still use the lowest-speed connections for their primary connection to the Internet, and thus cannot access complex computer applications and resources. Table 3 summarizes the information on students\u2019 access to technology at BIA schools based on our survey and for public schools nationally.", "While computers and the Internet are generally available at BIA schools, a smaller proportion of the schools have paid (versus volunteer) technology support staff than public schools.  In a survey conducted by Education, nearly all (95 percent) of public schools reported having some paid staff, either full- or part-time, to support advanced telecommunications (for example, networked computers and computer hardware and software) in their school in 1999. In our survey, we asked whether schools had (1) staff who provided technical support or performed maintenance on computers and (2) staff who assisted teachers in using computer software or the Internet to instruct students. The results indicated that more than one- quarter of BIA schools did not have paid technical support and about one- third did not have paid staff to help teachers use computers for instruction in 2000. Evidence suggests that technology support of this kind has a positive impact on teacher use of technology in the classroom. According to an NCES report, research in general shows that public school teachers view the lack of technology support for integrating telecommunications into the classroom and the lack of technical assistance in schools to be obstacles to their effective use of technology. Our survey results show that these areas of support are not available in many BIA schools. One reason why technology staff is more limited in BIA schools, according to one BIA official, is that the high turnover rate for technology coordinators is a problem throughout the BIA school system. He indicated that these technology coordinators often receive training for the work and then leave the schools for higher-paying positions.", "BIA school administrators reported that their computers are used regularly for learning activities. Although there is evidence to suggest that the effective use of technology in the classroom can improve student learning, the research on what types of classroom activities are best served by technology applications is not conclusive. Nonetheless, studies on the uses of technology in schools tend to distinguish more basic uses of computers\u2014such as for drill and practice, which the research shows can be effective for learning\u2014from more pedagogically complex uses of computers\u2014such as using the Internet in small groups for class projects, where the research data are less extensive. In our survey, we asked school administrators to estimate the portion of their teachers who routinely engaged their students in the use of computers for certain activities. As shown in figure 6, many of the teachers at BIA schools regularly engage students in the use of computers for practice drills and for learning subject matter. Fewer BIA teachers are using them on a regular basis for student research or to develop student skills in problem solving.", "BIA schools appear to be making substantial investments in school technology. Administrators reported to us that in 1999\u20132000 they spent an average of $401 per student to support educational technology in their schools. In comparison, according to a national survey, public school districts planned to spend $113 per student on educational technology in the 2000\u20132001 school year. These expenditures covered all aspects of supporting educational technology, such as purchasing computer hardware and software, installing and upgrading local and wide area networks, paying for technical support and training for teachers, and paying for telecommunications access."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Extensive Problems With BIA School Facilities Reported", "paragraphs": ["Most of the BIA school administrators responding to our survey reported significant problems with the condition of their facilities.

The extent of the concerns they reported in the survey are reflected in BIA\u2019s backlog of maintenance and repair needs. Among the backlog of such needs, which was recently verified by an independent engineering firm, is more than $960 million in needed repairs for school facilities and dormitories. A contributing factor to the facility needs of BIA schools is their isolation. Many schools are located in remote areas where, in addition to maintaining school buildings and grounds, facilities managers must also maintain other components of the infrastructure such as water and sewer systems, electric utilities, and fire stations\u2014systems normally provided by local municipalities for most public schools.

She said that the mold was a health problem for children with certain allergies. In a South Dakota school, a teacher expressed concerns about aging asbestos floor tiles in her classroom that had to be partially removed due to cracking, leaving other tiles exposed. Asbestos floor tiles, which are present in more than 90 of BIA\u2019s schools, can be a threat to the health of students and staff if the asbestos fibers are disturbed, released into the air, and inhaled.", "In addition to questions about the condition of buildings and aspects of their environment, our survey asked administrators about the sufficiency of work spaces for students and teachers, such as classrooms, libraries, labs, and eating areas. We also asked whether some of these work spaces were adequately equipped\u2014for example, whether libraries had sufficient numbers of books or whether buildings were adequately wired to support technology needs. As shown in figure 7, many BIA school administrators responding to our survey reported that various work spaces and equipment were insufficient at their school. For example, administrators at 55 percent of responding schools reported that the number of classrooms was insufficient and over 60 percent reported the space in their libraries was a problem. Insufficient classroom space was noted by officials at some schools we visited. For example, at a large K\u201312 school in South Dakota, officials said that the number of students in the high school building exceeded capacity. According to school officials, the building was intended to house 250 students, but they currently had about 400 students enrolled. In an Arizona school, because there was no other space, the school held special education classes in an area previously used for storage and teachers used partitions to separate the different groups of students.", "A large proportion of BIA schools (60 percent) also reported that the capacity of the building\u2019s telephone and electrical wiring systems to support computers, the Internet, and telephones was inadequate for their buildings. For BIA schools with insufficient telephone and electrical wiring, the age of the buildings may be a factor. Almost half of the buildings are more than 30 years old and almost 15 percent are between 50 and 100 years old. The principal of an Arizona school built in the 1930s said that most of the electrical wiring in the school is original and as new technology has been added, they have had frequent problems with system overloads. He said that this is likely to get worse as more new technology is added."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "BIA Reports Needing More Than $960 Million To Address Educational Facilities Deficiencies but Funding Has Been Increasing", "paragraphs": ["Administrators\u2019 concerns about the condition of their facilities are reflected in the BIA backlog of deferred maintenance and repairs. This backlog is a catalog of deficiencies\u2014related to buildings, surrounding grounds, and other infrastructure\u2014identified by architects, engineers, facilities managers, and safety officers over the years. The inventory describes in detail individual work items required in schools to meet national standards and codes such as the Uniform Building Code and National Fire Codes. The backlog contains a description of the work that needs to be done and the estimated cost for each item. The deficiencies may involve safety and health, access for persons with disabilities, or noncompliance with building codes. Recently, BIA\u2019s backlog was validated by an independent engineering firm. According to BIA officials and representatives from the engineering firm, this process included on-site inspections of each BIA school building. Based on their inspections, the engineers validated current projects and their cost estimates, removed items that had already been addressed, and added new deficiencies they identified.", "As of February 2001, BIA\u2019s backlog for educational facilities totaled $962 million\u2014an increase of almost $270 million (in current dollars), or 39 percent, since October 1997. Table 5 shows estimated costs from BIA\u2019s backlog to address deficiencies related to certain building features at BIA schools. BIA school administrators often indicated problems with these features in our survey. For example, the cost to address all deficiencies related to heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems in schools totaled more than $63 million at the time of this review. Administrators at more than half of the schools responding to our survey indicated problems with these systems. One school we visited in Arizona did not have a central cooling system, so each classroom had an air conditioner or evaporative cooling unit. The principal said the units were quite old and so noisy that they disrupted the students\u2019 learning environment.", "More than $127 million of the backlog total represents deficiencies related to the health and safety of students, and a significant portion of this ($44 million) relates to fire safety alone. For example, the backlog lists buildings at more than 100 schools that need to have their fire alarm systems replaced or upgraded because they are old, not working, or missing. At one school we visited, the facilities manager said that the fire alarm system on the school campus was no longer reliable, and that it was so old that buying replacement parts was becoming difficult. With respect to sprinkler systems, the BIA Chief of Safety and Risk Management said that it is BIA\u2019s goal to have sprinkler systems and smoke detectors in all dormitories to ensure the safety of the residents. However, at the time of our review, the backlog showed that more than half of the 54 boarding schools\u2019 dormitories needed sprinkler systems either to be installed or upgraded. None of the boarding schools we visited had sprinkler systems in student dormitories. In addition, a dormitory at one school was closed due, in part, to fire-related safety deficiencies, according to the school superintendent.", "A contributing factor to BIA school facility needs and the backlog is that BIA schools have to support a more extensive infrastructure than most public schools. Because many BIA schools are located in isolated areas, they maintain their own water and sewer systems, electric utilities, fire stations, and other important services that are generally provided to public schools by municipalities. Among the 171 BIA schools and 14 peripheral dormitories, 146 sites (79 percent) had responsibility for maintaining some kind of water infrastructure such as wells, water distribution lines, and/or water treatment facilities; 138 (75 percent) had responsibility for sewer infrastructure, such as sewage lagoons and sewage lines; and 52 schools (30 percent) operated and maintained fire trucks.", "BIA officials indicated that providing and maintaining this additional infrastructure was a considerable drain on resources. For example, at a K\u2013 8 school we visited in Arizona, the facilities manager said that his staff must maintain a water system that includes five wells with distribution lines, pumps, pump houses, and water storage tanks; a sewer system that includes sewer lines, a lagoon, and a lift station; a fire station, fire truck, and hydrants; and a landfill. The facilities manager said the school has chronic problems with the sewer system, and an independent engineering firm has recommended that the sewer mains and service lines be replaced. For water and sewer systems alone, deficiencies in BIA\u2019s backlog for educational facilities totaled almost $56 million.", "BIA\u2019s infrastructure also includes dormitory facilities for boarding students and housing for staff and their families. In total, BIA schools support 157 dormitory buildings for students and 1,879 single-family quarters and 194 apartment buildings for employees. However, we did not include employee housing in the scope of our study because the rent paid by staff is meant to cover the upkeep of these facilities.", "Funding from BIA\u2019s construction budget that is used largely to address the backlog was increased substantially by the Congress last year. This funding more than doubled from $40 million in fiscal year 2000 to $110 million in fiscal year 2001. BIA uses this funding to support a wide range of facility-related activities, including minor projects, such as the replacement of boiler systems, and major projects, such as the replacement of a natural gas line or the renovation of a school office building. In addition, the Congress provided even greater increases for replacement school construction the last 2 years. Funding rose from $17 million in fiscal year 1999 to $141 million in fiscal year 2001. This funding can reduce the backlog when new facilities are constructed to replace those that cannot accommodate current education programs or are beyond repair."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "BIA Funding for Maintenance and Repair Is Less Than National Guidelines", "paragraphs": ["While funding has increased during the last few years for certain facility- related line items in BIA\u2019s budget, we attempted to look more closely at funding available specifically for maintenance and repair needs. Adequately funding maintenance and repair is important because deferral of these tasks can increase the backlog. One guideline set forth by the National Research Council (NRC) considers maintenance and repair budgets in terms of the current replacement value of buildings. The NRC has recommended that budget allocations for routine maintenance and repair be in the range of 2 to 4 percent of the current replacement value of buildings.", "Using NRC\u2019s definitions, we extracted and combined pieces of BIA\u2019s budget to identify funding available for the maintenance and repair of buildings and other infrastructure and determined that funding levels were below those recommended by the NRC. From 1997\u20132000, funding requested for and allocated to the maintenance and repair of BIA schools was between 1.5 percent and 1.8 percent\u2014below the lower end of the recommended range of 2 to 4 percent. Funding increased in fiscal year 2001, resulting in maintenance and repair budget allocations providing about 2.5 percent of current replacement value that year. However, based on discussions with recognized experts in budgeting and facilities operations and maintenance, even with this increase, budget allocation levels over the past 5 years have been too low. These experts suggested that because of the extensive infrastructure beyond buildings that BIA must support, the isolation of the schools which dramatically increases maintenance and repair costs, and the age of BIA facilities, BIA schools likely require maintenance and repair funding in the range of 4 to 6 percent of current replacement value."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Estimated Expenditures Per Pupil for BIA Schools Are Higher Than Public Schools\u2019, and Vary Substantially Between Categories of Schools", "paragraphs": ["Estimated per-pupil expenditures for BIA day schools were $9,647 in 1997\u2013 98. In comparison, the national average per-pupil expenditure for public schools was $6,189 in 1997\u201398, the latest year for which national data were available at the time we did our work. It is important to note that per-pupil expenditures can range widely. Within the 50 states, per-pupil expenditures for public schools in 1997\u201398 ranged from $4,288 in Mississippi to $9,643 in New Jersey.", "Estimated per-pupil expenditures at BIA schools also varied widely depending upon the type of school. As shown in table 6, BIA boarding school expenditure estimates were almost $2,000 more per pupil than BIA day schools overall; the additional estimated expenditures for the boarding schools were likely due to their residential components. Among BIA day schools, estimated expenditures per pupil were higher for tribally operated schools than BIA-operated schools.", "One reason for the difference between estimated per-pupil expenditures for day schools operated by BIA and those by tribes is that tribally operated schools bear higher administrative costs\u2014each school must provide its own accounting and other support services that otherwise would be provided by BIA for a comparable BIA-operated school. To support these additional operating expenses, BIA provides administrative cost grants to tribally operated schools, which averaged about $1,400 per student in 1997\u201398.", "In comparing BIA and public school per-pupil expenditures, it is difficult to draw meaningful conclusions because the many factors that distinguish BIA schools from public schools may add to their educational costs. Special-needs students generally require additional educational resources and, as mentioned previously, a high proportion of BIA students have special needs. For example, according to BIA records for the 2000\u20132001 school year, about 21 percent of BIA students are enrolled in special education compared with 13 percent of public school students, and 58 percent of BIA students have limited English proficiency, compared with 8 percent of public school students. Available data also indicate that a high proportion of BIA students are poor. The student populations of BIA schools in fact may be more similar to those of large city or rural public schools, where higher proportions of students tend to have special needs.", "Other characteristics of BIA schools may lead to increased expenditures. The isolation that results in additional infrastructure needs for BIA schools also results in higher costs in other areas, such as transportation. For example, the number of miles transported per student for BIA schools in school year 1999\u20132000 was about 296, while that of public schools was about 165 for school year 1998\u20131999. Many of the miles traveled by BIA students are on unimproved roads or roads in poor condition, which increases wear and tear on vehicles. BIA also provides long-distance transportation four times a year for many of the 8,000 students living in boarding schools. Because BIA schools are generally small and often far from each other, it can be difficult for them to achieve economies of scale.

For example, nearly all military enlistees are high school graduates and relatively high proportions of the parents of DOD students have attended or graduated from college. Moreover, while a considerable portion of children in DOD schools are eligible for free or reduced-price lunch programs (32 percent), this is less than the proportion in public schools (40 percent); in addition, military families receive benefits, such as tax-free housing allowances or free housing on base, that are not considered in eligibility determinations for the lunch programs. Finally, nearly 90 percent of military school-age children reside in two-parent families compared with 70 percent of children in public schools, although DOD families are affected by the absence of parents deployed away from home.", "In addition to these socioeconomic factors, DOD schools receive unique support from the military and its culture. Military commands support the schools in their jurisdictions and encourage their staffs to do so as well\u2014 for instance, by making parent-teacher conferences a duty or fostering volunteer work in the schools. Staff at DOD schools are sensitive to the unique circumstances of military families, such as the deployment of military parents away from home and frequent family moves to new duty stations.

North Dakota uses the TerraNova Basic Multiple Assessments to assess students in grade 4 and the TerraNova Complete Battery Plus to assess students in grades 6, 8, and 10.  The state provided data on statewide averages for students\u2019 performance on the test, a breakdown of these scores by student ethnicity, and the scores for all BIA schools. We focused on students\u2019 total scores on the test and reported the range of scores across all grades. In South Dakota, schools use the Stanford Achievement Test to assess students in grades 2, 4, 8, and 11. From South Dakota\u2019s Department of Education, we obtained the average scores for students statewide, and the scores for all BIA schools on the complete battery and for specific skill areas such as language arts, reading, and math. We reported specifically on the range of scores on the complete battery across all grades. Arizona uses an assessment test customized for its standards, called the Arizona Instrument to Measure Standards (AIMS), in grades 3, 5, 8, 10, and 11. AIMS classifies students into four categories in relation to the standards: Falls Far Below, Approaches, Meets, or Exceeds. The Arizona Department of Education provided us with statewide averages for students\u2019 performance on the AIMS, including a breakdown of statewide scores by ethnicity, and the scores for participating BIA schools. We reported the range for the proportion of children who met or exceeded the state standards, across all grades and across all subjects (reading, writing, and math).", "We requested data on the performance of BIA students on the SAT and ACT from the respective college testing organizations. With BIA\u2019s approval, the testing organizations provided us data on the scores for BIA students who graduated in 1999 or 2000. It should be noted that a small number of BIA graduates (fewer than 70) take the SAT. Far more BIA students (about 800) take the ACT because BIA schools are located in areas of the country where the ACT is the predominant college admissions test.", "BIA also provided the annual reports for virtually all BIA-funded schools, which include data on the proficiency of students as assessed by schools.", "These assessments are based on multiple measures, which in addition to students\u2019 performance on standardized tests can include measures such as portfolios illustrating students\u2019 work, grades, teacher observations, and work samples.", "DOD students in both overseas and domestic schools are assessed using the TerraNova Multiple Assessments in grades 3 through 11. We obtained data from DOD on students\u2019 performance for school year 1999\u20132000 and focused on students\u2019 scores in language arts and math. We reported the range of scores for students in all grades, across both language arts and math, and across students in both overseas and domestic schools. We also obtained data from DOD on students\u2019 performance on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). The NAEP is a nationally administered test offered in different subject areas, such as reading, math, science, and writing, in different years. We examined DOD data on students\u2019 performance on the NAEP in math (1996), reading (1998), and writing (1998).

We obtained BIA\u2019s total education facility square footage for maintained buildings for 1997\u20132001. (These data included 14 peripheral dormitories and two colleges, which account for about 11 percent of BIA\u2019s total education facility square footage.)

The results of this survey are used to develop the national per-pupil figure. National per-pupil expenditure figures reflect current expenditures from federal, state, local and private sources, at the district level for pre- kindergarten through grade 12. Current expenditures include salaries, benefits, purchased services, and supplies for the following functions: instruction; support services; noninstructional services, such as food services; and direct program support, such as state contributions to employee retirement funds.  Long-term expenditures such as capital outlay, debt service, facilities acquisition and construction services, and property expenditures (for example, for equipment and vehicles) are excluded from current expenditures by NCES and, in most cases, by our evaluation. At the time we did our work, the latest school year for which national public school per-pupil expenditures were available was 1997\u201398.", "Data needed to precisely compute per-pupil expenditures for both BIA and DOD schools were not available. Therefore, our calculations are estimates based on BIA and DOD agency data and federal expenditure information from tribal audit reports submitted under the Single Audit Act. Because BIA and DOD data were generally not available by categories specified by NCES, we used agency or tribal expenditure or obligation data for programs or budget line items which included these categories. Using this approach we were able to include expenditures for salaries, benefits, purchased services, and supplies for the categories included in the national per-pupil expenditure: instruction, support services, and noninstructional services.  Direct program support generally did not apply. Similarly, we were generally able to exclude expenditures for capital outlay, debt service, and facilities acquisition and construction services by excluding budget line items that contain these expenditures. In some cases, we were not able to extract specific expenditures or obligations relating to property expenditures within selected programs; however, these amounts were likely to be relatively small.", "For BIA schools, we developed estimated per-pupil calculations for (1) BIA-operated day schools, (2) tribally operated day schools, (3) day schools overall, and (4) boarding schools. For BIA-operated schools, we obtained expenditure information from the Department of the Interior\u2019s (Interior) financial system based on codes indicating programs that support kindergarten through grade 12. We were not able to identify expenditures for administrative services provided by Interior for BIA- operated schools, such as payroll and procurement. We used fiscal year 1998 data. A fiscal year reasonably approximates the period July 1, 1997, and ending June 30, 1998, used by NCES.  For tribally operated schools, we relied primarily on federal expenditure information from audit reports submitted under the Single Audit Act. These reports were generally for the period July 1, 1997, through June 30, 1998. We were able to obtain expenditure information for 54 of the 98 schools that were tribally operated that year. We could not obtain expenditure information for the remaining 44 schools because, in some cases, the school expenditure information in the audit report was included with other expenditure information for tribal or other organizations and could not be readily extracted, or because related audit reports were not available.", "For both BIA-operated and tribally operated schools, we considered expenditures from federal funding sources only, which, according to BIA officials, represent by far the greatest source of funding for BIA schools. This included expenditure data for Education programs, such as Title I; and the Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) child nutrition programs, such as the National School Lunch and Breakfast programs. The per-pupil expenditure figures for public schools nationally consider funding from all sources.

We stated that BIA\u2019s funding for school operations and facilities needs increased 30 percent from fiscal years 2000 to 2001. Interior suggested that GAO differentiate the actual amount of the increase between the Operation of Indian Programs and Construction appropriation accounts, initially stating that each account had increased by 25 percent. Based on our calculations, we added information to the report specifying that funding for Operation of Indian Programs increased by about 5 percent and funding for Construction increased 121 percent between fiscal years 2000 and 2001. This supports our statement that nearly all the increase was for the repair and replacement of school facilities while funding for school operations received only a modest increase. 2.  Interior commented that our report should acknowledge that the Department of Education (Education) funding that BIA schools receive is available to all public schools across the country. Interior specifically noted that public schools that educate Indian children on or near Indian reservations receive Impact Aid Funds from Education. We added text to the report indicating that like BIA schools, many public schools also receive funding from Education. 3.  Interior noted that in an agreement with Education, BIA serves as a state education agency and is authorized to receive flow through funds from Education. We have added this information in the report. 4.  Interior suggested that we provide some examples to further highlight differences between BIA and DOD schools. Interior stated that the DOD school system has no schools with small enrollments or combinations of grades like those in the BIA school system. The DOD school system does have several schools with enrollments under 100 students and schools that span both elementary and secondary grades, but we agree that these types of schools are less prevalent in DOD\u2019s school system. Interior also said that it would have been helpful for GAO to provide an example of how BIA schools are less able to take advantage of economies of scale and that this would help explain the school system\u2019s per- pupil expenditure. In our report section on per pupil expenditures, we describe a situation that illustrates how difficult it can be for BIA schools to achieve economies of scale. Finally, Interior stated that the report could comment on how the physical conditions found in BIA schools could affect student outcomes. Thus, we added a note to the report stating that though some studies conclude that school facility conditions\u2014such as inadequate ventilation or faulty heating systems\u2014can affect student learning, the research is inconclusive overall. 5.  Regarding the performance of BIA students on state assessments, Interior argued that state standardized tests may be culturally biased and may be a less reliable measure for Indian students than other minorities. In the report we acknowledged that standardized tests have been criticized as being culturally biased, and we therefore provided information on authentic assessments of BIA students. However, we are not aware of any research that shows standardized tests are less reliable for Indian students than other minority students. 6.  Interior said GAO should have compared BIA student achievement with public schools serving large numbers of  Indian students in rural areas. We agree that these would be worthwhile analyses. However, the additional audit work and data required to perform these analyses did not allow us to include them in this report. 7.  Interior noted BIA\u2019s efforts to address differences in student achievement through programs designed to moderate the effects of poor economic and family conditions on student achievement. The agency also noted that BIA had established long term goals that address student performance. We have added information to the report to acknowledge BIA\u2019s efforts in these areas. 8.  Interior questioned our comparison of BIA students\u2019 plans to attend college and performance on college entrance examinations with those of students nationally. The agency argued that the economies of rural areas, where most BIA schools are located, do not offer jobs that require post-secondary education, and for this and other reasons, less cultural emphasis is placed on BIA students to perform well on tests like the SAT and to attend college. The agency stated that BIA students generally expect to go to tribal colleges that do not require college entrance examinations, such as the SAT. We believe that these measures are appropriate given that one of the Office of Indian Education Program\u2019s goals is to increase post-secondary enrollment rates. Also, a significant number of BIA students take the SAT and ACT, perhaps to enter colleges that require these examinations. 9.  Interior also said that we should have compared BIA students\u2019 plans to attend college and their performance on college entrance examinations with students from other rural regions of the U.S. or students in public schools on Indian reservations. Some data are available for students living in rural areas but these are not specifically focused on Indian students. For example, data from 1993-94 show that on average 54 percent of 12th graders living in small towns or rural areas applied to college, compared with BIA school administrators\u2019 estimates that 28 percent of graduating seniors planned to enroll in college. With regard to the SAT, for students graduating in 2000, rural students received an average total score of 992 on the verbal and math sections of the SAT, compared with 1,019 for students nationally, and 765 for BIA students. 10. Interior stated  that teacher turnover correlates with reduced student achievement, but did not provide support for this statement. We were not able to identify any studies establishing a link between teacher turnover and student achievement. 11. Interior noted that in fiscal year 2000, BIA conducted a census of personal computers in BIA schools and concluded that the school system had a ratio of 1 computer for every 3.3 students. BIA added, however, that 30 percent of these computers are for administrative usage and that almost half are reaching or have surpassed their life cycle usefulness. Our survey asked school administrators about computers used specifically for instructional purposes. Using these data, we determined that the school system had a ratio of 1 computer for instructional purposes for every 3.5 students. 12. Interior said that we had failed to address the fact that state legislatures have appropriated funds for school technology and that these funds are not included in district funding appropriations and therefore are not included in calculations of expenditures per pupil by NCES. We contacted NCES and were told that state funding for educational technology should be included in the data that states report to NCES for expenditure per pupil calculations. Thus, based on this information, we did not modify our report. Interior also noted that the Office of Indian Education Programs had to rely on private partnerships and grants to provide enough resources to place technical capabilities in all its schools. (It should be noted that these additional resources were not identified during our review and therefore were not included in our expenditure per pupil calculation for BIA schools.) In addition, Interior stated that our report was unclear about the resources DOD uses to support technology in its schools. In our report we provided an estimate for the amount of money the DOD school systems obligated per student for educational technology in fiscal year 2000, which was less than the amount BIA schools spent per student based on our survey results. This funding comes from DOD appropriations. 13. With respect to housing for teachers and staff, Interior said that we had assumed that rents collected from teachers living in employee housing covered the cost of maintaining this housing and had not realized that schools end up covering these costs out of their facilities maintenance funds. Interior argued that school maintenance funding diverted for teacher housing should not have been included in our calculation of expenditures per pupil. Interior also stated that staff in DOD schools live in government provided quarters expense free. Early in our review, BIA officials informed us that rents paid by teachers and staff did not cover the full cost of maintaining employee housing. However, when requested, BIA was unable to identify expenditures made by schools for such purposes. More importantly, Interior noted in its comments that providing housing is necessary for maintaining a qualified teaching staff. Because of this, we believe that expenditures to maintain employee housing are part of the cost of providing instruction for these schools. An NCES official agreed and stated that expenditures from school facilities maintenance funds used to maintain employee housing should be included in the calculation of expenditures per pupil. For the same reason, we included DOD schools\u2019 expenditures for housing allowances provided to overseas staff in our calculation of expenditures per pupil. We have also added a footnote stating that a small number of staff in DOD schools overseas live in government-provided quarters; most receive housing allowances intended to cover the cost of housing in the areas where they choose to live. 14. Interior commented that our report failed to address the adequacy of funding for facilities operations. We were not able to identify a widely used benchmark to assess the sufficiency of BIA\u2019s facilities operations funding. We were only able to compare BIA\u2019s obligations for both facilities operations and maintenance with similar expenditures for public schools. We found that BIA\u2019s obligations per square foot of building space were higher than the national median for public schools. However, it was difficult to draw conclusions from these calculations as they do not consider the additional infrastructure BIA schools operate and maintain. Also, this analysis does not examine the adequacy of BIA\u2019s funding for operations and maintenance, it merely compares the amounts used by BIA and public schools for these purposes. Further, we were aware at the time we conducted our work that BIA had contracted with a private engineering firm to assess the adequacy of BIA\u2019s facilities operations and maintenance funding. This work may provide a clearer picture of BIA\u2019s needs. This report is expected to be completed in Fall 2001. 15. Interior commented that the cost of operating facilities could be reduced if school replacement construction funding covered the cost of demolishing and removing old structures. Currently, BIA provides for the security of these idle structures out of operations funding until a decision is made on their disposal. This issue may be worthy of attention, but BIA\u2019s own budget formula for determining operations and maintenance needs suggests that this is not a major expense. 16. Interior noted that BIA, DOD, and public schools define and account for maintenance funds and expenditures differently, and these differences make \u201ca straight across the board comparison\u201d difficult. We determined that it would be challenging to complete such an analysis within the timeframe of this review. Thus, we did not attempt to compare maintenance budgets or expenditures among these school systems. Rather, we analyzed BIA\u2019s and DOD\u2019s maintenance and repair backlogs and provided information on the amount of funding allocated to address them and school construction. 17. Interior commented that our estimates of expenditures per pupil were not adjusted to reflect differences between students in day schools and in residential schools. We did calculate separate per-pupil expenditures for day schools and residential schools and did not combine them. Interior also stated that we did not adjust our per-pupil expenditure estimates for students with special education needs or for the costs of small schools in sparsely populated areas. The agency recommended that we use an alternative approach for calculating expenditures per pupil that takes into account differences in student and school needs. Interior pointed to funding allocation systems used by some states where students are weighted differently based on the additional education resources they may require. For example, a student requiring special education services may be counted as 1.5 students in determining state aid. Interior argued that we should have used a weighted count of its students to calculate expenditures per pupil, since a high proportion have special needs. Such a calculation may be useful, but comparisons with public schools would not be possible since NCES does not calculate the national expenditure per pupil using a weighted student count. 18. Interior stated that we should have compared BIA expenditures per pupil with that of school districts with similar student populations. Interior suggested several school districts with similar student populations in South Dakota and New Mexico that could be used for comparison with BIA\u2019s per-pupil expenditure. We obtained the per- pupil expenditures for these districts from NCES and found they ranged from $4,979 to $8,706 in 1997-98, all below BIA\u2019s estimated expenditure per pupil of $9,647. 19. Interior recommended that we should not have included administrative cost grants for tribally operated schools in our expenditure per pupil calculation. The agency argued that these grants are for the purpose of administering the schools and carrying out support functions that are not part of the basic academic instruction, such as fiscal and personnel activities. According to an NCES official, these expenditures should be included as they fall into the category of general administration expenditures, which is included in the national per pupil expenditure calculation."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individuals named above, Mary E.
