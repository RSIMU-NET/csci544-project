Also, 11 World Trade Organization (WTO) members lodged a complaint over the law at the WTO. This report assesses (1) key legal requirements guiding and affecting agency implementation of CDSOA; (2) problems, if any, U.S. agencies have faced in implementing CDSOA; and (3) which companies have received CDSOA payments and their effects for recipients and non-recipients; and describes (4) the status of WTO decisions on CDSOA."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Congress enacted CDSOA to strengthen relief to injured U.S. producers. The law's key eligibility requirements limit benefits to producers that filed a petition for relief or that publicly supported the petition during a government investigation to determine whether injury had occurred. This law differs from trade remedy laws, which generally provide relief to all producers in an industry. Another key CDSOA feature requires that Customs and Border Protection (CBP) disburse payments within 60 days after the beginning of a fiscal year, giving CBP limited time to process payments and perform desired quality controls. This time frame, combined with a dramatic growth in the program workload, presents implementation risks for CBP. CBP faces three key implementation problems. First, processing of company claims and CDSOA payments is problematic because CBP's procedures are labor intensive and do not include standardized forms or electronic filing. Second, most companies are not accountable for the claims they file because they do not have to support their claims and CBP does not systematically verify the claims. Third, CBP's problems in collecting duties that fund CDSOA have worsened. About half of the funds that should have been available for disbursement remained uncollected in fiscal year 2004. Most of the CDSOA payments went to a few companies with mixed effects. About half of these payments went to five companies. Top recipients we surveyed said that CDSOA had beneficial effects, but the degree varied. In four of seven industries we examined, recipients reported benefits, but some non-recipients noted CDSOA payments gave their competitors an unfair advantage. These views are not necessarily representative of the views of all recipients and non-recipients. Because the United States has not brought CDSOA into compliance with its WTO obligations, it faces additional tariffs on U.S. exports covering a trade value of up to $134 million based on 2004 CDSOA disbursements. Recently, Canada, the European Union, Mexico, and Japan imposed additional duties on various U.S. exports. Four other WTO members may follow suit."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act (CDSOA) of 2000 has  provided over $1 billion to hundreds of U.S. companies in industries  deemed to have been injured by unfair competition from dumped or  subsidized imports. Before CDSOA\u2019s enactment, these funds, which come  from duties (import taxes) imposed and collected on such imports, went to  the Department of the Treasury\u2019s (Treasury) general revenue fund. Some of  CDSOA\u2019s defenders argue that the law gives U.S. firms and their employees  a reasonable chance to compete and invest, despite facing continued unfair  trade from foreign competitors. However, since the act\u2019s enactment,  various domestic and international interests have opposed its  implementation. Some domestic opponents contend, among other things,  that CDSOA recipients receive a large, unjustified windfall from the U.S.  treasury. Also, several nations lodged a complaint over the law against the  United States at the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001.", "Nevertheless, defenders of CDSOA say that U.S. trading partners have been  unable to demonstrate they actually suffered adverse effects from the law.", "The President has proposed repealing the CDSOA three times.

To identify company recipients, we obtained and analyzed CBP  disbursement data for fiscal years 2001 through 2004. To assess the effect  of disbursements on companies, we relied upon the views of the top  recipients of all CDSOA funds, and of selected leading recipient and non- recipient companies in seven industries via standard data collection  questionnaires. A total of 24 of the 32 top recipient companies we  contacted responded to our questionnaires. In the seven industries, a total  of 92 of the 151 leading companies responded to structured questions we  sent them, ranging from 2 to 25 respondents per industry. The views of  these companies are not necessarily representative of all recipient and non- recipient companies.

In both situations, U.S. law  provides that a duty intended to counter these advantages be imposed on  imports. Such duties are known as AD/CV duties. The process involves the  filing of a petition for relief by domestic producer interests, or self- initiation by the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce), followed by  two separate investigations: one by Commerce, which determines if  dumping or subsidies are occurring, and the other by the ITC, which  determines whether a domestic U.S. industry is materially injured by such  unfairly traded imports. If both agencies make affirmative determinations,  Commerce issues an order to CBP directing it to collect the additional  duties on imports. These are known as AD/CV duty orders. No later than 5  years after publication of these orders, Commerce and the ITC conduct a  \u201csunset review\u201d to determine whether revoking the order would likely lead  to the continuation or recurrence of dumping and/or subsidization and  material injury.", "Congress enacted CDSOA on October 28, 2000, as part of the Agriculture,  Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration and Related Agencies  Appropriations Act to strengthen the remedial nature of U.S. trade laws,  restore conditions of fair trade, and assist domestic producers. Congress  noted in its accompanying findings that \u201ccontinued dumping and  subsidization . . . after the issuance of antidumping orders or findings or  countervailing duty orders can frustrate the remedial purpose\u201d of U.S.  trade laws, potentially causing domestic producers to be reluctant to  reinvest or rehire and damaging their ability to maintain pension and health  care benefits. Consequently, Congress enacted the CDSOA, reasoning that  \u201cU.S. trade laws should be strengthened to see that the remedial purpose of  those laws is achieved.\u201d CDSOA instructs Customs to distribute AD/CV  duties directly to affected domestic producers. Previously, CBP transferred  such duties to the Treasury for general government use.", "Two agencies are involved in CDSOA implementation. The law gives each  agency\u2014ITC and CBP\u2014specific responsibilities for implementing CDSOA.  The ITC is charged with developing a list of producers who are potentially  eligible to receive CDSOA distributions and providing the names of these  producers to CBP. CBP has overall responsibility for annually distributing  duties collected to eligible affected domestic producers. CDSOA also  makes CBP responsible for several related actions. Specifically, it charges  CBP with establishing procedures for the distribution of payments and  requires that CBP publish in the Federal Register a notice of intent to  distribute payments and, based on information provided by the ITC, a list of  affected domestic producers potentially eligible for the distribution.", "Both agencies had some start-up challenges and have made improvements  in response to reports by their Inspectors General (IG). In September 2004,  ITC\u2019s IG found that the ITC had effectively implemented its part of the act  but made several suggestions for enhancing the agency\u2019s CDSOA efforts.  For example, it suggested that the ITC better document its policies and  procedures for identifying and reporting eligible producers to CBP and  improve its communication with companies regarding eligibility. In  response, the ITC implemented these suggestions to, among other things,  formalize and strengthen its procedures for identifying eligible producers,  developing a list of potentially eligible producers, and transmitting the list  to CBP. For example, the ITC updated its desk procedures, clarified certain  responsibilities to support the staff responsible for maintaining the ITC list,  and added additional guidance on CDSOA requirements to its website.", "In June 2003, the Treasury\u2019s IG issued a report finding several major  deficiencies in CBP\u2019s implementation of CDSOA and made several  recommendations. The Treasury\u2019s IG found that CBP was not in  compliance with the law because it did not properly establish special  accounts for depositing and disbursing CDSOA payments, did not pay  claimants within the required time frame, and did not institute standard  operating procedures or adequate controls for managing the program.  Specifically, Treasury\u2019s IG noted that the absence of proper accounts,  accurate financial data, and adequate internal controls had resulted in  \u201coverpayments of at least $25 million, and likely more.\u201d   Treasury\u2019s IG also  emphasized that several other issues warranted attention, including no  routine verification of claims and significant amounts of uncollected  AD/CV duties. In response, CBP consolidated the processing of claims and  payments by establishing a CDSOA team in Indianapolis, Indiana; instituted  procedures for processing claims and disbursements, and for conducting  claim verification audits; and started proceedings to secure  reimbursements from the companies that had received overpayments.  Despite these efforts, CBP still faces issues raised by the Treasury IG, such  as the issue of uncollected duties.", "The United States has an obligation that its trade remedy actions conform  to its legal commitments as part of the WTO, an international body based in  Geneva, Switzerland. The WTO agreements set forth the agreed-upon rules  for international trade. The WTO provides a mechanism for settling  disputes between countries, and serves as a forum for conducting trade  negotiations among its 148 member nations and separate customs  territories. WTO trade remedy rules involve both procedural and  substantive requirements, and a number of U.S. trade remedies have been  challenged at the WTO. WTO members that believe other members are  not complying with their WTO obligations can file a dispute settlement  case. The resulting decisions by a dispute settlement panel, once adopted,  are binding on members who are parties to the dispute, and WTO rules  create an expectation of compliance. Under WTO rules and U.S. law,  however, compliance is not automatic. WTO dispute settlement panels  cannot order the United States to change its law. Alternatively, the United  States may choose not to comply with WTO agreements and instead may  choose to offer injured members mutually-agreed upon trade  compensation or face retaliatory suspension of trade concessions by the  complainant members. A new round of global trade talks aimed at  liberalizing trade barriers is now underway and includes discussions of  possible clarifications and improvements to the WTO rules on antidumping  and on subsidies and countervailing measures. U.S. trade with members of  the WTO totaled $2.1 trillion in 2004, giving the United States a  considerable stake in these WTO negotiations, which aim to liberalize trade  in agriculture, industrial goods, and services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Key CDSOA Features Restrict Company Eligibility, Determine Share of Disbursements, and Set Tight Time Frame for Disbursing Payments", "paragraphs": ["Three key features of CDSOA guide and affect agency implementation.

The law also requires the ITC to  prepare a list of potentially eligible producers for CBP, which publishes it in  advance of each annual distribution. The law only applies to orders in  effect on or after January 1, 1999. CDSOA further specifies that support  must be communicated to the ITC through a letter from the company or a  response to an ITC questionnaire. Successor companies or members of an  association may also be eligible for CDSOA distributions.

Our analysis of ITC data reveals that roughly two-thirds of  (234 out of 351) AD/CV duty orders in effect as of April 15, 2005, precede  CDSOA. The application of CDSOA to orders that predate the law\u2019s  enactment raises concern. This is because, for AD/CV relief petitions that  were investigated before CDSOA was enacted, producers had no way of  knowing that their lack of expression of support for the petition would  later adversely affect their ability to receive CDSOA disbursements.  Moreover, firms that began operations or entered the U.S. market after the  ITC\u2019s original investigation are not eligible to receive CDSOA distributions.  For petitions that have been investigated since CDSOA was enacted,  producers would likely be aware of this linkage. The ITC and CBP told us  that in a recent case involving shrimp, industry associations reached out  broadly to ensure producers were aware of the need to communicate  support to the ITC. Similarly, officials from a law firm that works with  importers told us they were aware of such industry association efforts in  cases involving live swine.

However, the  ITC\u2019s investigative process does not result in collecting information from  all industry participants, because it is intended for purposes other than  CDSOA. The ITC\u2019s primary role in AD/CV investigations is to define the  scope of the industry that is affected by competition from imported goods  and to determine whether the industry has suffered or been threatened  with material injury as a result of dumped or subsidized imports. The ITC  collects information from U.S. producers, primarily by surveying them. ITC  officials told us that they generally strive to cover 100 percent of industry  production in their surveys and usually receive responses from producers  accounting for a substantial share of production. In situations with a  relatively small number of producers, ITC officials said they often succeed  in getting coverage of 90 percent of the domestic industry. However, in  certain circumstances, such as with agricultural products, which have a  large number of small producers, ITC surveys a sample of U.S. producers  instead of the entire industry.

In its investigations, the ITC sends out  both preliminary and final surveys in which producers are asked about  support for petitions. Presently, producers have the option of checking  one of three boxes: (1) support, (2) take no position, and (3) oppose.  According to ITC officials, because the statute requires support, only  those firms that check the \u201csupport\u201d box are considered eligible.  Moreover, ITC\u2019s practice has been to look to the most recent clear  expression of a company\u2019s position on the petition to determine its  CDSOA eligibility. For example, if a company\u2019s response was \u201csupport\u201d  on the preliminary survey but \u201ctake no position\u201d on the final survey, the  ITC interprets \u201ctake no position\u201d as non-support, and considers the  company ineligible for CDSOA disbursements.", "The ITC limits its list of potentially eligible producers to those who  indicate their support can be made public. The ITC is required by statute  to keep company information, including positions on petitions,  confidential, unless the company waives its confidentiality rights.

The companies were not on the ITC\u2019s list  of potentially eligible producers and did not file timely certifications  with CBP. The companies asserted that the ITC had violated CDSOA by  failing to include them on the list of affected domestic producers and  that this omission excused their failure to timely file their  certifications. A federal appellate court held that the ITC properly  excluded the two producers from the list of affected domestic  producers because the producers provided support for the AD petition  in a response to a confidential questionnaire and failed to waive  confidentiality. The court also held that when the ITC properly  excludes a producer from the list, the producer still must file a timely  certification with CBP to obtain retroactive consideration for CDSOA  distributions. As a result, the court found that the firms were not  entitled to CDSOA disbursements for the years in question.", "Another set of candle companies, which had opposed the relevant  petition and subsequently acquired companies in support of the same  petition, brought a case seeking to obtain CDSOA disbursements on  behalf of the acquired companies. An appellate court held that CDSOA  bars claims made on behalf of otherwise affected domestic producers  who were acquired by a company that opposed the investigation or were  acquired by a business related to a company that opposed the  investigation.

In  reviewing certain claims and CBP\u2019s procedures, we found that claims are  generally not questioned even though top CDSOA recipient companies  have claimed over $2 trillion since fiscal year 2001 (see app.II). CBP  normally does not take steps to determine that companies are still in  business and producing the item covered by the order under which they are  making a claim. Neither CDSOA nor CBP require companies to explain  their claims, provide supporting documentation about their claims, or  follow a format when listing their qualifying expenditures. For example, in  reviewing the 2004 claims filed by top CDSOA recipients, we found that  most companies did not provide any details about their claimed  expenditures. Indeed, one company listed all of its claimed expenditures  under the category of raw materials. CDSOA and CBP do not require that  companies have their claims reviewed by a certified public accountant or a  party outside of the company.", "CBP has only verified the claims of a handful of claimants.

Subsequently, CBP\u2019s Regulatory Audit Division decided  to conduct a fifth verification using the detailed verification procedures the  division developed in mid-2004. This verification, which took about a year  and was completed in June 2005, revealed significant problems, including  substantial overstatement of claimed expenses. According to CBP, the  primary cause of the CDSOA expenditure overstatement was the  company\u2019s failure to maintain an internal control system to prepare and  support its CDSOA claims. This prevented the company from identifying  the non-qualifying products and costs associated with them. As a result, the  company included expenditures incurred in the production of products not  covered by the scope of the AD/CV orders.

In the third year of CDSOA implementation, a CBP  working group under the direction of the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s office  developed a statement of work to, among other things, verify claims  according to a risk-based plan.

Instead, CBP will continue to rely on complaints from  competitors to select companies for verification. According to CBP  officials, this approach is logical because the pro rata formula for  allocating disbursements among firms creates an incentive for other  companies to police their competitors. Although CBP has an agencywide  risk-based plan for targeting companies for audits, this plan does not target  the CDSOA program\u2019s recipients because the agency does not consider the  program a high risk to revenue or a high priority for policy reasons.", "CBP\u2019s current position is at odds with its own Inspector General\u2019s (IG)  position and our work on financial management, which highlights the  importance of verifying claims.

Moreover, it emphasized that untimely verifications could  result in the loss of revenue for other deserving companies if, in fact,  deception was later discovered. Our overall work on claims and  disbursements throughout the government shows that the systematic  verification of claims before they are processed (or after they are paid) is  key to ensuring the validity of transactions and to avoid disbursement  problems such as improper payments.

For example, it distributed  about half of the money that should have been available under CDSOA in  fiscal year 2004. CBP\u2019s efforts to date to address the causes of its  collections problems have not been successful, leading CBP to pledge  further steps in a July 2005 report to Congress.", "Customs collections problems have been evident since mid-2003 and have  two distinct components. Specifically, the 2003 report on CDSOA by  Treasury\u2019s IG highlighted CBP\u2019s collections problems, raising particular  concerns about the following two AD/CV collection issues:  Unliquidated entries make the eventual collection of duties owed less  certain. Liquidation is the final determination of duties owed on an  import entry. Liquidation of import entries subject to AD/CV duties only  occurs after Commerce issues a final order, determines final dumping  margins or final net countervailable subsidies (i.e. duty), and issues  liquidation instructions to CBP. Upon receipt of liquidation instructions,  CBP calculates and seeks to collect the actual duties owed. In some  cases, such as softwood lumber, liquidation is being suspended due to  ongoing litigation. While neither Commerce nor CBP can hasten  collection of duties tied up in litigation, Treasury\u2019s IG report found that,  in some cases, CBP was not collecting duties because Commerce had  failed to issue proper liquidation instructions to CBP. In other cases, the  report said CBP had overlooked Commerce liquidation instructions. The  report said clearing up the liquidation backlog should be given a high  priority given the substantial dollars involved\u2014about $2 billion in 2003.  Clearing the backlog is also urgent because discrepancies between  unliquidated duties and final duties often means that CBP must attempt  to collect additional sums from producers that did not expect to pay  more, or that went out of business.", "Open (unpaid or uncollected) duty bills are liquidated entries for which  final bills have been issued but not paid. The Treasury\u2019s IG report  expressed concern that CBP had not collected $97 million in duties  owed and said that the agency might not be able to recover some of  these funds. Treasury\u2019s IG said its discussion with CBP personnel  suggested recovery could be difficult because: (1) port personnel are  accepting bonds that are not sufficient to cover the duties owed plus  interest when the entry is liquidated, and (2) the length of time between  entry and liquidation is often several years, and in that time, some  importers go out of business, leaving CBP with no way to go back for  collection of additional duties.", "In response, CBP and Commerce took steps to identify and address the  causes of CBP\u2019s collections problems. CBP attributes the uncollected  duties problem largely to \u201cnew shippers\u201d with little import history, a  problem that is particularly prevalent in the agriculture and aquaculture  industries. According to CBP, one of these new shippers accounted for $130  million in uncollected duties in fiscal year 2004. To address this problem, in  2004, Commerce changed its new shipper review process and listed several  steps it has taken to strengthen it. These included steps such as making the  bondholder liable for duties owed on each import entry, and formalizing a  checklist to ensure the legitimacy of new shippers and their sales.  Subsequently in 2004, CBP announced an amended directive to help ensure  that duties on agriculture and aquaculture imports were collected properly  by reviewing and applying a new formula for bonds on these imports,  effectively increasing these bonds by setting them at higher rates.", "Nevertheless, since the problem and its basic reasons became known in  2003, the size of CBP\u2019s collections problem has more than doubled. As  figure 2 shows, according to CBP data, $4.2 billion in AD/CV duties  remained unliquidated and $260 million in AD/CV duties were unpaid at the  end of fiscal year 2004. According to CBP, a large amount of the  unliquidated entries involves duties on softwood lumber from Canada  (about $3.7 billion). In February 2005, CBP reported to Congress that it had  developed a plan to isolate suspended entries that were beyond the normal  time frames of an AD/CV case and then worked with Commerce to obtain  liquidation instructions, reducing the inventory of one million suspended  entries by 80,000. However, many unliquidated entries remain and some of  the unliquidated entries are still due to problems within CBP\u2019s and  Commerce\u2019s control. CBP estimates that over 90 percent of all unliquidated  AD/CV entries are awaiting Commerce instructions for liquidation.  Regarding unpaid duties, a large percentage pertains to imports from  China. Specifically, nearly two-thirds of these unpaid duties (about $170  million) relate to an AD order on crawfish tail meat from China. The second  largest amount (about $25 million) relate to an AD order on fresh garlic  from China.", "CBP\u2019s continued collections problems have led to calls for more drastic  measures. Several industry groups, including representatives of the garlic,  honey, mushroom, and crawfish industries, have advocated for elimination  of the new shipper bonding rules in favor of cash deposits on entries for  new AD orders. Most crawfish and some steel recipients responding to our  questionnaire also raised concerns about CBP\u2019s collection efforts and  quality of communication about ongoing problems.", "As a result, CBP is pursuing additional measures. In a February 2005 report  to Congress, CBP said it is working with Treasury to address financial risks  associated with bond holders\u2019 insolvency and monitoring of  agriculture/aquaculture importers\u2019 compliance with its new bonding  requirements on a weekly basis. In its July 2005 report to Congress, CBP  highlights that it has begun working with other U.S. agencies to develop  legislative proposals and other solutions to better address AD/CV duty  collection problems.

One company stated that the  disbursements helped it to replace equipment and enabled it to recover  to the position it had held prior to being injured from dumping. Another  recipient commented that, while the CDSOA disbursements were  helpful, they were distributed several years after the initial injury and  did not fully compensate the company for lost profits due to unfair  trade.

Steel recipients also  commented, though, that CDSOA has not been a complete solution to  the serious problems they faced.

About 30 small, family-owned crawfish processors have  received CDSOA disbursements.

In June 2003, the ITC reported that  CDSOA disbursements to some domestic producers had converted an  industrywide net loss into net income.

As  discussed previously, two of these companies brought legal action to  challenge agency decisions on their eligibility status. Because they also  have to compete against cheap Chinese imports, these non-recipients  viewed the application of the law as unfair. In addition, several said they  were not able to compete with recipient companies that offer processed  tail meat at prices below their cost of production and appear to be able  to do so because the recipients\u2019 CDSOA disbursements will compensate  them for any losses. In such conditions, some non-recipients said they  cannot operate profitably and some decided to stop processing tail  meat.", "Pasta.

Most companies that responded to our questions said that filing and  winning new cases was too expensive, and the receipt of CDSOA payments  was too speculative, for CDSOA to be a major factor in their filing decision.  For example, producers accounting for a sizeable share of U.S. softwood  lumber production freely chose not to support the case, despite being  aware of the prospect of sizeable CDSOA disbursements.

Our review suggests that the implementation of  CDSOA is achieving some objectives more effectively than others. One  reason is that, as a result of some of the key features of CDSOA, the law in  practice operates differently from trade remedies. For instance, while trade  remedies such as AD/CV duties generally provide relief to all producers in a  particular market, the eligibility requirements of CDSOA limit relief to only  a subset of domestic producers\u2014only those that petitioned for relief or  that publicly supported the petition by sending a letter to the ITC or filling  an ITC questionnaire while the agency was conducting its original  investigation and remain in operation. Our analysis of CDSOA  disbursement data and company views on the effects of CDSOA indicate  that CDSOA has provided significant financial benefits to certain U.S.  producers but little or no benefits to others. As a result, CDSOA has, in  some cases, created advantages for those U.S. producers that are eligible  and receive the bulk of disbursements over those U.S. producers that  receive little relief or are ineligible, by choice or circumstance. Moreover,  because the WTO found that CDSOA did not comply with WTO  agreements, the EU, Canada, Mexico, and Japan recently retaliated against  U.S. exports and this imposes costs on a number of U.S. companies  exporting to those markets.", "In implementing CDSOA, CBP faces problems processing CDSOA claims  and payments, verifying these claims, and collecting AD/CV duties. The  CDSOA program\u2019s time frame for processing payments is already too tight  to perform desired quality controls. The dramatic growth in the program\u2019s  workload--an estimated 10-fold increase in the number of claims in fiscal  year 2005 and the potential disbursement of billions of dollars from  softwood lumber duties--heighten program risks. CBP\u2019s labor-intensive  process for claims could be streamlined through steps such as regularly  obtaining from the ITC electronic updates of the list of potentially eligible  companies and having companies file CDSOA claims using a standard form  and submit them electronically. CBP\u2019s recent comprehensive company  claim verification effort also indicates that the agency needs additional  guidance in place for filing claims. In addition, CBP lacks plans for  managing and improving its CDSOA program\u2019s processes, staff, and  technology. For instance, it needs a human capital plan for enhancing its  staff in the face of dramatic growth in workload processing for both  CDSOA claims and payments. Accountability for the accuracy of the claims  is virtually non-existent and CBP has no plans to verify claims  systematically or on a routine basis. Finally, CDSOA has helped highlight  CBP\u2019s collection problems. Despite reports to Congress on its efforts to  address these problems, CBP faced a doubling in the AD/CV collections  shortfall in fiscal year 2004, to $260 million.

We then obtained and analyzed ITC and CBP  documents outlining their procedures for carrying out their CDSOA  responsibilities and discussed with agency officials the actions the  agencies have taken to implement CDSOA. We reviewed evaluations of  CDSOA operations in both the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and  ITC conducted by the Inspectors General (IG) of those agencies.  We also  obtained from CBP a statement of work that had been developed for  improving CBP\u2019s management of the CDSOA program.

We also  reviewed documentation of a comprehensive verification of one  company\u2019s CDSOA claims that was conducted using these new  procedures.

All recipient companies in the bearings, DRAMs,  and candles industries provided responses, and these responses can be  generalized. For recipient companies in the other four industries, and for  non-recipient companies in all the industries, the responses we received  cannot be generalized because of the non-probability samples we used  and/or the number of responses we received. Thus, in these cases, the  views we report are not necessarily representative of their respective  groups.  However, we supplemented the information we received with  telephone interviews to verify, and in some cases, expand upon, the  information that some companies provided.

The Asian financial crisis was an important factor in  increasing steel imports to this country, as Asian demand for steel dropped  and foreign steel companies increasingly looked to the United States as a  market for their products. The surge in imports led to the filing of relief  petitions on hot-rolled steel against Russia, Japan, and Brazil beginning in  1998. Companies subsequently filed relief petitions against 11 other  countries. In 2002, the President also took action under section 201 of the  Trade Act of 1974, which allows him to implement temporary relief when  an industry has been seriously injured by surging imports.

Crawfish may be sold whole and live, whole and boiled, or as fresh or  frozen tail meat. Whole crawfish and fresh tail meat is consumed primarily  in Louisiana and neighboring states, where there is generally a preference  for local products in season. Tail meat is also sold more broadly throughout  the United States.

U.S. businesses that process whole crawfish into tail meat are  primarily small, family-owned concerns.
