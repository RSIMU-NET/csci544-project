Besides providing better authentication of the identities of people accessing buildings and computer systems, smart cards offer a number of other potential benefits and uses, such as creating electronic passenger lists for deploying military personnel and tracking immunization and other medical records. Over the past 2 years, GAO has studied and reported on the uses of smart cards across the federal government. Congress requested that GAO testify on federal agencies' efforts in adopting smart card technology--based on the results of this prior work--and on the specific actions that the Department of Veterans Affairs is taking to implement smart card technology."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["As the unique properties and capabilities of smart cards have become more apparent, federal agencies, including the Office of Management and Budget, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the General Services Administration, have acted to advance the governmentwide adoption of smart card technology. In turn, numerous smart card projects that offer a variety of uses and benefits have been launched. As of June 2004, 15 federal agencies reported 34 ongoing smart card projects. Further, agencies' actions toward the adoption of smart cards continue to evolve as understanding of the technology grows. Agencies are moving away from the small-scale, limited-duration demonstration projects of past years (involving as few as 100 cardholders and aiming mostly to show the value of using smart cards for identification) to larger, more integrated, agencywide initiatives involving many thousands (or even millions) of users and that are focused on physical access to facilities and logical (information systems) access to computer systems and networks. In pursuing smart card projects, federal agencies have had to contend with numerous management and technical challenges. However, these challenges may be less imposing in the future because of increased management concerns about securing federal facilities and because technical advances have improved the capabilities and cost effectiveness of smart card systems. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is one of 9 federal agencies currently pursuing large-scale, agencywide smart card initiatives. VA's project, currently in limited deployment, involves using, among other technologies, the One-VA Identification smart card to provide an agencywide capability to authenticate users with certainty and grant them access to information systems essential to accomplishing the agency's business functions. VA estimates that this project will cost about $162 million between 2004 and 2009, and enable it to issue 500,000 smart cards to its employees and contractors."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for this opportunity to participate in the Subcommittee\u2019s  hearing regarding the adoption and use of smart card technology.  Smart cards are plastic devices\u2014about the size of a credit card\u2014 that generally use integrated circuit chips to store and process data,  much like a computer. This processing capability distinguishes these  cards from traditional magnetic stripe cards, which cannot process  information interactively with automated information systems.", "Our prior work has found that smart cards offer a variety of benefits  to the federal government, such as better authentication of  cardholders\u2019 identities, increased security over buildings, more  effective safeguards of computer systems and data, and more  accurate and efficient financial and nonfinancial transactions. The  General Services Administration (GSA) has promoted the adoption  of smart card technology across government based on a goal of  equipping all federal employees with a standardized smart card for a  wide range of services. Nonetheless, the successful adoption of  smart cards throughout the federal government has been a  challenging task, and federal agencies\u2019 adoption of this technology  continues to evolve.", "At your request, my remarks today will summarize the federal  government\u2019s efforts toward adopting smart card technology and  the challenges that have been encountered. Also included in my  discussion is an overview of the actions that the Department of  Veterans Affairs (VA) is taking to implement smart cards. In  addressing these objectives and developing this testimony, we relied  primarily on previously reported information describing federal  agencies\u2019 accomplishments and planned activities to promote smart  cards and the challenges to smart card adoption identified across  the federal government. We also assessed available documentation  and interviewed VA officials regarding their specific actions to  implement smart cards; however, we did not verify the information  that VA provided in support of its initiatives. We performed our  work in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards during September and October 2004."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["As you are aware, technology plays an important role in helping the  federal government ensure the security of its many physical and  information assets. Today, federal employees are issued a wide  variety of identification (ID) cards that are used to access federal  buildings and facilities, sometimes solely on the basis of visual  inspection by security personnel. These cards often cannot be used  for other important identification purposes\u2014such as gaining access  to an agency\u2019s computer systems\u2014and many can be easily forged or  stolen and altered to permit access by unauthorized individuals. In  general, the ease with which traditional ID cards\u2014including credit  cards\u2014can be forged has contributed to an increase in identity theft  and related security and financial problems for both individuals and  organizations.", "The unique advantage of smart cards\u2014as opposed to cards with  simpler technology, such as magnetic stripes or bar codes\u2014is that  smart cards can exchange data with other systems and process  information rather than simply serving as static data repositories.  Smart cards can readily be tailored to meet the varying needs of  federal agencies or to accommodate previously installed systems.  For example, other media, such as magnetic stripes, bar codes, and  optical memory (laser-readable) stripes can be added to smart cards  to support interactions with existing systems and services or to  provide additional storage capacity. An agency that has been using  magnetic stripe cards for access to certain facilities could migrate to  smart cards that would work with both its existing magnetic stripe  readers as well as new smart card readers. Of course, the functions  provided by the card\u2019s magnetic stripe, which cannot process  transactions, would be much more limited than those supported by  the card\u2019s integrated circuit chip. Optical memory stripes (which are  similar to the technology used in commercial compact discs) can be  used to equip a card with a large memory capacity for storing more  extensive data\u2014such as color photos, multiple fingerprint images,  or other digitized images\u2014and for making that card and its stored  data very difficult to counterfeit. A typical example of a smart card  is shown in figure 1.", "Smart cards can be used to significantly enhance the security of an  organization\u2019s computer systems by tightening controls over user  access. A user wishing to log on to a computer system or network  with controlled access must \u201cprove\u201d his or her identity to the  system\u2014a process called authentication. Many systems authenticate  users by requiring them to enter secret passwords, which provide  only modest security because the passwords can be easily  compromised. Substantially better user authentication can be  achieved by supplementing passwords with smart cards.", "Even stronger authentication can be achieved when smart cards are  used in conjunction with biometrics. Smart cards are one type of  media that can be configured to store biometric information\u2014such  as fingerprints or iris scans\u2014in electronic records that can be  retrieved and compared with an individual\u2019s live biometric scan to  verify that person\u2019s identity in a way that is difficult to circumvent. A  system requiring users to present a smart card, enter a password,  and verify a biometric scan provides what security experts call  \u201cthree-factor\u201d authentication, with the three factors being (1)  something you possess (the smart card), (2) something you know  (the password), and (3) something you are (the biometric). Systems  with three-factor authentication are considered to provide a  relatively high level of security.", "Additionally, smart cards can be used in conjunction with public key  infrastructure (PKI) technology to better secure electronic messages  and transactions. A PKI is a system of hardware, software, policies,  and people that, when fully and properly implemented, can provide  a suite of information security assurances that are important in  protecting sensitive communications and transactions. A properly  implemented and maintained PKI can offer several important  security services, including assurance that (1) the parties to an  electronic transaction are really who they claim to be, (2) the  information has not been altered or shared with any unauthorized  entity, and (3) the parties will not be able to deny taking part in the  transaction. Security experts generally agree that PKI technology is  most effective when deployed in conjunction with smart cards.", "Smart cards are grouped into two major classes: contact cards and  \u201ccontactless\u201d cards. Contact cards have gold-plated contacts that  connect directly with the read/write heads of a smart card reader  when the card is inserted into the device. Contactless cards contain  an embedded antenna and work when the card is waved within the  magnetic field of a card reader or terminal. Contactless cards are  better suited for environments where quick interaction between the  card and reader is required, such as high-volume physical access.  For example, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority  has deployed an automated fare collection system using contactless  smart cards as a way of speeding patrons\u2019 access to the Washington,  D.C. subway system. Smart cards can be configured to include both  contact and contactless capabilities; however, two separate  interfaces are needed because standards for the technologies are  very different."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Agencies\u2019 Pursuit of Smart Card Technology Is Evolving and Involves Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Since the 1990s, the federal government has considered the use of  smart card technology as one option for electronically improving  security over buildings and computer systems. In 1996, OMB tasked  GSA with taking the lead in facilitating a coordinated interagency  management approach for the adoption of multi-application smart  cards across government. In this regard, GSA has taken important  steps to promote federal smart card use. For example, since 1998, it  has worked with several other federal agencies to promote broad  adoption of smart cards for authentication throughout the federal  government. Specifically, GSA worked with the Department of the  Navy to establish a technology demonstration center to showcase  smart card technology and applications and it established a smart  card project managers\u2019 group and Government Smart Card  Interagency Advisory Board.", "For many federal agencies, GSA\u2019s chief contribution toward  promoting smart card adoption was its effort in 2000 to develop a  standard contracting vehicle for use by federal agencies in procuring  commercial smart card products from vendors. Under the terms of  the Smart Access Common ID Card contract, GSA, NIST, and the  contract\u2019s awardees worked together to develop smart card  interoperability guidelines\u2014including an architectural model,  interface definitions, and standard data elements\u2014that were  intended to guarantee that all the products made available through  the contract would be capable of working together.", "Further, OMB has begun taking action to develop a framework of  policy guidance for governmentwide smart card adoption.  Specifically, on July 3, 2003, OMB\u2019s Administrator for E-Government  and Information Technology issued a memorandum detailing  specific actions the administration was taking to streamline  authentication and identity management in the federal government.  This included establishing the Federal Identity and Credentialing  Committee to collect agency input on policy and requirements and  coordinate the development of a comprehensive policy for  credentialing federal employees.", "Since 1998, multiple smart card projects have been launched in the  federal government addressing an array of capabilities and  providing many tangible and intangible benefits, including  enhancing security over buildings and other facilities, safeguarding  computer systems and data, and conducting financial and  nonfinancial transactions more accurately and efficiently. As of June  2004, 15 federal agencies reported 34 ongoing smart card projects.", "Initially, many of the smart card initiatives that were undertaken  were small-scale demonstration projects that involved as few as 100  cardholders and intended to show the value of using smart cards for  identification or to store cash value or other personal information.  However, federal efforts toward the adoption of smart cards have  continued to evolve as agencies have gained an increased  understanding of the technology and its potential uses and benefits.  Our most recent study of federal agencies\u2019 investments in smart card  technology, which we reported on last month, noted that agencies  are increasingly moving away from many of their earlier efforts\u2014 which frequently involved small-scale, limited-duration pilot  projects\u2014toward much larger, integrated, agencywide initiatives  aimed at providing smart cards as identity credentials that agency  employees can use to gain both physical access to facilities, such as  buildings, and logical access to computer systems and networks. In  some cases, additional functions, such as asset management and  stored value, are also being included.", "To date, the largest smart card program to be implemented in the  federal government is the Common Access Card program of the  Department of Defense (DOD), which is intended to be used for  identification by about 3.5 million military and civilian personnel.  Results from this project have indicated that smart cards can offer  many useful benefits, such as significantly reducing the processing  time required for deploying military personnel, tracking  immunization records of dependent children, and verifying the  identity of individuals accessing buildings and computer systems.", "Another large agencywide initiative is the Department of Homeland  Security\u2019s (DHS) Identification and Credentialing project, an effort  in which the agency plans to issue 250,000 cards to employees and  contractors using PKI technology for logical access and proximity  chips for physical access. Authentication is to rely on biometrics  with a personal identification number as a backup. Further, GSA\u2019s  Nationwide Identification is a recently initiated agencywide smart  card project in which the agency plans to issue a single standard  credential card for identification, building access, property  management, and other applications to 61,000 federal employees,  contractors, and tenant agencies.", "While smart card technology offers benefits, launching smart card  projects\u2014whether large or small\u2014has proved challenging to federal  agencies and efforts to sustain successful adoption of the  technology across government. Our prior work noted a number of  management and technical challenges that agency managers have  faced. These challenges include:  \u25cf  Sustaining executive-level commitment. Maintaining executive- level commitment is essential to implementing smart card  technology effectively. Without this support and clear direction,  large-scale smart card initiatives may encounter organizational  resistance and cost concerns that lead to delays and cancellations.  DOD officials stated that having a formal mandate from the Deputy  Secretary of Defense to implement a uniform, common access  identification card across the department was essential to getting a  project as large as the Common Access Card initiative launched and  funded.  \u25cf  Recognizing resource requirements. Smart card implementation  costs can be high, particularly if significant infrastructure  modifications are required, or other technologies, such as  biometrics and PKI, are being implemented in tandem with the  cards. Key implementation activities that can be costly include  managing contractors and card suppliers, developing systems and  interfaces with existing personnel or credentialing systems,  installing equipment and systems to distribute the cards, and  training personnel to issue and use smart cards. As a result, agency  officials have found that obtaining adequate resources is critical to  implementing a major government smart card system.  \u25cf  Integrating physical and logical security practices across  organizations. The ability of smart card systems to address both  physical and logical (information systems) security means that  unprecedented levels of cooperation may be required among  internal organizations that often had not previously collaborated,  particularly physical security organizations and information  technology organizations. In addition to the gap between physical  and logical security organizations, the sheer number of separate and  incompatible existing systems also adds to the challenge of  establishing an integrated agencywide smart card system.  \u25cf  Achieving interoperability among smart card systems.", "Interoperability is a key consideration in smart card deployment.  The value of a smart card is greatly enhanced if it can be used with  multiple systems at different agencies, and GSA has reported that  virtually all agencies agree that interoperability at some level is  critical to widespread adoption of smart cards across the  government. However, achieving interoperability has been difficult  because smart card products and systems developed in the past  have generally been incompatible in all but very rudimentary ways.  With varying products available from many vendors, there has been  no obvious choice for an interoperability standard. GSA considered  the achievement of interoperability across card systems to be one of  its main priorities in developing its Smart Access Common ID Card  contract that I discussed earlier.  \u25cf  Maintaining security of smart card systems and privacy of  personal information. Although concerns about security are a key  driver for the adoption of smart card technology in the federal  government, the security of smart card systems themselves is not  foolproof and must be addressed when agencies plan the  implementation of a smart card system. Although smart card  systems are generally much more difficult to attack than traditional  ID cards and password-protected systems, they are not invulnerable.  In order to obtain the improved security services that smart cards  offer, care must be taken to ensure that the cards and their  supporting systems do not pose unacceptable security risks. In  addition, protecting the privacy of personal information is a growing  concern and must be addressed with regard to the personal  information contained on the smart cards. Once in place, smart  card-based systems designed simply to control access to facilities  and systems could also be used to track the day-to-day activities of  individuals, thus potentially compromising the individual\u2019s privacy.  Further, smart card-based systems could be used to aggregate  sensitive information about individuals for purposes other than  those prompting the initial collection of the information, which  could compromise privacy. The Privacy Act of 1974 requires the  federal government to restrict the disclosure of personally  identifiable records maintained by federal agencies while permitting  individuals access to their own records and the right to seek  amendment of agency records that are inaccurate, irrelevant,  untimely, or incomplete. Further, the E-Government Act of 2002  requires agencies to conduct privacy impact assessments before  developing or procuring information technology that collects,  maintains, or disseminates personally identifiable information.  Accordingly, agency officials need to assess and plan for  appropriate privacy measures when implementing smart card-based  systems and ensure that privacy impact assessments are conducted  when required.", "In considering these challenges, it is important to note that, while  they served to slow the adoption of smart card technology in past  years, they may be less difficult in the future because of increased  management concerns about securing federal facilities and  information systems and because technical advances have improved  the capabilities and reduced the cost of smart card systems.  Nonetheless, sustained diligence in responding to such challenges is  essential in light of the growing emphasis on the use of smart card  technology.", "Recognizing the critical role that GSA, OMB, and NIST play in  furthering the successful adoption of smart card technology, we  made recommendations in January 2003 to these agencies that were  aimed at advancing the adoption of smart card technology  governmentwide. Specifically, we recommended that   \u25cf  the Director, OMB, issue governmentwide policy guidance regarding  adoption of smart cards for secure access to physical and logical  assets;  \u25cf  the Director, NIST, continue to improve and update the government  smart card interoperability specification by addressing  governmentwide standards for additional technologies\u2014such as  contactless cards, biometrics, and optical stripe media\u2014as well as  integration with PKI; and  \u25cf  the Administrator, GSA, improve the effectiveness of GSA\u2019s  promotion of smart card technologies within the federal government  by (1) developing an internal implementation strategy with specific  goals and milestones to ensure that GSA\u2019s internal organizations  support and implement smart card systems consistently; (2)  updating its governmentwide implementation strategy and  administrative guidance on implementing smart card systems to  address current security priorities; (3) establishing guidelines for  federal building security that address the role of smart card  technology; and (4) developing a process for conducting ongoing  evaluations of the implementation of smart card-based systems by  federal agencies to ensure that lessons learned and best practices  are shared across government.", "As of last month, all three agencies had taken actions to address the  recommendations made to them. Specifically, in response to our  recommendations, OMB issued its July 3, 2003, memorandum to  major departments and agencies directing them to coordinate and  consolidate investments related to authentication and identity  management, including the implementation of smart card  technology. NIST responded by improving and updating the  government smart card interoperability specification to address  additional technologies, including contactless cards and  biometrics. GSA responded to our recommendations by updating  its \u201cSmart Card Policy and Administrative Guidance\u201d to better  address security priorities, including minimum-security standards  for federal facilities, computer systems, and data across the  government.", "However, three of our four recommendations to GSA remained  outstanding. GSA officials stated that they were working to address  the recommendations to develop an internal GSA smart card  implementation strategy, develop a process for conducting  evaluations of smart card implementations, and share lessons  learned and best practices across government. The responsibility for  one recommendation\u2014establishing guidelines for federal building  security that address the role of smart card technology\u2014was  transferred to DHS.", "Recent federal direction contained in Homeland Security  Presidential Directive 12 could further facilitate smart card  adoption across the federal government. This directive, signed in  late August, seeks to establish a common identification standard for  federal employees and contractors to protect against a litany of  threats, including terrorism and identity theft. The directive  instructs the Departments of Commerce, State, Defense, Justice, and  Homeland Security to work with OMB and the Office of Science and  Technology Policy to institute the new standards and policies. With  federal agencies\u2019 increasing pursuit of smart cards, directives from  central management such as this one could be an important vehicle  for ensuring that more comprehensive guidance is available to  support and sustain the broader implementation of agencywide  smart card initiatives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA Is Pursuing Agencywide Use of Smart Cards", "paragraphs": ["Mr. Chairman, beyond the governmentwide assessment presented,  you requested that we specifically address actions of the  Department of Veterans Affairs in adopting smart card technology.

The initiative, currently in a limited deployment  phase, involves three core components: (1) a One-VA ID smart card;  (2) an enterprise PKI solution; and (3) an identity and access  management infrastructure that addresses internal and external  access requirements for VA users. VA currently estimates that,  between fiscal years 2004 and 2009, this initiative will cost about  $162 million.", "The project is currently focusing on development of the One-VA ID  card, which is to employ a combination of smart card and PKI  technologies to store a user\u2019s credentials digitally. According to  project documentation, the One-VA ID card is intended to replace  the several hundred methods for issuing identification cards that are  currently in place across the department, and improve physical and  information security by strengthening the ability to authenticate  users and grant access to information systems that employees and  contractors rely on to perform VA\u2019s business functions. As an  official source of government identification credentialing, the card is  expected to be compliant with Homeland Security Presidential  Directive 12.", "VA is using a phased approach to develop and implement the One- VA ID card. This approach involves prototype testing followed by  limited production testing at the department\u2019s facilities in the United  States, and by 2006, the issuance of 500,000 cards with PKI  credentials to its personnel. VA reported that it has already begun an  initial limited deployment of the cards to about 15,000 to 25,000  users. The AAIP project manager anticipated that the results from  this limited deployment would provide lessons learned for ensuring  successful implementation, support, and training once full  deployment of the One-VA ID card begins in early 2005. Further, the  department has indicated that it plans to use information gathered  from the limited deployment to create agency-wide policies and  procedures for the full deployment of smart cards across all VA  business units. As of late September, VA reported that fiscal year  2004 spending on the One-VA ID card totaled approximately $27  million for activities such as the acquisition of smart cards, card  readers, and hardware support.", "We have not yet had an opportunity to fully assess the outcomes of  the department\u2019s One-VA ID card initiative or its actions to develop  the enterprise PKI solution and identity and access management  infrastructure that are also key components of this initiative.  However, VA officials believe that the department is sufficiently  positioned to successfully implement the smart card technology on  an agencywide level. The AAIP project manager noted the chief  information officer\u2019s involvement, as chair of the department\u2019s  Enterprise Information Board, in monitoring progress of the project.", "Further, as a participant in a number of governmentwide initiatives  supporting the adoption of smart card technology, VA should be  effectively positioned to carry out such an undertaking. Among its  collaborations, VA is one of five agencies using GSA\u2019s Smart Card  Access Common ID contracting vehicle and plans to purchase smart  cards for AAIP through the GSA contract. It is also a member of the  Federal Identity Credentialing Committee, which provides guidance  to federal agencies on the use of smart card technology that  supports interoperable identity and authentication to enable an  individual\u2019s identity to be verified within an agency and across the  federal enterprise for both physical and logical networks.  Collectively, the department\u2019s experiences and collaborations  should lend strength to its own and overall federal efforts toward  making smart cards a key means of securing critical information and  assets.", "In summary, the federal government is continuing to make progress  in promoting and implementing smart card technology, which offers  clear benefits for enhancing security over access to buildings and  other facilities, as well as computer systems and networks. The  adoption of such technology is continuing to evolve, with a number  of large-scale, agencywide projects having been undertaken by  federal agencies over the past several years. As agencies have  sought greater use of smart cards, they have had to contend with a  number of significant management and technical challenges,  including sustaining executive-level commitment, recognizing  resource requirements, integrating physical and logical security  practices, achieving interoperability, and maintaining system  security and privacy of personal information. These challenges  become less difficult to address, however, as managers place greater  emphasis on enhancing the security of federal facilities and  information systems and technical advances improve the  capabilities and reduce the costs of smart card systems. The  challenges are also tempered as increased federal guidance brings  direction to agencies\u2019 handlings of their smart card initiatives.", "VA is among a number of agencies currently undertaking large-scale,  agencywide projects to implement smart cards. While its project is  still under development, VA has gained experience as a participant  on governmentwide initiatives to further smart card adoption that  should facilitate the increasing movement toward the use of smart  cards as an essential means of securing critical information and  assets.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my statement.
