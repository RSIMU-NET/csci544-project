It manages approximately 264 million acres of public land in 28 states\u2014about one-eighth of the land in the United States. It also manages the subsurface mineral resources on another 300 million acres of lands administered by other government agencies or owned by private interests. Public resources managed by BLM include rangelands, timber, minerals, watersheds, wildlife habitats, wilderness and recreation areas, and archaeological and historical resources. The bureau has 210 state, district, and resource area offices that manage over 1 billion paper documents, including land surveys and surveyor notes, records of land ownership, mining claims, and oil and gas leases. According to BLM, most of the paper documents are deteriorating and becoming increasingly difficult to read.", "During the energy boom in the early 1980s, BLM found that it could not handle the case processing workload associated with a peak in the number of applications for oil and gas leases. It recognized that to keep up with increased demand, it needed to automate its manual records and case processing activities. Thus, in the mid-1980s, the bureau began planning to acquire an automated land and mineral case processing system. The scope and functionality of the planned system changed over the years, ranging from a system to automate paper documents and records and case processing activities to a system that would provide improved efficiency for recording, maintaining, and retrieving land description, ownership, and use information and provide geographic information system (GIS)capabilities.", "In 1993, BLM decided on the scope and functionality of the ALMRS/Modernization. The bureau designated it a critical system for (1) automating land and mineral records and case processing activities and (2) providing information to support land and resource management activities. The ALMRS/Modernization is expected to more efficiently record, maintain, and retrieve land description, ownership, and use information to support BLM, other federal programs, and interested parties. It is to do this by establishing a common information technology platform, integrating multiple databases into a single geographically referenced database, shortening the time to complete case processing activities, and replacing costly manual records with automated ones.", "The ALMRS/Modernization consists of the ALMRS IOC, geographic coordinate database (GCDB), and modernization of BLM\u2019s computer and telecommunications infrastructure and rehosting of selected management and administrative systems. These components are described more fully below.", "The ALMRS IOC is the flagship of the ALMRS/Modernization. With new software and upgraded hardware, it is to provide (1) support for case processing activities, including leasing oil and gas reserves, recording valid mining claims, processing mineral patents, and granting rights-of-way for roads and power corridors and (2) information for land and resource management activities, including timber sales and grazing leases. ALMRS IOC is to replace various manual and ad hoc automated BLM systems currently operating on older mainframe computers.", "GCDB is the database that is to contain geographic coordinates and survey information for land parcels. Other databases, such as those containing land and mineral records, are to be integrated with GCDB. ALMRS IOC will tie BLM\u2019s records and land and mineral resource data to the legal descriptions of specific land parcels.", "The information technology modernization and rehost component consists of installing computer and telecommunications equipment and office automation applications, and converting selected management and administrative systems to a relational database system to be used throughout BLM.", "Some elements of the ALMRS/Modernization, such as new computer and telecommunications equipment, e-mail, and office automation, were installed at BLM offices from fiscal years 1994 through 1996. The 12 administrative applications have been rehosted and are operational. According to BLM\u2019s latest estimates, the ALMRS/Modernization is expected to cost about $594 million through fiscal year 2002, about 47 percent more than the $403 million estimate provided to the Office of Management and Budget in 1993. According to the Assistant Director for Information Resources Management (IRM), the increase is largely due to costs that were not included in the original agreement with OMB, including almost $105 million for technology refreshment.", "Concerned that BLM might deploy the system prematurely, the House and Senate appropriations committees in fiscal year 1996 directed BLM to (1) test, verify, and validate that ALMRS operates as specified and (2) certify to them that it performs accurately and effectively and provides the expected capabilities prior to deployment. BLM retained a contractor to conduct the independent verification and validation testing and an operational assessment, testing, and evaluation and expects to base its certification to the committees on these tests.

The transition from automated capabilities provided by a centrally managed mainframe system to a locally managed client-server environment requires changes in organizational roles, responsibilities, and interrelationships among the units and people using the system. A transition plan should address these issues and guide BLM in defining new operational procedures.

This plan describes the (1) routine operations and maintenance services that the National Information Resources Management Center will provide and (2) approach that will be used to provide management and technical guidance necessary for the operations and maintenance of ALMRS. The plan, however, does not address how BLM will provide for operations and maintenance functions at the major BLM sites that will be responsible for operating and maintaining ALMRS on a daily basis. This is critical because BLM will be relying on ALMRS to conduct its business and maintain its official records.

This information is summarized in the \u201cAgency Comments\u201d section of the report. 2. In discussing BLM\u2019s comments, the Assistant Director for IRM told us that a primary reason for the increased estimated cost from $403 million to $594 million is that $105 million of technology refreshment costs were not included in the estimate provided to OMB. We revised the report to clarify this point. We also note that technology refreshment costs, as well as the other costs BLM mentioned, are properly a part of life-cycle costs and should have been included in the initially approved $403 million life-cycle estimate provided to OMB. 3. In BLM\u2019s comments on the ALMRS project schedule, it stated that GAO staff has supported placing emphasis on completing a successful pilot as opposed to meeting an artificially derived schedule. We agree that emphasis should be placed on successfully completing all testing, including the pilot test. Testing is an essential part of developing and deploying an efficient and effective system.", "We also agree that BLM should not try to meet artificially derived milestones. A complete, current, and accurate schedule with tasks linked to available resources is an essential tool to manage and control a large-scale project. This is the primary reason why we have addressed the project schedule in this report and in our two prior reports on ALMRS. The project schedule should have been based on tasks to be completed, resources associated with task completion, and a critical path with sufficient time allotted to deal with unanticipated problems. BLM has not done this. 4. BLM noted that the Configuration Management Plan and program were fully implemented about a month after we completed our fieldwork. As we note in the report, we did not assess the configuration management program during our review because the plan had not been completed and the program had not yet been fully implemented before the end of our fieldwork. 5. As we discuss in the report, the risk assessment performed at the New Mexico State Office focused on policies, procedures, and conditions at that office. The risk assessment did not deal with the security of, or assess the vulnerabilities of and risks to, ALMRS. In addition, until a full risk assessment of ALMRS is completed and documented, BLM has no basis for asserting that the system is secure or that the plan adequately addresses the vulnerabilities and risks attendant to a nationwide client-server system. 6. Our review of BLM\u2019s updated transition plans showed that only one of the four plans identified and addressed transition issues. As we discuss in the report, the transition from automated capabilities provided by centrally managed mainframe legacy systems to the locally-managed client server environment of ALMRS will require changes in organizational roles, responsibilities, and interrelationships among the units and people using the system. A transition plan should address these issues and guide BLM in defining new operational procedures. Our concern is that with the complexity of ALMRS and the business process changes it will require, BLM needs to ensure that its transition plans provide the necessary guidance for successful transitions in its 210 state, district, and resource area offices. 7. Operations and maintenance plans are essential for operating and maintaining ALMRS on a daily basis. BLM noted that the states will update the operations and maintenance plans for their sites. In updating their plans, the state offices will need specific information that clearly describes how they are to fulfill their day-to-day responsibilities and how these responsibilities will be fulfilled when there are unexpected shortages of qualified staff. 8. We agree. Beta testing is testing of a prerelease version of software by selected cooperating users in order to uncover problems that were not discovered during laboratory testing.
