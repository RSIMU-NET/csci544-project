To assist in performing these seemingly contradictory activities, Customs recognized that because of the high volume of imported cargo entering the country, processes were needed to identify low-risk cargo and facilitate its movement so that inspectors could focus on shipments that were potentially higher risk for narcotics smuggling. Toward this end, Customs developed several low-risk, cargo entry programs designed to process certain cargo expeditiously and at the same time target, for additional scrutiny, those shipments considered to be high risk for drug smuggling.", "In response to your request that we review Customs\u2019 drug-enforcement operations along the Southwest border of the United States, this report describes Customs\u2019 low-risk, cargo entry programs in use at three ports on the Southwest border and discusses the results of our evaluation of the internal controls over the Line Release Program and processes used to assess the risk of narcotics smuggling in other cargo entry programs. In developing information for this report, we (1) interviewed key officials and reviewed program documents at Customs\u2019 headquarters and at three Customs Management Centers located along the Southwest border and (2) visited three cargo ports of entry\u2014Otay Mesa, CA; Laredo, TX; and Nogales, AZ. At each port we visited, we interviewed key officials, reviewed program documents, and observed cargo entry processes\u2014including inspection and enforcement activities\u2014used by the ports to detect illegal drugs.

It also processes persons, carriers, cargo, and mail into and out of the United States. One of Customs\u2019 major goals is to prevent the smuggling of drugs into the country by creating an effective drug interdiction, intelligence, and investigation capability that disrupts and dismantles smuggling organizations.", "Customs performs its mission with a workforce of about 19,000 personnel at its headquarters in Washington, D.C., and at 20 Customs Management Centers, 20 investigative offices, and 301 ports of entry around the country. Of the 301 ports, 24 are located along the Southwest border and\u2014through 39 crossing points (such as bridges)\u2014handle both passengers and commercial cargo entering the United States. At the end of fiscal year 1997, Customs had deployed about 28 percent of its inspectors and about 62 percent of its canine enforcement officers at ports along the Southwest border.", "The Commissioner of Customs has designated drug enforcement to be Customs\u2019 highest priority. As 1 of more than 50 federal agencies involved in the national drug control effort, Customs is responsible for stopping the flow of illegal drugs through the nation\u2019s ports of entry. Customs\u2019 inspectional, investigative, intelligence, canine, marine, and air interdiction assets combine with the efforts of other agencies to reduce the supply of narcotics coming into the country. In addition to routine (primary) inspections to search passengers, cargo, and conveyances (including cars, buses, trucks, aircraft, and vessels), Customs\u2019 drug interdiction efforts include (1) preprimary and postprimary inspections; (2) a more thorough, intensive inspection (secondary) of suspicious shipments or those automatically selected by Customs\u2019 computer system; (3) canine enforcement inspections; (4) inspections using X-ray machines for cargo and trucks; and (5) inspections of randomly selected groups of vehicles using canines and other inspection tools."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Internal Control Weaknesses and Other Issues Raise Concerns About the Line Release Program", "paragraphs": ["Line Release is one of two programs the Customs Service is using at its land-border cargo ports to segregate low-risk shipments from other shipments. The Line Release Program was established on the assumption that port officials would know enough about the companies\u2014the brokers, importers, and manufacturers\u2014that participated in the program to assume that they would be unlikely to smuggle drugs. Our review indicated that the internal controls over the Line Release Program at three ports were lax and that port officials could not be reasonably assured that companies approved as low risk under this program should have been designated as such and afforded the benefits that go with it."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Description of the Line Release Program", "paragraphs": ["The theory behind the Line Release Program is that companies that routinely import goods through a port and are generally in compliance with trade laws and Customs regulations pose significantly less risk for drug smuggling than other companies. Customs believes that if ports could identify and designate certain companies as low risk for drug smuggling, inspectors would have more assurance that these companies\u2019 shipments may pose a lower risk than those of other companies. Truck drivers transporting shipments for companies approved under the Line Release Program are not required to stop inside the port at the dock to process paperwork; this procedure expedites their entry processing, frees dock space for trucks that are required to stop, and allows inspectors to focus their attention on higher-risk shipments.", "The Line Release Program was first implemented in 1986 on the Northern border and was designed to expedite the release and tracking of high-volume, low-risk shipments by prescreening manufacturers, brokers, and importers to ensure that they did not present a threat of drug smuggling. In 1987, Customs began implementing the Line Release Program at cargo ports along the Southwest border; by the end of 1989, most of the major Southwest border cargo ports had fully implemented the program.", "Customs\u2019 regulations for the Line Release Program, which became effective in 1992, are published in the Code of Federal Regulations.Customs port directors are responsible for screening, reviewing, and approving Line Release applicants. Program applicants are required to complete and submit an application to the port director for review and approval.", "In 1993, Customs issued guidance on the administration and use of the Line Release Program. According to Customs, this guidance combined all the Line Release policies and procedures issued since the program\u2019s inception. The guidance instructed port directors to establish their own procedures for screening, reviewing, and approving applications; and it suggested that specific port personnel, such as import specialists, review the applications. The guidance did not specify what criteria ports should consider in approving applicants or what the reviews should entail, although it did state that the purpose of the reviews would be to conduct risk analyses of applicants to determine if they qualified for Line Release. The guidance did not require port officials to maintain any specific documentation on the review and approval process.", "In August 1997, Customs developed national Draft Line Release Quality Standards that, among other things, established volume and compliance eligibility criteria for program applicants and recertification standards for program participants. The volume criterion proposes that applicants should have had \u201cat least 50 shipments . . . within the previous 12 months prior to the filing of the application.\u201d The compliance criterion proposes that the applicants should have had \u201cat least five Customs intensive examinations with no discrepant findings, or more than five Customs examinations with no more than a 10 percent discrepancy rate.\u201d The recertification standards propose that Line Release participants be reviewed at least annually to ensure they have had 50 shipments within the preceding 12 months. Biennially, participants are to be reviewed to ensure they have met a minimum compliance rate of 90 percent. In May 1998, Customs convened a Line Release Conference in San Diego, CA, during which representatives from northern and southern land-border cargo ports discussed, among other things, the above eligibility criteria and recertification standards, and agreed to finalize and issue the Line Release Quality Standards at the end of fiscal year 1998.", "Each of the three ports we reviewed had developed a two-part process for screening, reviewing, and approving Line Release applicants, although the eligibility criteria and review procedures differed somewhat among the ports. Part one of each port\u2019s process involved screening applicants to determine whether they met the port\u2019s eligibility criteria for participating in Line Release\u2014a high-volume of shipments each year and a history of compliance with trade laws and Customs commercial importing regulations. The second part of each port\u2019s process involved several components, including (1) verification of the data submitted by the applicants (i.e., verification of company name, address, identification number, etc.); (2) review of the application by an import specialist to ensure that, among other things, the commodity (merchandise) was properly classified; and (3) a background check on the applicants to ensure they had no past history of drug smuggling.", "Each port had developed a Line Release checklist that was used to evaluate the applications and track them through this process, as well as a checklist that recorded the results of the background checks conducted on applicants. Although the ports\u2019 Line Release checklists varied, they included some of the same elements, such as approval by an import specialist and the Line Release coordinator. In addition, the checklists used to record and track background checks also included many of the same elements, such as name and address verifications, Internal Revenue Service numbers, and smuggling history.", "In July 1996, Customs implemented the Land Border Carrier Initiative Program (Carrier Initiative Program). The program requires participating carriers to be prescreened by Customs\u2014through background checks and site visits\u2014and approved as low risk for drug smuggling. At the time this program was implemented, Customs established a new requirement that all Line Release participants (brokers, importers, and manufacturers) on the Southwest border use carriers (trucks and drivers) approved under the Carrier Initiative Program.", "In fiscal year 1996, cargo entries along the Southwest border totaled 1,408,790 of which 277,382 or about 20 percent, were Line Release entries. In fiscal year 1997, total entries increased by nearly 15 percent to 1,617,445, while Line Release entries dropped by almost 29 percent to 197,344, or about 12 percent of total entries. Customs officials attributed the drop in Line Release entries to the implementation of the Carrier Initiative Program in July 1996. Of the three ports we reviewed, Otay Mesa had the largest number of Line Release entries during fiscal years 1996 and 1997 (see table 1) and, in fiscal year 1997, the greatest number of participants. Officials at the Laredo and Nogales cargo ports told us that Line Release entries dropped significantly at their ports at the time the Carrier Initiative Program went into effect. Laredo and Nogales officials said companies did not want to participate in the program either because they already had contracts with nonprogram carriers or because they did not want to tie themselves to Carrier Initiative\u2014approved carriers, many of whom were located near the border and not the Mexican interior, where many of the commodities were produced."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Weak Internal Controls Over the Line Release Program at Three Ports", "paragraphs": ["Although each of the three ports we reviewed had developed a process for screening and approving applicants, we found internal control weaknesses in the procedures actually followed.

One official estimated that approximately 70 percent of cargo shipments at Laredo are Prefile shipments, although statistics were not maintained to confirm this figure.", "A disadvantage of the Prefile Process is that unlike the Line Release process, Prefile focuses on the importer, broker, and manufacturer and does not require the use of prescreened carriers. Companies participating in the Line Release Program are required to use preapproved carriers and drivers cleared under the Carrier Initiative Program. According to a September 1997 report from the Office of National Drug Control Policy,76 percent of the seizures made in the Southwest border commercial cargo environment during 1997 were found in the conveyance (truck and trailer), not in the actual cargo."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Automated Targeting System Designed to Assist in Identifying Shipments Warranting Extra Inspectional Attention", "paragraphs": ["In May 1997 Laredo began pilot testing, in conjunction with the Prefile Process, a computerized system called the Automated Targeting System. The Automated Targeting System assists the port in identifying shipments that could pose a high risk for drug smuggling. According to Customs, the system is designed to help the port prioritize shipments according to threat, in order to allow the port to more effectively use resources and to ensure that shipments that pose the highest risk for smuggling are researched first.", "The Automated Targeting System standardizes entry and entry-summary data received from the broker and creates integrated records called \u201cshipments.\u201d The shipments are to be evaluated and scored by the Automated Targeting System through the use of approximately 400 weighted \u201crules\u201d designed to identify or profile high-risk shipments. According to the system\u2019s program officer, the rules are based on targeting and evaluation methods successfully used by experienced Customs inspectors. The higher the score, the more the shipment warrants attention.", "Customs inspectors may use the score to determine whether the shipment should be detained for inspection after it reaches the port. For example, a shipment going to a \u201cfirst-time importer\u201d might be selected for an intensive inspection. One of the rules used for scoring a potentially high-risk shipment is a first-time importer because little information is available about first-time importers on which to assess the risk of drug smuggling.", "The Automated Targeting System also allows Customs inspectors to query several databases simultaneously to conduct background checks on importers, brokers, and manufacturers associated with a shipment.

Depending on the outcome of Laredo\u2019s pilot test, Customs may expand the system to all major seaports, airports, and land-border ports of entry. Customs is currently evaluating the pilot test at Laredo. According to the system\u2019s program officer, Customs does not plan to expand the system to other land-border, cargo ports of entry until an evaluation has been completed. According to the program officer, the system will be assessed for use at other Southwest border ports on the basis of three factors: (1) drug threat, (2) volume of shipments and method of processing (i.e., Line Release, etc.), and (3) technological capability. Laredo port officials told us they are tracking drug seizures attributed to the Automated Targeting System; as of May 1998, three marijuana seizures had been made, totaling over 5,000 pounds."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The Customs Service is faced with the challenge of facilitating the flow of legitimate cargo into the United States while, at the same time, detecting and intercepting illegal drug smuggling. Customs has developed several programs to try to identify shipments that are lower risk than others and give more inspectional attention to the higher-risk shipments. Theoretically, these programs would facilitate the processing of lower risk cargo and enable Customs to use its inspectional resources more efficiently and effectively.", "The key to the success of these programs is Customs\u2019 ability to identify the risk that any given shipment poses. Our review of three programs at three Southwest border ports raises several concerns about the implementation of two of these programs. The weak internal controls over the Line Release Program at three ports may not assure Customs that program participants, at these three ports, are fully researched and properly designated as low risk.", "Further, port officials\u2019 concerns about the Three Tier Targeting Program raise questions about the continued value or utility of the program at the three ports we visited. Officials at all three ports said that the program should be discontinued, and that they relied on other programs for distinguishing high- and low-risk shipments. These reasons cause us to conclude that the Three Tier Targeting Program may not be an effective tool for assessing narcotics risk.", "We recognize that under current operating conditions, Customs will not be able to subject all cargo entering the United States to intensive inspections to detect drug smuggling. We also recognize that inadequately controlled processes for identifying low-risk shipments can give Customs inspectors a false sense of confidence that those shipments are low risk for drug smuggling. While the Prefile Process, used in conjunction with the Automated Targeting System, seems to have the potential to offer the advantage of basing inspection decisions on more current information than the Line Release and the Three Tier Targeting programs, it does not cover the carriers, and has not been thoroughly evaluated."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Commissioner of Customs strengthen internal control procedures for the Line Release application and review process to ensure fully researched and documented risk-assessment decisions on applicants; suspend the Three Tier Targeting Program until it can be determined if more complete and comprehensive data are available on which to base \u201clow risk for narcotics smuggling\u201d risk assessments; and evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the Automated Targeting System, as designed and implemented at Laredo, and use the evaluation results to determine whether other land-border cargo ports should implement the system or whether additional testing is needed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["Treasury provided written comments on a draft of this report, and its comments are reprinted in appendix III. Overall, Treasury and Customs management generally agreed with our conclusions, and Customs is taking action, or is planning to take action, on all of our recommendations.", "Regarding our first recommendation, Treasury stated in its written comments that Customs\u2019 Office of Field Operations plans to publish the Line Release Quality Standards in the form of a Headquarters Directive by the end of fiscal year 1998. According to Treasury, this directive will create consistent national criteria and guidance with regard to the application procedures. Included will be a requirement for ports to retain the original approved applications and supporting documentation on file for as long as the applicants are active participants in the program.", "Regarding our second recommendation, Treasury agreed that the Three Tier Program should be suspended until more reliable information is developed for classifying low-risk importations. Treasury stated in its written comments that Customs believes its other targeting methods, including the Line Release Program, the Automated Targeting System, the Prefile Program, and the Land Border Carrier Initiative Program, are better able to fulfill Customs\u2019 narcotic interdiction goals and responsibilities.", "Regarding our third recommendation, Treasury said Customs is currently evaluating the Automated Targeting System as implemented at the port of Laredo. It also plans to assess data regarding cargo volume and cargo processes used\u2014e.g., Line Release\u2014on other Southwest border ports of entry to determine future deployment of the system.", "Customs management, in their written comments, acknowledged that the Prefile Process, used in conjunction with the Automated Targeting System, does not require the use of preapproved carriers and drivers cleared under the Carrier Initiative Program and that this could be seen as a disadvantage. They also stated that the Prefile approach narrows the scope of Customs\u2019 interdiction efforts to focus on the driver and conveyance because the cargo has been determined to be low risk. Customs pointed out that Prefile shipments are also subject to other enforcement actions, including (1) random checks performed on all companies using the Prefile Process, (2) X-ray and detection dogs, and (3) the experience and knowledge of Customs inspectors. Nevertheless, we still feel that the fact that the Prefile Process does not require shipments to use carriers preapproved under the Carrier Initiative Program is a significant disadvantage. Line Release shipments are also subject to the same enforcement actions mentioned above. Yet, in July 1996, Customs strengthened the Line Release Program by requiring all participants on the Southwest border to use carriers approved under the Carrier Initiatives Program.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of the Treasury, the Acting Commissioner of Customs, and to the Chairmen and Ranking Minority Members of the congressional committees that have responsibilities related to these issues.
