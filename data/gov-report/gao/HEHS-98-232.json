Other (often smaller) districts may be involved with the federal government through a smaller number of more broadly targeted programs and requirements, such as those that provide funding for teacher training.", "Although there has been widespread agreement on the need to improve the educational system, school districts are central to some education reform efforts and more peripheral to others. Certain education reform movements, like charter schools, have minimized the role of the school district. In contrast, in other reform efforts the district plays a central role in improving curriculum, instructional methods, student assessment, and professional development. Many proponents of all varieties of education reform\u2014regardless of their view of school districts\u2014regard flexibility as a key element in efforts to improve teaching and learning. However, little information is currently available about what types of flexibility are thought to be needed and how federal flexibility initiatives have been used."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "School Districts Vary in Size, Programs Offered, and Federal Involvement", "paragraphs": ["U.S. school districts vary greatly in size, from rural districts with only one school to citywide systems encompassing hundreds of schools and hundreds of thousands of students. In enrollment, school districts range from some with only a few students to New York City with over 1 million. As shown in figure 1.1, while only a few districts had enrollments of over 100,000 students in school year 1995-96, a much larger number of districts reported serving fewer than 150 students. These small districts, although numerous, accounted for less than one-half of 1 percent of total student enrollment. Some districts (usually smaller ones) served only younger children or only secondary students. Although about 74 percent of school districts provided instruction from the beginning of school through 12th grade, 22 percent of school districts provide instruction only through grade 8, and the remaining 4 percent have a low grade of 7 or higher and a high grade of 12. Districts with more than 100,000 students accounted for about 12 percent of student enrollment but made up less than 1 percent of all school districts. Similarly, while more school districts were located in rural areas, urban districts served a greater proportion of students.", "Differences in the composition of the student population are sometimes reflected in the specialized programs found in many districts and schools. In 1993-94 (the most recent school year for which data are available), 43 percent of public schools provided English as a Second Language (ESL) programs, and 18 percent of public schools provided bilingual programs, for students with limited English proficiency. Many districts offer vocational-technical programs, which provide skill training in specialized areas as well as academic instruction. Some districts offer \u201cmagnet\u201d programs, which focus on a special subject theme. Some districts have established alternative schools; in 1993-94 there were approximately 2,600 of these schools in the country.", "Districts that have a wide variety of specialized programs may receive federal assistance from separate funding streams that target these specific areas. For example, in 1997, 64 districts that were implementing desegregation plans received federal funds for magnet school programs, and, in 1996, 509 school districts received federal funds to support programs for children with limited English proficiency. As a result, larger districts and districts with a wider variety of programs and populations may receive federal assistance from a larger number of sources and also be subject to a greater number of federal program requirements. One large urban district we visited received a total of 27 federal grants, from agencies as diverse as the Department of Education, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the Department of Agriculture. Many of these programs targeted specific areas or specific groups of students, such as students with limited English proficiency, neglected and delinquent youth, and Native Americans. Another, smaller district received only four federal grants, all from the Department of Education and all targeted fairly broadly."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Major Education Reform Efforts Reduce School Districts\u2019 Role, While Others Maintain District-Level Focus", "paragraphs": ["Many Americans see the nation\u2019s public elementary and secondary schools as average at best. With American students\u2019 achievement in mathematics and science lagging behind that of their peers in other industrial nations, dissatisfaction with the educational system has fueled calls for widespread systematic reform. Various education reform efforts have adopted differing approaches toward the role of the school district. Some initiatives view school district organizations as part of the problem, while others are designed to rely strongly on district leadership.", "Two education reform strategies\u2014charter schools and school-based management\u2014have attempted to expand the role of principals and other school administrators, reducing or even eliminating the role of the school district in making key decisions on educational programs. Charter schools are schools formed by parents, teachers, and/or community members who collectively determine the school\u2019s structure, mission, and curricular focus. Charter school laws essentially allow entities other than school districts to start and operate public schools. Charter schools therefore are generally not required to follow all policies, procedures, and requirements of the local school district. In addition, although they receive public funds and must comply with federal requirements, charter schools are generally designed to operate with more autonomy from state and local regulations. Charter schools are responsible for meeting the terms of their charters, however, and these charters may include specific educational outcomes.", "Proponents of charter schools believe that this freedom from district-level and state-level requirements will lead to better academic outcomes both at charter schools and at the surrounding district schools.", "Another type of reform initiative\u2014school-based management\u2014has also focused on freeing building-level administrators from some of the restrictions imposed by district-level management. Initiatives in school-based management have become common, particularly in light of perceptions that district bureaucracies and school boards are unresponsive and impose restrictive requirements that hinder the ability of individual schools to meet their unique needs. Under school-based management, the school district typically delegates some control over decisionmaking on budgets, personnel, and/or instructional programs to school administrators, teachers, parents, or other members of the community. For example, school-based management could allow individual schools to choose to offer either half-day or full-day kindergarten, instead of following a uniform policy that was decided at the district level. Similarly, school-based management could allow individual schools to hire fewer staff and buy more computers (or vice versa), rather than have those decisions made by the district office. Proponents of school-based management believe that allowing the people most closely associated with children to make decisions about a school will make the school more responsive to children\u2019s needs.", "Although charter schools and school-based management primarily focus on administration at the school level, other reform efforts involve changes in curriculum, instructional strategies, professional development, and student assessment that are implemented on a districtwide basis. For example, one school district we visited established new standards, curricula, and assessments at the district level aimed at increasing accountability for student learning. Similarly, in our 1993 report on education reform efforts, we reviewed another school district that had developed its own school improvement model, which was subsequently adopted by other districts. Another district in this study had adopted a policy of testing students frequently and evaluating teachers on the basis of student performance on certain tests that related specifically to the district\u2019s standard curriculum.", "Whether reforms are initiated outside of the school district (as in charter schools) or at the school or district level, many proponents of education reform believe that efforts to improve teaching and learning will be more successful if local school districts have more flexibility to adapt federal programs to local needs. The National Governors Association, along with several major education associations, has advocated increased flexibility for school districts, including a loosening of federal and state requirements that are thought to potentially impede new or innovative reform approaches. Over the past 5 years, the Congress has enacted several provisions designed to provide schools and districts with more flexibility in how they use federal funds. In addition, for certain areas the Congress has given the Department of Education the authority to grant waivers\u2014temporary exceptions to certain federal requirements\u2014to states and school districts. While some experts have welcomed these provisions, other observers have urged caution. Because many federal and state restrictions were established to protect students, they fear that important social purposes\u2014such as protecting civil rights\u2014may be compromised if federal restrictions are loosened or lifted. Despite the importance of this debate, little information has been available about the issues school districts face in implementing various federal requirements, what flexibility they would find most useful, and how existing flexibility has been used."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["The Chairman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, the Chairman of the House Committee on the Budget, and the Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Human Resources, Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, asked us to report on how federal requirements affect local school districts. Specifically, the objectives of this study were to describe the major federal requirements that affect school districts; describe the issues that local school districts face in implementing these analyze the impact of the Department of Education\u2019s flexibility initiatives on school districts\u2019 ability to address these implementation issues.", "Our approach relied on data from a variety of sources. We interviewed officials from 87 school districts using a variety of methods\u2014telephone interviews, group interviews, and site visits. We also interviewed representatives from 15 major education associations and federal and state program officials. We surveyed officials from all 50 states to obtain information on the use of financial flexibility mechanisms by states and local school districts. We reviewed the education finance literature and analyzed federal laws and regulations applying to school districts. In addition, we analyzed data from the Department of Education on school district characteristics and the use of federal waivers. We did not verify the data we obtained from the Department of Education.", "We focused our review on 36 federal programs or mandates that education experts, school district staff, state and federal officials, and the literature identified as having a major impact on school districts. We reviewed the relevant legislation (and, in some cases, the regulations and/or agency guidance) to obtain descriptive information about the programs or mandates. These 36 requirements were defined according to their impact on school districts, not necessarily by law or by program. For example, the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) contains provisions regarding the accessibility of public buildings and also regulates the employment protections extended to persons with disabilities. These provisions clearly have separate and distinct implications for school districts, although they are contained in the same piece of legislation. Therefore, we elected to treat these requirements separately. Similarly, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) and the Improving America\u2019s Schools Act (IASA), which reauthorized ESEA in 1994, deal with many programs in a single legislative act. In other cases, multiple pieces of legislation may provide a vehicle for very similar requirements. For example, the Asbestos School Hazard Abatement Act and the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act (AHERA) established regulations for the management of asbestos in schools. Because both laws affect how schools and districts manage asbestos, we considered these requirements together. Although our list of major requirements is not comprehensive, it does capture the requirements that education experts and district officials viewed as having a significant impact on school districts\u2019 administration and operations.", "We used several methods to gather information on school districts\u2019 views of the issues that affect their implementation of federal requirements. Early in our study, we conducted two group interviews of school district personnel at major education conferences. The district officials who participated in these group interviews represented 15 states from across the country. From these group interviews, and from our interviews with associations and federal officials, we learned that state requirements\u2014and differing state interpretations of federal requirements\u2014can play a crucial role in the implementation of federal laws and regulations. Because school district officials could not, in general, distinguish between state and federal requirements, obtaining the views of district officials nationwide would be problematic because district staff in different states would be responding to different sets of requirements. For this reason, we conducted the majority of our interviews with school district officials in a few states. As a result, when we discussed particular requirements with officials from different districts, we could adequately account for variation across states, although we cannot generalize our results to all states.", "We selected three states\u2014Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and Louisiana\u2014as the major focus of our study. We chose these states because each had a diverse student population in terms of income, disability status, and urban and rural areas, and because they differed in other characteristics, including the mix of state and local funding for education, the relative amount of state funding provided to poorer and wealthier districts, the number of federal waivers granted to districts in the state, and whether the state had been designated as an \u201cEd-Flex\u201d state.", "In each of these three selected states, we obtained detailed information from site visits and from a telephone survey of school district superintendents and other officials. We visited two districts (one relatively large and one relatively small) in each of the three states. (Characteristics of the districts we visited are shown in table 1.1.) The districts we visited ranged from a large inner-city district with 257 schools and over 200,000 students to a rural district with 2 adjacent schools and an enrollment of just over 1,000. We selected these districts primarily on the basis of enrollment size, geographic location, and urban/rural mix; where more than one district met our requirements we made a random selection from these districts. During our site visits, we interviewed the district\u2019s superintendent; the food service director; the assistant superintendent, business manager, or facilities manager; the Title I and special education directors; and directors of other programs (such as vocational education) where applicable. We also visited state officials with responsibility for special education, Title I, and other major programs in each state.", "In addition, we conducted a telephone survey with officials from school districts in each of these three states. We selected a random sample of school districts in each state, stratified by size. We drew this sample from the Department of Education\u2019s Common Core of Data database, which contains information on the approximately 15,000 school districts in the United States as reported by states and school districts for the 1993-94 school year. In drawing the sample, we eliminated districts that reported no schools for the 1993-94 school year. We verified our data through the current school district listing provided on each state\u2019s Internet site. We eliminated a few districts from the sample because they were no longer operating or had already participated in a site visit or group interview. For each of the 83 districts selected, we sent a letter to the district superintendent asking the superintendent or assistant superintendent to participate in a 1-hour telephone interview with us regarding the implementation of federal requirements. Superintendents were invited to include key staff members in the interview (many of them did) or to solicit comments from staff prior to the interview. A total of 59 school districts (71 percent) participated in the survey. In each state, at least 5 percent of the districts in the state participated in the survey. However, due to the small number of total participants and the qualitative nature of many of the questions, the survey was not designed to enable us to project quantitative estimates at the state level. In these interviews, we asked districts about the information and technical assistance they received on federal requirements, the eligibility determination process, federal funding, application processes, accounting and reporting requirements, and other areas. All data were self-reported.", "Our group interviews, site visits to states and school districts, and telephone survey results also provided important information on how federal flexibility efforts have affected local school districts. We obtained additional information on waivers of state requirements, consolidated planning and reporting initiatives, and financial flexibility mechanisms by surveying education officials in the 50 states. In this survey, we asked state officials about the number and types of waivers granted for state requirements, the extent to which school districts in their state submitted consolidated applications and reports, and the extent to which school districts in their state used certain financial flexibility mechanisms. In addition, we reviewed the Department of Education\u2019s data on waivers and interviewed federal and state officials to discuss their views on flexibility initiatives. We also reviewed the legislation, regulations, and guidance associated with these efforts.", "Our work was done between September 1997 and August 1998 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Federal Requirements and Financial Assistance Reflect Desire for Safe and Effective Schools for All Students", "paragraphs": ["School districts serve their communities in several key roles\u2014not only as educators but also as food service providers, employers, and managers of public facilities.

Many federal education programs (including some of the largest federal efforts) are intended to ensure equal educational opportunity for children with various types of disadvantages. For example, the federal government funds programs specifically targeted to children with disabilities, poor children, homeless children, and children with limited English proficiency. Other federal education programs are directed not at particular children but at particular topics or subject areas that are thought to have special national or economic importance. Federal teacher training programs, for example, give priority to math and science instruction. Through targeted programs, the federal government also earmarks funds for vocational education and for integrating technology into the classroom.", "Other federal programs and requirements are designed to indirectly facilitate high-quality education by ensuring that students and teachers work and learn in a safe environment. A number of federal requirements, including environmental mandates and nutrition requirements for school meals, aim to ensure or improve students\u2019 safety and health. In addition, those programs that distribute federal dollars carry a concern with ensuring the integrity of those funds. Documentation, spending, and auditing requirements address these concerns.

However, in addition to their primary function as educators, school districts also serve in other roles, many of which are resource-intensive and of great importance to the community. For example, in addition to operating classrooms, schools operate restaurants\u2014most serving lunch and many serving breakfast. In one rural school district we visited, the single school cafeteria served lunch to about 1,000 students each day\u2014probably more than any other restaurant in the local area. School districts are also employers of teachers, aides, administrators, and custodians. School districts manage one or more public buildings, which may be used by the community for voting, adult education, or recreational activities.

The largest federal education programs provide financial assistance to many school districts, although the programs target specific student populations. For example, in school year 1997-98 about 89 percent of the school districts in the United States received funding from the Title I program, which helps school districts finance programs to assist disadvantaged students, particularly in reading and math. Along with financial assistance, federal programs come with requirements concerning which students or what subject areas are to be targeted, what records must be kept, and how school districts are allowed to spend federal dollars. Title I requirements specify a formula for how funds must be distributed to schools within a district. Similarly, Perkins Act programs, which support vocational education, require school districts to give priority in allocating funds to sites or programs that have higher concentrations of students with disabilities, economically or educationally disadvantaged students, and students with limited English proficiency. Federal regulations also require school districts (and other recipients of federal funds) to keep records of equipment purchased with federal funds and to submit to an annual financial audit in accordance with the Single Audit Act.", "The different education programs vary in the extent to which they prescribe and restrict school districts\u2019 use of federal funds. For example, the Safe and Drug Free Schools program is often considered a flexible program; within the broad guidelines established by the statute, school districts are free to develop their own programs. In contrast, the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) specifies several procedures school districts must follow in providing educational services to children with disabilities. Under IDEA, districts must assess a student\u2019s need for additional services; for each student, create an Individualized Education Program (IEP) that details the support services the student will receive; offer services in accordance with the IEP; review each child\u2019s IEP annually and revise it as appropriate; and reevaluate the child\u2019s need for special education services as appropriate, but at least once every 3 years.", "Other federal requirements also affect how school districts provide educational services, even though they are not associated with any specific federal program.

Nearly 68,000 schools participated in the National School Breakfast program, serving an average of 6.9 million breakfasts every day in fiscal year 1997. Under these federally funded child nutrition programs, school districts receive cash assistance based on the number of meals they serve and the number of low-income children who are served free or reduced-price meals. Schools also receive additional federal support in the form of agricultural commodities such as meats, fruits and vegetables, and dairy products. About 17 percent of the total dollar value of the food served in the school lunch program is provided through commodities.", "In return for this federal support, schools must provide free and reduced-price meals to children from low-income families and ensure that the meals meet federal nutrition standards.

Children from families with incomes between 130 and 185 percent of the poverty level are eligible for reduced-price meals. In addition, as of school year 1996-97, schools must serve meals which meet several nutrition requirements established in the 1990 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, including limiting total fat to 30 percent of calories and limiting saturated fat to less than 10 percent of calories.

The law does not require a school district to retrofit each of its existing facilities to make them fully accessible to individuals with disabilities. However, a more stringent standard applies to new construction and to certain renovations of existing facilities; these buildings must be readily accessible and useable by individuals with disabilities and must comply with design standards.", "School districts also must comply with certain environmental standards where they are applicable. For example, AHERA required school districts to inspect schools for asbestos, to draw up an asbestos management plan that identifies where asbestos is located in the schools, and to reinspect schools every 3 years to ensure that asbestos materials have not become damaged. Similarly, to protect groundwater from contamination, school districts that operate underground storage tanks (UST) must comply with federal and state safety requirements. Certain USTs are required to meet EPA requirements for spill protection and corrosion prevention; owners of affected USTs must upgrade their tanks to meet these standards by December 22, 1998. If a UST is found to have a leak, the owner may also be required to take action to prevent further contamination of the soil. Additional requirements may govern school districts\u2019 disposal of hazardous materials (for example, chemicals from a high school science lab).

Programs that directly support instructional activity (such as Title I and Safe and Drug Free Schools) carry some federal dollars, as do the child nutrition programs that support school food service programs.

Employment-related requirements, for example, do not provide financial support; and environmental requirements generally come without financial assistance. Indirect federal support\u2014especially in the form of information and technical assistance\u2014is often provided for many federal programs and mandates, whether or not direct financial assistance is also provided. For example, EPA has published documents to provide information on UST requirements, and the federal Department of Education provides support for technical assistance, mainly through state agencies.", "For many major programs, federal financial contributions do not fully fund the activities these programs support. Federal dollars account for a relatively low share of total education spending (about 7 percent in school year 1995-96), while state and local funds account for about 47 and 46 percent, respectively. Although reliable information on local expenditures for specific program areas is scarce, the available figures show similar results. For example, the Department of Education has estimated that in the early 1990s, in 24 states, about $13.9 billion was spent annually to provide services to children with disabilities under IDEA, yet federal funds accounted for only 7 percent of these costs. In our 1993-94 survey of school districts, the average amount of federal funding school districts reported receiving for vocational education equaled only 11 percent of the average amount of funding districts reported receiving from state and local sources. Similarly, one of the large districts we visited received $695,242 in federal bilingual education funds but budgeted about $30 million for bilingual education instruction. Food service programs appear to be an exception to this overall pattern, being fully or nearly fully funded by federal dollars; a research study found that in school year 1992-93, the federal reimbursement rate for a free lunch under the National School Lunch program was approximately equal to the median cost of producing a school lunch.", "Although it is clear that the cost of many education activities exceeds the overall federal contribution, the precise size of this gap is difficult to determine for specific areas or requirements. Little information is available on the true cost of many education and education-related activities that are supported with federal funds. Even at the level of the local school district, it is usually difficult to determine exactly how much has been spent on different educational activities such as \u201cregular\u201d classroom instruction, special education, dropout prevention, assistance to students with limited English proficiency, and so forth. Some of the districts we visited set up their budgets to provide such program-specific information, but others did not. When districts do generate their budgets on a program-specific basis, their definitions and methods of classifying expenses may be inconsistent with those of other districts, making comparisons across districts often difficult and sometimes impossible.", "These difficulties are further complicated by the wide variation in per pupil spending across school districts. For example, for the six districts we visited, the highest-spending district spent over twice as much per student ($7,804.06) as the lowest-spending district ($3,801.50). Factors such as district size, geographic differences in salaries and other expenses, the age and condition of school facilities, and the composition of the student body (such as the number of students with disabilities or with limited English proficiency) can contribute to such differences and make it difficult to say what level of expenditure is adequate or appropriate for a particular program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States Often Play a Key Role in Requirements Affecting School Districts", "paragraphs": ["Several programs provide funding directly from the federal government to school districts.

The largest federal education programs\u2014Title I and IDEA, which provided $8 billion and $4.8 billion in fiscal year 1998, respectively\u2014distribute their funds through state education agencies.", "The role played by the state agency differs substantially across various federal programs. For example, under the Adult Education program, states have considerable discretion in distributing federal funds because each state can determine the criteria it will use to award competitive grants. In contrast, Eisenhower Professional Development program funds (which finance teacher training) are merely passed through the state, with district allocations already determined by the formula set out in the federal statute. The role of the state in program administration also varies. In the National School Lunch program, the state plays a key role in selecting and distributing federal commodities. For many programs, states play a key oversight role as well. Under IDEA, for example, the states assume a major part of the responsibility for ensuring that school districts comply with the law\u2019s requirements.", "For most of the programs we reviewed that provide federal funds, school districts must submit plans or applications to either the state or the federal government. These plans or applications generally contain information on how the funds will be used, certifications that federally prescribed procedures will be followed, and assurances that federal funds will be expended in accordance with the purpose of the program. For certain programs in some states, school districts must also request and receive reimbursement from the state, rather than receiving grant funds up front.", "In fulfilling their role as administrators of federal programs, state governments sometimes place additional requirements on school districts. For example, federal requirements allow districts to purchase equipment costing under $5,000 without separate documentation; however, in one state we visited, a lower threshold of $500 had been set by the state government. In cases where a state requirement arises from the implementation of a federal program or regulation, it becomes especially hard to distinguish a state requirement from a federal one. From the point of view of the local school district, it may not be important where the requirement originated because the district must comply in any case. Staff in most of the school districts we visited told us that they could not tell or did not know which requirements were state and which were federal, and education experts told us that this was probably true of most districts nationwide.", "States have also imposed many requirements on educational programs in areas unregulated by the federal government, such as curriculum and teacher certification. For example, by 1996, 44 states had set minimum curriculum requirements for high school graduation, 43 states required districts to offer a half-day or full-day kindergarten, and 46 states established professional development requirements or continuing education requirements for teachers. States also specify a required number of days or hours for the school year.", "In addition to federal and state requirements, school districts are also affected by requirements imposed by local governments and by the courts. Local requirements such as building codes can affect school district operations. Some school districts are also affected by judicial decisions. For example, one district we visited had been required by a court order to fund several programs as a result of a long-standing desegregation lawsuit.

An official from another district told us that officials had not fully understood all the requirements they had to follow when renovating their gymnasium; if they had known about all the regulations before issuing the bond to pay for the renovation, they would have tried to raise more money, she added.

District superintendents and special education directors identified a variety of factors as major contributors to the higher costs of special education: (1) the large number of students who require special education, (2) a few students whose very severe conditions require extensive care and support, (3) a lack of assistance from other parties (such as insurers and other public agencies) in providing related services, and (4) the costs of litigation and procedural issues. These same elements are frequently mentioned in the special education literature, although research to measure the impact of each of these factors has not yet been conducted.", "First, in many districts a large number of students require special education and related services. In the 50 states and the District of Columbia, about 4.8 million students aged 6 to 17 were served under IDEA in the 1995-96 school year. This amounts to approximately 10.6 percent of all students in that age group. However, this percentage can vary considerably across school districts and across states. For example, across states the percentage of students aged 6 to 17 served under IDEA ranged from 7.6 percent in Hawaii to 14.85 percent in Massachusetts. In one district we visited, over 20 percent of students were receiving special education.", "Second, although many students with disabilities are fully integrated into regular classrooms and require little additional support, a few children with severe disabilities require more extensive\u2014and more expensive\u2014support and care. For example, in one district we visited, the special education director told us that the annual cost of caring for two autistic children in the district amounted to approximately $150,000, and four other students with psychiatric disorders were being served at a cost of about $38,000 each. State officials and staff from other districts also pointed to similar high-cost cases as an important factor in the cost of special education.", "Third, some district staff told us\u2014and state officials confirmed\u2014that districts sometimes had difficulty obtaining financial assistance from public agencies and private insurers for related services (especially health services) they provided to a student with a disability. Under IDEA, the school district is obligated to provide a \u201cfree appropriate public education\u201d to any student with a disability, including both special education and \u201crelated services.\u201d \u201cRelated services\u201d are defined under IDEA as services that may be required to help a child with a disability benefit from special education, including transportation, speech-language pathology and audiology services, physical and occupational therapy, social work, counseling, and medical services. Similarly, assistive technology (such as special computer software, a plastic device to assist in holding a pencil, or other items) may be needed to help the student participate in school. Because many related services are health-related or medical in nature, they may be covered under private health insurance policies or under Medicaid, the government insurance program that provides health care to poor families. In addition, other related services (such as counseling or mental health care) may fall within the purview of other state agencies such as the Department of Mental Health or Social Services. However, some school district officials reported that they had difficulty obtaining assistance or reimbursement from these other sources. Even when assistance could be obtained, we were told, it was ofetn insufficient to meet the costs. One district official told us that obtaining funds from Medicaid and other health insurers was \u201can unbelievable nightmare.\u201d In its 1997 reauthorization of IDEA, the Congress specified that other public agencies should provide services within their purviews and required states to establish an interagency agreement or other mechanism to establish which agency is financially responsible for which services and to otherwise coordinate between agencies. However, it is too soon to determine the impact of this provision on local school districts.", "Finally, school district and state officials identified dispute resolution\u2014especially litigation\u2014as a contributing factor to special education costs. According to district officials, the possibility of litigation not only creates legal costs, but also can make school districts more cautious and less innovative in dealing with special education issues. As one district official told us, \u201cYou always call the lawyer first on any special education-related issue.\u201d The superintendent in another district said that a single due process hearing could cost his district around $8,000 to $10,000 in legal fees and salary costs, regardless of the outcome. The special education director in that district also expressed concern about legal costs. He added that because of the high cost of litigation, he does not believe that he can refuse parents\u2019 requests, even when he believes they are unreasonable. Despite these anecdotal reports of high costs, however, disability advocates often view litigation as necessary to prod some school districts into providing necessary and required services.

When discussing funding issues, many district officials mentioned the need to abate or remove asbestos when renovating, remodeling, or repairing school buildings. Asbestos abatement can be costly, even in the context of a remodeling project. For example, when one district we visited remodeled two buildings in 1991, asbestos removal cost the district a total of $174,376. In another district we visited, district staff told us that they had to postpone repairs to one school\u2019s roof because they could not afford the cost of removing the current roof, which contains asbestos. In our 1994 survey on school facilities, schools reported having spent an average of $43,000 on asbestos in the previous 3 years; furthermore, schools reported needing to spend an average of $71,000 over the next 3 years on asbestos.", "Asbestos abatement issues will continue to present school districts with difficult and often expensive financial choices, as more schools are remodeled or modernized. School enrollments are growing; at the same time, many of America\u2019s schools are in poor condition, needing not only repair but additional space to accommodate modern instructional techniques like alternative student assessments. Finally, as we reported in 1995, many schools need to put in place the building infrastructure needed to support information technology, including electrical wiring, conduits/raceways for computer cables, and additional electrical outlets. As a result, many school districts will be faced with asbestos abatement expenses as they prepare to modernize their aging buildings.", "Incomplete implementation of existing requirements may also compound schools\u2019 difficulties with asbestos. For example, an EPA study estimated that only 16 percent of the original AHERA inspections were \u201cthorough inspections\u201d; the remaining 84 percent of inspections failed to either accurately identify, quantify, or record the location of asbestos-containing material in the school. As a result, a school or district that relied on its AHERA plan to avoid disturbing asbestos might experience asbestos problems in areas it could not or did not anticipate. In addition, federal officials expressed concern that because of lack of communication, turnover in personnel, or other reasons, school or district officials might fail to adequately review their AHERA plan before beginning remodeling work, and as a result they might encounter asbestos-related problems.", "In some districts, staff also mentioned the difficulty in absorbing the cost of upgrading or removing USTs.

About 56 percent of the schools we surveyed for that study believed that they would need to spend some money in the coming 3 years (1995-1998) to improve accessibility. In addition, 53 percent of schools in the survey reported having incurred expenditures in the previous 3 years (1991-1994) to improve accessibility. According to the survey results, schools across the country could have been expected to spend about $5.2 billion on accessibility in the 1995 to 1998 period.

This program structure, while allowing federal dollars to be targeted to those students most in need, requires school district staff to determine which students are eligible for assistance. At the beginning of the year, school districts generally distribute applications to school children and their families. Once applications are returned by the parents, district staff process the applications to determine a child\u2019s eligibility. Some district officials told us that because of pride or privacy concerns, some students and parents (particularly at the high school level) do not return applications even if they know they are eligible. To ensure that only eligible students receive benefits, the school district is also required to verify income information for a sample of applications. Once eligibility determinations have been made, district officials must notify the parents and then incorporate the eligibility information into the district\u2019s food service system. All of this processing takes place at the beginning of the school year, a very busy period for all school staff.", "Food service staff at the districts we interviewed used two strategies to try to limit the work created by this application process. First, districts used a process called \u201cdirect certification\u201d to quickly identify and enroll a portion of eligible students. Under direct certification, students from families that receive food stamps or public assistance can be certified as eligible for free or reduced-price meals. Data from public assistance records is matched with school files, obviating the need for parents to fill out applications and for district staff to process the forms.", "All of the districts we visited used direct certification, and the food service directors were grateful for the opportunity to use this streamlined process. However, district officials added that while direct certification was helpful, they still faced an administrative challenge in processing applications. Because many families who qualify for free or reduced-price meals do not receive public assistance or food stamps, district officials must gather and process data on a large number of families who cannot be enrolled through direct certification. For example, in one district we visited, district officials could use direct certification to enroll only about 31 percent of eligible students; for the remaining 69 percent, the district had to distribute, collect, and process applications.", "Second, some districts have also used a more sweeping strategy to reduce the costs associated with eligibility determination\u2014a universal service or no-fee option. Under these options, schools serve lunches and/or breakfasts to all students at no charge, regardless of whether their family income would qualify them for a free meal. Districts are reimbursed based on the number of qualifying students for the year before they began serving no-fee meals. At the end of the 3-to-5-year program period, districts must generally redetermine students\u2019 eligibility to provide a new, up-to-date basis for reimbursement.", "Under universal or no-fee service, districts reduce the administrative costs associated with determining eligibility and with counting and claiming meals by reimbursement category. However, the cost of the meals increases as the district pays for meals served to students who would not otherwise be eligible for free meals. In addition, with all meals served for free, more students may eat in the cafeteria rather than bring lunch from home, further increasing the cost of the food service program. For any one district, total costs may increase or decrease depending on the strength of these factors. Two of the districts we visited had one or more schools participating in these programs recently, and they reported different experiences. In one district we visited, the no-fee approach was in place at several schools, and district officials told us that universal feeding had lowered their total costs while allowing them to serve more children.

The parents or district staff may also invite other individuals to participate. States may impose additional requirements on the composition of the IEP team. For example, Massachusetts requires that, for an older student who may need continuing services outside the school system, a representative from an agency that provides adult services be invited to the IEP meetings at least 2 years before the anticipated exit date. The IEP must be reviewed each year and revised as appropriate by the IEP team, and students must be reevaluated for eligibility at least once every 3 years.", "This highly individualized process allows students with disabilities to have educational programs tailored to their specific and unique needs.

For example, prior to the 1997 amendments to IDEA, school districts were not required by federal law to have a regular classroom teacher participate in the development of the IEP. Many district officials told us that implementing this new requirement would be difficult and costly, primarily because substitute teachers must be hired to take over classroom duties when regular teachers are attending IEP meetings during normal school hours.", "Staff from some school districts also told us that, in their opinions, the IDEA definition of eligibility is unclear or too subjective, making eligibility determination more difficult. For example, one special education director told us that in his experience, almost any child who is referred for an evaluation concerning emotional disturbance is given that diagnosis. Officials from other districts echoed this concern with respect to emotional disturbance and disability in general, especially when possible disability diagnoses are raised in the context of a student\u2019s inappropriate conduct.", "The definition of disability in general, and the subcategories of emotional disturbance and learning disability in particular, have been controversial. Some have advocated a relatively narrow definition that would emphasize well-understood conditions, while others have recommended a wider definition to encompass less prevalent and less well-defined, but also potentially debilitating, conditions.

If a school district wants to remove a child with a disability from the classroom for a cumulative total of more than 10 days in a school year, the district generally must reconvene the IEP team. The district has somewhat more latitude in cases involving weapons or illegal drugs. If a student with a disability carries a weapon or illegal drugs to school, the district may move the student outside the school to an alternative educational setting (such as a special program for troubled youth) for up to 45 days.

Although this emphasis on overall outcomes has enjoyed widespread support, controversy has arisen over the role existing federal programs and mandates will play in achieving this broad purpose. Some individuals\u2014both educators and legislators\u2014believe that loosening or eliminating some federal requirements will enable local school districts to direct more resources to the classroom and to adopt more innovative instructional approaches. However, others have expressed concern that the purposes underlying federal programs (such as ensuring equal educational opportunity) could be compromised if federal requirements are loosened or eliminated. As the education reform movement has accelerated, interest in providing additional flexibility has heightened in both the executive and legislative branches.", "Some of school districts\u2019 key concerns\u2014particularly the amount of financial assistance provided to school districts\u2014lie beyond the scope of the flexibility initiatives that have been implemented to date. Alleviating these concerns may require more than providing additional flexibility within the existing federal program structure. Other key concerns, including informational and procedural issues, could be partially or fully addressed in the context of flexibility, although current initiatives are not targeted toward these issues. Our findings on school districts\u2019 experiences with federal requirements and regulatory flexibility suggest four lessons to be considered in refining existing federal initiatives and designing new ones. 1. School districts\u2019 concerns are wide ranging rather than centered on a single program or issue. To address these concerns successfully, federal initiatives must also be multifaceted.", "School districts expressed a wide range of concerns, covering numerous federal programs and reflecting a broad variety of implementation issues. These issues extend to all facets of providing educational and support services\u2014from planning educational programs at the beginning of the year to auditing the accounts at year\u2019s end. Although much of the public debate on education reform has focused on procedural and financial flexibility, such as easing restrictions that govern the use of funds, district superintendents and program directors identified obtaining better information, streamlining eligibility determination and other administrative processes, and obtaining more procedural flexibility as key issues. Because the implementation issues school districts face cut across program and agency lines, initiatives that are narrowly focused can at best provide only limited assistance. Although it may be difficult to design, a broader flexibility initiative (or set of initiatives) that is simple to understand and easy to use, extended across related programs, and widely applicable to many school districts would be better positioned to address districts\u2019 concerns. 2. School districts need\u2014and many lack\u2014adequate information to successfully implement federal requirements and take advantage of flexibility options. Strengthening the knowledge base will be key to the success of both current and future flexibility efforts.", "As complex organizations, school districts face a large and complicated body of federal requirements that affect many operational areas. According to district officials, the volume and complexity of federal requirements make it difficult to keep track of what is needed to comply and what flexibility is available. With inadequate information, district staff may be more conservative in their interpretation and less innovative in their approach. In addition, district officials cannot take advantage of flexibility mechanisms if they don\u2019t know what flexibility is available or how to apply it to their programs. Experience with various flexibility initiatives\u2014from federal and state waivers to consolidated planning\u2014suggests that increasing awareness among district officials is a crucial factor in how frequently these provisions are used and how helpful they are to school districts. 3. Because states play a key role in overseeing and administering federal programs, in order for flexibility initiatives to succeed, state education agencies must be able and willing to help school districts implement them.", "For local school districts, state education agencies are the main source not only for information and technical assistance but also for monitoring and oversight. In addition, states impose their own requirements on school districts. Some of these, such as teacher certification standards, may interact with federal requirements but are not associated with specific federal programs. Others, such as requirements concerning IEP forms, arise out of the state\u2019s role in administering federal programs. Because state requirements are stricter than federal ones, initiatives to loosen federal requirements may not have the desired impact unless related state requirements are also modified. As a result, federal legislation alone may be insufficient to create regulatory flexibility that reaches down to the local level. 4. The Congress and the Department of Education face potential conflicts between local officials\u2019 desire for flexibility and the important purposes underlying federal programs and mandates.", "District officials recognized the benefits of federal requirements to students, parents, and educators. Requirements that students with disabilities receive the additional help they need to achieve in school were widely supported, as were many health and safety requirements. Educators and advocates alike have expressed concern that the opportunity to achieve these goals could be lost if too many federal requirements are loosened or lifted. The Congress and the Department of Education may sometimes face a tension between providing flexibility and still ensuring equal educational opportunity, promoting high quality education, guarding against health and safety hazards, or protecting the integrity of federal funds. In education, where such outcomes are often difficult to identify and measure, it may be especially difficult to ensure that these goals are realized without procedural requirements. Consequently, in some program areas federal authorities may choose to provide local officials with less discretion than they may desire."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
