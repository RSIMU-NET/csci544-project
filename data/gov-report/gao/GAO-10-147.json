All 34 of these most critical assets require electricity continuously to support their military missions, and 31 of them rely on commercial power grids--which the Defense Science Board Task Force on DOD Energy Strategy has characterized as increasingly fragile and vulnerable--as their primary source of electricity. DOD Instruction 3020.45 requires DOD to conduct vulnerability assessments on all its most critical assets at least once every 3 years. Also, the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland Defense and Americas' Security Affairs ASD(HD&ASA) has requested the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers--which serves as the Defense Critical Infrastructure Program's Defense Infrastructure Sector Lead Agent for Public Works--to conduct preliminary technical analyses of DOD installation infrastructure (including electrical power infrastructure) to support the teams conducting Defense Critical Infrastructure Program vulnerability assessments on the most critical assets. (1) As of June 2009, and according to ASD(HD&ASA) and the Joint Staff, DOD had conducted Defense Critical Infrastructure Program vulnerability assessments on 14 of the 34 most critical assets.18 DOD has not conducted the remaining assessments because it did not identify the most critical assets until October 2008. To comply with the instruction, DOD would have to complete Defense Critical Infrastructure Program vulnerability assessments on all most critical assets by October 2011. (2) DOD has neither conducted, nor developed additional guidelines and time frames for conducting, these vulnerability assessments on any of the five non-DOD-owned most critical assets located in the United States or foreign countries, citing security concerns and political sensitivities. (3) The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has not completed the preliminary technical analyses requested because it has not yet received infrastructure-related information regarding the networks, assets, points of service, and inter- and intradependencies related to electrical power systems that it requires from the military services. (4) Although DOD is in the process of developing guidelines, it does not systematically coordinate Defense Critical Infrastructure Program vulnerability assessment processes and guidelines with those of other, complementary DOD mission assurance programs--including force protection; antiterrorism; information assurance; continuity of operations; chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high-explosive defense; readiness; and installation preparedness--that also examine electrical power vulnerabilities of the most critical assets, because DOD has not established specific guidelines for such systematic coordination. (5) The 10 Defense Critical Infrastructure Program vulnerability assessments we reviewed did not explicitly consider assets' vulnerabilities to longer-term (i.e., of up to several weeks' duration) electrical power disruptions19 on a mission-specific basis, as DOD has not developed explicit Defense Critical Infrastructure Program benchmarks for assessing electrical power vulnerabilities associated with longer-term electrical power disruptions. With more comprehensive knowledge of the most critical assets' risks and vulnerabilities to electrical power disruptions, DOD can better avoid compromising crucial DOD-wide missions during electrical power disruptions. This additional information may also improve DOD's ability to effectively prioritize funding needed to address identified risks and vulnerabilities of its most critical assets to electrical power disruptions."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) relies on a global network of defense  critical infrastructure so essential that the incapacitation, exploitation, or  destruction of an asset within this network could severely affect DOD\u2019s  ability to deploy, support, and sustain its forces and operations worldwide  and to implement its core missions, including those in Iraq and  Afghanistan as well as its homeland defense and strategic missions.

In particular, as we have  previously reported, DOD has been responsible since September 2003 for  developing and ensuring implementation of defense critical infrastructure  protection policy and program guidance. To identify and help assure the  availability of this mission-critical infrastructure, in August 2005 DOD  established the Defense Critical Infrastructure Program (DCIP), assigning  overall responsibility for the program to the Office of the Assistant  Secretary of Defense for Homeland Defense and Americas\u2019 Security Affairs  (ASD(HD&ASA)). Since then, ASD(HD&ASA) has issued formal DCIP  program guidance, including a directive articulating the roles and  responsibilities of relevant DOD organizations; an instruction on program  management; and several program manuals, including ones on identifying  critical assets and remediating asset risks and vulnerabilities. Under  DCIP, DOD also established 10 functionally based defense sectors\u2014 including one for public works, which encompasses electrical power  infrastructure\u2014and designated a Defense Infrastructure Sector Lead  Agent (DISLA) for each sector. In addition to using DCIP, DOD can also  assess risks and vulnerabilities to its critical assets and installations (at the  departmental, combatant command, military service, and installation  levels) through other mission assurance programs and efforts, including  those related to force protection; antiterrorism; defense continuity;  information assurance; continuity of operations; chemical, biological,  radiological, nuclear, and high-explosive defense; readiness; and  installation preparedness. In addition, within the framework of the  National Infrastructure Protection Plan of 2009, DOD also collaborates  with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of  Energy (DOE) to address risks and vulnerabilities associated with  electrical power infrastructure.", "In its May 2008 report on H.R. 5658, the House Committee on Armed  Services noted the risks of electrical power disruptions to critical DOD  missions and, among other things, directed that GAO continue its review  of DCIP. In response to this mandate, we have examined (1) the extent to  which DOD\u2019s most critical assets are vulnerable to disruptions in electrical  power supplies and (2) the extent to which DOD\u2014both within and outside  of the Defense Critical Infrastructure Program\u2014has attempted to assure  the availability of electrical power supplies to its most critical assets.", "We have previously conducted an extensive body of work on DOD\u2019s  efforts to assure the availability of defense critical infrastructure, reporting  on DOD\u2019s progress in addressing the evolving management framework for  DCIP; coordination among DCIP stakeholders; implementation of key  program elements; availability of public works infrastructure; and  reliability issues in DOD\u2019s lists of critical assets, among other issues. We  have also issued reports concerning federal critical infrastructure  protection, cybersecurity, and electrical power. A list of these reports by  category can be found at the end of this report in the Related GAO  Products section.", "To address our objectives in this report, we conducted three structured  written surveys regarding the electrical power vulnerabilities of DOD\u2019s 34  most critical assets, which DOD identified through DCIP as of October  2008. We pretested the survey with U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Air  Force officials representing three most critical asset sites as well as  officials from the Joint Staff (J-34) and ASD(HD&ASA) to ensure that the  questions were relevant, clearly stated, and easy to understand. We then  administered one survey to the military services and DOD agencies that  own or have program responsibility for the assets through DCIP to obtain  information about the assets\u2019 reliance on electrical power; the assets\u2019  primary and backup sources of electrical power supplies; the number and  type of unplanned electrical power disruptions to the assets; DCIP and  non-DCIP assessments of the assets\u2019 risks and vulnerabilities to electrical  power disruptions from January 2006 through December 2008; and  measures recommended, implemented, or planned to address or manage  such risks and vulnerabilities.

As illustrated  in figures 1 and 2, the grid is a vast, complex network of interconnecte d  regional systems and infrastructure (e.g., power plants, electricity lines,  and control centers) used to generate, transmit, distribute, and manage  electrical power supplies across the United States. According to the  Defense Science Board Task Force on DOD Energy Strategy,  approximately 99 percent of the electrical power DOD installations  consume originates from outside installation boundaries, while  approximately 85 percent of the energy infrastructure that DOD relies on  for electrical power is commercially owned and outside of DOD\u2019s  control.", "There are currently a variety of mechanisms in place that may help to  mitigate the risk of losing electricity service due to electrical power  disruptions, including mandatory reliability standards for the electrical  power industry approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.  In addition, other risk mitigation measures are being considered, such as  islanding. However, while the U.S. commercial electrical power grid is  generally a reliable source of electricity and is subject to some reliability  standards that typically assure its availability over 99 percent of the time,  concerns have been raised about the increasing vulnerability of the grid to  more frequent or longer electrical power disturbances. For example, the  Defense Science Board Task Force reported that the commercial power  grid is \u201cbrittle, increasingly centralized, capacity-strained, and largely  unprotected from physical attack, with little stockpiling of critical  hardware.\u201d Similarly, according to the May 2007 Infrastructure Resiliency  Guide for DOD\u2019s Defense Critical Infrastructure Program, \u201cthe electric  power network is a complex system of interconnected components that  can fail and cause massive service disruptions.\u201d Factors that contribute to  the grid\u2019s vulnerability include (1) increasing national demand for  electricity; (2) an aging electrical power infrastructure; (3) increased  reliance on automated control systems that are susceptible to  cyberattacks; (4) the attractiveness of electrical power infrastructure as  targets for physical or terrorist attacks; (5) long lead times (of several  months to several years) for replacing high-voltage transformers\u2014which  cost several millions of dollars and are manufactured only in foreign  countries\u2014if attacked or destroyed; and (6) more frequent interruptions in  fuel supplies to electricity-generating plants.", "The National Science and Technology Council\u2019s Committee on Homeland  and National Security also established a task force in January 2009 to  identify research and development needs for electric grid vulnerabilities  and to coordinate with other federal agencies to address those needs. In  addition, government and industry efforts are under way to examine  cybersecurity threats, develop potential \u201cSmart Grid\u201d solutions to  address some of the grid\u2019s vulnerabilities, and develop and enforce  electricity reliability standards for the industry.", "DOD assets are vulnerable to electrical power disruptions in various ways.  For example, according to the DCIP Infrastructure Resiliency Guide,  vulnerabilities may involve the co-location of both primary and secondary  electrical power equipment, single points of failure in an electrical power  network, lack of security access controls to critical electrical power  equipment, electrical power lines sharing rights-of-way with other utilities,  and insufficient backup sources of electrical power generation. To address  such vulnerabilities, the guide suggests that owners or operators of DOD  assets consider diversifying the locations of primary and secondary  electrical power equipment, establishing independent transmission paths  for commercial and backup electrical power, increasing security and  monitoring access to critical electrical power equipment, establishing  mitigation options based on potential loss of rights-of-way, and developing  additional backup sources of electrical power. For more detailed  information regarding typical electrical power vulnerabilities that could  affect DOD assets and potential measures to address them, see appendix  II.", "DOD identifies the vulnerabilities and manages the risks of its most critical  assets to electrical power disruptions primarily through DCIP. On October  14, 2008, DOD designated 34 assets through DCIP as its most critical  assets\u2014assets of such extraordinary importance to DOD operations that  according to DOD, their incapacitation or destruction would have a very  serious, debilitating effect on the ability of the department to fulfill its  missions. While most (29 of 34) of these critical assets\u2014which may be  located in the United States, U.S. territories, or foreign countries\u2014are  owned by DOD, 5 are owned by other entities, including both domestic  and foreign commercial and other governmental entities. To ensure the  availability of these and other networked assets critical to DOD missions,  DCIP uses a risk management model that helps decision makers   (1) identify the department\u2019s critical assets based on the criticality of their  missions; (2) conduct \u201cthreat and hazard assessments;\u201d (3) conduct  \u201cvulnerability assessments\u201d (that include detailed reviews of electrical  power vulnerabilities); (4) conduct \u201crisk assessments\u201d to determine the  consequences of the assets\u2019 loss, evaluate the importance and urgency of  proposed actions, and develop alternate courses of action; (5) reach \u201crisk  management decisions\u201d to accept risks or reduce risks to acceptable  levels; and (6) formulate \u201crisk responses\u201d to implement the risk  management decisions.", "Key stakeholders involved in these DCIP processes include  ASD(HD&ASA), which serves as the principal civilian advisor to the  Secretary of Defense on the identification, prioritization, and protection of  defense critical infrastructure; the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,  who serves as DOD\u2019s principal military advisor for the program; and the  combatant commands, the military services, and other DOD agencies and  organizations, which may serve as asset owners or mission owners for  specific critical assets.

According to the official, the Corps has been requesting  this infrastructure-related information informally from the military  services for several months and recently augmented its requests with  formal written requests to the services. However, as of July 2009, the U.S.  Navy is the only service that has begun to gather the requested  information. In written correspondence with us, the remaining two  military departments have indicated that limited funds and personnel will  affect their ability to respond to the Corps\u2019 request for the infrastructure- related information, which one of the services considers to be an  unfunded mandate. Without this information, however, the Corps will be  unable to conduct its preliminary technical analyses of public works  infrastructure, including electrical power systems, which support the most  critical assets. As a result, the teams conducting DCIP vulnerability  assessments will be unable to consider crucial background information  about the most critical assets\u2019 public works infrastructure\u2014including  networks, assets, points of service, and inter- and intradependencies  related to electrical power systems\u2014before the teams conduct the DCIP  vulnerability assessments in the field."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DCIP Vulnerability Assessments Are Not Systematically Coordinated with Those from Related Mission Assurance Programs", "paragraphs": ["DOD does not systematically coordinate DCIP vulnerability assessment  policy, guidelines, or processes with those of other, related DOD mission- assurance programs that also examine electrical power vulnerabilities of  DOD critical assets.

Vulnerability assessments from  these other mission programs and efforts also examine electrical power  vulnerabilities of DOD critical assets. For example, as part of DOD\u2019s  antiterrorism and force protection efforts, the Defense Threat Reduction  Agency conducts Joint Staff Integrated Vulnerability Assessments at  selected DOD installations worldwide, including some that host critical  assets. These assessments identify vulnerabilities related to terrorism and  force protection at the selected installations, including those related to  electrical power systems, and provide options to assist installation  commanders in mitigating or overcoming the vulnerabilities.

Also, as previously discussed, DOD has conducted DCIP  vulnerability assessments on 14 of the 34 most critical assets and has  scheduled assessments for 13 of the remaining assets, but it has not yet  scheduled assessments for 5 of the non-DOD-owned most critical assets.  The DCIP vulnerability assessments conducted so far have identified  specific electrical power\u2013related vulnerabilities to some of the critical  assets, including vulnerabilities associated with the reliability of the assets\u2019  supporting commercial electrical power grid, the availability of backup  electrical power supplies, and single points of failure in electrical power  systems supporting the assets. Addressing the risks associated with these  vulnerabilities\u2014by remediating, mitigating, or accepting those risks\u2014can  help DOD assure the availability of electrical power to the critical assets.  For example, at all 6 most critical assets we visited, the DOD asset owners  have installed diesel-based electrical power generators as backup sources  of electricity during electrical power disruptions. Other (non-DCIP) DOD  mission assurance programs also have the potential to help DOD assure  the availability of electrical power supplies to its most critical assets. For  example, we found that Joint Service Integrated Vulnerability Assessments  and similar vulnerability assessments from the military services, which  have been conducted on some of the installations with critical assets for  antiterrorism and force protection purposes, also have identified  vulnerabilities related to electrical power.", "Furthermore, DOD also has taken steps to coordinate with other federal  agencies, including DOE and DHS, as well as electrical industry  organizations, and these steps may help to assure the supply of electricity  to its critical assets. For example, to represent its concerns and interests  on electricity, DOD participates in the Energy Government Coordinating  Council. The council provides DOD and other federal agencies with a  forum for sharing their concerns, comments, and questions on energy- related matters\u2014including critical infrastructure protection\u2014with DOE,  which chairs the group. In another effort involving DOE, several DOD  combatant commands\u2014including U.S. European Command and U.S.  Africa Command\u2014have recently agreed to accept a DOE departmental  representative to serve as an energy attach\u00e9 to the commands. The DOE  representatives will provide energy-related expertise to their respective  commands, particularly with respect to the commands\u2019 energy-related  planning activities and the security and reliability of the commands\u2019  energy infrastructure. DOD has also partnered with various federal  agencies and industry organizations to further increase the assurance of  electrical power. For example, DOD serves as co-chair of the federal Task  Force on Electric Grid Vulnerability of the National Science and  Technology Council\u2019s Committee on Homeland and National Security,  which was established in January 2009 to identify research and  development needs for electrical grid vulnerabilities and to coordinate  with other federal agencies to address those needs. In addition, DOD  officials are collaborating with a working group established by the Edison  Electric Institute in early 2009 called the Energy Security Partnership  Group. The group focuses on improving communications between DOD  and its utilities and on identifying and removing barriers to the  development of comprehensive energy security programs at DOD  installations. Also, in July 2009, DOD participated in an interagency  exercise cosponsored by DHS, DOE, and DOD called Secure Grid 2009,  Electric Grid Tabletop Exercise, for which officials from DOD, DOE, DHS,  the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the North American Electric  Reliability Corporation, and the Edison Electric Institute, among others,  jointly developed recommendations and potential responses to two  scenarios involving theoretical physical and cyber-related attacks on U.S.  electrical power grids.", "Our survey results confirm that some steps are being taken at various  levels within DOD to improve the assurance of electrical power supplies to  its most critical assets.

The survey  results also indicate that secondary sources of electricity\u2014such as  uninterruptible power supply systems and diesel generators\u2014provide  some backup electrical power capabilities to almost all of the critical  assets. In addition, according to the survey, asset owners and host  installations for some of the critical assets whose vulnerabilities have been  assessed have taken specific measures to address those vulnerabilities,  such as eliminating single points of failure, developing electrical power  disruption contingency plans, installing emergency electrical power  generators, and increasing physical security measures around electrical  power facilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Lacks a Mechanism for Tracking Implementation of Future DCIP Risk Management Decisions and Responses to Vulnerabilities", "paragraphs": ["DOD has not yet established a mechanism for systematically tracking the  implementation of future DCIP risk management decisions, which are  intended to address vulnerabilities (including those involving electrical  power) that have been identified for the most critical assets.

We administered one survey to  the military services and DOD agencies that own or have program  responsibility for the assets through DCIP to obtain information about the  (1) assets\u2019 degree of reliance on electrical power; (2) assets\u2019 primary and  backup sources of electrical power supplies; (3) number and type of  unplanned electrical power disruptions to the assets; (4) DCIP and non- DCIP assessments of the assets\u2019 risks and vulnerabilities to electrical  power disruptions from January 2006 through December 2008; and   (5) measures recommended, implemented, or planned to address or  manage such risks and vulnerabilities. We administered another survey to  the Joint Staff to obtain information about the missions supported by the  assets. Finally, we administered the third survey to the Office of the  Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland Defense and Americas\u2019  Security Affairs (ASD(HD&ASA)) regarding coordination efforts with  relevant DOD and non-DOD stakeholders. (These surveys are reproduced  in full in apps. III, IV, and V, respectively.) We limited our surveys to the  universe of DOD\u2019s most critical assets because of concerns over the  reliability of DOD\u2019s larger list of about 675 Tier 1 Task Critical Assets,  which support critical DOD missions at the departmental, combatant  command, and military service levels. We also conducted six follow-up  site visits to a nonprobability sample of critical assets to verify and  validate the surveys\u2019 results and evaluate in-depth issues identified in the  surveys\u2019 responses. We selected the sites for visits judgmentally based on  the survey responses regarding issues addressed in this report.", "We initially selected a random sample from DOD\u2019s universe of about 675  Tier 1 Task Critical Assets to survey for this review. However, based on  discussions with DOD officials and our own analysis, we found significant  data reliability and validity problems with DOD\u2019s Tier 1 Task Critical Asset  list. We found that the use of disparate sets of guidance, including draft  and nonbinding guidance, resulted in the selection and submission of  assets to the Tier 1 Task Critical Asset list based on inconsistent criteria,  thus limiting the usefulness of the Tier 1 Task Critical Asset list to DOD  decision makers in determining DOD\u2019s most critical assets and prioritizing  funding to address identified vulnerabilities. As a result, we determined  that for methodological purposes, DOD\u2019s current Tier 1 Task Critical Asset  list did not represent a meaningful universe from which we should select  our survey sample or to which we should project our survey results.  Because the universe of critical assets did not represent an accurate,  comprehensive list of DOD Tier 1 Task Critical Assets, we determined that  this issue in and of itself warranted further analysis. Therefore, we issued  a separate report, with recommendations, on issues relating specifically  to the Tier 1 Task Critical Asset list to enable DOD to take timely actions  to update and improve its list of Defense Critical Assets in the fall of 2009  and prioritize funding.", "Defense Information Systems Agency    Defense Infrastructure Sector Lead Agents    Headquarters, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, DCIP Public Works    Defense Threat Reduction Agency, Support Branch Chief, Combat    Director of Defense Research and Engineering    Defense Science Board, Task Force on DOD Energy Strategy    Mission Assurance Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center at Dahlgren    Selected DOD critical assets at U.S. military installations within the  To become more familiar with efforts currently taking place to assure the  nation\u2019s electrical power grid, we met with various officials from federal  agencies, electrical power industry associations, and private-sector  entities and other officials to determine their roles and responsibilities,  ongoing initiatives, and the extent of their coordination efforts with DOD  in assuring electrical power to the nation\u2019s power grid. We obtained  relevant documentation and interviewed officials from the following  organizations:    Department of Homeland Security (DHS)", "National Protection and Programs Directorate    Office of Infrastructure Protection   Infrastructure Information Collection Division    Partnership and Outreach Division    Protective Security Coordination Division    Office of Cybersecurity and Communications    Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Electricity Delivery & Energy    Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Office of Electric Reliability    North American Electric Reliability Corporation    CACI International, Inc.    Edison Electric Institute    Pareto Energy, Inc.    Talisman International, LLC  We did not request agency comments from DOE, DHS, and the Federal  Energy Regulatory Commission on the full draft report, which at the time  was classified as SECRET because of (1) DOD\u2019s concerns about the  classification and dissemination of the report and (2) the focus of the  recommendations on DOD\u2019s program. We did seek technical comments  from these entities on sections of the initial draft report that pertained to  their roles and responsibilities, which we incorporated in the report where  appropriate. We also shared sections of the initial draft report that  discussed the 2008 Report of the Defense Science Board Task Force on  DOD Energy Strategy, \u201cMore Fight\u2014Less Fuel,\u201d and the entities either  agreed or did not take issue with the conclusions of this report.", "To learn more about the assurance of electrical power supplies to DOD  critical assets, we developed three electronic surveys for DOD critical  assets, their missions, and coordination efforts regarding the assets. We  asked responders about (1) missions supported by the assets; (2) assets\u2019  degree of reliance on electrical power; (3) assets\u2019 primary and backup  sources of electrical power supplies; (4) number and type of unplanned  electrical power disruptions to the assets; (5) DCIP and non-DCIP  assessments of the assets\u2019 risks and vulnerabilities to electrical power  disruptions; and (6) measures recommended, implemented, or planned to  address or manage such risks and vulnerabilities, including coordination  efforts with relevant DOD and non-DOD stakeholders.", "We conducted our surveys from May 2009 through August 2009, using self- administered electronic surveys. We sent a questionnaire on DOD critical  assets to the owners and operators of DOD-owned critical assets. We sent  a second questionnaire on DOD critical asset missions to the Joint Staff (J- 34). We sent a third questionnaire on coordination efforts for DOD critical  assets to ASD(HD&ASA)/DCIP Office. We sent the questionnaires by  SIPRNet in an attached Microsoft Word form that respondents could  return electronically via SIPRNet after marking check boxes or entering  responses up to the SECRET classification level into open answer boxes.  We also made provisions for receiving completed questionnaires at the  TOP SECRET classification level, if needed, via a GAO Joint Worldwide  Intelligence Communications System account, which was established for  us at the DOD Office of the Inspector General.", "We sent the original three electronic questionnaires in May and June 2009.  We sent out reminder e-mail messages at different times to all  nonrespondents in order to encourage a higher response rate. In addition,  we made several courtesy telephone calls to nonrespondents to encourage  their completion of the surveys. All questionnaires were returned by  August 2009. In the end, we achieved a 100 percent response rate.", "Because this was not a sample survey, but rather a survey of the universe  of respondents, it has no sampling errors. However, the practical  difficulties of conducting any survey may introduce errors, commonly  referred to as nonsampling errors. For example, difficulties in interpreting  a particular question, determining sources of information available to  respondents, or entering data into a database or analyzing them can  introduce unwanted variability into the survey results. We took steps in  developing the questionnaire, collecting the data, and analyzing them to  minimize such nonsampling error.", "For example, design methodologists designed the questionnaire in  collaboration with GAO staff who had subject matter expertise. In addition  to an internal expert technical review by GAO\u2019s Survey Coordination  Group, we pretested the survey with U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Air  Force officials representing three most critical asset sites as well as  officials from the Joint Staff (J-34) and ASD(HD&ASA) to ensure that the  questions were relevant, clearly stated, and easy to understand. Since  there were relatively few changes based on the pretests and because we  were conducting surveys with the universe of respondents, we did not find  it necessary to conduct additional pretests. Instead, changes to the content  and format of the questionnaire were made after the pretests based on the  feedback we received.", "When we analyzed the data, an independent analyst checked all computer  programs. All data were double keyed during the data entry process, and  GAO staff traced and verified all of the resulting data to ensure accuracy.", "To verify and validate the survey recipients\u2019 responses and evaluate in  more detail issues identified in the surveys, we conducted six follow-up  site visits to a nonprobability sample of surveyed assets. We selected the  sites for visits judgmentally based on the survey responses regarding  issues addressed in this report. During these site visits, we spoke with  installation personnel, including asset owners and operators, about their  reliance on supporting electrical infrastructure and electricity providers.  While findings from our site visits are not generalizable to all 34 most  critical assets, we obtained follow-up survey information from installation  personnel for critical assets and visited those assets to validate the survey  responses, as applicable. We clarified responders\u2019 interpretation of the  survey questions, discussed their responses in detail, and visited the  critical assets and their supporting infrastructure to better understand  each asset\u2019s unique situation. Finally, we reviewed documentation and  guidance related to those critical assets, including vulnerability  assessments.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2008 through October  2009 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
