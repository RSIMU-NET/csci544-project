At that time, USDA had separate IT modernization efforts planned for each of the farm service, conservation, and rural development agencies. In light of the impact of possible restructuring on these plans, the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry urged USDA to postpone purchases of computer technology beyond what was necessary to maintain existing systems until the new structure of the department was defined. USDA agreed, and in April 1993 established a consolidated, multiagency program called Info Share. The goal of Info Share was to improve operations and delivery of services to customers by reengineering business processes and developing integrated information systems.", "We reported in August 1994 that Info Share was being managed as a vehicle for acquiring new technology rather than for reengineering business processes to better serve farm service customers. We recommended that Info Share be refocused on business process reengineering rather than on information technology acquisition, and that Info Share be linked to the department\u2019s reorganization.", "In response to our report, the General Services Administration canceled USDA\u2019s procurement authority for the program and OMB placed Info Share on its list of high-risk programs. However, as reported by USDA\u2019s Office of Inspector General (OIG), over $100 million had already been spent on the project during fiscal years 1993 and 1994. USDA later disbanded the Info Share program.", "USDA established the Service Center Implementation initiative in February 1995. Its objectives are to (1) reduce the number of field office locations for the farm service and rural development agencies from about 3,700 to about 2,500 and (2) restructure these 2,500 locations into one-stop service centers that would serve farm service, conservation, and rural development customers. In doing so, USDA expects to improve service delivery to customers and reduce costs.", "Responsibility for the Service Center Implementation initiative is assigned to a Subcommittee of the National Food and Agriculture Council (NFAC) consisting of agency administrators for the service center agencies. To achieve the objectives of the Service Center Implementation initiative, NFAC has undertaken several activities. One activity involves the service center IT modernization effort that consists of several major projects to reengineer business processes and acquire integrated information systems\u2014computers, software, telecommunications, and data. Other ongoing NFAC activities include closing and moving field offices into collocated sites, training staff on culture change to prepare them to work together within a single location, and consolidating the agencies\u2019 separate administrative structures into a single structure that supports all three agencies. A small interagency team\u2014the Service Center Implementation team\u2014works for NFAC to coordinate these projects and activities.", "The department also has two other activities underway that could have an impact on the IT modernization projects. One is a county-based study evaluating, among other things, how the Farm Service Agency (FSA), Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS), and Rural Development (RD) can best deliver service to customers at the service centers. The department contracted for this study in December 1997 and intends to use the results, due in September 1998, to help determine how county offices will be structured and how the department will deliver services. The second activity is the department\u2019s effort to make its information systems Year 2000 compliant.", "USDA\u2019s Chief Information Officer (CIO) has overall responsibility for implementing the Clinger-Cohen Act within the department.

However, in January 1997 USDA experienced significant problems when it began nationwide implementation of the project. Because telecommunications equipment being installed at the initial sites was not properly configured and did not interface with the existing computer equipment, it did not work properly and therefore delayed the installation schedule. As a result of this, as well as other factors, the telecommunications project fell more than 1 year behind schedule, and the overall cost of the project has increased by millions.

Also over this time period, USDA estimates savings of $5.5 billion achieved mostly through productivity gains from reducing staff time needed (an estimated 19 million hours annually) to handle such tasks as explaining programs or determining eligibility. The department cautioned, however, that these estimates must be validated in an operational environment.", "While there is little doubt that modernizing processes and IT for the service centers can result in significant qualitative and quantitative improvements for the department and its customers, none of the estimated billions in productivity gains identified will result in actual dollar savings to the department.

The Secretary envisions every one-stop service center providing its customers with access and service for all farm, conservation, and rural development programs. Yet, the department\u2019s plans show that all three agencies\u2014FSA, NRCS, and RD\u2014will be physically collocated at only about 700 of its 2,554 service centers. Approximately 1,650 other centers will house only two agencies, with the remaining 200 centers having staff from only one agency present. Because the department does not currently provide services and programs for all three agencies at every site, new and fundamentally different processes, information flows, and databases would be required to meet the Secretary\u2019s vision of one-stop service in all service centers.", "Nevertheless, the department has reported already spending over $140 million on its service center IT modernization, and plans to spend over $200 million more in fiscal years 1998 and 1999, with most of these funds used for acquiring new technology. Because the department\u2019s plans show that it will still be reengineering processes during fiscal years 1998 and 1999, and may not be finished reengineering until 2003, USDA has no assurance that these new IT acquisitions will meet customer needs or allow the department to provide one-stop service as envisioned by the Secretary.", "Furthermore, USDA\u2019s efforts to reengineer business processes at the service centers are redundant and uncoordinated. Both the county-based study USDA contracted for in December 1997 and the service center IT modernization\u2019s business process reengineering project are evaluating how the service center agencies (FSA, NRCS, and RD) should provide customer service at the centers. The two, however, are proceeding independently. Without integrating the study and the reengineering project, USDA may find costly rework necessary and waste IT resources. For example, one deliverable of the study is to include options to consolidate, centralize, outsource, privatize, cross-service, or franchise programmatic functions.

In September 1995, after USDA\u2019s OIG reported that the department was not effectively tracking costs for Info Share, the Senate Appropriations Committee noted in report language that it expected USDA to develop a comprehensive cost accounting and budget tracking process prior to making IT purchases.", "USDA\u2019s CIO is still in the process of developing and testing a capital planning and investment control process for the department and its agencies to use when assessing and managing IT acquisitions. Also, the department has not yet developed a comprehensive cost accounting and budget tracking system for the service center IT modernization. In the absence of a completed investment control process and cost accounting and budget tracking system, USDA continues to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on IT with no assurance that these expenditures will return commensurate benefits, and with limited ability to control and evaluate these investments effectively.", "For example, the department reviewed and approved the service center IT modernization plans and fiscal year 1998 and 1999 IT budgets of $200 million without considering explicit qualitative and quantitative information that is necessary to effectively assess IT projects and make high-quality investment decisions. First, no information on mission-related performance measures for any of the service center IT modernization projects was used because such information had not yet been developed, and risk information had been developed for only the telecommunications project. Second, information on estimated benefits and costs was not available for some projects. Moreover, although OMB developed capital asset criteria and worksheets that agencies are to use to consistently and objectively rate and rank IT projects, the department did not use this decision criteria to rate and rank its service center IT modernization projects.", "Once selection has occurred, as we reported in September 1996, leading organizations continue to manage their investments, maintaining a cycle of continual control and evaluation. To do so, projects are reviewed by senior executives at specific milestones as the project moves through its lifecycle and as the dollar amounts spent on the project increase. At these milestones, the executives compare the expected costs, risks, and benefits with the actual costs incurred, risks encountered, and benefits realized to date. This enables senior executives to (1) identify and focus on managing high-potential or high-risk projects, (2) reevaluate investment decisions early in a project\u2019s lifecycle if problems arise, (3) be responsive to changing external and internal conditions in mission priorities and budgets, and (4) learn from past successes and failures in order to make better decisions in the future.", "Although USDA has had the service center IT modernization projects underway since 1996 and has spent millions of dollars on them, the department is not systematically controlling and evaluating these IT projects throughout their lifecycles. First, executives are not reviewing these projects at specific milestones to ensure that these continue to be viable investments. Second, the department is not developing and maintaining the quantitative and qualitative information needed by these executives to effectively control and evaluate these IT projects. For example, the department has not developed an effective cost estimating, budgeting, and accounting process to identify, track, and report actual costs so that these could be compared to estimated costs. Third, while benefits have been estimated for the IT projects, they are not defined in terms of measurable mission-related performance improvements so that actual benefits could be tracked against estimates to assess the impact the IT investments have on productivity and mission performance.

Integrate the service center business process reengineering project with the county-based study.", "One approach for ensuring completion of these actions would be to assign accountability to the Deputy Secretary who would need to work with the Under Secretaries and Assistant Secretaries for the service center agencies and the CIO.", "We also recommend that the Secretary hold the CIO accountable, and provide her requisite authority and responsibility for managing and implementing the service center IT modernization, and direct that she complete the following additional actions: Identify, assess, and document the risks, costs, benefits, and performance measures for each service center IT project before providing additional funding to ongoing projects and approving any new projects, and then use this information to review, control, and evaluate these projects at specific milestones of the project\u2019s lifecycles.", "Develop a comprehensive plan for the service center IT modernization that documents and tracks all critical milestones, dependencies among major segments, and resources needed to complete them, taking into account the resources that will be needed to make the service center agencies\u2019 systems Year 2000 compliant.", "Develop an acquisition strategy that focuses on buying technology in manageable increments, where cost justification and performance measures are developed and documented for each increment.", "We further recommend that the Deputy Secretary report on a regular basis to the Secretary on the progress the department is making to implement each of these recommendations, and notify the Secretary when all of the identified weaknesses have been fully addressed and resolved."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["USDA\u2019s Deputy Secretary provided written comments on a draft of this report. They are summarized below, along with our responses, and reproduced in their entirety as appendix II.", "USDA agreed with some of our findings and recommendations. Specifically, USDA agreed to integrate the service center business process reengineering project with the county-based study. USDA also agreed to complete a comprehensive plan identifying critical milestones, project dependencies, and resources required for the modernization. Further, USDA agreed that the Deputy Secretary should report on a regular basis to the Secretary on progress the department is making to implement each of our recommendations.", "USDA also agreed with two other recommendations, but stated it was already performing consistent with these recommendations. First, the department agreed that IT-related projects should be managed as investments, but said that it was already accomplishing this. For example, the department stated that \u201cservice center IT projects are subjected to the evolving USDA capital investment and control process just as any other investment.\u201d The department also said that its Executive Information Technology Investment Review Board has \u201cdevoted considerable effort to examining these activities and monitoring progress\u201d and that \u201cUSDA management is provided information regarding the progress of the investment in the Service Center Implementation initiative by means of monthly Program Management Reviews.\u201d", "Our work showed, however, that the department does not have the process or the information to effectively manage the service center IT projects as investments. Although the Clinger-Cohen mandate requires that agencies use a capital planning and investment control process to assess and manage the risks of IT acquisitions, USDA has neither completely developed nor implemented such a process. Also, the department\u2019s senior executives have not been substantively involved in systematically controlling and evaluating the projects. For example, USDA\u2019s Executive Information Technology Investment Review Board has met only once since October 1997, when it approved the service center IT modernization plans and budgets. Minutes from that meeting, held on June 16, 1998, show no indication that the board discussed or evaluated information on service center IT modernization costs, benefits, risks, or performance measures. Regarding the monthly Program Management Reviews, the CIO\u2019s May 15, 1998, review found \u201cirregular attendance\u201d at the monthly meetings and that monthly progress reports provided to the Deputy Secretary \u201care often not timely, complete, or in a format to clearly communicate whether or not major initiatives are on target or behind.\u201d", "Second, the department agreed with our recommendation that technology should be acquired in manageable increments, each of which provides documented mission-related return on investment, but stated it was already doing so. We do not agree that this is being accomplished adequately. As discussed in the report, USDA began implementing the entire $129 million telecommunications project on a nationwide basis 5 months before it completed the cost/benefit analysis. By the time the cost/benefit analysis was completed, USDA had already obligated over half the $129 million for this project. No project increments were defined, no incremental cost/benefit analyses were prepared, and no incremental mission-related performance measures were developed.", "In addition, USDA disagreed with several of our recommendations. Specifically, USDA disagreed that it should define and document a concept of operations for providing one-stop service in all of its service centers before investing in new IT. USDA stated that it can simultaneously reengineer business processes and purchase IT, and said that \u201cbecause the business process reengineering process will take several years to complete, the investments cannot wait until the full process is completed.\u201d The department further stated that it objected to the \u201cpremise that every process inherent in delivering service must be fully reengineered before implementation can begin,\u201d and asserted that \u201can incremental and parallel approach is the best way to proceed given the massive business processes involved and the changing technology which will allow USDA to achieve efficiencies and savings as we move through the reengineering process.\u201d", "USDA\u2019s position is not consistent with the Clinger-Cohen mandate that agencies reengineer mission-related and administrative processes before making significant investments in supporting IT. If USDA continues making major IT purchases before determining how it will do business in its service centers, it risks repeating past failures, i.e., investing millions of dollars on IT that does not effectively satisfy its needs. The department needs to understand clearly how it is going to operate before it acquires supporting technology. This does not mean that every process must be fully reengineered before any investments can be made. It means that every process that is being automated must be fully reviewed and changes understood before technology is acquired to support it.", "USDA also disagreed with our recommendation that the CIO be given responsibility for managing the service center IT modernization. The department considered this a reversal of our earlier recommendations related to Info Share, that pointed out as a weakness that it was being driven by IT personnel rather than program personnel. USDA said its strategy has been to assign the responsibility and accountability for service center initiatives to agency program leadership. It further said that separating IT modernization from program change initiatives would invite \u201crepeating mistakes of the past.\u201d USDA agreed that \u201cmuch needs to be done to improve the project management structure\u201d and said it is taking steps to do so, but said it will continue to implement this initiative under its current approach of \u201cassigning day-to-day leadership and accountability to agency heads, acting collectively as the NFAC, and assigning the IT policy and oversight function to the CIO to ensure the effort is successful.\u201d", "USDA organizational weaknesses, in particular the fact that its CIO does not have the responsibility and authority needed to effectively manage major IT acquisitions agencywide, have contributed to past failures like Info Share. To correct the weaknesses, we recommended in past reports, and continue to recommend in this report, that the senior business managers in USDA be responsible for business process reengineering, but that the CIO be held accountable and responsible for managing the service center IT modernization. As currently planned, this IT modernization will be the biggest and most costly in USDA\u2019s history. If USDA is to avoid repeating past mistakes, it cannot insist on maintaining the status quo, i.e., having no senior-level official with overall responsibility, authority, and accountability for managing and coordinating the separate service center IT modernization projects and for ensuring that the Clinger-Cohen mandates have been met and that critical tasks are completed on time and within budget.", "In addition, USDA stated that it is not funding IT projects without preparing the requisite data and analyses, and that the \u201ccommon computing environment  has not been approved by USDA for procurement and deployment, and the CIO has conditioned any such approval on meeting capital investment planning and control requirements and other factors.\u201d", "Based on the results of our audit work, USDA claims that service center IT project approval is conditioned on \u201cmeeting capital investment planning and control requirements and other factors\u201d are not convincing and are not supported by facts. USDA does not define what its \u201cplanning and control requirements and other factors\u201d are, and has not completed development of, nor implemented, a capital investment process. Nonetheless, USDA plans to spend over $200 million in fiscal years 1998 and 1999, which includes investments for the common computing environment. These plans were approved by the department\u2019s Executive Information Technology Investment Review Board and the CIO.", "Finally, the department said it strongly opposes our suggestion that the Congress limit funding until the weaknesses we identified are resolved. The department stated that it believed limiting IT funding at this critical juncture would shut down much of the reengineering and technical development work that is underway and would cause USDA to forego implementation of improvements.", "USDA\u2019s view that our recommendations related to limiting its IT funding would \u201cshut down much of the reengineering . . . work\u201d is not correct. Our recommendation allows for funding to help USDA develop and document a concept of operations and the new mission-critical business processes necessary to provide one-stop service at all sites and integrate the service center business process reengineering project with the county-based study, and we have amplified the wording in our matters for congressional consideration to reflect this.", "While USDA does not take issue with most of our recommendations, it does not explain whether or how it plans to implement them. Rather, USDA cites actions that it already has underway and believes these are sufficient to mitigate risks. Although some of the steps being taken by USDA are helpful, they will not and do not correct the persistent weaknesses we identified.", "USDA also raised several additional matters that do not affect our conclusions and recommendations and thus are not discussed here. These matters and our responses are discussed in appendix II.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce its contents earlier, we will not distribute this report until 30 days from the date of this letter. At that time, we will send copies to the Secretary of Agriculture; the Chairmen and Ranking Minority Members of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, the Senate and House Committees on Appropriations, and the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight; the Director, Office of Management and Budget; and other interested parties.

We also interviewed the Executive Officer and his deputy from the Service Center Implementation team and those individuals leading IT modernization major projects to determine how these plans and efforts were being managed and undertaken.", "Using the Service Center Business Process Reengineering Business Case, Service Center Business Need and Technical Alternative Evaluation Study, and telecommunications planning documents, we identified the department\u2019s estimated costs for the service center IT modernization. We also obtained information from the Service Center Implementation team budget officer on expenditures the department has incurred since 1996, as well as planned expenditures for fiscal years 1998 and 1999. We used the agency\u2019s OMB A-11 submissions to identify expenditures that service center agencies had made and planned to make. We did not validate the accuracy of agency-provided data on cost or benefit estimates, or actual costs.", "To identify significant risks in USDA\u2019s service center IT modernization activities and plans, we compared them with requirements under the Clinger-Cohen Act and with generally accepted sound management practices as outlined in GAO guidance\u2014Executive Guide: Improving Mission Performance Through Strategic Information Management and Technology (GAO/AIMD-94-115) and Executive Guide: Measuring Performance and Demonstrating Results of Information Technology Investments (GAO/AIMD-98-89) and OMB\u2019s Circular A-130, Management of Federal Information Resources. We also determined whether recommendations made in past GAO reports, particularly those related to USDA\u2019s Info Share Program, had been implemented.", "In addition, we met with USDA officials and obtained information on the two other major initiatives the department has underway that could affect the service center IT modernization effort\u2014the county-based study evaluating options for delivering services at the service center and the Year 2000 conversion of all of the agencies\u2019 IT systems.", "Finally, we interviewed senior CIO officials to discuss their roles in overseeing the service center IT modernization, and met with OMB officials to discuss their reviews of related funding requests by USDA.

Our work was performed from September 1997 through May 1998 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments From the Department of Agriculture", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the Department of Agriculture\u2019s letter dated July 21, 1998."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1. Reporting USDA\u2019s $3 billion life-cycle estimate figure is not misleading. We explain on page 8 that personnel costs are included in the $3 billion life-cycle figure. In addition, appendix III provides a detailed breakout of the life-cycle costs estimated by USDA for each of the major projects and the cost elements for the business process reengineering and common computing environment projects. 2. Our report clearly states that the new technology we are referring to is technology that USDA acquired as part of the nearly $145 million the department spent on its service center IT modernization in fiscal years 1996 and 1997. In contrast, the \u201cmoderate investment\u201d that USDA discusses refers to the nearly $100 million that FSA, NRCS, and RD reported spending over this same time period on hardware and software within each agency and independent of the modernization. 3. We clarified the report to emphasize that configuration and integration problems were not the only cause of the delays. However, the department\u2019s characterization of the configuration and integration problems is misleading. A major reason for these problems was a failure by the department to properly test and pilot the telecommunications equipment and promptly correct the problems that were identified as early as October 1996 in the first two pilot sites. Instead, the department began installing equipment with known problems nationwide, thus complicating, delaying, and increasing the cost of correction. 4. USDA\u2019s position that the overall cost of the project remains under budget is misleading. The department originally set a budget of $132.5 million, but it was revised to $111.3 million, according to USDA\u2019s records, once the actual cost of the telecommunications equipment was determined. At the time of our review, however, the department expected the costs of the overall project to reach $128.8 million. 5. The report recognized that the 38,000 personal computers included not only workstations and laptops but also personal data assistants. Nevertheless, we modified the report to specify the number of workstations (7,000), laptops (21,000), and personal data assistants (10,000) making up the overall figure. We included the number of personal data assistants because these are computers. 6. Our statement is accurate. The estimated billions of dollars in productivity gains discussed refers to gains USDA said it expects to achieve by reengineering program processes, not gains achieved by reengineering administrative processes or consolidating administration. Our report makes this clear by noting that USDA currently has no plans to make additional staff reductions (i.e., beyond those already planned as part of the administrative consolidation) on the basis of expected productivity gains. In addition, USDA agrees that it has no plans to further reduce staff. 7. The statement accurately reflects information provided to us by the department on the number of computers RD and NRCS acquired and the reported costs of those computers. 8. While IT purchases that are not part of the service center IT modernization are reviewed by agency administrators, Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) staff, and \u201cother reviewers,\u201d neither the agencies nor the department has the process, the information, or the continual, substantive involvement of senior executives needed to ensure that the investments are judicious. Further, since the department has not formulated its concept of operations and has not yet reengineered its business processes to support \u201cone-stop\u201d service, it does not know what its new environment will be and has no analytical basis for determining whether interim purchases will \u201cfit into it.\u201d 9. At the conclusion of our review, the department could not describe clearly (either orally or in writing) how it would operate and deliver services at all service center sites. The department notes in its comments that it is currently updating a concept of operations document. 10. USDA has misread the clear language of the report which correctly states that the department plans to spend over $200 million in fiscal years 1998 and 1999. The report does not discuss whether the service center agencies have been provided departmental \u201capproval\u201d for specific amounts. 11. We modified the report to recognize that USDA had identified risks for its telecommunications project. 12. USDA\u2019s statement is incorrect. The information used in our report was developed independent of any of the department\u2019s cited reviews, including the May 15, 1998, OCIO report. Moreover, USDA did not provide us with a copy of its May 15 report until after we had met with departmental officials to review and discuss a draft copy of our report. While some of the problems identified in the department\u2019s reviews are similar to some of our findings, none are the same. For example, USDA\u2019s internal review notes that delays in business process reengineering schedules have occurred, whereas we report that USDA is acquiring IT before reengineering its business processes. Further, several of our findings, such as those related to not managing IT projects as investments or not acquiring IT incrementally, were not discussed in USDA\u2019s reviews at all. 13. USDA\u2019s assertion is not supported by the facts. Information on mission-related performance measures was not used because it had not yet been developed for any of the projects, and risk information has only been developed for the telecommunications project. Also, information on estimated benefits and costs for some projects (e.g., life-cycle costs and benefits for the telecommunications project) was not available. Further, USDA does not dispute the fact that OMB capital asset criteria and worksheets were not used. 14.
