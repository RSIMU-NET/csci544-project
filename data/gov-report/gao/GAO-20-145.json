Treasury, State, and Commerce, among other agencies, coordinate to implement these programs. Sanctions may place restrictions on a country's entire economy, targeted sectors of the economy, or individuals or corporate entities. Reasons for sanctions range widely, including support for terrorism, narcotics trafficking, weapons proliferation, and human rights abuses. Economic restrictions can include, for example, denying a designated entity access to the U.S. financial system, freezing an entity's assets under U.S. jurisdiction, or prohibiting the export of restricted items. GAO was asked to review issues related to the implementation and effectiveness of economic sanctions. Among other things, this report (1) examines the extent to which U.S. agencies assess the effectiveness of sanctions, and (2) identifies factors that have been shown by publicly available studies to contribute to the effectiveness of economic sanctions.

In addition, Commerce assesses prospective impacts of some sanctions on targeted countries and others. According to Treasury and State officials, the agencies also use Intelligence Community assessments to gauge sanctions' impacts. However, agency officials cited several difficulties in assessing sanctions' effectiveness in meeting broader U.S. policy goals, including challenges in isolating the effect of sanctions from other factors as well as evolving foreign policy goals. According to Treasury, State, and Commerce officials, their agencies have not conducted such assessments on their own. However, they stated that agency assessments of sanctions' impacts often contribute to broader interagency discussions that examine the effectiveness of sanctions in achieving policy goals.", "The academic studies GAO reviewed suggest that several factors have contributed to more-effective sanctions. Studies examining factors that contribute to the effectiveness of sanctions in changing targeted countries' behavior provided evidence that sanctions have been more effective when (1) they were implemented through an international organization (e.g., the United Nations) or (2) the targeted countries had some existing dependency on, or relationship with, the United States, such as a trade or military relationship. In addition, studies examining factors that increased sanctions' economic impact provided evidence that the impact has generally been higher when the sanctions were more comprehensive in scope or severity, or\u2014similar to the findings on effectiveness in changing behavior\u2014were imposed through an international organization. Sanctions may also have unintended consequences for targeted countries, such as negative impacts on human rights or public health.

Moreover, according to State  officials, routine, finished analysis\u2014assessing the impact of sanctions  either before or after their imposition\u2014is not always available from the  Intelligence Community or is slow in delivery.

The difficulties they  cited included the following:  Isolating sanctions\u2019 effects from other factors is difficult. Agency  officials cited the difficulty\u2014or, in some cases, the impossibility\u2014of  identifying sanctions as the sole or most significant cause of a target\u2019s  action relative to U.S. policy goals. For example, a sanctioned country  may decide to cease certain behavior for any number of reasons that  may be unrelated to the sanctions or other U.S. policy measures.  OFAC officials also stated that behavioral change can be subtle,  incremental, and lacking clear correlations with specific causes. In  addition, Treasury officials noted that sanctions are often used in  conjunction with other policy tools, such as diplomatic engagement  with the target, export controls, and visa bans. Distinguishing the  impact of each policy tool used is exceedingly difficult due to the  limited information available via intelligence and law enforcement  channels, according to Treasury officials.", "Policy goals and objectives often shift. Treasury officials stated  that U.S. policy goals and objectives underpinning the sanctions can  change over the course of a sanctions program, making it difficult to  measure sanctions\u2019 effectiveness in achieving any ultimate policy  objective. According to OFAC officials, because sanctions programs  are ongoing, any assessments of a sanctions program\u2019s effectiveness  would necessarily be interim, not final, and the metrics used to  measure effectiveness might change over the program\u2019s duration.", "Reliable data are sometimes lacking. Agency officials stated that a  lack of reliable data on certain targets or countries can also make it  difficult to assess the effectiveness of sanctions.", "According to Treasury, State, and Commerce officials, given these  difficulties and limited resources, they do not conduct their own  assessments of the overall effectiveness of existing sanctions programs  in achieving broad policy goals. Instead, they have directed resources  toward the assessments of sanctions\u2019 impacts on targets, such as the  impact on a target country\u2019s economy or trade. Agency officials also  noted that there is no policy or requirement for agencies to assess the  effectiveness of sanctions programs in achieving broad policy goals.  However, Treasury and State officials stated that sanctions policy is  continuously evaluated informally by those implementing the sanctions,  as new information comes in and as new targets are developed.  Moreover, Treasury, State, and Commerce stated that agency  assessments of sanctions\u2019 impacts often contribute to broader  interagency discussions, typically coordinated through the NSC, that  examine the effectiveness of sanctions in achieving broad policy goals.", "According to agency officials, an NSC-led process allows the U.S.  government to draw on multiple agencies\u2019 inputs and perspectives, and to  consider these issues in the larger policy context, given that sanctions are  often only one element of broader government-wide strategies to achieve  U.S. policy goals."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Studies Suggest Certain Factors Contributed to More- Effective Sanctions, but These Studies May Not Fully Reflect Certain Types of U.S. Sanctions", "paragraphs": ["We found strong evidence\u2014based on studies examining factors that  contributed to the effectiveness of sanctions in changing targeted  countries\u2019 behavior\u2014that sanctions have been more effective when  implemented through an international organization, or when targeted  countries had some existing dependency on or relationship with the  United States.

In addition, we found  strong evidence that the economic impact of sanctions has generally  been greater when they were more comprehensive in scope or severity.  Sanctions may also have unintended consequences for targeted  countries, such as negative impacts on human rights or public health. In  some studies, larger economic impacts were associated with more  unintended consequences, suggesting an important policy trade-off.

Studies using different methods, datasets,  and time periods consistently found that the United States was more likely  to achieve its sanctions goals when an international organization was  involved or when the target had some existing dependency on or  relationship with the United States.", "We found some evidence, based on a smaller number of studies, that  sanctions have been more effective when the target state had low per- capita income, when a country\u2019s threat of imposing sanctions was  assessed to be credible, or when sanctions imposed relatively high  costs on the target state. For example, one study found that the  likelihood of the target\u2019s acquiescing to all of the sanctioning country\u2019s  demands increased when sanctions were imposed on a target with low  per-capita income. Another study found that targets were more likely to  acquiesce in response to threatened sanctions when the United States  had not backed down against a resisting target recently. A third study  found that more-severe sanctions increased the likelihood that the  sanctioning country achieved more of its goals, suggesting that sanctions  imposing relatively high costs have been more effective.", "Our review also suggests that in some circumstances, the risk of  sanctions has deterred states from undertaking activities that would likely  have resulted in the imposition of sanctions. Factors that have increased  the measured effectiveness of sanctions may also increase their deterrent  effect. For example, two studies found that the greater the trade flows  between the target state and the sanctioning country, the greater the  likelihood of sanctions\u2019 success. A separate study demonstrated that  this same dependency\u2014greater trade between the target and the United  States\u2014led to greater deterrence of nuclear proliferation.", "More generally, states are likely to consider the risks associated with  undertaking activities that could lead to the imposition of economic  sanctions, among other factors. These risks include the likelihood of  sanctions being imposed or removed, the states\u2019 vulnerabilities to the  different types and amounts of pressure that could result from sanctions,  and the consequences that the states would experience if sanctions were  imposed. See the text box for more detail on the potential risks that states  that could be the target of sanctions might consider. (The text box is  intended to provide a more general framework for understanding how  states may anticipate and respond to sanctions; it reflects, but is not  limited to, the specific factors included in the studies we reviewed.)", "Risk Framework for States That May Be Targets of Economic Sanctions  Likelihood of sanctions\u2019 being imposed or removed. States that may be targets of  sanctions may assess the credibility of any explicit threats to impose or maintain  sanctions and the credibility of any assurances that sanctions will be removed when the  activity that motivated the imposition of sanctions ceases.   Vulnerabilities to potential pressure from sanctions. States that may be targets of  sanctions may assess whether the benefits of withstanding pressure that could result  from the sanctions exceed the costs. For example, states may be concerned that higher  economic costs from sanctions could be associated with greater impact on the material  wellbeing of individuals and firms. Higher economic costs could also make it more  difficult to compensate those affected by the sanctions\u2014and those costs could be  especially burdensome in states with low per-capita income. However, states likely  consider not only the costs from sanctions but also the extent to which they might over  time avoid or adapt to these costs. For example, if potential sanctions are likely to  disrupt trade and investments from major commercial partners, states that are potential  targets may examine whether developing or expanding relationships with third parties  could mitigate the loss of these economic relationships. Sanctions imposed via an  international organization (e.g., a multilateral approach associated with the United  Nations) may make it more difficult for targets to avoid or adapt to sanctions\u2014for  example, by finding alternative commercial partners\u2014and may signal a more robust  international consensus regarding the objectives of the sanctions.   Consequences if sanctions are imposed. States that may be targets of sanctions  may assess the direct financial impact as well as future diplomatic, political, or security  implications of the potential sanctions. That is, before engaging in activities that could  trigger sanctions, states that depend on the United States may consider the possible  impact of their actions on their future relationships with the United States in other areas,  including military cooperation or the provision of aid. Conversely, states that are less  dependent on the United States might anticipate fewer ongoing benefits from  acquiescing to U.S. demands."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Research on the Effectiveness of Sanctions May Not Fully Reflect Certain Types of U.S. Sanctions", "paragraphs": ["Two important types of U.S. sanctions\u2014targeted sanctions and  secondary sanctions\u2014were present during the time periods covered by  the studies we reviewed. However, the studies generally did not account  differently for these two sanctions types than for non-targeted and primary  sanctions, respectively. As a result, the studies generally did not reflect  differences between the effectiveness of these types of sanctions. This  limitation of the available studies could reduce the applicability of this  research to contemporary policymaking.", "Targeted sanctions. Targeted sanctions restrict transactions of and  with specific entities and individuals, such as those who may have  influence with a state\u2019s government. In response to such sanctions,  the targeted actors may in turn influence their government to change  its behavior. Targeted sanctions seek to minimize impact on society at  large and maintain most trade relationships with non-targeted actors  in the country. However, our interpretation of studies of sanctions  suggests that the targeted actors may use their influence with their  government to extract concessions that compensate them for the  impact of sanctions, which could limit the effectiveness of certain  targeted sanctions.", "Secondary sanctions. Secondary sanctions, also known as  supplementary sanctions, target third-party actors doing business  with, supporting, or facilitating targeted regimes, persons, and  organizations. From the perspective of a third-party actor, secondary  sanctions likely increase the risk involved in commercially partnering  with primary sanctions targets. Thus, secondary sanctions, especially  those implemented by a country as large and interconnected as the  United States, may make it more difficult for primary targets to avoid  or adapt to sanctions. Our interpretation of studies of sanctions  suggests that the effects of secondary sanctions imposed by the  United States could be similar to the effects of sanctions imposed with  a large or multilateral coalition through an international organization,  since sanctions imposed through an international organization also  increase the difficulty of finding alternative commercial partners.  However, our interpretation of the studies suggests that if secondary  sanctions were imposed without an international organization they  would be unlikely to signal a robust international consensus regarding  the sanctions\u2019 objectives, and thus may not as effectively deter their  targets, or third parties, from developing alternative commercial  arrangements.", "While the studies we reviewed generally did not separately analyze  targeted or secondary sanctions, states remain likely to consider the risks  associated with undertaking activities that could lead to the imposition of  these sanctions and sanctions in general. With respect to targeted and  secondary sanctions, states\u2014both primary targets and third-country  actors\u2014are likely to consider, among other things, the risks associated  with undertaking activities that could result in targeted or secondary  sanctions and the consequences they would experience if targeted or  secondary sanctions were imposed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Studies Suggest Comprehensive Sanctions Have Had Larger Economic Impacts but Could Also Yield More Unintended Consequences", "paragraphs": ["We found strong evidence, based on studies examining factors that  increased the economic impact of sanctions, that sanctions\u2019 economic  impacts on targets have generally been greater when the sanctions were  more comprehensive or were imposed through an international  organization.

Another study found  that imposing sanctions along with other countries led to reductions in  both U.S. and other Group of Seven countries\u2019 bilateral trade with  targeted countries.", "Some other studies suggest that sanctions may also have unintended  consequences. For example, some studies suggest that sanctions have  had a negative impact on human rights, the status of women, public  health, or democratic freedoms in target countries.
