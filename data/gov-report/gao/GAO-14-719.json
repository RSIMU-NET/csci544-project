Its mission is to support the export of U.S.  goods and services overseas, through the provision of loans, loan  guarantees, and insurance, thereby supporting U.S. jobs. Ex-Im is  generally prohibited by law from financing any credit sale of defense  articles and services for any country. However, in an exception to this  rule, Ex-Im was granted authority to facilitate the financing of U.S. exports  of defense articles and services, provided that it determines that these  items are nonlethal and primarily meant for civilian end use. Such items  are known as dual-use exports.", "Ex-Im\u2019s Engineering and Environment Division, with assistance from the  General Counsel, Congressional and External Affairs Division, and the  Policy and Planning Division, is responsible for implementing the dual-use  authority. According to Ex-Im\u2019s Military Policy, its definitions of \u201cdefense  articles\u201d and \u201cdefense services\u201d are based on who the end user is, and  then by the nature of the item and the use to which it will be put. In  addition, if the item is designed primarily for military use, it is presumed to  be a defense article. For example, according to Ex-Im, furniture sold to a  military organization for military use (e.g., for offices or homes occupied  by military personnel) is deemed a defense article. However, according to  Ex-Im, helicopters sold to a private firm or civilian police force are not  defense articles. According to Ex-Im policy, an export is eligible for  financing as a dual-use item if convincing evidence exists that the export  is nonlethal in nature and will be used mainly for civilian activities. The  determination of eligibility for dual-use financing may require applicants  for Ex-Im financing to provide additional information beyond the contract  and transaction data the bank normally requires for a loan or guarantee.  Ex-Im may also seek to corroborate the information submitted by  applicants by contacting other U.S. government agencies, such as the  Department of State. For example, prior to approving the three fiscal year  2012 dual-use transactions, Ex-Im obtained written certification from each  borrower that the items to be exported were nonlethal and would be  primarily for civilian use. In addition, Ex-Im vetted the Eutelsat and  Cameroon transactions with the Department of State, and vetted the  Mexico transaction with the U.S. embassy military attach\u00e9 in Mexico."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ex-Im End-Use Monitoring Requirements in Credit Agreements Are Not Being Fully Met", "paragraphs": ["Ex-Im has policies and procedures for monitoring end use, including  various documentation requirements, which are reflected in its financing  agreements with each of these borrowers.
