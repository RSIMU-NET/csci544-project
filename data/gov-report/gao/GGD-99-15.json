Over the past few years, the Postal Service\u2019s introduction of new products has stirred controversy. Some Members of Congress have said that the Service is unfairly expanding its product line to compete in nonpostal-related markets and have introduced legislation to curtail such activity. Some private sector companies have also complained about the Service\u2019s entry into nontraditional postal markets. They were concerned that the Postal Service could use its governmental status to an unfair advantage when introducing products that compete with private sector companies. In examining these concerns, you requested that we review several issues related to the Postal Service\u2019s development and marketing of new products and provide information on expenses and revenues associated with new products the Service introduced in recent years.

An independent Postal Rate Commission was established to, among other things, regulate the Postal Service\u2019s adherence to ratemaking standards and to ensure that it does not take advantage of its monopoly on the delivery of letter mail.", "Since the creation of the General Post Office in 1775, the core business of the U.S. Postal Service has been the collection and delivery of letters and packages to the households and businesses of the nation. Today, however, the Service sees its core business threatened by the advent of the electronic age. The Service believes that its role as provider of universal postal service at uniform rates faces competition significantly more challenging than the competition from past eras\u2014most notably the telegraph and the telephone.", "In 1997, former Postmaster General Marvin Runyon, in testimony before your Subcommittee, said the electronic rival the Postal Service currently faces goes far beyond anything faced before. He stated that computers, telephones, television, and electronic funds transfers are being brought together with a rapidly evolving communications network, and this network promises one day to link nearly every home and business in the nation with the capability to rapidly trade messages, money, and multimedia content.", "According to the Postal Service, this new communications network\u2014e.g., the Internet and its World Wide Web, e-mail, electronic commerce, and electronic data exchange\u2014is fundamentally altering consumers\u2019 choices and expectations. More importantly, because of these new choices, the Service is concerned that future First-Class Mail revenues will decline due to the electronic diversion of mail. In fact, the former Postmaster General was so concerned about this prospect that he testified before the Subcommittee that if a significant amount of First-Class Mail gravitates to alternative sources of delivery, this could jeopardize the Service\u2019s core business, which is the financial bedrock of universal service.", "It is against this backdrop that the Postal Service began, in the mid-1990s, focusing resources on the aggressive development and introduction of new products\u2014primarily nonpostal products. This move, however, has created controversy. Some Members of Congress and some private sector companies have said that the Postal Service is unfairly expanding its product line to compete in nonpostal-related markets, and they have manifested their concerns in various forms. For example:", "Representative Hunter introduced a bill (H.R. 3690) on June 20, 1996, to prohibit the Service from making available to the public any commercial nonpostal service that it did not have available on January 1, 1994.

To track the flow of three judgmentally selected products through the process, we worked primarily with the program managers responsible for those products. In all cases, we obtained, where possible, documentation to corroborate oral statements. This documentation included, for example, copies of draft and approved Business Proposition Statements, copies of draft and approved Business Plans, documents provided to top management and the Postal Service\u2019s Board of Governors, financial information about the three new products, and summary information about contracts and contractors. We did not independently verify the accuracy of the financial data provided or validate the Service\u2019s claim as to how much of its annual revenues were at risk to electronic diversion.", "We gathered pertinent information from the Service\u2019s Finance Department to develop profiles, including financial data, on the remaining new products the Service marketed and/or had under development during fiscal years 1995, 1996, and 1997 and that had been publicly announced as of November 1997. Included in the information we gathered were Business Proposition Statements, Business Plans, documents provided top management and the Board of Governors, and financial information about each new product. We reviewed and analyzed the information gathered and summarized the results of that work in appendix III. Clarification questions were addressed either by Finance officials or the program manager responsible for a particular product. As with the three products we reviewed in detail, we did not independently verify the accuracy of the financial data provided on the remaining products in appendix III. The inventory of products in appendix III is limited to products marketed and products under development that have been publicly announced by the Service. It does not include products under development that have not been publicly announced because of the proprietary nature of the Service\u2019s research and development effort.

However, our analysis shows that the Service is subject to at least three constraints. First, since it is the underlying statutory mission of the Postal Service to provide postal services to bind the nation together, the Service needs to be able to explain how any new product it develops will further that mission. Second, under its statutory authority, before marketing (including test marketing) a new domestic postal product, which necessarily involves classification of mail, the Service must request a recommended decision from PRC regarding the propriety of the Service\u2019s proposed classification, rates, or fees for the new product. Prior to issuing its recommended decision, PRC is required to hold hearings on the Service\u2019s proposal.

For example, the Service would be restricted to introducing new, nonpostal products through a for-profit corporation created and owned by the Postal Service. However, H.R. 22 would provide the Service with broader latitude to test market experimental postal products. For example, market tests of new postal products could be conducted for as long as 2 years and generate $10 million in revenues per year without prior PRC approval and could be extended to a third year with PRC\u2019s approval. The Postal Service\u2019s proposed legislative changes would also provide the Service with broader latitude to test market experimental postal products. Under the Service\u2019s proposed changes, it would be able to test market experimental domestic postal products without having them reviewed by PRC first."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Current Statutory and Regulatory Authorities and Constraints Governing the Postal Service\u2019s Ability to Market New Products", "paragraphs": ["The Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 provides the Postal Service with broad statutory authority to develop, test, approve, and market new products. With respect to the Postal Service\u2019s general duties, the act directs the Service to plan, develop, promote, and provide adequate and efficient postal services at fair and reasonable rates and fees. In addition, it specifies that it is the Service\u2019s general duty to \u201creceive, transmit, and deliver . . . written and printed matter, parcels, and like materials and provide such other services incidental thereto as it finds appropriate to its functions and in the public interest.\u201d", "In more specific terms, the act also provides the Postal Service authority to develop a variety of new products. With regard to new capital products, the Service has authority under the act to determine the need for post offices, postal and training facilities, and equipment and to provide such offices, facilities, and equipment as it determines are needed. The act also provides the Service with the specific power to provide philatelic services. With regard to new international products, the act has been interpreted by the courts as providing the Service, with the consent of the president, the authority to establish international products. Finally, with regard to nonpostal products, the act provides the Service with the specific power to \u201cprovide, establish, change, or abolish special nonpostal or similar services.\u201d These provisions do not contain any specific limitations or constraints on the Postal Service\u2019s authority to develop, test, approve, and market these products except for the requirement to obtain presidential consent with regard to international products. Nevertheless, our analysis shows that the Postal Service is subject to at least three constraints that affect postal operations, including the development and marketing of new products.", "First, the act sets forth the mission of the Service to provide \u201cpostal services to bind the Nation together through the personal, educational, literary, and business correspondence of the people.\u201d In addition, it directs the Service to provide postal services in a prompt, reliable, and efficient manner, at reasonable rates, and to all communities and patrons. Therefore, when the Service develops any new product, it needs to be able to explain how that new product will further its underlying statutory mission. For example, in response to recent questions from Congress regarding its marketing of new retail products with postal themes, such as neckties, T-shirts, greeting cards, and other gift items, Postal officials justified these nonpostal products as being needed to help provide the necessary revenues to operate its basic functions and obligations.However, more recently, the Postal Service acknowledged growing concerns in Congress and in the private sector about its marketing of these retail products, and it decided to end the sales of apparel merchandise at post offices.", "Second, under its statutory authority, before marketing a new domestic postal product, which necessarily involves classification of mail, the Service must request a recommended decision from PRC regarding the propriety of the Service\u2019s proposed classification, rates, or fees for the new product. The requirement to request a recommended decision from PRC before marketing a new product applies, however, only to new domestic postal products. Therefore, the Service may introduce new capital, philatelic, international, and nonpostal products without first requesting a recommended decision from PRC. Although there is no statutory definition of a postal product, court and administrative decisions have held that a product is considered to be postal in nature if it involves an aspect of the posting, handling, or delivery of mail.", "With regard to new domestic postal products, the act also requires that PRC provide an opportunity for a hearing on the record for the Service, mail users, and a PRC officer representing the interests of the general public prior to PRC issuing its recommended decision. Under its regulations, PRC provides general rules of practice for these proceedings and special rules and expedited proceedings for recommended decisions, such as decisions on (1) experimental products, (2) market tests of new products, and (3) new products that are to be marketed for only a limited amount of time. The Postal Service\u2019s Board of Governors may approve, allow under protest, reject, or modify PRC decisions as provided for in statute.", "Third, the Postal Service\u2019s ability to market new products can be constrained or influenced by congressional oversight and other congressional action. The act provides for congressional oversight of the Postal Service. This oversight responsibility resides primarily with the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs and its Subcommittee on International Security, Proliferation and Federal Services; and with the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight and its Subcommittee on the Postal Service. These Committees and Subcommittees periodically hold oversight hearings on postal operations, at which time the Postal Service may be asked to justify any new product being developed or marketed. Additionally, other congressional action, including restrictions imposed during the appropriations process and other types of legislative action, can constrain or influence the Postal Service\u2019s new product activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Current Authorities and Constraints Would Be Affected by the Adoption of H.R. 22", "paragraphs": ["On January 7, 1997, the Chairman, Subcommittee on the Postal Service, introduced H.R. 22 in the 105th Congress to reform the laws that govern the Postal Service.

The most recent version of H.R. 22 was agreed to by the Subcommittee on the Postal Service on September 24, 1998. H.R. 22\u2014currently entitled the Postal Modernization Act of 1998\u2014would amend the Service\u2019s current statutory authority to develop, test, approve, and market new products in a number of ways.", "First, H.R. 22 would provide, for the first time, statutory definitions for the terms postal products and nonpostal products. A postal product would be specifically defined as \u201cany service that provides for the physical delivery of letters, printed matter, or packages weighing up to 70 pounds, including physical acceptance, collection, sorting, or transportation services ancillary thereto.\u201d A nonpostal product would be defined as \u201cany product or service offered by the Postal Service (or that could have been offered by the Postal Service under section 404(a)(6), as last in effect before the date of enactment of the Postal Modernization Act of 1998) that is not a postal product.\u201d", "Having specifically distinguished between postal and nonpostal products, H.R. 22 would place additional constraints on the introduction of new, nonpostal products. Under H.R. 22, the Service would be restricted to introducing new, nonpostal products through a private, for-profit corporation funded through revenues derived from the Service\u2019s competitive products and loans obtained on the credit of the corporation itself. The corporation would be owned by, but separate from, the Postal Service and would be subject to the same corporate laws as any other similar private company. Furthermore, nonpostal products that the Service first offered to the public between January 1, 1994, and the date of enactment of H.R. 22 would be transitioned into the private corporation, following a schedule and procedures established by PRC. Nonpostal products first offered to the public prior to January 1, 1994, could continue to be produced or discontinued by the Service directly (but not established or changed). PRC would not, as under current law, be involved in reviewing the establishment of new nonpostal products.", "Under H.R. 22, for the first time postal products would be specifically divided into separate \u201ccompetitive\u201d and \u201cnoncompetitive\u201d categories. Competitive products would include those postal products facing full competition within the marketplace. As specified in H.R. 22, competitive activities would be, to the maximum possible extent, on the same terms and conditions as those faced by private sector competitors.", "After establishment of initial rates (referred to in H.R. 22 as baseline rates) based on a recommended decision by PRC, the Postal Service would have discretion to set prices for competitive products as it deems appropriate, as long as (1) each of these products was priced to cover its own costs, and (2) the competitive products collectively made a specified contribution to the overhead of the Postal Service. PRC would do annual audit reviews of competitive products to ensure that prices were set in accordance with the law.", "Noncompetitive products would include those products such as First-Class Mail and other classes of mail for which there are few practical or legal alternatives to the Postal Service. After establishment of baseline rates based on a recommended decision by PRC, rates for noncompetitive products would be established using a price \u201ccap\u201d regimen, based on the consumer price index less a \u201cproductivity offset,\u201d which PRC will determine every 5 years. Once the cap is established, the Postal Service may adjust prices on an annual basis within specified limits.", "International postal products would be grouped into the competitive or noncompetitive categories, as appropriate, and would, for the first time, be treated the same as any other postal product with regard to PRC involvement and oversight.", "H.R. 22 would provide the Service with broader latitude to test market experimental postal products. Under H.R. 22, experimental postal products could be tested in the marketplace without having to meet the specific price cap/competitive category requirements the bill would impose. Specifically, the proposal would authorize market tests of experimental noncompetitive and competitive postal products for as long as 2 years and for $10 million in revenues per year without prior PRC approval. Market tests could be extended to a third year with PRC\u2019s approval. Larger scale market tests, generating up to $100 million in annual revenues, would also be permitted under rules adopted by PRC. The Postal Service would be required to provide to PRC (1) notice prior to the initiation of any market tests; and (2) annually, information regarding costs, revenues, and quality of service on its market tests of new products. PRC would have the authority to review market tests through annual audit, to review market tests upon complaint, or to stop market tests that do not meet established criteria.

To oversee this work, Marketing established a New Business Initiatives and Products Group. Additionally, to facilitate the process of developing and introducing new products and to ensure effective management control, the Service developed a formalized system of checks and balances that requires top management buy-in at critical stages of the development process. This system of checks and balances, adopted in June 1996, is known as the CustomerPerfect! new product development process. This process is also used to review the performance of products and terminate those that do not perform to Postal Service expectations.", "As an additional check to ensure that the new product development process is followed, top management established a Business Evaluation Group in the Finance Department. In addition to helping the Marketing Department oversee the process, the Business Evaluation Group is to validate the financial feasibility of new products and provide the Board of Governors with an independent financial assessment of each new product. The Business Evaluation Group reports directly to the Chief Financial Officer/Senior Vice President.", "Under the new product development process, new products initiated by the Marketing Department\u2019s New Business Initiatives and Products Group go through four distinct stages: the (1) concept stage, (2) business plan stage, (3) test stage, and (4) implementation stage.

If the Chief Marketing Officer approves the Business Proposition Statement, then the new product proposal advances to stage 2\u2014the business plan stage.", "In the business plan stage, a preliminary Business Plan is prepared that includes detailed sections on customer requirements, the target market and strategy for entering that market, the organization and management structure for the business, financial projections, and critical success factors and measures of success. In developing the preliminary Business Plan, a cross-functional team is assembled to achieve consensus on the product assumptions needed to build the preliminary Business Plan. Team members, selected on the basis of skills needed, are drawn from various postal headquarters departments, such as Marketing, Finance, Legal, and Purchasing; and Field Operations. Any issues the cross-functional team cannot resolve by consensus are settled by the Chief Marketing Officer.", "After the preliminary Business Plan is developed, the Chief Marketing Officer solicits feedback from individual members of the Management Committee, which comprises the Postmaster General, Deputy Postmaster General, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Marketing Officer. Following review and approval by the Management Committee, the Marketing Department conducts a proof of concept operations test with a vendor to validate the new product concept. If the operations test indicates that the new product concept is valid and ready for market testing, then the Chief Marketing Officer presents the preliminary Business Plan to the Strategic Planning Committee of the Board of Governors for review.

Following the limited market test, the Chief Marketing Officer reviews the test results and determines the need for an expanded test. If the Chief Marketing Officer determines that an expanded test is warranted, then a proposal for a major market test is prepared. That proposal is then to be reviewed and approved by the Management Committee, Strategic Planning Committee of the Board of Governors, and the Board of Governors.

Electronic PostmarkTM is the Postal Service\u2019s electronic version of its traditional postmark. The Electronic PostmarkTM System applies the digital signature of the Postal Service to an electronic transaction, states the time and date it is applied, and displays notification to the recipient if the transaction has been tampered with.", "Although all three products were moved into the new product development process in June 1996, the products entered different stages of the new process and progressed at different rates. FIRSTCLASS PHONECARDTM entered the new process at the test stage and has since progressed to the implementation stage. At the end of fiscal year 1997, FIRSTCLASS PHONECARDTM was the only product to have achieved national rollout under this process.
