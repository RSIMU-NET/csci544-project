To address this problem, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), under its Underground Storage Tank (UST) Program, required tank owners to install leak detection equipment and take measures to prevent leaks. In 1986, the Congress created a federal trust fund to assist states with cleanups. Cleanup progress has been made, but, as of early 2005, cleanup efforts had not yet begun for over 32,000 tanks, many of which may require state and/or federal resources to address. GAO identified (1) data on the number and cleanup status of leaking tanks, (2) funding sources for tank cleanups, and (3) processes used by five states with large numbers of leaking tanks--California, Maryland, Michigan, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania--to identify, assess, and clean up sites."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Data submitted to EPA by the states show that, as of March 31, 2005, more than 660,000 tanks were in use and about 1.6 million were no longer in use. In addition, states identified about 449,000 tank releases (leaks) and about 416,000 initiated cleanups, with almost 324,000 of those cleanups completed. States also compile limited data on abandoned tanks--tanks whose owners are unknown, or unwilling or unable to pay for their cleanup--but EPA does not require states to provide separate data on all of their known abandoned tanks. Without this separate data, EPA cannot effectively determine the number and cleanup status of these tanks, or how to most efficiently and effectively allocate federal cleanup funds to the states. Tank owners and operators are primarily responsible for paying to clean up their own sites, but abandoned tanks are cleaned up using state resources, that may be limited, and federal trust funds. EPA estimates that the average remediation costs per site have been about $125,000, but costs sometimes have exceeded $1 million. Officials from two of the five states we contacted reported that their state funds may be inadequate to address contamination at abandoned tank sites. In this regard, Michigan and North Carolina officials told GAO that, because of resource constraints, they let contamination at abandoned tank sites attenuate (diminish) naturally once immediate threats are addressed. Furthermore, due to limited resources, states must sometimes find other options for cleaning up sites. For example, Pennsylvania officials asked EPA to take over the cleanup work at the abandoned Tranguch site in 1996 because the owner was bankrupt and the state could not pay the expected cleanup costs. The five states that GAO contacted identify, assess, and clean up leaking tank sites using similar processes. Generally, owners and operators are responsible for conducting these activities under state oversight. Leaking tanks are identified when tank owners report leaks; land redevelopment activities uncover unknown tanks; or state agencies investigate contamination complaints or inspect tanks for regulatory compliance. While regular tank inspections can detect new leaks and potentially prevent future ones, as of early 2005, only two of the five states GAO contacted--California and Maryland--consistently inspected all the state's tanks at least once every 3 years, the minimum rate of inspection that EPA considers adequate. The Energy Policy Act, enacted in August 2005, among other things, requires inspections at least once every 3 years and provides federal trust funds for this and other leak prevention purposes. EPA and some state officials told GAO that increasing inspection frequency could require additional resources. Being able to use trust fund allocations for this purpose will help in this regard. The five states GAO contacted, once they become aware of leaking tanks, identify responsible parties and require them to hire consultants to conduct site assessments and plan and implement cleanup work. The states generally prioritize sites for cleanup according to the immediate threat they pose to human health, safety, and/or the environment."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Leaking underground tanks that store potentially hazardous products,  primarily gasoline at service stations, can contaminate soil as well as  groundwater, the source of drinking water for nearly half of all Americans.  Some components of gasoline can pose serious health risks to the  individuals exposed to them. For example, one gasoline additive\u2014methyl  tertiary butyl ether (MTBE)\u2014is a potential carcinogen that can migrate  quickly through the soil into groundwater. Even in small amounts, MTBE  can render groundwater undrinkable and is difficult and costly to clean up.  According to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data, as of March 31,  2005, about 449,000 fuel releases (leaks) had occurred from the more than  2.2 million active (currently in use) and closed (no longer in use) federally  regulated underground storage tanks nationwide. While progress has been  made in cleaning up releases, cleanup efforts had not yet begun to address  over 32,000 of them.", "To address this problem, in 1984, the Congress created the Underground  Storage Tank (UST) Program within EPA, which subsequently established  the Office of Underground Storage Tanks to manage the program. Under  the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), tank owners and  operators must register with a designated state or local agency  underground tanks that store petroleum or hazardous substances. EPA and  the states then track and regulate these tanks. Furthermore, EPA required  tank owners to install new leak detection equipment by the end of 1993 and  new spill-, overfill-, and corrosion-prevention equipment by the end of 1998.  If these conditions were not met, owners had to close or remove their  tanks.", "Tank owners and operators are ultimately responsible for cleaning up  contamination from their leaking tanks. However, in 1986, the Congress  established the Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) Trust Fund to  provide money for (1) overseeing and enforcing cleanup actions taken by a  tank owner or operator, and (2) cleaning up leaks at tank sites where the  owner or operator is unknown, or unwilling or unable to take action\u2014  which we refer to in this report as \u201cabandoned\u201d\u2014or which require  emergency action. EPA or a state can proceed with cleanup using the LUST  Trust Fund, and can subsequently seek reimbursement from the owners or  operators. The fund is capitalized through a $0.001/gallon tax on gasoline  and other motor fuels and the interest that accrues to the fund balance  annually. As of September 2004, the fund balance was about $2.2 billion.  The Congress annually appropriates amounts from the LUST Trust Fund to  the federal UST Program that EPA uses to negotiate and oversee  cooperative agreements with states, implement programs on Indian lands,  and support regional offices and state programs. Appropriations from the  fund have been about $70 million to $76 million annually. The majority of  these funds go to states to implement their underground storage tank  programs. As of September 2004, EPA had approved 34 states, the District  of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, to operate and enforce their own  underground storage tank programs with EPA oversight and monitoring.  Fourteen other states operate and enforce their own tank programs under  state laws with limited EPA oversight. States receiving LUST Trust Fund  money can spend it on cleanup and related activities. In addition, the  Energy Policy Act, enacted in August 2005, authorizes states to use a  portion of their federal trust funds for inspections and other leak  prevention purposes and generally requires that states inspect their  underground storage tanks at least once every 3 years. EPA also awards  states annual grants to help them fund a portion of their inspection and  enforcement costs.", "In this context, we identified (1) information available on the number and  cleanup status of leaking underground storage tanks, (2) existing sources  of funding for cleanups at contaminated tank sites, and (3) processes used  to identify, assess, and clean up sites in 5 states with large numbers of  leaking tanks\u2014California, Maryland, Michigan, North Carolina, and  Pennsylvania. In addition, to provide some perspective on how leaking  underground storage tank sites are identified and cleaned up, we are  providing information on the history and cleanup status of one leaking tank  site in each of these 5 states. This information is included in appendix I.", "To address these issues, we reviewed and evaluated program data from  EPA and interviewed program officials in EPA\u2019s Office of Underground  Storage Tanks and EPA Regions 3 (Philadelphia), 4 (Atlanta), 5 (Chicago),  and 9 (San Francisco). We also reviewed and evaluated data from and  conducted interviews with state program officials in California, Maryland,  Michigan, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania. In addition, we selected one  leaking tank site in each of these 5 states for comparison of cleanup status,  costs, and other factors. We included the Tranguch Tire Service,  Incorporated, facility in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, among the sites in  our review due to congressional interest. We selected the remaining 4 sites  primarily on the basis of their high cleanup costs, cleanup status, and other  similarities with the Tranguch site for comparison. We interviewed site  project or incident managers and reviewed case files for each site.  Additional information regarding our objectives, scope, and methodology is  included in appendix II.

Figure 1 shows confirmed releases from underground  storage tanks, cleanups initiated, and cleanups completed annually from  fiscal years 1997 through 2004.", "As this figure indicates, the number of new releases confirmed annually  declined, from about 12,000 in 2003 to less than 8,000 in 2004\u2014about 35  percent. However, while figure 1 shows a decline in the number of releases  confirmed annually over the period, it also shows a decrease in the number  of cleanups initiated and completed. According to EPA, the number of  cleanups completed each year has generally decreased over recent years  and fell by 23 percent\u2014from more than 18,000 in fiscal year 2003 to just  over 14,000\u2014in fiscal year 2004. Furthermore, there still remains a national  backlog of almost 130,000 cleanups yet to be completed.", "EPA\u2019s UST Program is primarily implemented by the states. EPA has  become directly involved in program implementation only in Indian  country and when states have been unwilling or unable to establish  effective underground storage tank programs or to address contamination  at specific sites. Instead, EPA\u2019s primary role has been to establish standards  and regulations to assist the states in implementing their programs. While  all EPA-approved underground storage tank programs must be no less  stringent than the federal program, individual aspects of each state  program differ. For example, state time frames for conducting inspections  vary widely. Also, while some states use only state environmental  personnel to conduct inspections, others use state-certified private  inspectors, or both. Furthermore, state program requirements and  standards are sometimes more stringent and inclusive than those under the  federal program. For example, states often regulate home heating fuel  tanks, tanks on farms, and above-ground tanks that RCRA generally  excludes from the federal program.", "EPA\u2019s UST Program receives approximately $70 million each year from the  LUST Trust Fund, about 80 percent of which is used for administering,  overseeing, and cleaning up sites. The remaining money has been used by  EPA for negotiating and overseeing cooperative agreements, implementing  programs on Indian lands, and supporting regional and state offices. EPA  spends about $6 million annually from the LUST Trust Fund on the agency\u2019s  program implementation, management, and oversight activities. Amounts  distributed to the states from the fund each year vary depending primarily  on whether they have an EPA-approved program, the total number of each  state\u2019s tanks, and the number of releases from those tanks. Until recently,  states could use these funds only for cleanup and related administrative  and enforcement activities, and EPA awarded each state about $187,000  annually from the agency\u2019s State and Tribal Assistance Grant account to  help administer their programs and cover inspection and enforcement  costs. Historically, states have used about one-third of their LUST Trust  Fund money for administration, one-third for oversight and state-lead  enforcement activities, and one-third for cleanups, according to EPA.", "The Energy Policy Act of 2005, enacted in August 2005, includes a number  of provisions addressing issues relating to training, tank inspections,  prohibitions on fuel deliveries to problem tanks, and funding tank  inspections and enforcement, among others. With regard to training, the act  requires EPA to publish guidelines specifying training requirements for  tank operation and maintenance personnel and authorized EPA to award  up to $200,000 to states that develop and implement training programs  consistent with these guidelines.", "In addition, the act requires EPA and any state receiving federal UST  funding to inspect all regulated tanks not inspected since December 22,  1998, within 2 years of the date of enactment. After these inspections are  completed, EPA or the state must generally inspect regulated tanks once  every 3 years. The act allows EPA to extend the first 3-year period for up to  1 additional year if an authorized state demonstrates that it has insufficient  resources to complete all inspections within the first 3-year period.  Furthermore, beginning in 2007, the act prohibits deliveries to underground  storage tanks that are not in compliance with applicable regulations and  requires EPA and states to publish guidelines for implementing the delivery  prohibition that would, among other things, identify the criteria for  determining which tanks are ineligible for delivery. Finally, the act  authorizes substantial appropriations from the trust fund during fiscal  years 2005 through 2009 for a variety of activities, including release  prevention, compliance, training, inspections, and enforcement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States Provide EPA with Some Tank and Cleanup Data, but Do Not Provide Separate Information on All Known Abandoned Tanks", "paragraphs": ["EPA collects data on the total number of underground storage tanks and  the status of cleanup activities relating to these tanks from all states, and  reports this information semiannually.

While abandoned tanks are  included in the data reported to EPA, they are generally aggregated with  the other data and cannot be separately identified. However, all 5 states we  contacted compile some limited data on abandoned tanks and report this  information separately to the EPA regional office that manages each state\u2019s  LUST Trust Fund cooperative agreement. In this regard, all 5 states  separately report the number of initiated and completed cleanups of  abandoned tanks using trust fund money. However, these data do not  include separate information on cleanups of known abandoned tanks using  state funds or any known abandoned tanks where cleanup has not yet been  initiated. EPA officials believe that the data the agency currently obtains  from states are sufficient for general program oversight, identifying  program trends, and determining the progress of individual states\u2019  programs. However, because states generally do not provide separate data  on all abandoned tanks, EPA has limited ability to assess and track states\u2019  progress in cleaning up contamination from these tanks. In addition,  although one of the primary purposes of the LUST Trust Fund is to provide  money for cleaning up abandoned tank sites, EPA lacks information\u2014such  as the number of releases from known abandoned tanks in each state and  how many of these releases have been or are being cleaned up\u2014to help it  determine how to most efficiently and effectively allocate funds to the  states for this purpose.

However,  according to the director of EPA\u2019s UST Program, many of these  owners/operators, most of which are small, independent businesses, do not  have the financial capacity to pay for expensive cleanups. EPA estimates  that the average remediation cost per site has been about $125,000, but  costs sometimes have exceeded $1 million. Under RCRA, tank owners and  operators must maintain evidence of financial responsibility for carrying  out cleanup actions, using one or more of a variety of mechanisms,  including commercial insurance, corporate guarantee, letter of credit,  qualification as a self-insurer, or an EPA-approved state financial assurance  fund. For commercial insurance, the owner/operator usually pays  premiums as well as a deductible amount and/or co-payments before the  policy begins to cover remediation costs up to some limit of coverage per  leak incident. To assist owners/operators in funding cleanups, as of  November 2004, 40 states had established state assurance or  indemnification funds. State indemnification funds typically have  deductible and co-payment requirements similar to those for commercial  insurance, but these funds are managed by the state. Indemnification funds  are usually capitalized through gasoline and diesel fuel taxes or fees paid  by owners/operators registering or obtaining permits for underground  storage tanks, as required. Any cleanup costs above the maximum coverage  provided by insurance or the indemnification fund are borne by the tank  owner/operator. A state fund qualifies as a financial assurance mechanism  if EPA has approved it for that purpose. In deciding whether to approve a  fund, EPA considers the certainty of the availability of funds for cleanup,  the amount of funds that will be made available, the types of costs covered,  and other relevant factors.", "The 5 states we contacted vary in their approaches to ensuring that  contaminated tank sites are cleaned up and that tank owners/operators, to  the extent possible, pay the remediation costs. Three of the 5  states\u2014California, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania\u2014currently have  financial assurance funds that reimburse owners/operators for cleanup  costs under varying conditions. Maryland and Michigan have no such  funds, and, instead, tank owners/operators rely primarily on commercial  insurance to pay cleanup costs.", "California: California's Underground Storage Tank program includes a  state financial assurance program\u2014the Underground Storage Tank  Cleanup Fund\u2014to assist tank owners/operators in funding site cleanups.  The fund, established in 1989, is the state\u2019s primary mechanism for  reimbursing owners/operators for their costs of cleaning up leaking  underground storage tanks incurred after January 1, 1988. The fund is  available to most owners/operators of tanks subject to EPA\u2019s Underground  Storage Tank Program, as well as owners of certain small home heating oil  tanks. The California State Water Resources Control Board administers the  fund, which is primarily capitalized through a storage fee\u2014paid by owners  of regulated and permitted underground storage tanks\u2014for each gallon of  petroleum placed in the tanks. According to board officials, the fund  collects about $240 million annually and, except for $200,000 per year that  is used for enforcement, monies from the fund are all used for tank  cleanups, including such activities as direct cleanup by responsible parties,  agency oversight, and replacement of drinking water wells. In fiscal year  2004, California spent approximately $208 million to reimburse responsible  parties for direct expenses incurred in cleaning up leaking underground  storage tanks.", "The fund reimburses tank owners/operators for cleanup costs up to $1.5  million per incident for \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d remediation costs.  Claimants are divided into four classes: class \"A\" claimants do not have to  pay a deductible before costs are reimbursed by the fund; class \u201cB\u201d and \u201cC\u201d  claimants must pay the first $5,000 in eligible corrective action costs; and  class \u201cD\u201d claimants are responsible for the first $10,000. An Underground  Storage Tank Petroleum Contamination Orphan Site Cleanup subaccount  was established as part of the fund in September 2004, capitalized with $30  million ($10 million per year for 2005 through 2007) transferred from the  fund to reimburse cleanup costs incurred in cleaning up abandoned  contaminated urban brownfield sites. In addition to reimbursing  owners/operators, state officials said that $5 million a year is transferred  from the fund to a subaccount to address emergency, abandoned, and  recalcitrant tank site cleanups.", "Board officials we interviewed told us that the fund is adequately  capitalized and that they do not always spend all available funds each year.  Nevertheless, these officials also said that the state is interested in ways to  minimize program costs and is experimenting with pay-for-performance  remediation contracts, which are now being used at 20 cleanup sites in the  state.", "Maryland: Although Maryland has 2 trust funds that have financed certain  cleanup activities, it does not have a fund that EPA has approved for use as  a financial assurance mechanism. According to state officials, owners and  operators primarily use commercial insurance to demonstrate financial  responsibility. The state\u2019s Oil Contaminated Site Environmental Cleanup  Fund has provided limited cleanup assistance to owners/operators of  federally-regulated underground storage tanks, among others. The fund  provides funding of up to $125,000 per leak occurrence from underground  storage tanks\u2014subject to deductibles from $7,500 to $20,000\u2014and is  primarily capitalized by a fee of 1.75 cents per barrel of oil imposed at the  first point of transfer into the state. However, the program stopped  accepting applications for reimbursement from owners and operators of  federally-regulated underground storage tanks on June 30, 2005. In  addition, the Maryland Oil Disaster Containment, Cleanup, and  Contingency Fund finances, among other things, state cleanup costs for  abandoned sites. Revenues for this fund, according to the fund\u2019s fiscal year  2004 annual report, are generated by a fee of 2 cents per barrel of oil  transferred into the state. From July 1, 2003 to June 30, 2004, this fund paid  out about $3.5 million.", "Michigan: Michigan's state financial indemnification program for  underground storage tanks was terminated in June 1995, because it had  insufficient funds to pay existing and future claims. Since that time, tank  owners/operators have been required to annually show proof of financial  assurance to cover cleanup costs in order to operate in Michigan. Small  owners/operators usually provide this proof by obtaining commercial  insurance. The state has used a number of sources to fund limited cleanup  work at underground storage tank sites, including the Cleanup and  Redevelopment Fund, the Clean Michigan Initiative Bond Fund, the  Environmental Protection Fund; State General Funds, and the  Environmental Protection Bond Fund. Appropriations from these funds  address soil, groundwater, and sediment contamination from all sources,  including leaking tanks. Most of these funds are no longer available for new  projects. According to state officials, in the fall of 2004, state legislators  voted to establish a Refined Petroleum Fund that will be capitalized by a  7/8 cent-per-gallon fee on refined petroleum products to be collected  through 2010. This fund is expected to accrue approximately $60 million  each year, a portion of which is expected to be used to clean up  underground storage tank sites. A Refined Petroleum Cleanup Advisory  Council was also established to provide the governor and legislature with  recommendations on how to spend the fund\u2019s revenues. State officials told  us that the council is expected to recommend an increase in the 7/8 cent fee  to implement its other recommendations.", "North Carolina: North Carolina has a state fund that acts as a financial  assurance mechanism and that reimburses owners/operators for most of  the costs for site assessments, cleanups, and damages related to leaking  underground storage tanks. This fund applies to leaks discovered after  June 30, 1988, from commercial underground tanks containing petroleum.  The fund is primarily capitalized by a 0.297 cent-per-gallon excise tax on  motor fuel sales; a small part of the state inspection tax on motor fuel and  kerosene; and annual tank operating fees. Under provisions of the fund,  owners/operators of tanks that have upgraded corrosion, leak, and overfill  protection pay the first $20,000 of assessment and cleanup costs and the  first $100,000 in third party liability costs. The fund then pays all other  cleanup costs deemed reasonable and necessary, up to $1 million, and an  additional $500,000, with a 20 percent co-payment by the owner/operator,  after which any remaining amount is paid by the owner/operator. The state  paid approximately $21 million in reimbursements for tank assessment and  cleanup costs from this fund in fiscal year 2004.", "Because the balance of the fund was not sufficient to cover all obligations,  in June 2002, the fund began operating from month to month, paying out  funds on a first-come, first-paid basis. This action resulted in a significant  backlog of claims with pending payments, according to the fund\u2019s annual  report. Consequently, EPA is currently monitoring North Carolina\u2019s fund to  determine its viability as a financial assurance mechanism. To address  concerns about the viability of the trust fund, North Carolina officials are  considering requiring tank owners/operators to use other forms of financial  assurance, such as commercial insurance.", "Pennsylvania: Pennsylvania\u2019s Underground Storage Tank Indemnification  Fund was created by the state Storage Tank and Spill Prevention Act of  1989, as amended, and is administered by the State Insurance Department,  according to the fund\u2019s 2004 annual report. The fund reimburses tank  owners/operators for reasonable and necessary cleanup costs for leaks that  occur in regulated tanks on or after February 1, 1994, the date it began  operation. The maximum amount of coverage under the fund is currently  $1.5 million; however, for claims reported prior to January 1, 2002, the limit  was $1 million, according to state officials. The aggregate limit is $1.5  million for owners of 100 or less tanks and $3 million for owners of 101 or  more tanks. The fund also covers bodily injury and property damage claims  that arise from a leak, indemnifies certified tank installers, and provides  loans to owners/operators for upgrading their facilities. According to the  fund\u2019s 2004 annual report, a claimant for reimbursement from the fund  must be an owner or operator of a tank registered with the Pennsylvania  Department of Environmental Protection, and must report the claim to the  fund within 60 days of the discovery of the release. Claimants must also pay  the first $5,000 per tank of allowable cleanup costs and $5,000 per tank of  third-party liability claims. State program officials told us that Pennsylvania  law requires that the fund be managed on an actuarial basis and that the fee  structure be reviewed yearly to maintain solvency. They also said that the  fund's objective is to have positive cash flow and invested assets for a  projected period of at least 5 years. The fund is primarily capitalized by (1)  a 1.1 cents-per-gallon fee (for 2004) on substances such as gasoline, new  motor oil, and aviation fuel, (2) investment income generated from fund  balances, and (3) a capacity fee of 8.25 cents-per-gallon for substances such  as diesel, kerosene, and used motor oil.", "While the fund does not directly cover costs for remediating abandoned  tank sites, it is authorized to provide allocations to the Pennsylvania  Department of Environmental Protection\u2014which manages the cleanup of  contamination from these tanks\u2014up to a maximum of $12 million annually:  $5.5 million for general environmental cleanup, $5.5 million for  catastrophic release, and $1 million for pollution prevention.

However, these criteria do not include the number and cleanup status of a  state\u2019s abandoned tanks. According to EPA program officials, states  historically have used about two-thirds of the federal trust fund money  allocated to them each year to oversee and support the cleanups paid for by  state funds, tank owners/operators, and other financial assurance  mechanisms, while the states have used the remaining one-third to directly  pay for cleanups of abandoned tanks that are not covered by the other  funding sources.", "As Table 2 shows, for the 5 states we contacted, the amount of funds that  EPA awards from the fund and the portions of these funds the states  allocate for cleaning up tank sites varies, as do the amounts of their own  funds that they spend on leak cleanups.", "The LUST Trust Fund\u2019s contribution to state cleanup efforts is generally  small compared to amounts paid by tank owners/operators, state  indemnification programs, and other state mechanisms for cleaning up  sites each year. For example, in fiscal year 2004, EPA awarded $61.7  million in trust funds to assist states\u2019 leaking tank cleanup efforts.  However, according to EPA, states, on average, spend a total of about $1  billion to $1.5 billion each year on tank site cleanups. To illustrate, EPA  program officials told us that for every federal dollar spent to clean up tank  sites, states spend as much as $18 of their own funds.", "If cleanup costs paid by owners/operators were included, the actual ratio of  dollars spent by other sources to federal dollars could be significantly  higher than the 18 to 1 calculation provided by EPA. However, tank  owners\u2019/operators\u2019 costs to remediate a site are difficult to determine since  they are not always captured in state and federal records. While state  records may include deductible and co-payment amounts paid by  owners/operators under state programs, they do not typically include any  costs these parties pay that are disallowed by the state. Furthermore,  amounts that owners/operators pay in excess of program limits are not  captured in state and federal data. For example, California program  officials told us that a leaking tank site in Santa Monica contaminated the  public water supply with MTBE, which is typically very expensive to clean  up. While the owner/operator estimated that it may require $50 million to  clean up the site, the state indemnification fund limits reimbursements for  cleanup costs to a maximum of $1.5 million per tank per leak incident. As a  result, the approximately $48.5 million in additional non-reimbursable  costs paid by the owner would not be reflected in program records."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some States Believe That Funding From Available Sources Is Inadequate to Address All Sites With Leaking Abandoned Tanks", "paragraphs": ["Some states\u2019 indemnification funds and other resources may be insufficient  to clean up all of the leaking abandoned tanks in their state. For example,  according to a survey of states conducted for the Association of State and  Tribal Solid Waste Management Officials in early 2005, claims for the  reimbursement of cleanup costs exceeded the fund balances in 10 states.  Of the 5 states we contacted, officials of 3\u2014Maryland, Michigan, and North  Carolina\u2014told us that the state is experiencing difficulties in funding  cleanups at abandoned tank sites. Furthermore, officials of 2 of these  states\u2014Maryland and Michigan\u2014said that available resources will be  insufficient to clean up all of them and that additional resource allocations  from the LUST Trust Fund would help address these funding shortfalls and  enhance the states ability to clean up leaking tank sites.", "Because of funding constraints, Maryland is now prioritizing and deferring  cleanups of its abandoned tank sites. The state requires tank  owners/operators to demonstrate financial responsibility to pay for  cleanup costs, which they generally do by obtaining commercial insurance  to fund cleanups of the state's nonabandoned tank sites. However, state  officials are concerned that commercial insurance may not provide a  dependable source of funding for tank site cleanups, because insurers have  sometimes been reluctant to pay cleanup costs when leaks occur. For  example, files for the Henry Fruhling Food Store site in Harford County,  Maryland (see app. I), indicated that the site's owner/operator experienced  problems in getting the insurance company to pay for cleanup costs  because he could not prove that the leak occurred during the period of  coverage. The absence of insurance funds to pay cleanup costs may lead to  more abandoned sites\u2014sites where the owners/operators are unable to pay  the cleanup costs themselves\u2014which will require the state to fund cleanup  with its own funds or seek federal resources. State officials told us that, in  the absence of increased allocations of federal trust funds, they asked the  state legislature to approve an increase in Maryland\u2019s special oil transfer  fee to fund the state's tank cleanup needs. The state legislature  subsequently approved the fee increase.", "Since Michigan\u2019s indemnification fund was terminated in June 1995,  because of insufficient funds to pay existing and future claims, tank  owners/operators have been required to show proof of financial assurance  to cover cleanup costs in order to operate in Michigan. Small  owners/operators usually provide this proof by obtaining commercial  insurance. However, state LUST program officials cited anecdotal evidence  showing that insurance claims for remediation costs are frequently denied  because it is often difficult to prove that the release occurred under the  period of coverage. If the owner/operator cannot or is unwilling to pay the  costs and these costs are not covered by insurance or some other form of  financial assurance, the burden for cleaning up a site will fall on the state.", "In addition, Michigan program officials told us that the state\u2019s causation  standard further exacerbates the funding problem for abandoned tanks  because it requires that the state prove that the present owner/operator is  responsible for a site's contamination before it can be held responsible for  cleanup. Proving responsibility becomes difficult in cases where releases  have occurred at some point in the past and ownership of the property has  changed. If responsibility cannot be established, the state must then fund  any cleanup of the site. In addition, state officials said that underground  storage tank owners/operators acquiring properties after March 6, 1996,  can limit their liability for pre-existing contamination by performing a  baseline environmental assessment of the property\u2014any contamination  found at that point becomes the responsibility of the owner/operator who  caused the contamination or the state if a responsible party cannot be  identified. According to program officials, Michigan now has a backlog of  9,000 confirmed releases from leaking underground storage tanks, an  estimated 4,200 of which are at abandoned sites. State program officials  estimate that it will require about $1.7 billion in public funds to remediate  these 4,200 releases alone. However, according to these officials, resources  available from all state sources are not adequate to remediate these  releases.", "North Carolina\u2019s commercial trust fund can be used to assist  owners/operators with cleanup costs and to assist landowners in cleaning  up abandoned sites where the tank owner/operator cannot be located or is  unwilling to perform the cleanup. In recent months, according to program  officials, claims against the fund have exceeded revenues, causing  timeframes for paying reimbursements to stretch out over a year. As a  result, the state is now prioritizing sites based on relative risk and directing  work only to emergency releases and those leaks that pose the highest  risks that can be funded with available resources.", "While neither California nor Pennsylvania are experiencing significant  problems funding cleanups of leaking tank sites, officials in both states said  that they could use more federal funding for leak prevention initiatives and  welcome the flexibility to use federal trust funds for that purpose, as  provided by the Energy Policy Act of 2005.", "In an ongoing review, we are examining the scope and magnitude of states\u2019  workload and funding needs for cleaning up contamination from leaking  underground tanks. Specifically, for each of the 50 states, the District of  Columbia, and 5 U.S. Territories, we are examining (1) how much funding  is currently available for cleaning up contamination from leaking tanks, (2)  the extent to which tank cleanup funds have been used for purposes other  than cleanups, if at all, and (3) what future revenues will be available to  clean up contamination from leaking tanks."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "States Identify, Assess, and Clean Up Leaking Tank Sites Using Similar Means", "paragraphs": ["States become aware of leaking underground storage tanks through a  variety of methods, including owner/operator reports, complaints by local  residents, incidental discovery during land redevelopment or removal of  tanks for upgrading or replacement, and compliance inspections.

Once  contamination from leaking tanks is detected and confirmed, the 5 states  we contacted generally use risk-based systems to prioritize sites for  cleanup according to the immediate threat they pose.

EPA and the states have established  a number of requirements that tank owners/operators must follow to  ensure and facilitate the early detection of possible leaks. In this regard, in  1988, EPA issued regulations governing leak detection, among other things.  Under these requirements, tank owners/operators must notify the  designated state or local authority when they discover a release or when  leak detection equipment indicates that a leak may have occurred. This  notification must generally occur within 24 hours. Tanks must generally be  monitored for leaks at least once every 30 days.", "Despite these requirements, leaks can remain undetected and/or  unreported. According to state officials, owners/operators sometimes do  not conduct proper inventory checks or leak detection procedures and may  intentionally disconnect leak detection equipment. Also, tank tightness  tests are imprecise and tanks can lose small amounts of pressure or  vacuum during the test and still pass. Such small pressure leaks can result  in large releases of the tanks contents over time. In some cases, tightness  tests have failed to detect significant leaks altogether. For example, during  investigation of the Tranguch Tire Service site in Pennsylvania, the state  Department of Environmental Protection requested tank tightness test  results for that facility as well as 3 nearby tank operating facilities. Even  though test results showed that 3 of these facilities had passed their tests, 2  of them were ultimately found to have leaking tanks, including all 6 tanks at  the Tranguch facility (see app. I). In addition to problems in detecting  leaks, some owners/operators fail to report suspected or actual leaks once  they are discovered. For example, the tank owner/operator of the fourth  facility in the Tranguch investigation did not provide tightness test results  as requested but admitted that a leak had occurred at the site several  months earlier that he had not reported.", "While owners/operators identify many leaks through established testing  and monitoring procedures, EPA and officials of the 5 states we contacted  told us that many leaks are discovered only when tanks are removed for  replacement or closure. When tanks are replaced or facilities closed, in  some states\u2014such as California, Maryland, and Pennsylvania\u2014a state  certified or licensed environmental consultant or contractor removes the  tanks, sometimes with state or local agency oversight. Other states, such as  Michigan and North Carolina, do not require the contractor to be certified.  In Michigan, however, any person who removes or installs a tank must have  a million dollars in pollution liability insurance, according to state officials.  As part of this process, soil samples generally are taken from the  excavation and tested to determine whether contamination is present.  However, leaks are often readily apparent because of the presence of liquid  product (gasoline or diesel fuel) and/or strong fumes; state or local  environmental or health agencies may discover leaking tanks when  investigating homeowner complaints about such odors in their residences  or gasoline contamination in their well-water.", "Frequently, unknown and abandoned tanks are discovered when land is  being excavated during property redevelopment. In these cases, states  generally follow the same process of sampling and testing described above  to assess contamination at the site. However, if contamination is found, the  responsibility for cleaning up these sites differs from state to state. For  example, in Pennsylvania, the new owner of the contaminated property  would be responsible for cleaning it up, according to state officials.  However, Michigan state officials told us that Michigan law limits the  cleanup responsibility to those who actually caused the contamination.  Therefore, the state would have to pay for the cleanup unless it could  identify the party or parties who caused the contamination, which can be  difficult. In general, cleanup costs for abandoned tanks where no owners  or operators can be found usually become the state\u2019s responsibility."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some States\u2019 Inspection Rates May Have Limited the Timely Detection or Prevention of Leaks", "paragraphs": ["In addition to other methods for discovering leaking tanks, state or local  environmental agencies may detect leaking tanks or indications of possible  leaks while inspecting facilities for compliance with regulatory  requirements.

EPA  and state officials agreed that regular inspections of underground storage  tanks provide the opportunity to detect new leaks before serious  environmental or health damage can occur and potentially prevent future  leaks. Even if performed on a regular basis, infrequent inspections may  allow violations of leak prevention and other tank requirements to go  undetected long enough for leaks to occur and contamination to spread,  potentially resulting in environmental and health consequences and the  need for costly cleanups.", "While more frequent inspections potentially could enhance preventive  efforts, state officials in 4 of the states we contacted told us that increasing  the frequency of inspections would require additional resources. Although  EPA recommended inspections at least once every 3 years, EPA program  officials recognized both the value of increased inspections and some  states\u2019 need for additional resources to conduct more frequent inspections,  and supported providing more flexibility in the use of LUST trust funds for  these purposes.", "In 2001, after reviewing EPA's and states' efforts to enforce UST Program  regulations, we recommended that EPA negotiate with each state to reach  a minimum frequency for physical inspections of all its tanks and present to  the Congress an estimate of the total additional resources the agency and  states would need to conduct the inspection, training, and enforcement  actions necessary to ensure tank compliance with federal requirements.  In addition, to strengthen EPA\u2019s and the states\u2019 ability to inspect tanks and  enforce federal requirements, we suggested that the Congress consider (1)  authorizing EPA to establish a federal requirement for the physical  inspections of all tanks on a periodic basis and (2) increasing the resources  available to the UST Program, based on a consideration of EPA\u2019s estimate  of resource needs. We noted that one way to do this would be to increase  the amount of funds the Congress provides from the trust fund and to  authorize states to spend a limited portion of these amounts on inspection,  training, and enforcement activities to detect and prevent leaks, as long as  this did not interfere with tank cleanup progress. Generally consistent with  our recommendations, the Energy Policy Act of 2005, among other things,  generally requires inspections once every 3 years, increases amounts  authorized to be appropriated from the fund, and authorizes these funds to  be used for inspections, training, and other enforcement and prevention  activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States Use Risk-Based Assessments to Determine Cleanup Priorities", "paragraphs": ["The 5 states we contacted all use risk-based systems to prioritize leaking  underground storage tank sites for cleanup according to the immediate  threat they pose to human health, safety, and/or the environment.", "California prioritizes cleanup sites based on risk, with the highest risk  sites remediated first.

The highest priority is assigned to sites  that pose a threat to human health and the next highest to those posing  an environmental threat. Under this system, immediate threats are  abated first and then sites with the likelihood of future impact are  addressed.", "Maryland uses a risk-based determination to prioritize both abandoned  and nonabandoned leaking tank sites. For example, if contaminated  well water is the primary threat involved, well samples are drawn and  tested and the levels of the various compounds found are compared to  EPA safe drinking water standards. Abandoned sites whose cleanup will  have to be paid for by the state are remediated if they pose an immediate  threat to public health. The cleanup of nonabandoned sites is paid for by  the tank owners and operators and begins immediately regardless of  threat level.", "Michigan uses a modified ASTM four-tier classification system to  prioritize sites according to their threat. The classification system  ranges from class 1\u2014an immediate threat to the public or  environment\u2014to class 4\u2014no demonstrable long-term threat. Michigan  also uses a risk-based assessment and corrective action process, based  on the ASTM process, which allows contamination to remain on-site as  long as it is possible to demonstrate that human health and the  environment are adequately protected.", "North Carolina prioritizes leaking tank sites according to three levels of  risk: high, intermediate, and low. High risk sites are those that pose an  immediate threat to human health and the environment because, for  example, a leak presents an explosion hazard from petroleum vapors or  a release is within 1,000 feet of a drinking water well. Intermediate risk  sites include those that contaminate or potentially could contaminate  surface water, a wellhead protection area, or an area that recharges  drinking water aquifers, or have groundwater contamination levels high  enough that natural attenuation may be impeded. Low risk sites involve  releases that do not fall into the other 2 categories or that pose no  significant risk to human health or the environment. The state is now  addressing only the highest risk sites and emergency releases, with the  goal of moving them to the intermediate risk level. North Carolina also  uses a risk-based assessment and corrective action process wherein  more contamination can remain on site as long as adequate protection  of human health and the environment can be demonstrated. For  instance, the state groundwater standard for benzene is 1 part per  billion, but cleanup to 5,000 parts per billion may be allowed if it can be  shown that the remaining pollution poses no threat to human health and  the environment.", "Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection uses a modified  ASTM system that classifies abandoned tank sites based on 4 priority  levels.

The method of cleanup selected is tailored to the specific  characteristics of the site, including the probable pathways the  contamination will follow to threaten the soil, groundwater, and/or the  health of surrounding residents. Depending on whether the contamination  has reached the local groundwater, treatment methods can range from the  removal and on-site treatment of contaminated soil to expensive on-site  pump-and-treat and vapor extraction systems, activated carbon filtration  systems for municipal water systems, and vapor extraction and water  treatment units for nearby impacted or threatened homes and businesses,  among others.", "EPA seldom becomes directly involved in this process unless the site is  located at federal facilities or on Indian reservations. However, states may  ask EPA to lead or support the cleanup at sites that present an imminent  threat, have no viable responsible party, do not qualify for funding under a  state plan, or for which the magnitude of the cost and cleanup work is  beyond state resources. For example, state officials asked EPA to assume  the lead on cleaning up the Tranguch Tire Service site in Pennsylvania after  they determined that site remediation costs would far exceed the state\u2019s  resources (see app. I). This leak involved the release of an estimated 25,000  to 50,000 gallons of gasoline. The leaking fuel reached the aquifer and the  contamination plume migrated off-site into the sewer system of the  surrounding residential neighborhood. According to an EPA Region 3  official, gasoline and gasoline fumes seeped into the basements of 20 to 30  homes through the sewer system as well as into a nearby creek. After  conducting an environmental investigation of the area, the Pennsylvania  Department of Environmental Resources required the owner/operator of  Tranguch to begin site characterization and cleanup work. However, in  1995, the owner of the Tranguch facility declared bankruptcy and the state  assumed responsibility for characterizing the site and mitigating vapors in  area homes. By March 1996, the state had spent $2 million on the site and  did not have the funds that were going to be necessary to clean up the site  due to its potential magnitude. According to state officials because of the  emergency nature of the situation and funding problems, the state asked  EPA to take over as the lead agency for remediating the site, which EPA did  in late August 1996.

Without such information, neither EPA nor the Congress can readily  determine the number of abandoned tanks requiring cleanup nationwide,  whether this number is growing, whether states are initiating and  completing or deferring work, and what the potential impacts on state  resources and, ultimately, the LUST Trust Fund may be. Furthermore,  although one of the primary purposes of the fund is to help states clean up  releases from abandoned tanks, EPA currently allocates resources to the  states without taking into account how many abandoned tanks each state  has, how many are leaking, or how many are being cleaned up. All 5 of the  states we contacted provide data to EPA on their abandoned tanks  aggregated with other tank data and separately identify and report some  limited information on abandoned tanks to EPA regional offices. Asking the  states to separately identify information on all known abandoned tanks in  the reports they currently provide to EPA should not pose an additional  burden. In any case, we believe that requiring states to specifically report  information on all known abandoned tanks would provide EPA useful data  for overseeing the UST Program and more efficiently and effectively  allocating LUST Trust Fund resources.", "While the extent to which this situation exists nationwide is unknown,  officials in 2 of the 5 states told us that the state\u2019s present resources are  inadequate to cover cleanup efforts.

Furthermore, the EPA and state officials we contacted believed that greater  emphasis on leak prevention activities, such as tank inspections, is  necessary to detect compliance problems that can lead to future leaks and  uncover physical evidence of leaking tanks so that states can respond more  quickly, if warranted, to prevent or limit the potential health and  environmental impacts on nearby communities. Moreover, the cost of  taking measures to prevent a release is generally much less than the cost of  cleaning up a release after it occurs.

However, EPA notes that the process that  states must conduct to establish that a tank is abandoned\u2014that its owner is  unknown or unwilling or unable to pay for leak cleanups\u2014may involve  ownership searches to identify the potentially responsible party and  assessment of their financial ability and willingness to pay for cleanup.", "With this in mind, EPA is concerned about placing an undue burden on  states by requiring them to provide specific data on abandoned tanks.

However, we are not suggesting that states  should make an effort to identify unknown abandoned tanks; rather we are  recommending that they report to EPA separately the information they  currently have on tanks that they know are abandoned, and, as new  abandoned tanks are identified in the normal course of program  operations, report this information to EPA as well. This should place no  additional burden on the states. States currently provide EPA data on  known abandoned tanks aggregated with all other tanks in the state. We are  simply recommending that the states break out the data on their  abandoned tanks from total tank data. Because a limited portion of these  data\u2014information on abandoned tanks being cleaned up using LUST Trust  Fund resources\u2014is currently broken out and provided to EPA\u2019s regions, the  UST Program could easily utilize these existing data and EPA would only  have to require states to break out the remaining data on the number and  cleanup status of their known abandoned sites.

The resulting gasoline plume contaminated soil  and groundwater, and spread generally northeastward through the  adjoining community to encompass about a 70-acre area, including 11  businesses, two doctor\u2019s offices, two churches, two parks, 26 vacant lots,  and 359 residential properties and impacted the lives of up to a reported  1,500 neighborhood residents."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Chronology of Key Site Events from the Case Files", "paragraphs": ["Prior to 1990: Neighborhood residents near the Tranguch facility had  complained of an odor from the facility that smelled like automobile or  truck emissions as early as August 1976.

Case files do not contain any additional complaints about this  site until February 1990.", "February 1990 \u2013 April 1993: Over the three-year period, PADER  investigated complaints of gasoline or other odors in residences in the  area of the Tranguch facility, including one home on three separate  occasions. In March 1993, a local Department of Public Safety  environmental protection specialist performed an investigation at this  residence and verified the presence of strong gasoline odors. Because of  the saturated condition of the soil, he was able to trace gasoline residue  to a nearby abandoned underground storage tank facility. The  environmental specialist referred the matter to PADER for follow-up. In  April 1993, PADER took a water sample from the basement sump of this  residence that tested positive for the presence of gasoline, and began  efforts to determine whether nearby underground gasoline storage  tanks were the source of the contamination. Out of eleven commercial  locations in the vicinity, PADER identified four operating facilities\u2014 including the Tranguch facility\u2014and one abandoned underground  storage tank facility as potential contamination sources.", "May 1993 \u2013 June 1993: PADER directed the owner of the abandoned  facility to register and either properly close (remove) or upgrade the  tanks at that site. At this time, PADER also asked the owners of the  Tranguch facility and the other two operating facilities to either provide  the department with proof that their tanks passed tank tightness tests or  conduct the tests. The abandoned site owner notified PADER that he  intended to close the site and PADER directed him to submit and  implement a site characterization plan. Because none of the three  operating facilities responded to the PADER request, it asked for this  information a second time.", "July 1993: The owner of one of the three operating facilities submitted  a report to PADER showing that, in June 1993, tanks at the site had  passed a tightness test. However, PADER discovered that the owner had  installed this facility\u2019s current tanks in 1991 to replace older tanks and,  at that time, 1,042 tons of fuel-contaminated soil had been removed from  the site. The older unregistered tanks remained in operation until they  were replaced in 1991. The owner filed a closure report for these tanks  in October 1993. PADER documentation indicates that the report lacked  some of the required sampling and soil analysis information.", "Also in July 1993, the owner of another of the three operating facilities  admitted to having had an unreported release in April 1993. Tanks at this  site were subsequently removed. Three of these tanks had never been  registered. Soil contamination was evident during excavation, and  during the removal process an abandoned heating oil underground  storage tank was also discovered at the site. Also, when the owner of the  facility removed his tanks, PADER observed contamination at the site  and the owner arranged for a site investigation/characterization.", "August 1993: PADER requested a third time that the owner of the  Tranguch facility provide tank tightness test information and submit and  implement site assessment and remedial action plans. PADER surveyed  leak detection methods used at the Tranguch site and the owner stated  that the facility was performing these methods. These methods were  required to be performed under the state\u2019s applicable rules and  regulations in force at that time. PADER also requested that the owners  of the other two operating facilities and the abandoned facility submit  and implement site assessment and remedial action plans.", "September 1993: The owner of the Tranguch facility submitted  information to PADER indicating that tanks at the site had passed a  tightness test. PADER again requested that the Tranguch owner perform  a site characterization and report the results to the department within 14  days. Also, the local fire department received two additional complaints  of gasoline-like fumes in area residences. PADER Emergency Response  Program personnel also began regularly monitoring vapor levels in area  homes.", "October - November 1993: Beginning in October, the PADER  Emergency Response Program started to install interim remedial  systems designed to prevent gasoline vapors from entering affected  homes and, by mid-May 1994, had installed thirteen. Also in October,  PADER identified a fourth operating facility as a potential contributor to  the area\u2019s contamination and asked the owner of that facility to perform  a site characterization. Through late November 1993, the owner of this  fourth facility took no action in this regard, but requested to review any  PADER documentation indicating that this facility had contributed to  pollution in the area, as well as files regarding the other facilities in the  area. Although PADER arranged for access to these files, the owner  never reviewed them.", "PADER confirmed the presence of gasoline-like fumes in six area  residences and arranged to have a preliminary subsurface investigation  performed on the area impacted by the contamination. The investigation  revealed that gasoline had contaminated the groundwater at several  locations down-slope from the Tranguch site and that gasoline  contamination had spread to the neighborhood sewer system. The  gasoline contamination was also found to stop up-slope of the location  of the Tranguch tanks, within the property boundary. PADER officials,  representatives of the city of Hazleton, and the city fire chief met with  the owner of the Tranguch site and requested that he immediately  remove all gasoline from his tanks. The following day, the owner  informed PADER that he had discovered that 375 gallons of gasoline had  been lost from his tanks early in November. The owner admitted to  PADER officials that\u2014contrary to what he had told PADER in August  1993\u2014he had just started to comply with the required leak detection  methods the previous day. Accordingly, PADER issued a second  compliance order to the Tranguch site owner, requiring him to, within 24  hours, remove all gasoline from the underground storage tanks on-site,  begin cleaning up the leaked gasoline, and take steps to monitor and  mitigate vapors in area homes. Although the owner appealed this order,  he had his tanks and lines drained and began monitoring wells to  recover gasoline. Furthermore, although the Tranguch site owner made  inquiries regarding homes impacted by vapors, he took no action to  monitor or mitigate vapors in area homes.", "City personnel began venting the neighborhood sewer system.", "December 1993 \u2013 February 1994: PADER held a public meeting with  area residents, city and township representatives, and state legislators  regarding the spill. School district officials, city and township  representatives, and a state legislator were also contacted during  subsequent site activities.", "In December, PADER issued a compliance order to the owner of the  fourth operating facility suspected of contributing to the contamination.  The order required a complete site investigation, including tank system  tightness testing, a review of leak detection and inventory records, and  sub-surface sampling and analysis of soil and groundwater at the site.  The owner\u2019s attorney responded with a letter stating his client\u2019s intent to  appeal the order, and included attachments with information in defense  of his decision. From the information presented in the attachments,  PADER determined that the owner had not employed any type of  automatic leak detection devices on the two underground gasoline  storage tanks installed at his site in 1962, and that he might not have complied with applicable federal and state leak detection regulations.  In January 1994, the legal counsel for PADER informed the owner that  the information he had submitted was incomplete and did not satisfy  the compliance order\u2019s requirements. Later in January, the owner  formally appealed the December compliance order.", "PADER documents indicate that problems with gasoline-like vapors  entering neighborhood homes and commercial establishments grew  progressively worse through the end of 1993 and, by early 1994, 28  residences and 1 commercial building had been impacted. The Hazleton  City Health Officer determined that a neighborhood home was unfit for  human habitation and the owner temporarily relocated because of the  presence of potentially harmful gasoline vapors and the explosion  potential from the collected gasoline vapors in the basement of his  home. (This homeowner had previously reported gasoline-like odors in  his residence in February 1990, March 1992, August 1992, and March  1993).", "In January 1994, all product recovery efforts at the Tranguch site ceased  because of the owner\u2019s failure to pay his environmental consultant, but  resumed after he was able to secure a loan.", "March \u2013 April 1994: Local residents formed an organization called the  Group Against Gas (GAG) at about this time and announced plans for a  class action lawsuit against parties responsible for the contamination.  PADER received from the owner\u2019s consultant a proposed Tranguch site  characterization plan that included monitoring well locations. Upon  review, PADER requested that the consultant perform additional site  characterization work, including the installation of additional  monitoring wells. Also, PADER notified the owner of the fourth  operating facility of a June 1994 hearing date and the owner wrote to his  state senator in an unsuccessful attempt to stay the PADER compliance  order.", "May \u2013 August 1994: In May, PADER held a second public meeting with  area residents, city and township representatives, and state legislators  regarding the spill. Also in May, to avoid compliance proceedings, the  owner of the fourth operating facility conducted a site investigation and  found gasoline in the groundwater near his underground storage tank  systems. He withdrew his appeal of the compliance order, voluntarily  removed all fuel from his underground gasoline storage tank systems,  and sent a summary report of the investigation to PADER. In August,  this owner notified PADER of his intent to conduct and complete a site  characterization by the end of September 1994.", "An August court order required the Tranguch facility owner to take  interim remedial actions to recover leaked fuel, monitor and mitigate  vapors in area homes, and complete and report on site characterization  by mid-October 1994.", "PADER obtained funds from the state Leaking Underground Storage  Tank fund to conduct an extensive characterization study of the  impacted area.", "February 1995 \u2013 September 1995: The owner had all six tanks at the  Tranguch facility removed. Tanks were found to be perforated with \u201cfist- sized holes,\u201d and gasoline contamination was evident at the site. The  owner of the Tranguch facility declared bankruptcy. In addition, in May,  the owner of the fourth operating facility had two tanks removed. Both  tanks were found to be deeply pitted and the fill end of one tank had  pinholes and corrosion that extended through the steel. Evidence of  gasoline contamination was observed during the excavation.", "November 1995 - December 1995: The Pennsylvania Department of  Environmental Protection (PADEP, formerly PADER) issued another  compliance order to the owner of the Tranguch facility, who again  appealed it.", "March \u2013 July 1996: PADEP\u2019s environmental consultant issued a report  on, among other things, the sources of contamination in the area. While  the consultant found contamination at all 5 of the sites, it found that the  Tranguch facility was primarily responsible for the leak impacting the  residential area. According to the consultant\u2019s report, the contamination  at the other four facilities did not significantly contribute to the  contamination plume that was affecting the area residences.", "Although PADEP continued to monitor conditions in the area, it no  longer had the funds necessary to mitigate the contamination threat.  Therefore, PADEP asked EPA to lead the remediation of the Tranguch  site and the impacted area. EPA took over as lead agency for the site,  while PADEP continued to work with EPA by providing technical  support.", "EPA entered into an Interagency Agreement with the U.S. Army Corps  of Engineers (USACE) for contracting services for the site.

The EPA On-Scene Coordinator (OSC)  determined that (1) gasoline contamination at the Tranguch site  impacted surface waterways as well as groundwater at the site, (2) site  conditions met or exceeded removal criteria described in the National  Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP), and  (3) the site posed an imminent and substantial threat to the public  health of residents in the area of the plume because of the threat of fire,  explosion, and direct inhalation of benzene. The OSC estimated that  over 900,000 gallons of gasoline leaked from the tanks. EPA requested  remediation funds under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 and received an  initial $180,000 to begin removal actions, including installation and  maintenance of two underflow dams on Black Creek to reduce the  gasoline contamination which was entering the creek.", "EPA sampled and tested air quality in 53 of 362 homes in the area.

According to the model, while much of the spilled material  would have come from the Tranguch facility, some material from three  other operating facilities would have mingled with the plume from the  Tranguch leak and subsequently be transported to Black Creek.  Furthermore, for part of the year, spilled material from one of the  operating facilities would flow directly to the creek. However, EPA\u2019s  Region 3 General Counsel recommended that the agency not issue  removal enforcement orders to these parties because it considered them  to be \u201cde minimis\u201d (small volume) contributors to the contamination.

According to EPA officials, beginning in  July 1996, EPA held meetings with local officials and public meetings  with area residents and others to discuss plans for remediating the  contamination at and around the Tranguch site and to update the status  of the cleanup. Through May 2003, EPA held at least five such meetings  and participated in at least one meeting sponsored by GAG. The  meetings often included representatives from the state and other federal  agencies\u2014such as USACE\u2014involved in cleanup operations, among  others.", "Litigation: Nearby residents affected by the contamination sued  numerous parties, including the owners of the gas stations in the vicinity  of the leak as well as certain oil companies, asserting that the  contamination had caused personal injury and property damage, among  other things. These lawsuits are still pending."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["The objectives of this review were to identify (1) information available on  the number and cleanup status of leaking underground storage tanks, (2)  existing sources of funding for cleanups at contaminated tank sites, and (3)  processes used to identify, assess, and clean up sites in 5 states with large  numbers of leaking tanks\u2014California, Maryland, Michigan, North Carolina,  and Pennsylvania.  In addition, to provide some perspective on how leaking  underground storage tank sites are identified and cleaned up, we are  providing information on the history and cleanup status of one leaking tank  site in each of these 5 states.", "To identify information available on the number and cleanup status of  leaking underground storage tanks, we reviewed and evaluated data from  EPA\u2019s underground storage tank program semi-annual activity reports for  the period from March 31, 2001 through March 31, 2004.  Each activity  report contains data on the number of active and closed tanks, confirmed  releases, cleanups initiated and completed, and cleanup backlog for the 50  states, 5 territories, and the District of Columbia, arranged by EPA region.   To assess the reliability of the EPA data, we interviewed EPA program  officials at headquarters and in Regions 3, 4, 5, and 9; conducted electronic  (logic and other) reliability testing of the data itself; and obtained and  reviewed EPA\u2019s responses to questions designed to determine the reliability  of the data.  In addition, we compared the semiannual data reported by EPA  with data provided by the states we visited.  In general, we found only  minor discrepancies during our reliability testing of the data.  For example,  the Maine and Massachusetts semi-annual data for the period ending March  31, 2002, were inadvertently switched.  Once we brought this to EPA\u2019s  attention, it was immediately corrected.  We also found that EPA reported  1,000 less closed tanks and 1,000 more active tanks than reported by the  state of Pennsylvania.  The state had initially provided EPA data on the  number of closed tanks as of September 30, 2004 but the following day  provided EPA a correction to this amount.  However, EPA inadvertently did  not update its records to reflect this correction.  While acknowledging  these problems, we have determined that the reliability of the semi-annual  data is adequate for the purposes used in this report.", "To identify funding options available for cleaning up contaminated tank  sites and the processes used for identifying, assessing, and cleaning up  leaking tanks by 5 states with large numbers of leaking tanks, we discussed  possible funding options with EPA officials, conducted structured  interviews with state program officials, and reviewed documents provided  by these officials or located on their internet sites.  To select which states  to include in our review, we used data from EPA\u2019s semi-annual activity  report and applied it to our selection criteria and picked the five states  having the highest combined score. Our selection criteria consisted of the  following five quantitative indicators:   states with the largest average number of active tanks for the last 3   states with the largest average number of confirmed releases for the last   states with the largest average number of backlogs for the last 3 years;  states with the largest increase in backlogs during the last year divided  by the number of active tanks for that state; and   states with the largest increase in new tank releases for the last year  divided by the number of active tanks for that state.", "Three of the five indicators used 3-year average data to minimize the  impact of single-year fluctuations and to reduce the effect of state officials\u2019  periodic revisions to the data.  Two of the five indicators included  adjustments for the number of active tanks in the state so as to reduce the  possible selection bias in favor of states that have large numbers of active  tanks.", "For each indicator, we assigned a numerical score corresponding to its  ranking compared to the other states.  For example, because EPA data  indicated that California averaged the most releases over the last three  years, we assigned it a score of 56 out of a possible 56 points; alternatively,  because American Samoa averaged the least number of releases over the  last three years, we assigned it a score of one. To determine a state\u2019s total  ranking for all five indicators, we added the scores for each state across all  indicators and ranked each from highest to lowest.", "As a final step in our state selection process, we reviewed the 5 states with  the highest quantitative score to ensure that, taken as whole, these states  (1) were geographically diverse, (2) had different EPA regional offices  overseeing their LUST programs, (3) included states with and without EPA- approved LUST programs, and (4) included states with and without LUST  assurance funds.  This process resulted in our including California rather  than Ohio.  While both states had the same quantitative score, including  California, in our opinion, increased geographic diversity and added a  different regional office to our selected states.", "To provide information on the history and cleanup status of one leaking  underground storage tank site in each of the 5 states, we identified the 5  sites\u2014Coca-Cola Enterprises, Yuba County, California; Henry Fruhling  Food Store, Harford County, Maryland; Bob's Marathon, Grand Ledge,  Michigan; R.C. Anderson Trust, Nash County, North Carolina; and Tranguch  Tire Service, Incorporated, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania\u2014interviewed  state program officials responsible for overseeing or managing the cleanup  at these sites, reviewed case files, and visited each site.  In identifying these  sites, we first selected the Tranguch site because of congressional interest.   For comparison with Tranguch, we selected the remaining 4 sites primarily  on the basis of the following similarities to that site: Cleanup was either completed in 2004 or is relatively close to  completion based on total estimated costs;   Remediation costs significantly exceeded the average cost of cleanup of  about $125,000; and   The risk priority ranking for remediation was above normal.", "Specifically, we selected each of the 4 remaining sites as follows:  Coca-Cola Enterprises n Yuba County, California:  From California\u2019s  GeoTracker database, we obtained a list of about 3,400 closed sites\u2014 that is, sites where cleanup has been completed\u2014and identified the 10  most expensive cleanup sites for further investigation.  The Coca-Cola  site had the highest risk rating among those sites closed since January  2004, and while all of the remaining 9 sites were more costly than the  Coca-Cola site, the cost differential was not significant and all had the  same or lower risk ratings.", "Henry Fruhling Food Store in Harford County, Maryland:  For site  selection, we obtained a list of 39 sites from Maryland\u2019s Oil Control  Program, administrating the state\u2019s underground storage tank program.   Because Maryland does not track cleanup costs for sites being  remediated by responsible parties, these were all sites with state-lead  cleanups.  In addition, they were sites still undergoing remediation,  because the state has not closed a site within the last 2 years.  From this  list we selected the Fruhling Food Store site primarily based on its high  cost and high risk.  This site was the most costly to clean up and had a  high risk ranking, having impacted residential water supplies.", "Bob's Marathon in Grand Ledge, Michigan: We obtained a list of 68  sites with remediation costs of at least $250,000 from Michigan\u2019s  Department of Environmental Quality, administrating the state\u2019s  underground storage tank program.  Because Michigan does not track  cleanup costs for sites being remediated by responsible parties, these  were all sites with state-lead cleanups.  We selected the Bob\u2019s Marathon  site primarily based on its high cost and high risk.  Bob\u2019s Marathon was  the most costly of sites that were either completed or nearly completed  and was high risk because it impacted municipal water supplies and the  community.", "R.C. Anderson Trust in Nash County, North Carolina:  We obtained a  list of 108 sites with remediation costs of at least $250,000 from North  Carolina\u2019s Department of Environment and Natural Resources,  administrating the state\u2019s underground storage tank program.  We  selected the 4 sites with the highest remediation costs for further  analysis.  From these 4, we selected the R.C. Anderson Trust site  primarily based on high risk and high cost.  This site was the only site  ranked high risk because of its potential impact on nearby water wells  and on the community.  While this site was the least costly of the four  high-cost sites, the cost differential between this site and the highest  cost one was only about $24,000.", "We conducted our review from August 2004 through November 2005 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Environmental Protection Agency", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition, Vincent P.
