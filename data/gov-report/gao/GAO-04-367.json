Under competitive sourcing, federal agencies open their commercial activities to competition among public and private sector sources. While competitive sourcing is expected to encourage innovation and improve efficiency and performance, it represents a major management change for most agencies. This report describes the progress selected agencies have made in establishing a competitive sourcing program, identifies major challenges these agencies are facing, and discusses strategies they are using to select activities for competition."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Since the President announced competitive sourcing as a governmentwide initiative, the six civilian agencies GAO reviewed created a basic infrastructure for their competitive sourcing programs, including establishing offices, appointing officials, hiring staff and consultants, issuing guidance, and conducting training. With infrastructures in place and leadership involvement, each agency has developed competitive sourcing plans and conducted some competitions. The Department of Defense (DOD) has had an extensive competitive sourcing program since the mid-1990s. Interagency forums for sharing competitive sourcing information also have been established. While such activities are underway, each agency GAO reviewed, including DOD, cited several significant challenges in achieving its competitive sourcing goals. Key among these is maintaining workforce inventories that distinguish inherently governmental positions from commercial positions--a prerequisite to identifying potential positions to compete. Agencies also have been challenged to develop competitive sourcing approaches that would improve efficiency, in part because agencies have focused more on following OMB guidance on the number of positions to compete--not on achieving savings and improving performance. Ensuring adequate personnel with the skills needed to run a competitive sourcing program also challenged agencies. Many civilian department-level offices have only one or two full-time staff to interpret new laws, implement new OMB guidance, maintain inventories of competable positions and activities, and oversee agency competitions. The Federal Acquisition Council is currently identifying agency staffing needs to address this challenge. Finally, some of the civilian agencies we reviewed reported funding challenges in implementing their competitive sourcing programs. OMB told agencies to include a line item for competitive sourcing activities in their fiscal year 2005 budget requests. Several agencies integrated their strategic, human capital, and competitive sourcing plans--an approach encouraged by the Commercial Activities Panel, which was convened to conduct a congressionally mandated study of the competitive sourcing process. For example, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) used business case analyses to assess the economic benefits of various sourcing alternatives. An IRS official said this approach required minimal investment to determine an activity's suitability for competitive sourcing. The National Institutes of Health, the Army, and the Department of Education also took a strategic approach to competitive sourcing. OMB's task in balancing the need for transparency and consistency with the flexibility agencies need is not an easy one. While OMB is addressing funding and human capital challenges, it needs to do more to assure that the agencies' inventories of commercial positions and goal-setting processes are more strategic and helpful to agencies in achieving savings and improving performance."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The environment in which the federal government currently operates\u2014 with new security threats, demographic changes, rapidly evolving  technologies, increased pressure for results, and growing fiscal  imbalances\u2014demands that agencies engage in a fundamental review of  how they accomplish their missions. Agencies increasingly rely on a  range of technical and support services to meet mission objectives. It is  important for agencies to decide how best to acquire and deliver such  services, including whether to obtain services in-house or through private  sources. One way to inform this decision is to use competitive sourcing,  a strategy under which agencies open the government\u2019s commercial  activities to competition among public and private sector sources.", "In 2001, the administration identified competitive sourcing as one of five  governmentwide initiatives in the President\u2019s Management Agenda. This  initiative seeks to expand competition between the public and private  sectors to encourage innovation, increase efficiency, and to improve  performance. But the use of public-private competition represents a major  management change for agencies and has raised concerns about the  fairness of the process and the potential impact on federal jobs. Therefore,  after discussions with your staff, we agreed to (1) describe the progress  agencies have made in establishing a competitive sourcing program in  response to the President\u2019s Management Agenda, (2) identify major  challenges agencies are facing, and (3) identify strategies they are using to  select activities for competition based on mission-related needs.", "Our work focused on the initial implementation efforts of the following  seven departments and the agencies within those departments that have  the most developed competitive sourcing programs: Agriculture; Defense;  Education; Health and Human Services (HHS); the Interior; the Treasury;  and Veterans Affairs (VA). Together, these departments account for about  84 percent of the commercial positions among the 26 executive branch  agencies implementing the President\u2019s Management Agenda. For more on  our scope and methodology, see appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Since 1955, the executive branch has encouraged federal agencies to  obtain commercially available goods and services from the private sector  when the agency determines that it is cost-effective. In 1966, OMB  formalized this policy in its Circular A-76 and, in 1979, issued a handbook  with procedures for determining whether commercial activities should be  performed in-house, by another federal agency, or by the private sector.", "Administrative and legislative constraints from the late 1980s through 1995  resulted in a lull in awarding contracts under A-76 competitions. In 1995,  when congressional and administration initiatives placed greater emphasis  on public-private competitions to achieve economies and efficiency of  operations, DOD gave competitive sourcing renewed emphasis. In our past  work, we have found that DOD achieved savings through competitive  sourcing, although it is difficult to estimate precisely the amount of  savings. By including competitive sourcing as one of five governmentwide  initiatives announced in August 2001, the administration directed agencies  to implement competitive sourcing programs to achieve increased savings  and to improve performance. The administration continues to advocate  the use of competitive sourcing, which is addressed in the President\u2019s  budget for fiscal year 2005.", "Competitive sourcing has met with considerable controversy in both the  public and private sectors. Each sector expressed concerned that, in  general, the process was unfair and did not provide for holding the winner  of the competition accountable for performance. In response to this  controversy, in 2000, the Congress mandated a study of the government\u2019s  competitive sourcing process under A-76\u2014a study conducted by the  Commercial Activities Panel, chaired by the Comptroller General of the  United States. The panel included representatives from OMB, DOD, the  Office of Personnel Management, private industry, academia, a trade  association, and unions. In April 2002, the panel released its report with  recommendations that included 10 sourcing principles to provide a better  foundation for competitive sourcing decisions in the federal government  (see app. II). In particular, the panel stressed the importance of linking  sourcing policy with agency missions, promoting sourcing decisions that  provide value to the taxpayer regardless of the service provider selected,  and ensuring greater accountability for performance. The panel also  addressed an area of particular importance for all affected parties\uf8e7how  the government\u2019s sourcing policies are implemented. In this regard, one of  the sourcing principles was that the government should avoid arbitrary  numerical or full-time equivalent (FTE) goals. This principle is based on  the concept that success in government programs should be measured in  terms of providing value to the taxpayer, not the size of the in-house or  contractor workforce.", "The panel, in one of its 10 sourcing principles, also endorsed creating  incentives and processes to foster high-performing, efficient, and effective  organizations and continuous improvement throughout the federal  government. On November 6, 2003, the Comptroller General hosted a  forum to discuss what it means for a federal agency to be high-performing  in an environment where results and outcomes are increasingly  accomplished through partnerships that cut across different levels of  government and different sectors of the economy. There was broad  agreement among participants at the forum on the key characteristics and  capabilities of high-performing organizations, which are organized around  four broad themes. These four themes are (1) clear, well-articulated, and  compelling missions; (2) strategic use of partnerships; (3) a focus on the  needs of clients and customers; and (4) strategic management of people.", "The competitive sourcing process starts with agencies developing  inventories of their commercial positions in accordance with the Federal  Activities Inventory Reform (FAIR) Act of 1998. Additionally, OMB  requires agencies to identify activities that are inherently governmental, as  well as commercial positions that are exempt from competition because of  legislative prohibitions, agency restructuring, or other reasons. Only  activities classified as \u201ccommercial\u201d and not otherwise exempt are  potentially competable. In the 2002 FAIR Act inventories, the proportion  of competable commercial, non-competable commercial, and inherently  governmental FTE positions varied widely among the agencies we  reviewed. Governmentwide, competable commercial positions in 2002  accounted for approximately 26 percent of the total federal workforce.  Except for the Education Department\u2019s 62 percent, the percentage of  competable commercial positions in each of our selected agencies was  less than 50 percent of the agency\u2019s total FTEs (see app. III).", "After agencies identify competable commercial positions under the FAIR  Act and OMB guidance, they select from these positions which ones to  compete. Resulting public-private competitions are guided by OMB  Circular A-76. In May 2003, OMB released a revised Circular A-76. Under  this revised circular, agencies must use a standard competition process for  functions with more than 65 FTEs. As part of the standard process,  agencies identify the work to be performed in a performance work  statement, establish a team to prepare an in-house proposal to perform the  work based on a \u201cmost efficient organization\u201d (MEO), and evaluate that  proposal along with those submitted by private companies and/or public  reimbursable sources. For activities with 65 or fewer FTEs, agencies may  use either a streamlined or standard competition.

This  classification process is done using an OMB-provided coding schedule  containing nearly 700 functional codes in 23 major categories, such as  health services, grants management, and installation services. Civilian  agencies are having difficulty applying these functional codes, which were  developed by DOD. While intended to promote consistency, the codes are  not always applicable to civilian agencies, requiring some to create  supplemental codes to match their missions.", "As we have previously reported, selecting and grouping functions and  positions to compete can be difficult. For example, the Army has  determined that many functions, such as making eyeglasses for troops  located in a war zone, are core to its mission even though this function  may not be classified as inherently governmental when performed in the  United States. Also, some functions may involve both \u201ccommercial\u201d and  \u201cinherently governmental\u201d tasks. While agencies have had difficulty  classifying mixed positions, OMB\u2019s guidance allows agencies to take a  variety of approaches to address this difficulty. For example, according to  agency officials, the Internal Revenue Service classifies mixed positions on  a case-by-case basis considering how critical the position is to its mission,  not just the percentage of tasks related to that position that may be  inherently governmental or commercial.", "The process also can be resource intensive. For example, according to  agency officials, to determine whether positions should be classified as  inherently governmental or commercial, the National Park Service\u2014the  largest bureau in the Department of the Interior\u2014used an employee team  of approximately 30 individuals that represented all occupational areas, as  well as its human resources and acquisition staff.

For example, in April 2001, OMB created a new  requirement to report civilian positions designated as inherently  governmental. OMB\u2019s guidance gives agencies considerable latitude in  preparing their inventories to determine if an activity is commercial.", "OMB officials told us they have provided training on Circular A-76  procedures to its budget examiners, who act as liaisons between OMB and  each participating agency. The examiners address questions and provide  guidance on an agency-by-agency basis. OMB does not have formal written  guidance for reviewing FAIR Act data. Examiners provide verbal guidance  on an on-going basis to agencies and discuss concerns agencies have with  the FAIR Act and the related competitive sourcing program. Once agencies  submit their inventories, OMB officials review the inventories looking for  \u201cred flags\u201d\u2014that is, deviations from the norm, such as one agency listing a  position as inherently governmental while others classify the same  position as commercial\u2014and then consult with agency officials as  necessary on these deviations. However, a number of competitive sourcing  officials at two interagency forums expressed concern about the process.  For example, one official told us that an OMB program examiner said  there were too many function codes in one agency\u2019s inventory. Then, after  the agency resubmitted its inventory, the same examiner said the  inventory had too few codes. An official from another agency told us that  its OMB examiners did not appear familiar with OMB\u2019s own guidance for  applying the function codes. Given the lack of formal written OMB  guidance on reviewing the FAIR Act inventory data, there is little  assurance that OMB\u2019s review of inventories will be consistent across  agencies.", "According to a number of agency officials, implementation of OMB  guidance is further complicated due to time constraints. OMB inventory  guidance is typically issued in the spring, and agency inventories are due  to OMB by June 30. Officials contend that more time is needed to properly  implement the guidance. In response, OMB officials pointed out that the  basic guidance for developing inventories is set forth in Circular A-76 and  agencies can undertake significant steps to prepare their inventories based  on the Circular\u2019s guidance."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "OMB Guidance Has Focused More on Meeting Targets and Milestones Than on Improving Outcomes", "paragraphs": ["The ultimate goal of the competitive sourcing initiative is to improve  government performance and efficiency. To date, however, OMB\u2019s  competitive sourcing guidance to federal agencies has focused more on  targets and milestones for conducting competitions than on the outcomes  the competitions are designed to produce: savings, innovation, and  performance improvements. Although recent OMB guidance has stressed  the need for agencies to be more strategic, the emphasis in the guidance is  still more on process than results. The President\u2019s Management Agenda  established expected results for the competitive sourcing initiative to  encourage innovation, increase efficiency, and improve performance of  agencies. The Commercial Activities Panel similarly stated that the  success of government programs, such as competitive sourcing, should be  measured by the results achieved in terms of providing value to  the taxpayer.", "Since the inception of the competitive sourcing initiative in 2001, agencies  have faced continual changes to OMB\u2019s targets and guidance for  conducting public-private competitions. OMB initially set a target for  agencies to compete or directly convert at least 5 percent of their full-time  equivalent commercial positions by the end of fiscal year 2002, and an  additional 10 percent by the end of fiscal year 2003. They also set a  long-term target for agencies to compete at least 50 percent of commercial  FTEs. OMB later moved to agency-specific plans that reflect each agency\u2019s  own mission and workforce mix. OMB also developed a traffic light  system (red, yellow, green) for evaluating the progress agencies are  making in implementing these plans. Table 2 shows the chronology of  these changes.", "As shown in table 2, in December 2003, OMB released a memorandum  with guidance on developing competitive sourcing plans that would  receive a \u201cgreen\u201d rating under its traffic light evaluation system (see  app. VII). The guidance notes the need for a long-range vision, strategic  action by agencies, and public-private competitions tailored to the  agency\u2019s unique mission and goals. The memorandum also advises  agencies to include in their plans their general decision-making process  for selecting activities to compete, identification of activities to be  competed, potential constraints, and plans for handling activities suitable  for competition that the agency does not intend to compete.", "Neither OMB\u2019s initial FTE-based goals nor its revised competitive  sourcing goals and traffic light evaluation system calls for agencies to  assess how their plans for competitive sourcing could achieve the broader  improvements envisioned by the President\u2019s Management Agenda or the  Commercial Activities Panel. In this regard, the Panel said that arbitrary  competition goals should be avoided. In testimony before the Congress,  the Comptroller General has stated that OMB\u2019s initial competition targets  were inappropriate. Similarly, OMB\u2019s revised goals continue to emphasize  process milestones such as competitions completed more than enhancing  value through performance improvements and efficiencies. For example,  for an agency to receive a \u201cgreen\u201d rating on OMB\u2019s scorecard, it must have  developed an OMB-approved green competition plan, have publicly  announced standard competitions in accordance with the schedule in its  green plan, and have completed 95 percent of streamlined competitions in  90 days. The emphasis throughout OMB\u2019s most recent guidance is similarly  more on process than on results.", "Agencies have used a range of criteria to select positions for competition.  For most agencies, selection criteria have been based on the size and  composition of the workforce, such as attrition rates, skill needs, and  difficulty in hiring, as well as the agency\u2019s capability to manage the  competitions. Because these agencies have focused on meeting targets to  announce and complete competitions, they have not assessed broader  issues, such as weighing potential improvements against the costs and  risks associated with performing the competitions. Some agencies,  however, used a broader set of factors such as the function\u2019s contribution  to the mission, risks associated with the function being contracted out,  and the potential return on investment.

Adding to  this complexity is agencies\u2019 need to consider their competitive sourcing  staffing capacity in the context of their strategic human capital  management, an area we have identified as high-risk governmentwide  and one of the five President\u2019s Management Agenda governmentwide  initiatives. For example, we recently reported  that DOD\u2019s civilian human  capital strategic plan does not address the respective roles of civilian  and contractor personnel or how DOD plans to link its human capital  initiatives with its sourcing plans, such as efforts to outsource non-core  responsibilities.

As we reported  in December 2002, in the current environment, acquisition staff can no  longer simply be purchasers or process managers. Rather, they need to be  adept at analyzing business problems and in helping to develop acquisition  strategies. For example, human capital, job, and market analysis skills are  needed to inventory agency activities; benchmarking, and strategic and  workforce planning skills are needed to conduct the preliminary planning;  organizational analysis, contract management and cost analysis skills are  needed to conduct competitions; and financial management and oversight  skills are needed in the implementation and post-competition phase. Some  skills, such as labor relations and information technology, are required  throughout the competitive sourcing process.", "Despite these additional personnel requirements, many department-level  offices in the civilian agencies we reviewed have only one or two full-time  staff to complete FAIR Act inventories, interpret new laws and regulations,  and oversee agency selection of positions to compete and the  competitions.

However, Army officials recognized  that, in many instances, these \u201cnon-core\u201d functions would require  additional analysis to determine potential risks if the function were  contracted. There are four categories of risk analysis: force management,  operational, future challenges, and institutional. For example, Army  officials determined that many medical functions, which are not  classified as inherently governmental, could be considered core in some  circumstances. Although medical functions typically do not require unique  military knowledge or skills, medical activities in theater need to be  performed by in-house personnel because contracting for medical support  in host nations could present significant risk to U.S. armed forces.  Consequently, the Army has determined that the in-theater medical  mission is a critical element of the Army\u2019s ability to accomplish its core  competencies. Other medical functions could be considered both core and  non-core. For example, optical fabrication\u2014the ability to produce  replacement spectacles and protective mask inserts\u2014is considered a core  competency in support of the operational forces close to the point of need  in the area of engagement.
