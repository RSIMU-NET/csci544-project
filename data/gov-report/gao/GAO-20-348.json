Representatives of a policyholder association  whose members purchase NBCR coverage stated that available  coverage likely was insufficient to cover expected losses. Furthermore,  they said some policyholders forgo NBCR coverage because of its limited  availability, high cost, and the low perceived risk of a NBCR event. As a  result, many businesses may be exposed to high loss.", "Treasury officials and industry stakeholders described possible NBCR  terrorism events in which a significant amount of losses could be  uninsured or underinsured. Treasury\u2019s 2019 Small Insurers Report found  that a NBCR terrorism event likely posed the greatest risk of total  catastrophic terrorism losses, far outpacing a conventional attack.  Although modeling these types of losses is difficult, NAIC\u2019s Center for  Insurance Policy and Research estimated, taking into account the  program cap, that a NBCR event in New York City could generate nearly  $60 billion of uninsured loss, 38 percent of the total loss. It also found  that a larger NBCR event could create $850 billion in uninsured loss, or  90 percent of total losses. Furthermore, this research estimated large  uninsured losses in other cities, such as Houston, where a large nuclear  event was estimated to generate $67 billion in uninsured losses, or 40  percent of total losses. Such catastrophic losses could create a strong  public expectation of federal financial assistance for uninsured losses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Losses above the Program Cap", "paragraphs": ["The expectation of financial assistance to policyholders if insured losses  exceeded the program cap also creates implicit fiscal exposure. By law,  insurers that have met their individual deductible and the federal  government are not responsible for losses exceeding the TRIA program  cap. However, industry stakeholders we interviewed expected that, in the  event the program cap were exceeded, the federal government would  provide some form of assistance to those who experienced loss. For  example, losses from a NBCR event could be over $1 trillion, with TRIA- insured losses exceeding the $100 billion program cap. While a single  conventional attack would be unlikely to exceed the program cap,  according to stakeholders, a series of conventional attacks could.  Although determining the frequency of terrorist events is difficult, one  modeling firm with which we spoke estimates losses great enough to  exceed the program cap in a conventional attack to have a 0.0005  percent (or 1/2,000) chance of occurring in a single year. This is less  likely than severe natural catastrophes, such as Hurricanes Sandy and  Harvey.", "As we found in a 2019 report on fiscal exposures, Congress  demonstrated its willingness to fund the implicit exposure of policyholder  claims that exceeded the amount NFIP was authorized to borrow from  Treasury.

Stakeholders told us that policyholders may  choose larger retention amounts to reduce premiums or because  insurance for high-risk, high-value properties is unavailable. Insurers we  interviewed said that most businesses have small deductibles, but some  large businesses may choose higher retention amounts to reduce the  high insurance cost in locations considered to be higher-risk and for high- profile properties. For example as shown in figure 6, Treasury\u2019s 2017\u2013 2019 data call scenarios explored estimated losses in locations with high- profile properties such as Rockefeller Center in New York City (2017),  Willis Tower and O\u2019Hare International Airport in Chicago (2018), and  Embarcadero Center and Union Square in San Francisco (2019).  Although the actual amounts may be lower than the estimates insurers  reported, the aggregated policyholder retention could exceed losses paid  through the program.

If the total losses from a certified act of  terrorism were below the program trigger (currently $200 million), insurers  with deductibles below the program trigger could sustain losses larger  than their deductible without receiving any federal coshare. Because the  amount of the program trigger has increased over time, more insurers  potentially face this scenario. Stakeholders told us that small insurers and  those that offer workers\u2019 compensation insurance are most affected by  changes to the program trigger.", "Our analysis of Treasury data shows about 97 percent of insurers have  deductibles lower than the $200 million program trigger and thus could  receive no coshare following a certified act of terrorism. This includes all  small, captive, and alien surplus lines insurers, and more than half of the  nonsmall insurers. Furthermore, our analysis of 2016\u20132018 Treasury data  shows that these insurers are sometimes concentrated in certain  insurance lines. For example, small insurers may be concentrated in  commercial multiple peril lines. Additionally, market shares of small  insurers and captive insurers increased in the aircraft (all perils) line.  Such concentrations could destabilize specific insurance lines following a  terrorist event.", "Although the market is currently stable, some insurers may leave the  market to mitigate their risks if their losses are unlikely to trigger the  program\u2019s loss sharing, which could reduce the availability of insurance in  certain markets. A reduction in the availability of insurance could lead to  more uninsured losses in the event of a subsequent terrorist event and  could result in an increased expectation for losses to be covered through  federal assistance. In its 2019 report, Treasury recognized the potential  for small insurers to not provide insurance in certain markets. Additionally,  the report cautions that if the program trigger increased, the number of  insurers that would face the possibility of a gap between their deductible  and the program trigger also would increase. However, analysis of  Treasury data indicate that, to date, insurers in this situation largely have  not left the market. As previously noted, because the changes to program  parameters were gradual, insurers have had time to adjust to the  changes.", "Insurers facing this scenario also can mitigate their risk by purchasing  reinsurance to cover the difference between their deductible and the  program trigger. However, it is not clear that the reinsurance market can  absorb all of this risk. For example, industry stakeholders told us that  reinsurers are sensitive to accumulation of exposure and reinsurance is limited in perceived high-risk areas such as New York City, Washington  D.C., Los Angeles, and Philadelphia where there are large concentrations  of people and high-value properties.", "In addition, reinsurance premiums may be too costly for some insurers.  According to state insurance commissioners, high reinsurance costs may  not qualify as a reason for insurers to increase premiums in some states.  As a result, insurers would be unable to pass reinsurance costs on to  policyholders. Furthermore, limited availability and affordability of  reinsurance for high-risk areas and NBCR could be exacerbated following  a terrorist event. Alternative forms of reinsurance, such as catastrophe  bonds, are not widely used for terrorism risk.", "Treasury officials said that widespread market instability and an  expectation for federal assistance may be unlikely in the case of a  certified act of terrorism that produces significant losses for insurers that  do not reach the program trigger. They said any market effects would be  localized because a smaller terrorist event likely would affect a small  number of insurers with a gap between their deductibles and the program  trigger. Industry stakeholders said that it is possible that such an event  could cause insurers to reduce coverage offered, but other stakeholders  said that small insurers were well aware of the risk and their reactions  would not create market instability.

We found the data sufficiently  reliable for the purposes described below. We interviewed Treasury  officials and representatives from the National Association of Insurance  Commissioners (NAIC) and industry stakeholders, including insurers,  insurance trade associations, a rating agency, risk modelers, and an  insurance broker.

Specifically, first we calculated the annual  percentage change in direct-earned premiums for 2016\u20132017 and  2017\u20132018. Second, we found the average change to be an increase  of about 0.4 percent. This estimate was smaller than the percentage  change we used in the 2017 report, but we found the estimate  reasonable because our current estimate was based on Treasury\u2019s  data, specific to TRIA-eligible lines of insurance. Our 2017 estimate  was based on annual estimates of terrorism risk revenue. Third, we  estimated the 2015 and 2020 direct-earned premiums using the 0.4  percent average annual change and the reported 2016 and 2018  direct-earned premiums, respectively. To check for reliability, we used  the same method to estimate direct-earned premiums for 2014. Our  2014 estimate matched the 2014 data used in our 2017 report. We  calculated the change in both nominal and real dollars and decided to  use nominal dollars, which is consistent with how Treasury reports  direct-earned premiums. We found the data to be sufficiently reliable  for estimating the TRIA-eligible direct-earned premiums for 2015 and  2020.", "To compare events occurring under the program provisions in effect in  2015 and 2020, we analyzed how losses would be shared between  the government and insurers by modeling terrorist events with insured  losses of $5 billion, $25 billion, $50 billion, $75 billion, and the  maximum terrorism event size ($100 billion in insured losses) in 2015  and 2020. In each case, we modeled the affected insurers to have an  aggregate direct-earned premium base of 25, 35, 55, and 100 percent  of all TRIA-eligible premiums. To demonstrate how the program  trigger may affect insurers, we also modeled a smaller terrorist event  with $290 million in losses and assumed that the affected insurers had  an aggregate direct-earned premium base of $750 million.
