HHS officials acknowledged that the lack of data on the prevalence of these issues is a challenge in addressing the intersection of the issues. However, HHS does not have a plan for how it would collect better prevalence data. HHS agencies have some related efforts underway; however, the efforts are limited and generally do not examine the connection between brain injuries and intimate partner violence.

Intimate partner violence, also  referred to as domestic violence, includes physical violence, such as  slapping, pushing, hitting with a fist or hard object, slamming against  something, strangulation, or using a weapon. It can also involve sexual  violence, stalking, and psychological aggression. Intimate partner  violence can lead to significant chronic health consequences and pose  substantial costs to society. The CDC estimated the lifetime economic  costs of intimate partner violence to society at $3.6 trillion, which includes  costs associated with medical services for related injuries, lost  productivity from paid work, and help provided by the criminal justice  system. CDC, along with other Department of Health and Human  Services (HHS) agencies, works to address this public health issue  through, for example, monitoring data on those affected by intimate  partner violence and by providing grants to state and local entities to  develop and implement prevention programs. Additionally, the  Department of Justice (DOJ) provides grant funds to states to support  educating individuals on, and improving responses to, intimate partner  violence.", "According to researchers, intimate partner violence can result in brain  injuries, a major cause of disability in the United States. Brain injuries  can result from blows to the head or strangulation; victims of intimate  partner violence may incur repeated abuse over long periods of time, with  such injuries under-diagnosed and under-treated for many reasons. As  one example, individuals who are in abusive relationships may fear to  disclose their experiences or seek treatment for their injuries. In addition,  health care providers may not recognize that the symptoms experienced  by a victim of intimate partner violence could be the result of a brain  injury, such as a traumatic brain injury (TBI).", "A report accompanying the Department of Defense and Labor, Health  and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Act, 2019 and  Continuing Appropriations Act, 2019 included a provision for GAO to  review the status of research and efforts to promote awareness of the  relationship between intimate partner violence and TBI, among other  things.

While there are studies that estimate the prevalence of these  injuries, these studies are also limited. Specifically, among the 28 articles  we reviewed, six included an objective to estimate the prevalence of brain  injuries resulting from intimate partner violence, while the remaining 22  articles examined other areas, such as health effects or awareness of  brain injuries resulting from intimate partner violence, but did not have an  objective to estimate prevalence. The six articles are also specific to a  certain subpopulation or certain geographic locations and used different  approaches to identify individuals with brain injuries. As a result, the  range of reported prevalence rates on victims of intimate partner violence  with brain injuries (brain injuries caused by trauma or strangulation)  varied greatly (from 11 percent to about 79 percent) and were based on a  range of sample sizes, from 95 people to about 1,000 people.", "HHS agencies also have some data collection and research efforts  related to this issue; however, these efforts are limited as well. For  example, CDC and NIH have efforts that may assist in better  understanding the connection between brain injuries and intimate partner  violence, but CDC\u2019s efforts do not account for all causes of brain injuries  and NIH has only one study focused on this connection. Further, HHS  agencies treat brain injuries and intimate partner violence as separate  public health issues and pursue their efforts separately\u2014which limits their  ability to better understand the connection between the issues and the  overall prevalence of brain injuries that result from domestic violence.", "CDC officials told us that the agency\u2019s data on the connection between  brain injuries and intimate partner violence are limited, but the agency  plans to address some of the limitations. For example, the officials said  CDC analyzes health care claims data from emergency department visits  to determine the causes of TBI. However, CDC officials told us that these  data likely underestimate TBI among victims of intimate partner violence,  because many do not seek medical care; for domestic violence victims  who seek care, providers are unlikely to designate the individual as a  victim of intimate partner violence.", "CDC also collects data on intimate partner violence through its NISVS.  According to CDC reports, NISVS data are a key source of information on  intimate partner violence, but the survey does not collect data on all types  of brain injuries related to intimate partner violence. For example, the  NISVS estimates the prevalence of victims of intimate partner violence  who have been \u201cknocked out after getting hit, slammed against  something, or choked.\u201d However, published estimates are based on  responses to a survey question that asks individuals about being  \u201cknocked out,\u201d which is a colloquial term commonly used to indicate a  loss of consciousness. CDC officials stated that in most known incidents  of mild brain injury, people do not lose consciousness. As a result, NISVS  data likely understate the number of intimate partner violence victims who  may have brain injuries.", "In order to better estimate TBIs resulting from intimate partner violence,  CDC officials told us they plan to add a survey question to the NISVS to  ask respondents about whether they have experienced a concussion\u2014a  common term for mild forms of TBI\u2014due to a current or ex-partner.  CDC officials told us that they have begun initial testing on several  aspects of the survey, including on the additional question with the goal to  begin data collection by the end of 2022, plans which are pending  approval. Once the NISVS data are collected and analyzed, CDC officials  said the data could help them provide a nationally representative  prevalence estimate of intimate partner violence victims\u2019 who experienced  a TBI in their lifetimes.", "However, adding the question to the NISVS may not ensure that these  data can provide a comprehensive estimate of the prevalence of brain  injuries resulting from intimate partner violence. In particular,  The NISVS question will focus on TBIs, and will not account for  individuals with brain injuries caused by strangulation. According to  educational materials developed by the Training Institute of  Strangulation Prevention and used by HRSA in the training of  providers and advocates, more than two-thirds of intimate partner  violence victims are strangled at least once. CDC officials told us  that they are able to measure acts of choking or suffocation through  the NISVS, but this measure cannot be used to account for brain  injuries resulting from strangulation.  Additionally, CDC officials told us  that the agency\u2019s priority is to focus on TBI specifically rather than  accounting for other brain injuries.", "Despite the focus on TBIs, CDC officials told us the NISVS data are  not designed to examine whether intimate partner violence is a  leading cause of TBI in comparison with other causes, such as sports  or motor vehicle crashes. CDC officials said that some research and  NISVS data suggest that intimate partner violence is not as large a  contributor of TBIs when compared to other contributors.  However,  they noted that they do not have data on the proportion of TBIs  resulting from intimate partner violence. Absent the ability to compare  intimate partner violence as a cause of TBI against other contributors  through the NISVS or other representative studies, CDC officials will  continue to lack an understanding of the full scope of TBIs, their  primary causes, and who is affected by them.", "NIH officials identified two agency efforts that could help improve what is  known about the connection between brain injuries and intimate partner  violence.", "NIH began funding a study in September 2019 that will use advanced  brain imaging, blood analyses, and cognitive and psychological  testing to study the effects of multiple brain injuries on women  subjected to intimate partner violence. The objectives of the study are  not to measure prevalence, but to examine the health effects of brain  injuries resulting from intimate partner violence. NIH officials told us  that this is the first study funded by NIH using brain images to  investigate brain injuries resulting from intimate partner violence.", "NIH is also developing blood biomarkers\u2014which are clinical diagnosis  tools\u2014for identifying mild TBI. Currently, mild TBI is generally  diagnosed by taking an inventory of symptoms, but symptoms can  lead to misdiagnoses, including for mental illness or a substance use  disorder. NIH officials said they are in the initial stages of developing  these biomarkers, which could take the place of screening tools in  diagnosing a brain injury. While this effort was not initiated to better  understand brain injuries among victims of intimate partner violence,  biomarkers have the potential to improve the identification of TBIs,  provided they are applied to domestic violence victims.", "Two other HHS agencies\u2014ACL and HRSA\u2014also have efforts that  address brain injuries or intimate partner violence. However, these  agencies\u2019 efforts are generally not focused on the connection of the two  issues, so they are not likely to result in more complete data on the  prevalence of brain injuries resulting from intimate partner violence.  Specifically:  ACL provides grants to states to establish support services for individuals  with brain injuries through its TBI State Partnership Program. As part of  these efforts, ACL officials told us that they have begun to gather  information to determine how many TBI grant recipients are using the  funds to support particular populations, including individuals with TBI  resulting from intimate partner violence. As of December 2019, ACL  officials told us that two states (Idaho and Iowa) have used the grants to  focus on individuals with TBI as a result of intimate partner violence.", "HRSA has proposed an effort to collect data that may assist in further  understanding the health consequences of intimate partner violence. As  part of its strategy to address intimate partner violence, HRSA officials  recently began requiring federally qualified health centers to capture  International Classification of Diseases-10 codes for intimate partner  violence on health care claims beginning in 2020. This effort is not aimed  at the intersection of intimate partner violence and brain injuries; the  purpose of this data collection is to better understand the effect of  intimate partner violence on victims\u2019 health outcomes. While these data  may currently underestimate the number of individuals affected by  intimate partner violence, HRSA officials told us that their goal in  collecting these data is to underscore the significance of intimate partner  violence and help position providers to assist victims. Further, knowing  the prevalence of brain injuries resulting from intimate partner violence  and using these data could help officials further target education  campaigns to providers on the potential injuries associated with intimate  partner violence.", "Officials from HHS agencies acknowledge that the lack of prevalence  data on brain injuries resulting from intimate partner violence is a  challenge in addressing the intersection of these issues. However, HHS  and its agencies do not have a plan for how they would collect better  prevalence data, including a plan that specifies the extent to which HHS  agencies should collaborate on data collection efforts. Although HHS  agencies have some efforts underway, these efforts are limited or do not  examine the connection between the issues. For example, CDC is  working to add a question to NISVS to improve what is known about the  prevalence of TBIs among victims of intimate partner violence; however,  this effort overlooks brain injuries resulting from strangulation\u2014which  HRSA reports is often also experienced by these victims\u2014because  CDC\u2019s priorities are to focus on TBIs specifically. Further, the newly  funded NIH study is not intended to estimate the overall prevalence of  brain injuries resulting from intimate partner violence.", "Having complete data on the prevalence of brain injuries resulting from  intimate partner violence could strengthen HHS\u2019s efforts to address this  public health issue. HHS and its agencies acknowledge that enhancing  the health and well-being of Americans is critical to their public health  mission and intimate partner violence and TBIs are both prominent injury  and violence issues. As part of this mission, CDC uses its Public Health  Approach to guide its public health related efforts. The first step of this  approach is to define the problem, which includes collecting prevalence  data to understand the magnitude of the problem, where the problem  exists, and whom it affects. According to CDC, such data are critical to  ensuring that resources are focused on the individuals most in need.", "Collecting data on the prevalence of brain injuries resulting from intimate  partner violence is a critical first step. With better data comes a better  understanding of the overall prevalence of brain injuries resulting from  intimate partner violence.

Officials from HHS  agencies acknowledge the lack of overall prevalence data on brain  injuries resulting from intimate partner violence and the adverse effect this  lack of data has on understanding the intersection of these two issues.  While HHS agencies have some efforts underway to address brain  injuries and intimate partner violence, they are limited and address these  issues separately. Therefore, HHS and its agencies have missed an  opportunity to improve their public health efforts to address this issue,  particularly the prevalence of the problem, where the problem exists, and  whom it affects. By working together, HHS and its agencies can identify  ways that each agency\u2019s efforts could result in better prevalence data and  a better overall understanding of brain injuries resulting from intimate  partner violence. Improved data, in turn, could also help ensure that  federal resources are allocated to the appropriate areas and used as  efficiently and effectively as possible to address this public health issue."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following recommendation to HHS:  The Secretary of HHS should develop and implement a plan to improve  data collected on the prevalence of brain injuries resulting from intimate  partner violence and use these data to inform HHS\u2019s allocation of  resources to address the issue.
