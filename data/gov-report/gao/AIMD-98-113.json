All this suggests that the Park Service would benefit from aligning its planning and budgeting processes to demonstrate how these challenges can be met with available budgetary resources. However, in a prior report for you, we found that the Park Service\u2019s budget process is unconnected to agency performance goals, decentralized, and focused on justifying increases to a fixed base.The approach the Park Service has taken to develop its strategic plan and link its planning and budgeting processes under the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 provides a case study in the challenges that need to be overcome in (1) introducing servicewide goals to an organization that has traditionally been managed as 376 separate park units and (2) shifting from a budget process that is unconnected to servicewide goals and performance to one that links results to be achieved with available resources.", "Accordingly, you asked us to (1) describe how the Results Act has influenced planning and budgeting at the Park Service, (2) discuss the extent to which strategic and annual planning and budgeting processes have become linked and the challenges in achieving such a linkage, and (3) provide any insights that the Park Service\u2019s experiences with results-oriented management and budgeting suggest for other agencies implementing the Results Act.", "This review was an extension of previous work that described the process the Park Service used to develop budgets and establish operating priorities. We drew heavily from this prior review to describe the planning and budgeting practices at the Park Service prior to its implementing the Results Act.", "To address the three objectives for this review, we selected a judgmental sample of park units that reflected a variety of types of operating units located in different regions of the country. In addition, we selected parks and service centers with different degrees of experience in implementing the Results Act. For example, 6 of the 10 units we reviewed had participated in early testing of the Results Act, while 4 had not. At each location, we conducted structured interviews with officials at Park Service headquarters, three regional offices, eight parks, and two service centers. Although we broadly summarize the views of these officials for reporting purposes, their observations were not directly quantifiable and, thus, are not necessarily generalizable across the Park Service. Also, at each of the locations, we reviewed planning and budget documents, including strategic plans, annual performance plans, budget requests, and financial plans. The following regional offices, parks, and service centers were included in our review.", "The Intermountain Regional Office in Denver, Colorado, the National Capital Regional Office in Washington, D.C., and the Southeast Regional Office in Atlanta, Georgia.", "George Washington Memorial Parkway in Virginia, Great Smoky Mountains National Park in North Carolina and Tennessee, Harpers Ferry National Historical Park in Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia, Independence National Historical Park in Pennsylvania, Olympic National Park in Washington, Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado, Vicksburg National Military Park in Mississippi, and Yellowstone National Park in Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming.", "The Denver Service Center in Lakewood, Colorado, and the Harpers Ferry Interpretive Design Center in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia.", "We reviewed a variety of our recent reports for general background information on implementing the Results Act.

Today, more than 100 years after the first national park was created, the national park system has grown to include 376 units, most of which were created individually through legislation or presidential proclamation. The national park system covers roughly 83 million acres of land and includes an increasingly diverse mix of sites. In fact, there are now 20 different categories of park units. The most common categories include (1) national parks, such as Grand Canyon in Arizona, (2) national historical parks, such as Independence in Pennsylvania, (3) national battlefields, such as Antietam in Maryland, (4) national historic sites, such as Ford\u2019s Theatre in Washington, D.C., (5) national monuments, such as the Statue of Liberty in New York, (6) national preserves, such as Yukon-Charlie Rivers in Alaska, and (7) national recreation areas, such as Lake Mead in Arizona and Nevada. Figure 1 depicts the geographic dispersion and diversity of the units in the National Park System.", "The Park Service also operates servicewide programs from headquarters. For example, the Associate Director for Cultural Resources, Stewardship, and Partnerships operates the Cultural Resources Preservation Program, which provides funds for archeological, ethnographic, and historical research; the preparation of management studies, object cataloging, historic structure reports, and cultural landscape reports; and other research, planning, and data collection activities.", "The line of authority in the Park Service runs from the director and the deputy director to seven regional office directors. The function of the regional offices is to provide oversight and support of park operations. Regional directors directly supervise the performance of park superintendents in their regions. Regional offices also run programs for the parks in their regions. For example, regional offices run the Cyclic Maintenance Program, which provides funds for regularly scheduled preventive maintenance and preservation projects in the parks.", "In addition to the regional offices, the Park Service operates the Denver Service Center, which provides planning, design, and construction services for major park programs and complex projects for parks and the Harpers Ferry Interpretive Design Center, which provides the planning, design, and production of interpretive media for the parks. A variety of field resource centers, such as the North Atlantic Historic Preservation Center and the Southeast Archeological Center, also provide centralized technical services to parks.", "Below the regional office level, parks in the same geographic area are organized into one or more groups called clusters. Each park in the cluster is represented by its superintendent. Cluster members meet periodically to set priorities for park funding requests and to provide mutual operating support. For example, a manager of a park with a short-term resource need, such as for a specific technical skill or piece of equipment, could raise this issue at a cluster meeting and obtain temporary assistance from another park in the cluster.", "As table 1 shows, the account structure of the Park Service\u2019s budget is organized around functional activities, such as operations, construction, and land acquisition.", "As figure 2 shows, most of the Park Service\u2019s budget is for operations. For fiscal year 1997, the Park Service obligated about $1.7 billion. Of this, about $1.2 billion covered the cost of operating the national park system\u2014including parks, headquarters, regional offices, programs, and certain service centers.", "Figure 3 breaks down the nearly 69 percent of the budget that goes to operations. About 70 percent of the operating funds go directly to the parks to cover the costs of their day-to-day operations. This operating budget is the primary funding source for any park and it is generally referred to as the park\u2019s base budget. Parks compete within their regions or at the servicewide level for another 13 percent of the operating funds, which typically pay for one-time projects, such as those involving cyclic maintenance, ethnography, preservation of natural resources, or removal of hazardous waste. There are over 25 different sources of these project funds, each with its own criteria and application process.", "The Park Service\u2019s detailed budget justification presents the budget in a variety of ways. The dominant presentation is by budget account, program activity, and subprogram activity, as shown in table 1. Each budget account has its own section justifying proposed changes in funding. In addition, the operating budget includes separate sections for each major function\u2014resource stewardship, visitor services, maintenance, and park support. The account-level sections include other presentations for requested funds, such as by object class. Finally, the budget is presented according to the specific operating, construction, or other funds being requested for individual parks and programs. These park-by-park presentations, rather than the functional, object class, or performance presentations, generally serve as the basis for allocating appropriated funds to parks and programs and for controlling spending.", "Park entrance and recreation fees represent another source of funds for park units. Until recently, fee revenues collected offset rather than supplemented a park\u2019s income. Recent legislation changed this treatment. The 1996 Recreation Fee Demonstration Program enabled 100 demonstration parks to raise park entrance or recreation fees and retain 80 percent of total fees as added budget authority. The remaining 20 percent of the fees would be allocated for areas, sites, or projects selected at the discretion of the agency head."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Planning and Budgeting Becoming More Outcome-Oriented Under Results Act", "paragraphs": ["Under the Results Act, the Park Service for the first time has introduced servicewide goals to be achieved by park managers.

Park staff we interviewed said it was too soon to tell whether the strategic planning process will influence how budgets are executed\u2014i.e., allocated and spent\u2014at the park level. Although the Park Service has made some progress in aligning its budget structure and processes with its strategic plan, its efforts to link its plans and budgets have been hampered by the incompatibility between its activity-oriented budget and accounting systems and its goal-orientated strategic plan.

For nearly 20 years, each unit in the park system has been required to have a general management plan to guide the preservation and use of each unit over a 10- to 15-year period. The planning process includes consultation with the public to clearly define a park\u2019s purpose and significance, set goals and objectives, identify desired future conditions, and evaluate alternatives. Parks are also required to have a resource management plan, which defines park objectives concerning both natural and cultural resources and documents the status of the resources and outlines actions to ensure their well-being; it is the blueprint for comprehensive management of a park\u2019s resources.", "A park\u2019s general management and resource management plans are intended to identify the basic facilities, staff, interpretive materials, and equipment needed to run the park in a manner consistent with both its enabling legislation and the purposes, goals, and objectives identified during the planning process. Therefore, the plans serve as the basis for funding requests, such as for new construction, land acquisition, base operating increases, or project funds.", "At the park level, annual planning closely follows the budget cycle. About 18 months prior to a fiscal year, staff in each park analyze their needs and develop requests for increases to the prior fiscal year\u2019s budget for base operations. Park officials generally justify such increases as needed to carry out new or higher levels of ongoing operations, e.g., additional staff needed to run a new visitor center or to restore operations that were previously curtailed because past budgets did not keep pace with rising costs. Parks compete against one another for limited funds through the cluster, regional, and headquarters hierarchy.", "During the summer prior to the start of the fiscal year, staff in each park begin to plan how expected budget authority for base operations will be allocated to various park divisions, such as resources management, maintenance, or interpretation. The final base operating budget allocated to each park is the lump sum listed for each park in the Park Service\u2019s budget justification, plus or minus any changes that were made during the appropriations process. The Park Service imposes no additional controls on how the base funds are spent. For example, the financial plans developed by park managers showing projected spending by object classes are for informational purposes only. Park managers have flexibility to obligate and spend the funds as needed for ongoing operations. However, as we previously reported, many park budgets are dominated by the pay and benefits costs associated with permanent staff. According to many Park Service officials we spoke with, this reduces the flexibility of park managers to reallocate resources in the short term.", "The fee demonstration program has resulted in a new budgetary process for the 97 projects selected to participate. Under the demonstration program, park proposals to spend added fee revenues have not been subject to competition or scrutiny during the budget formulation process. Rather, parks must submit proposed spending plans for estimated fee revenues to headquarters just prior to the budget year and may only spend fee funds on projects that have been approved.", "As we noted in our report on the way the Park Service sets and budgets for operational priorities, previous long-range and annual planning have not identified outcome-oriented park goals, results to be achieved, or the resources necessary to achieve those results. As a result, accountability in the Park Service has lacked a focus on the outcomes of park operations. Accountability for park outcomes is especially important for an agency like the Park Service, which has traditionally set priorities and developed budgets at the park level. Under this decentralized management structure, individual park managers can make decisions about park operations that may or may not be consistent with the agency\u2019s mission, priorities, or goals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Park Service Used Field-Oriented Approach to Strategic Planning", "paragraphs": ["The nature of the Park Service\u2019s mission and decentralized structure necessitated a phased, field-oriented implementation of the Results Act. We previously reported that the Park Service\u2019s mission has dual objectives: to provide for the public\u2019s enjoyment of the resources that have been entrusted to its care and to protect its natural and cultural resources so that they will be unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.Balancing these often competing objectives has long shaped the debate about how best to manage the national park system. The competing missions and decentralized management culture of the Park Service provided a challenging environment in which to introduce common, servicewide missions and goals as called for by the Results Act.", "To overcome these challenges, both headquarters and field staff were engaged in drafting and exchanging comments on early draft strategic plans. Park Service staff have characterized this approach as \u201cdiagonal\u201d rather than \u201ctop-down\u201d or \u201cbottom-up\u201d; all described this approach as both difficult and frustrating. However, the same staff commented that this approach was probably the only way to develop a servicewide plan that balanced the needs of both headquarters and field staff and therefore achieved a degree of acceptance and ownership by both groups.", "A key element of the Park Service\u2019s approach to implementing the Results Act has been extensive field testing. During the summer of 1995, the Park Service undertook \u201cprototype\u201d exercises in strategic planning and performance measurement at six parks and three programs. The experiences of those prototype parks and programs along with help from planners at the Denver Service Center shaped the Park Service\u2019s strategic planning process and led to the development of some initial performance measures. During fiscal year 1996, staff from a park or program from each cluster, known as lead parks, worked to refine the goals in the servicewide plan and the implementation process. The experience of the prototype and lead parks also led to the development of written guidance used to train staff at the rest of the parks during the first part of fiscal year 1997.

Parks may also develop their own additional long-term goals that reflect the priorities of their particular mission and mission goals.", "According to Park Service officials, by September 30, 1997, each park had prepared a long-term strategic plan that mirrored the goals in the servicewide plans. Parks whose activities contributed to any of the servicewide long-term goals were required to include those long-term goals in their strategic plans. Parks could also include long-term goals that were not in the servicewide plan, but still fit within the Park Service\u2019s broad categories of goals. Park-level strategic plans cover the same 5-year period as the servicewide strategic plan. To link the strategic plans with park operations, parks also prepared annual performance plans that detail the specific performance goals for fiscal year 1998 and the activities, operating funds, and full time equivalent (FTE) staff needed to achieve the annual goals.", "Park Service officials told us that the first servicewide annual performance plan was created by summing across all parks the annual performance targets, such as the number of acres to be restored, for each long-term goal, along with the operating funds and FTEs associated with the annual performance target. The Park Service calculated servicewide percentage performance targets based on the park-level input.

The Park Service has taken initial steps to align its planning and budget processes. Under the Results Act, the Park Service\u2019s process for formulating requests for base funding increases has changed slightly. Parks requesting a funding increase are now required to specify which long-term goal will be addressed by such an increase. Park Service guidance also suggests that parks justify their requests for funding increases by describing how the increase would enable the park to meet its goals. Therefore, as such requests are evaluated at the cluster, regional, and headquarters levels, reviewers will have additional information about the specific Park Service goal to which the request will contribute. At the time of our review, however, parks were not required to demonstrate the level of performance that could be achieved with the requested funds.", "As a first step toward bringing the agency\u2019s budget presentations in line with its performance goals, the Park Service has developed an information system, called the Performance Management Data System (PMDS), which enables parks to enter their annual performance goals, along with the estimated funds and FTEs needed to achieve the goals, into a servicewide information system. PMDS is an internal Web site for the Park Service that provides users with information on the Results Act, including technical guidance, a list of the Park Service\u2019s goals, data entry screens for performance and budget information, and the ability to generate various reports, such as performance and resource information by long-term goal, region, or park. For each goal, there is a data entry page on which parks enter long-term goal, baseline, and annual target information, along with the funds and FTEs needed to achieve the targets for fiscal years 1998, 1999, and 2000. During the initial transition period, parks entered data for fiscal year 1998 only. According to Park Service officials, out-year data was to be entered by staff in each park during March 1998 for the next budget cycle.", "Park Service officials said that it was too soon to tell whether the strategic planning process will influence how budgets are formulated and executed. Although the Park Service used PMDS data to produce its fiscal year 1999 annual performance plan, which was included in its fiscal year 1999 budget justification to Congress, the justifications remained focused on traditional functional and organizational budget presentations. Most park managers also said that it was too soon to evaluate the influence of strategic planning on resource decisions. For example, despite park managers\u2019 relative freedom to spend base operating funds as needed within total allocations, some Park Service officials cited the relative inflexibility associated with budgets dominated by increasing personnel costs as a barrier to changing resource allocations to achieve performance goals. One park official said that the strategic and annual performance planning process will not likely lead to changes in resource decisions until parks begin to track performance against goals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Not All Funding Sources Linked to Park Plans", "paragraphs": ["To develop park-level and servicewide annual performance plans, the budget office instructed parks to assign only base operating funds to their annual goals. This decision was made because base operating funds are considered the only stable source of funding for purposes of planning over the 5-year period of the strategic plan. However, park-level officials commented that base operating funds are only one of a variety of sources of funding used to accomplish a park\u2019s goals. Many parks also rely heavily on other sources of funding, including project funds, volunteer time, and concession payments to accomplish their goals. For example, the budget division chief observed that the servicewide strategic plan calls for parks to increase visitor satisfaction. A park manager may decide that fixing bathrooms will contribute to this goal, but may use project rather than base operating funds to pay for the repairs. Because project funds cannot be included in the park\u2019s annual performance plan, this activity would be excluded from the park\u2019s plan.", "According to the budget division chief, the problem with parks assigning project funds to their goals is that parks must compete for those funds annually. Since they cannot count on having those funds from one year to the next, they cannot confidently project 5 years forward how those funds will help them accomplish their long-term goals. Since headquarters program directors or regional directors control the allocation of project funds, these managers were responsible for assigning the funds and FTEs for each project to the servicewide goals on the basis of past uses of the funds at the park level.", "The budget division chief said that resolving this issue in a way that allows park managers to incorporate project funds into their plans may force the Park Service to require parks to submit prioritized requests for project funds at the same time they request increases to base funding (i.e., following the timetable for budget formulation). This would be a change from current practice, in which overall levels of project funding are formulated and requested in the President\u2019s budget, but specific projects are not subsequently selected and placed in priority order until just prior to the budget year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Park Service Goals Differ From Activity Structure of Budget and Accounting Systems", "paragraphs": ["Park Service officials told us that creating a direct link between planned and actual spending and the Park Service\u2019s annual goals is complicated by the fact that the existing budget and accounting structures are activity-oriented and do not mesh well with the goal-orientation of the Park Service\u2019s strategic plan. The activity orientation of the account structure can be seen in table 1.", "The current budget structure is also the foundation for the Park Service\u2019s accounting system. As park and program managers execute their budgets, they set up accounts associated with maintenance, interpretation services, park support, etc., and use established codes to record the nature of the expense, e.g., trails and walks (maintenance), special interpretive programs (interpretation and educational programs), and administration (park support). Thus, park and program managers can use the budget and accounting systems to plan how much they intend to spend on an activity and then track actual spending against the plan. In the Park Service, these planning and budgeting systems are for park-level management purposes; for financial control purposes, the Park Service monitors spending only against total allocations to individual parks and projects.", "In contrast to the activity orientation of the budget and accounting systems, the Park Service\u2019s goals describe desired future conditions\u2014or outcomes\u2014in the areas of resource protection, visitor services, preservation of resources through partnerships, and organizational effectiveness. PMDS captures estimated park and program spending by goal. It was not, however, designed to be an accounting system. Currently, park managers have no way to track or report how actual spending compared to planned spending by goal at the end of the fiscal year. Park Service staff told us that until the agency develops a system for linking its goals to its budget and accounting systems, parks will continue to produce two sets of books: one for planning purposes using data from PMDS and another for financial accountability and budget execution purposes using data from separate budget and accounting systems.", "As a potential fix for this duplication, the Park Service is in the process of modifying its park-based financial management system to allow parks to create a crosswalk between their budget projections and actual cost data and their strategic goals. According to a planning document prepared by the Park Service\u2019s Accounting Operations Center, the crosswalk would allocate all of a park\u2019s accounts in the budget execution system to the park\u2019s goals. Park managers would determine the percentage of the budgeted and actual funds in a particular account that would be automatically allocated to each park goal. For example, a park could associate all funds in an existing road maintenance account to a single goal, such as enhancing the visitor experience, or it could split the funds among a variety of goals using set percentages, such as 50 percent for enhancing the visitor experience and 50 percent for preserving park resources."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Changes to Budget Structure Would Require Dialogue With Congress", "paragraphs": ["Park Service officials commented that, carried to its logical end, outcome-oriented management of the Park Service would require dramatic changes to the existing budget structure.

The officials told us that, despite these challenges, the strategic planning process produced benefits, such as increased communication and resource sharing within parks and information about how resources were being allocated among goals.

Some park staff said the process confirmed that they were generally doing the right things; others said the process had led them to make changes to meet a goal they had identified or to question assumptions about park operations.

Staff at one of those parks said they could see a lot of their work reflected in the final servicewide strategic plan.

Staff commented that the guidance and hands-on form of training provided a good basis for staff to develop their own strategic plans. For example, one park manager said that, in addition to presentations at the annual superintendent\u2019s conference and cluster meetings, the park\u2019s management staff received 4 hours of training with the director of the Office of Strategic Planning (OSP) and a day of hands-on training with the regional office\u2019s Results Act coordinator. The training sessions provided examples of mission statements and goals from other parks and definitions of terms. Among the handouts provided were copies of templates for strategic and annual work plans. The manager said that all this material was helpful in getting started. Another park manager commented that his staff could not have developed their strategic plan without the training. In that region, nearby parks formed groups and the staff from the region\u2019s lead parks and the regional director\u2019s office led 2-day workshops for each group. Staff said they made a few wrong turns in the beginning, but the training and feedback helped them get back on track.", "In addition to hands-on training, park managers reported that the Park Service training and guidance aided implementation by stressing that they should develop their park-level strategic plans in a way most useful for their particular operations within the overall framework of the servicewide plan. This approach increased the credibility and acceptance of the strategic planning process in individual parks.

Such a show of support made a positive difference in the attitudes of field staff toward the strategic planning process. Another park manager commented that his regional director issued strongly worded guidance to park superintendents supporting implementation of the Results Act. The regional director said she wanted park managers to be personally involved in making presentations to her about their strategic plans. This led the park manager to take the effort more seriously and to work intensively with division chiefs as a team to develop their plan.", "Conversely, some headquarters managers have had less involvement with Results Act implementation than park or regional officials. According to one headquarters official, mid-level managers at headquarters have not had the same degree of training or direct experience developing strategic plans as park managers since the Park Service\u2019s implementation of the Results Act has been primarily field-oriented to date. As a result, there is more cynicism concerning the Results Act among mid-level managers at headquarters than in the field. This official said that if they had to do this again, headquarters staff would have received the same orientation and training that park and regional staff received.", "In addition to visible top management support, centralized support and guidance provided by OSP and regional office coordinators were important aids to developing park-level plans. For example, several park managers said that the training manual developed by OSP, entitled Field Guide to the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) and Performance Management, was timely and excellent, although elements of the guide quickly became outdated. Park managers also found OSP\u2019s brief summary guide, entitled GPRA on the Go, to be a concise and useful synopsis of how to implement the Results Act. Several park managers noted that as they were rushing to complete their plans, central guidance changed frequently. However, managers also commended OSP\u2019s use of information technology, such as a computer bulletin board for posting guidance, questions, and answers. One park official said that he had received over 100 electronic mail messages from the regional office and headquarters providing directions, examples, and suggestions on implementing the Results Act.", "Finally, park officials suggested that a team approach to developing strategic and annual performance plans resulted in better plans with more buy-in from participants. In the parks we visited, we generally found that key management staff, such as the superintendent, assistant superintendent, division chiefs, and financial managers were personally involved in developing the strategic and performance plans, although the extent of the involvement varied. A park manager also noted that the use of trained facilitators from parks with more strategic planning experience to assist staff at less experienced parks had been very helpful."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Link to Budget Made Plans More Concrete", "paragraphs": ["According to headquarters and regional office officials, the requirement that parks estimate the budgetary resources associated with each goal aided strategic planning by making the exercise more concrete to park staff. Headquarters and regional office officials saw unambiguous benefits from linking park resources to their plans. For example, one headquarters official commented that making a connection between Park Service goals and resources is essential to make the Results Act work. Without this connection, park staff would view the effort as a paperwork exercise. A regional office manager added that the resource assessment phase of the strategic planning process was critical as a reality check on goals. Parks had to answer the question: Can these goals be realistically achieved with existing resources? If not, goals were adjusted. Another headquarters official thought that the park strategic plans would minimize arguments about budget priorities in the parks\u2014the goals in each park\u2019s plan now represent the park\u2019s priorities for the next 5 years.", "Park officials also mostly agreed with the importance of the budgetary link. For example, the requirement to assume constant, inflation-adjusted resources over the 5-year period of the strategic plan led a number of parks to develop more realistic goals after considering budgetary constraints. For example, officials at one park proposed a boundary study to address the protection of historical resources currently located outside the park\u2019s boundaries, which had been arbitrarily established. However, staff decided to scale back their initial plans because a sufficient level of funding would not be available without a budgetary increase. This contrasts with an experience described to us prior to implementing the Results Act, in which managers described a long-term management plan they developed that was not realistic because there was no way to achieve the goals in the plan without additional funding.", "While generally agreeing about the importance of a budgetary link for internal planning purposes, several park officials had concerns about how such data would be used by the Park Service or by Congress to make budgetary decisions. Some questioned whether estimated spending for each goal was sufficiently precise to be used to challenge a park\u2019s budget. Park officials had fewer concerns about using budget data at the park level to aid internal decision-making. Such views are not unique in the executive branch. In our recent report on the use of performance information in the budget process, executive branch officials we interviewed said that the principal value of the Results Act was internal and management oriented, stemming from its ability to clarify missions and performance expectations. They also said that current budgetary pressures and apprehension about the use of Results Act information could increase levels of defensiveness among agency staff."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Holding Managers Accountable for Results Is an Important Factor, but Concerns Remain at the Park Level", "paragraphs": ["The Park Service\u2019s intention to hold upper-level park managers accountable for achieving the goals in their strategic and annual performance plans lent greater importance to the strategic planning effort, but it raised concerns for some park managers. Headquarters officials generally agreed that holding managers accountable for achieving their goals was important for successful implementation of the Results Act. For example, one official said that holding managers accountable for results would have a particularly strong influence if managers believed that the results would affect their performance evaluations and budgets. However, at the park level, officials from half of the eight parks we interviewed agreed that holding managers accountable for achieving the goals in their plans reinforced the importance of strategic planning. Park staff expressed the following concerns.", "The focus on accountability is not really new in the Park Service because park managers have always been held accountable for the results of their actions. The difference under the Results Act is that now managers will be held accountable for the measurable outcomes of their operations. Park managers were also concerned about being accountable for achieving servicewide goals where outcomes cannot be directly controlled by park managers. For example, the Park Service has a goal to improve air quality in certain parks. However, this will be difficult for park managers to do because of the many external environmental factors that affect air quality that are beyond their control.", "The operating environment of a park can change rapidly and park managers respond by moving resources to where they are needed most. Holding managers accountable for achieving the goals in their plans will reduce park managers\u2019 flexibility in the short-term to move resources where they are needed most, especially when emergencies occur. In their view, such reduced flexibility to address emergency needs could have negative consequences for resource protection and the visitor experience."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Outcome-Oriented Goals Are Difficult to Establish and Measure", "paragraphs": ["One of the most prominent challenges identified by Park Service officials was developing meaningful outcome-oriented goals that could be measured and for which managers could be held accountable. In particular, comments focused on the difficulty of measuring outcomes for natural resource protection and customer satisfaction. Park Service officials commented on the difficulty of selecting appropriate outcome measures for natural resources, such as water quality, endangered species, or disturbed lands. One official gave the following examples.", "A single goal may be difficult to apply uniformly across park units. For example, there are hundreds of water quality measures that are specific to the unique characteristics of individual parks. The water quality standards needed to support plants and animals can differ from one species to the next or may not yet be defined scientifically. In contrast, the water quality standard for safe recreational swimming can be determined and is frequently defined at the state level. The Park Service adopted the goal of reducing the number of days park recreational waters fail to meet state water quality standards for swimming since it could be clearly defined, was measurable, and applied more broadly within the park system than other water quality goals that had been identified.", "The need to develop goals narrow enough to be aggregated meaningfully at the servicewide level may exclude closely related goals developed by parks. Budget data taken from PMDS revealed that spending on the 31 long-term goals in the servicewide strategic plan represented 44 percent of the operating budget. The remainder of the budget was linked to other mission-oriented goals developed by individual parks. A Park Service official suggested that this may indicate that many park goals did not fit the specific definition of the goals in the servicewide plan. For example, the servicewide goal for restoring disturbed lands focuses only on disturbances caused by development or invasions of exotic species. However, many parks set related goals, such as restoring lands disturbed by flooding or past forest fire control practices. Such goals would appear in the performance management system as park-specific goals, although they were closely related to the servicewide goal. To address this problem, the Park Service will modify PMDS to allow park officials to indicate when a park goal is closely related to a servicewide goal. This reorientation of goal labeling might offer a truer picture of the portion of the budget that is allocated to servicewide priorities. It can be difficult to measure progress toward a final outcome because the final outcome itself is not easily measured. For example, the Park Service has a goal to return land disturbed by development or exotic species to its natural state. A particular park may not have any scientific criteria for determining exactly when the natural state has been recovered. However, a first step toward recovering the land is to remove the exotic species. This action can be measured in terms of acres and used as a proxy for the final outcome.", "Even when a measure can be developed, the units to be measured can vary greatly, making it difficult to interpret aggregate data. For example, both Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and the Pierce-Klingle Mansion in Washington, D.C., are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Therefore the servicewide goal to maintain historic structures in good condition would apply to both structures. However, a headquarters official suggested that Independence Park has greater historical significance than Klingle Mansion. It is necessary to look behind aggregate figures to determine the relative weight and importance of individual performance goals.", "There is also the issue of whether park managers can control all the outcomes in their parks. For example, according to a headquarters official, parks exist in a broader geographic context and do not control all the variables that affect the quality of park resources. Some goals related to reducing pollution were abandoned because the Park Service did not own the land that generated the pollution and therefore could not directly prevent it.", "Most Park Service officials agreed that parks lack key baseline data to begin measuring performance against goals. Two large natural resource parks said that the lack of baseline data to measure progress in preserving natural resources was a problem because they did not have extra funding in their base budgets to develop the data. Therefore, they will have to reduce spending on other park operations to free the necessary funds. To address the lack of baseline data, an OSP official said that parks were allowed to establish \u201cthreshold\u201d goals aimed at establishing baseline performance data. After establishing baseline performance levels, park officials could then focus on achieving the percentage improvement goals contained in the servicewide strategic plan. Several plans we reviewed included threshold goals aimed at developing baseline performance data during fiscal year 1998.", "In the area of customer satisfaction, many parks were concerned that they were going to be held accountable for achieving improvements in customer satisfaction, but that parks did not yet have an instrument for measuring customer satisfaction. A headquarters official told us that the Park Service was in the process of addressing this issue by developing a servicewide Visitor Survey Card which will be distributed to all parks this summer. The card will contain questions pertaining to Park Service goals for visitor satisfaction and understanding. Randomly selected visitors would have the option to fill the card out. The Park Service will use a contractor to process the responses and report on the results."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Planning Systems Not Linked to Budget and Accounting Systems", "paragraphs": ["Another major challenge cited by park managers was the lack of systems needed to track actual spending by long-term goal. A park manager who commented on PMDS\u2014the information system the Park Service has developed for parks to report on planned performance, spending, and FTEs\u2014said the system worked well. However, in general, park managers expressed concern that PMDS only provides estimates of funds to be spent to accomplish annual goals, not actual funds spent. In addition to preparing data for PMDS, park managers must also prepare traditional financial plans and account for spending according to the activities in the budget and accounting systems. Park managers were hopeful that some integration of these systems could be achieved.", "In addition to the systems issue, a regional office official pointed out that some parks lack the computer hardware needed to input the data. One headquarters official acknowledged that computer hardware and systems were areas in which the Park Service has traditionally made minimal investments. However, he also said that information technology and systems have become easier to develop and use and steps will be taken in the near future to provide parks with the computers and Internet access they need to be linked servicewide."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Commented on the Value of the Strategic Planning Process for Park Operations", "paragraphs": ["According to Park Service officials, the strategic planning process has led to increased communication and resource sharing within parks and provided useful information about how resources were being allocated. There was less agreement that the process had resulted in any major operational changes. Some park managers said the process confirmed that they were generally doing the right things. Others said the process led them to make changes to meet a goal they had identified or to question assumptions about park operations. Several park managers were hopeful that their strategic and annual performance plans would provide a more effective way to justify their budgets.", "Within some parks, the strategic planning process fostered increased communication across park divisions and facilitated resource sharing to accomplish common goals. For example, the strategic planning process helped break down barriers between park divisions, such as resource protection, interpretation, and maintenance at one park we visited. Through the process of identifying park goals, staff at this park found that each division contributed to common goals. For example, prior to the Results Act, mowing the lawn was viewed as a maintenance activity that was done for its own sake. The strategic planning process led maintenance staff to view this activity as contributing to multiple park goals that cut across division lines, including (1) protecting park land from erosion, (2) aiding visitation, and (3) aiding the interpretation of the park\u2019s history by revealing the vistas seen by Civil War battle participants.", "The process of linking annual performance plans to park budgets provided useful information about how resources were being allocated to long-term goals. For example, staff from a large natural resources park said that aligning budget information with park goals provided factual confirmation that resource preservation goals received substantially fewer resources than visitor services goals. According to park staff, out of a budget of $8 million, a small share\u2014about 6 percent\u2014was being allocated to preserving natural resources in the park. They said having this information may lead them to reconsider the small share of spending on resource preservation. At the headquarters level, an official we spoke to hoped that parks\u2019 annual performance plans\u2014by requiring parks to link their goals to their operations\u2014would provide headquarters with information not previously available about the choices, in terms of resource allocations, park managers are making among competing Park Service goals.", "There was less agreement on whether strategic planning had led to changes in park operations or how resources were allocated. Typically, staff said they went through the strategic planning process with open minds, but found that the process confirmed that current activities were consistent with the park\u2019s legislation and contributed to the goals of the Park Service. A few park managers cited changes. For example, developing strategic and annual performance plans led one park to request funding for cataloging its archives because they recognized that this was a major, but unmet, goal. The park signed a memorandum of understanding with a university to do this work if funding becomes available.", "Some park staff said that the strategic planning process, by focusing on outcomes to be achieved, had led them to question assumptions about their operations and may help identify more effective and efficient ways to accomplish Park Service missions and make resource allocation decisions. For example, staff from a large natural resources park commented that half of the park\u2019s budget is spent on maintenance activities, such as maintaining picnic tables for visitors. However, they reasoned that there may be a more effective way to allocate resources to achieve the goal of enhancing the visitor experience. In addition, staff at a service center said that, to meet one of their organizational efficiency goals, they will be designing an Internet site to provide information about the center\u2019s services, thus reducing staff time needed to answer questions on the telephone.", "Finally, by showing what can be accomplished with existing base funds and staff, some park managers hoped that their annual performance plans would provide a more effective way to justify and communicate the need for increased resources. This view was not shared at one of the larger parks. These officials did not feel their strategic plan was an effective tool for communicating their resource needs. Their main concern was that their strategic plan could not be used to answer traditional questions about spending on activities, such as how much will be spent to reduce their backlog of maintenance tasks."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Observations", "paragraphs": ["We concluded in a previous report that by implementing the Results Act the Park Service can promote a better understanding by Congress and other stakeholders of (1) the agency\u2019s and each park\u2019s priorities, (2) the links between the agency\u2019s and each park\u2019s priorities, (3) the results achieved with the funds provided, and (4) the shortfalls in performance.As it sought to implement the Results Act, the Park Service has faced difficult circumstances, including multiple missions that are often competing and resistant to direct measurement, and extraordinarily decentralized operations, for which many parks possess distinct legislative mandates.", "The Park Service\u2019s initial progress in implementing the Results Act has laid a foundation for future performance management improvements and provides valuable insights to other federal agencies or programs also characterized by complex missions, which are carried out by decentralized and largely autonomous operating units. In such an environment, strategic planning that is exclusively top-down will likely lead to goals that are irrelevant to and/or ignored by operating managers. To be effective, the process must reflect a partnership among key participants and include flexibility for managers within the parameters of the organization\u2019s strategic goals. The active involvement of park managers in developing servicewide and park-level goals, coupled with the Park Service\u2019s phased implementation approach, has led to greater ownership of the goals by field staff who are ultimately responsible for achieving results. By setting broad servicewide goals and simultaneously giving line managers the authority to tailor local goals and performance measures to their unique operating needs, the Park Service has greater assurance that a balance can be achieved between park-level attention to servicewide goals and the operating realities of each park.", "The strategic planning process called for by the Results Act and discussed in many of our recent testimonies and reports starts with an agency\u2019s mission and the long-term goals it wishes to achieve and uses this information to shape the formulation and execution of agency budgets. For many years, the reverse has been the case\u2014the budget and the budget process often shaped an agency\u2019s plans, and costs were assigned by activity or item of expense rather than performance goal. The Park Service has taken an important step by asking managers to estimate the cost of achieving their goals and aggregating this information at the servicewide level. However, two questions remain: (1) whether the Park Service will be able to use strategic and annual performance planning to direct agency and park-level resources to affect the accomplishment of servicewide goals and (2) whether the new focus on accomplishing servicewide goals can be achieved without sacrificing the ability of park managers to respond to their unique operating environments. In the Park Service, as will likely be the case in many federal agencies, budget and accounting systems are more typically structured by organization, project, or activity than by goals. Thus, agencies will have to consider how best to achieve a linkage, whether by retaining existing budget structures and creating crosswalks to the goals in their plans or by reorganizing the structure of their program activities to better mirror goals in their strategic plans. The latter approach will require extensive dialog with congressional appropriations and oversight committees, parent departments, and OMB, and continued development of cost allocation systems.", "Although the challenges experienced by Park Service officials are hardly unique, their responses reflect long-term management commitment and an understanding that achieving results-oriented management will be neither easy nor quick. Park Service officials readily admit that much work remains to be done and that many of the successes they have achieved have occurred only after identifying and resolving problems in initial approaches or techniques.

The Park Service also gave park managers discretion to incorporate long-term goals that were unique to the missions of their individual parks but still fit within the broad mission goals of the servicewide strategic plan."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Mission, Mission Goals, and Long-Term Goals, National Park Service Strategic Plan, 1997", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Mission of the National Park Service", "paragraphs": ["The National Park Service preserves unimpaired the natural and cultural resources and values of the national park system for the enjoyment, education, and inspiration of this and future generations.
