As a result, SBA may have missed opportunities to collaborate with HBCUs and help achieve the goals of its plan.", "SBA has collected limited information about its programs and activities with HBCUs. SBA could not establish a baseline for performance measures developed in its 2018 plan because SBA district offices and the Small Business Development Centers are not required to collect or report information about their HBCU-related outreach and other activities. For example, while representatives from the nine Small Business Development Centers with whom GAO spoke said they conducted outreach to HBCUs, this information was not reported to SBA headquarters.

We also  obtained data from SBA\u2019s Office of Entrepreneurial Development and  Office of Strategic Alliances and identified the participation of institutions  of higher education (HBCUs and non-HBCUs) in key programs and  activities. To assess the reliability of these data, we reviewed available  data, cross-walked them with publicly available information, if applicable,  and requested written responses from SBA officials about the data and  their limitations, if any. We determined the data were sufficiently reliable  for describing the general scale of SBA\u2019s efforts with HBCUs and non- HBCUs.", "To address the second and third objectives, we reviewed SBA data  manuals and standard operating procedures. We interviewed SBA  officials in the Office of Entrepreneurial Development, Office of Field  Operations, and Office of Strategic Alliances and regional SBA  stakeholders\u2014such as SBDC representatives and SBA district office  officials. We selected the SBDCs and district offices where we conducted  interviews based on a combination of factors, including (1) HBCU  participation in the SBDCs (hosting a lead or service center), (2) high  number of HBCUs located in the state, and (3) high number of strategic  alliance memorandums or co-sponsorship agreements signed with  HBCUs. Specifically, we interviewed staff from six SBDC lead centers  and three associated service centers, and eight SBA district offices  (which had 47 HBCUs in their collective service areas). Furthermore,  based on data SBA provided of signed strategic alliance memorandums  with HBCUs, we selected and interviewed staff from eight HBCUs that  had strategic alliance memorandums with SBA or were located near an  SBA district office. We also reviewed additional documents SBA provided  related to its plans and reports for the White House Initiative on HBCUs.

The Office of Entrepreneurial  Development oversees several programs, primarily through a nationwide  network of public and private resource partners that offer small business  counseling and technical assistance. These resource partners include  SBDCs, Women\u2019s Business Centers, and SCORE chapters. The SBDC  program receives the majority of entrepreneurial development program  funding to provide technical assistance (business counseling and training)  to small businesses and aspiring entrepreneurs. SBDC services include  assisting small businesses access capital, develop and exchange new  technologies, and improve business planning, strategy, and financial  management.", "The entities eligible to receive SBDC funding are primarily institutions of  higher education. By statute, the amount eligible entities receive is  determined by a state population-based funding formula subject to the  amount of an appropriation in any given fiscal year. As a condition of  receiving the grant, the recipient or host institution is required to match  the funding. The host institution (funding recipient) is responsible for  establishing a lead center and network of service centers for a designated  service area. The SBDC program has 63 lead centers (generally hosted  by institutions of higher education) and more than 900 service centers,  including satellite locations.", "SBA has identified certain special emphasis groups to be targeted for  assistance by SBDCs, such as certain populations of business owners.  The groups do not include institutions; thus, HBCUs are not included as  special emphasis groups. According to SBA officials, SBDCs target  underrepresented groups in the population of business owners near  HBCUs.", "Office of Field Operations. SBA also provides services through a  network of 10 regional offices and 68 district offices that are led by the  Office of Field Operations. SBA district offices serve as the point of  delivery for most SBA programs and services. Some district office staff  (including business opportunity, lender relations, and economic  development specialists) work directly with SBA clients. SBA\u2019s district  offices also can initiate and oversee outreach activities to foster  entrepreneurship. For example, SBA district offices can implement  counseling or training events on their own, participate in such events  organized by third parties, or co-sponsor such activities with a third party  (for-profit, nonprofit, or government entity) through a co-sponsorship  agreement. Moreover, district offices can enter into a 2-year agreement  with a nonprofit or government party, known as a strategic alliance  memorandum, to foster a working relationship designed to strengthen  small business development in a local area.", "Office of Strategic Alliances. The Office of Strategic Alliances, housed  in SBA\u2019s Office of Communication and Public Liaison, reviews co- sponsorship agreements and strategic alliance memorandums drafted by  district or program offices.

Colleges and universities predominately have been the  institutional hosts of lead SBDCs since the 1980s according to SBA  officials.", "According to SBA officials, there is little turnover among institutions  hosting lead SBDCs because SBDC program announcements for host  institutions are not full and open competitions and existing host  institutions often renew their cooperative agreements to continue  operating lead SBDCs. Based on the statutorily defined and population- based allocation formula, the District of Columbia SBDC and the Virgin  Islands SBDC together received about 1.3\u20131.4 percent of the total SBDC  funding awarded to institutions of higher education from fiscal year 2008  through 2018.", "The District of Columbia SBDC and the Virgin Islands SBDC have  engaged with HBCU students, alumni, or faculty.

They also stated they work with all students who come to their  center seeking help and do not have a cap on the number of student  clients. Similarly, the Virgin Islands SBDC representatives told us as of  February 2019 they had made presentations to upper-level business  classes and freshmen development seminars at the University of the  Virgin Islands.

They noted that many of the SBDC  clients they serve have some affiliation with the university, such as being  an alumnus or having attended classes there.", "In addition to establishing the lead SBDC, the host institution establishes  a network of service centers to deliver services, such as counseling and  training, within its service area, including at HBCUs. As of September  2018, at least 16 HBCUs hosted SBDC service centers across 11  states. Three SBDC service centers we reviewed that were HBCU- hosted had engaged with HBCU students, alumni, or faculty. For  example, the Alabama SBDC service center representatives (housed at  Alabama State University in Montgomery, Alabama) said the center works  with several faculty members who provided training at SBDC workshops  and assisted the service center on specialized topics, such as marketing.

SBA signed at least 51 such memorandums with institutions of  higher education in states with HBCUs in that period. As we previously  reported, strategic alliance memorandums are mechanisms to initiate and  formalize a relationship with nonprofit and governmental agencies, but  they are not necessary to initiate a relationship.

Information on the number of  strategic alliance memorandums signed with HBCUs is incomplete. In  September 2018, SBA provided us a list of HBCUs that signed  strategic alliance memorandums from 2008 through 2018, developed  by cross-referencing records of memorandums with a list of HBCUs.  SBA identified 24 such HBCUs, but we identified an additional three  HBCUs that had signed strategic alliance memorandums during this  period.

Our  review of efforts to foster entrepreneurship focused on counseling and  training.", "To address the first objective, we analyzed SBA programs and activities  that in previous work we identified as key for fostering entrepreneurship  with HBCUs. Key programs and activities are the Small Business  Development Center (SBDC) program, strategic alliance memorandums,  and co-sponsored activities. We obtained data from SBA\u2019s Office of  Entrepreneurial Development and Office of Strategic Alliances for these  key programs and activities, and identified the participation of institutions  of higher education, including HBCUs. We reviewed and analyzed data  provided to us by SBA of the host institutions and the total amount of  funding obligated to administer the SBDC program in fiscal years 2008\u2013 2018 and signed agreements (strategic alliance memorandums and co- sponsorship agreements) with institutions of higher education (HBCUs  and non-HBCUs) in fiscal years 2013\u20132018. In addition, we conducted an  on-site file review to record strategic alliance memorandums signed in  fiscal years 2013\u20132015 that were not readily available electronically. To  assess the reliability of these data, we reviewed available data, cross- walked them with publicly available information, if applicable, and  requested written responses from SBA officials about the data and their  limitations, if any. We determined the data were sufficiently reliable for  describing the general scale of SBA\u2019s efforts to engage with HBCUs and  non-HBCUs.", "To address the second objective, we reviewed SBA\u2019s 2018 plan for the  White House Initiative on HBCUs and documentation of plans for 2011  and 2012, which were the only years in the period of our review (2008\u2013 2018) for which SBA could provide documentation of such plans. We also  analyzed the three most recent executive orders related to HBCUs to  understand the responsibilities expected of federal agencies and identify  changes over time. We also reviewed additional documents that SBA  provided related to its agency plans, such as efforts to promote small  business research programs, and one available annual agency  submission (fiscal year 2010) to the White House Initiative on HBCUs on  SBA\u2019s efforts to support HBCUs.", "We interviewed SBA officials from the Office of Entrepreneurial  Development, Office of Field Operations, and the Office of Strategic  Alliances.

We selected these SBDC networks and  district offices based on a combination of factors, including (1) HBCU  participation in an SBDC network (hosting a lead or service center), (2)  high number of HBCUs located in the state, and (3) high number of  agreements (strategic alliance memorandums or co-sponsorship  agreements) SBA signed with HBCUs.", "Based on data SBA provided of signed strategic alliance memorandums  with HBCUs, we selected and contacted 12 HBCUs that had signed a  strategic alliance memorandum with SBA between 2013 and 2018 or  were located close to SBA offices or resource partners such as SBDCs.  We interviewed staff at eight of these HBCUs and the remaining four  HBCUs did not respond.
