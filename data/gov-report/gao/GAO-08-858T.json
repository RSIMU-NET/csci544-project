U.S. assistance to Palau has also included discretionary federal programs, such as health, education, and infrastructure services, that are not provided for in the compact. Compact direct assistance is scheduled to expire on September 30, 2009. In addition, the related subsidiary agreement providing for federal services to Palau will expire on that date unless renewed or extended. At that time, Palau's annual withdrawals from its trust fund can increase from $5 million to $15 million. The compact mandates that the U.S. and Palau governments review the terms of the compact and its related agreements in 2009 and concur on any modifications to those terms. The Department of the Interior's (Interior) Office of Insular Affairs (OIA) has primary responsibility for monitoring and coordinating all U.S. assistance to Palau, and the Department of State (State) is responsible for government-to-government relations. To provide accountability for compact funds, the compact's related agreements require an annual audit of Palau's use of compact funds and require Palau to submit economic development plans, identifying planned expenditures of compact assistance, and annual reports on, among other topics, its implementation of these plans. The U.S. and Palau governments are also required to hold annual economic consultations to review Palau's progress toward self-sufficiency and to consult regarding Palau's trust fund every 5 years.

The provision of compact federal services--postal, weather, and aviation--is projected at about $25 million, or 3 percent of the assistance, and the compact road construction accounted for $149 million, or 17 percent of the assistance. Palau's receipt of discretionary federal program assistance is projected at $267 million, or 31 percent of the total assistance provided. In 1995-2006, five U.S. agencies--the Departments of Education (Education), Health and Human Services (HHS), Interior, Defense (DOD), and Transportation (DOT)--contributed the majority of discretionary federal program assistance to Palau. Palau has made progress in establishing financial accountability, despite limited capacity to address persistent internal control weaknesses, and has met most compact accountability requirements; however, Interior's monitoring of Palau's accountability has been limited. Palau's single audit reports for 1995-2006 show that it improved its timeliness in submitting the reports and improved the reliability of its financial statements. However, the reports show persistent weaknesses in Palau's internal controls over financial reporting; the reports also indicate that Palau has not complied with all federal award requirements and show persistent weaknesses in Palau's internal controls over compliance with these requirements. Although Palau has developed plans to correct these weaknesses, limited capacity in financial accounting resources and expertise puts at risk Palau's ability to sustain its improvements in financial accountability and to operate a major federal program within applicable requirements. Palau met the majority of the compact's and related agreements' accountability requirements, such as submitting annual reports and economic development plans. OIA and State officials, as well as officials from the government of Palau, reported that they participated in the required economic consultations but that the meetings were not held annually. Moreover, U.S. and Palau officials acknowledged that the required trust fund consultations were not held at all. According to OIA officials, OIA has used Palau's single audit results and compact annual reports to monitor Palau's use of compact funds and has provided technical assistance funds to train Palau employees as well as funds to enhance Palau's financial management systems and processes. However, OIA officials said that Interior views its oversight role as limited. To improve Palau's ability to sustain its improvements in financial reporting and address its internal control weaknesses, our report recommends that the Secretary of the Interior direct OIA to formally consult with the government of Palau regarding Palau's financial management challenges and target future technical assistance toward building Palau's financial management capacity. Responding to a draft of our report, Interior agreed with our recommendation and identified steps it will take to implement it."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss compact and other U.S. assistance  to the Republic of Palau.

Absent affirmative action by Congress,  Palau\u2019s eligibility for some federal programs could expire. The expiration  of the compact\u2019s federal programs and services agreement in 2009 may  also impact U.S. agencies\u2019 implementation of discretionary federal  programs in Palau, although agency officials we interviewed expressed  uncertainty about the extent of any such impact.

To grow in perpetuity, the trust fund must earn a  compounded return rate of 8.6 percent or higher. Both of these rates are  lower than the 9 percent rate the trust fund has earned from its inception  in 1995 through March 2008, however, forecasts of future returns are  subject to considerable uncertainty. The historical rates of return for the  asset classes held in the fund\u2019s portfolio differ depending on the time  period considered. For example, the compounded rate of return was 8.1  percent for 1926-2007, 9.1 percent for 1970-2007, and 5.2 percent for 1998- 2007. If the trust fund continues to earn the 9 percent annual return it has  earned thus far, or any rate equal or greater than 8.6 percent, the trust fund  will likely grow in perpetuity from its balance as of March 2008 (see  attachment VII).", "However, market volatility adds uncertainty regarding the availability of  the trust fund withdrawals. Despite its historical compounded annual  return rate of 9 percent as of March 2008, the trust fund\u2019s annual  investment returns have ranged from 24 percent in 1998 to negative 12  percent in 2002. Future returns to the trust fund portfolio are uncertain.  Even if the trust fund earns a favorable long-run return which could allow  the fund to grow in perpetuity without market volatility, a few consecutive  years of poor stock market performance could lead to the depletion the  fund. Attachment VIII illustrates results from our analysis with the  assumption that future returns are drawn from distributions based on the  historical 1970-2007 return of the asset classes in which Palau\u2019s trust fund  is invested. Our analysis shows that the trust fund will be able to disburse  $15 million per year through 2016 but is increasingly likely to be exhausted  after 2016.", "In addition, inflation will diminish the value of the annual trust fund  withdrawals: because the withdrawals are not adjusted for inflation, they  will lose real value over time.

For example, fewer than 50 percent of active  taxpayers are fully compliant, according to the IMF and ADB; the  government rarely collects assessed penalties and interest or exercises its  authority to suspend or revoke business licenses; and the current system  does not tax nonwage income, such as that from profits, investment, or  property, and taxes businesses on gross, rather than net, earnings.", "Expenditures. Economic experts and government officials suggest that  Palau could lower its operating expenditures, at around $67 million in  2006, by reducing the public sector wage bill.
