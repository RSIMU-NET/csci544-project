These officials stated that since the funding did not go through traditional security assistance programs, the DOD accountability requirements normally applicable to these programs did not apply. Further, MNF-I does not currently have orders that comprehensively specify accountability procedures for equipment distributed to the Iraqi forces. DOD and MNF-I cannot fully account for Iraqi forces' receipt of U.S.-funded equipment. Two factors led to this lapse in accountability. First, MNSTC-I did not maintain a centralized record of all equipment distributed to Iraqi forces before December 2005. At that time, MNSTC-I established a property book system to track issuance of equipment to the Iraqi forces and attempted to recover past records. GAO found a discrepancy of at least 190,000 weapons between data reported by the former MNSTC-I commander and the property books. Former MNSTC-I officials stated that this lapse was due to insufficient staff and the lack of a fully operational distribution network, among other reasons. Second, since the beginning of the program, MNSTC-I has not consistently collected supporting records confirming the dates the equipment was received, the quantities of equipment delivered, or the Iraqi units receiving the items. Since June 2006, the command has placed greater emphasis on collecting the supporting documents. However, GAO's review of the January 2007 property books found continuing problems with missing and incomplete records. Further, the property books consist of extensive electronic spreadsheets, which are an inefficient management tool given the large amount of data and limited personnel to maintain the system."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since 2003, the United States has provided about $19.2 billion to develop  the Iraqi security forces, including at least $2.8 billion to purchase and  transport equipment to Iraqi forces.

DOD does not report IRRF  funds for Iraqi forces\u2019 equipment and transportation as a separate line  item. DOD has requested an additional $2 billion to develop Iraqi security  forces in the fiscal year 2008 Global War on Terror budget requests.", "The United States restructured the multinational force and increased  resources to train and equip the Iraqi forces after they collapsed during an  insurgent uprising in the spring of 2004. This collapse ensued when MNF-I  transferred security responsibilities to the Iraqi forces before they were  properly trained and equipped to battle insurgents. Iraqi security forces  include the Iraqi Army, Navy, and Air Force under the Ministry of Defense  and the Iraqi Police, National Police, and Border Enforcement under the  Ministry of Interior.", "The train-and-equip program for Iraq operates under DOD authority and is  implemented by MNF-I\u2019s major subordinate commands, including MNSTC- I and Multinational Corps-Iraq (MNC-I) (see fig. 1). This differs from  traditional security assistance programs, which operate under State  Department authority and are managed in country by the DOD under the  direction and supervision of the Chief of the U.S. Diplomatic Mission.", "MNSTC-I was established in June 2004 to assist in the development,  organization, training, equipping, and sustainment of Iraqi security forces.

Congress funded the train-and-equip program for Iraq under IRRF  and ISFF but outside traditional security assistance programs, which,  according to DOD officials, allowed DOD a large degree of flexibility in  managing the program. DOD defines accountability as the obligation  imposed by law, lawful order or regulation accepted by an organization or  person for keeping accurate records, to ensure control of property,  documents or funds, with or without physical possession. DOD officials  stated that, since the funding did not go through traditional security  assistance programs, the DOD accountability requirements normally  applicable to these programs\u2014including the registration of small arms  transferred to foreign governments\u2014did not apply. Further, MNF-I does  not currently have an order or orders comprehensively specifying  accountability procedures for equipment distributed to Iraqi military  forces under the Ministry of Defense, according to MNSTC-I officials.", "According to DOD officials, because Iraq train-and-equip program funding  did not go through traditional security assistance programs, the equipment  procured with these funds was not subject to DOD accountability  regulations that normally apply in the case of these programs. For  traditional security assistance programs, DOD regulations specify  accountability procedures for storing, protecting, transporting, and  registering small arms and other sensitive items transferred to foreign  governments. For example, the Security Assistance Management Manual,  which provides guidance for traditional security assistance programs,  states that the U.S. government\u2019s responsibility for equipment intended for  transfer to a foreign government under the Foreign Military Sales program  does not cease until the recipient government\u2019s official representative  assumes final control over the items. Other regulations referenced by the  Security Assistance Management Manual prescribe minimum standards  and criteria for the physical security of sensitive conventional arms and  require the registration of small arms transferred outside DOD control.", "During our review, DOD officials expressed differing opinions about  whether DOD regulations applied to the train-and-equip program for Iraq.  For example, we heard conflicting views on whether MNF-I must follow  the DOD regulation that requires participants to provide small arms serial  numbers to a DOD-maintained registry. Although DOD has not specified  whether this regulation applies, MNSTC-I began to consolidate weapons\u2019  serial numbers in an electronic format in July 2006 and provide them to  the DOD-maintained registry, according to MNSTC-I officials.", "Moreover, MNF-I issued two orders in 2004 to its subordinate commands  directing steps to account for all equipment distributed to Iraqi security  forces, including military and police. Although these orders are no longer  in effect and have not been replaced, they directed coalition forces  responsible for issuing equipment to the Iraqi security forces to record the  serial numbers of all sensitive items such as weapons and radios, enter  relevant information onto a Department of the Army hand receipt, and  obtain signatures from the Iraqi security official receiving the items,  among other tasks. Army regulations state that hand receipts maintain  accountability by documenting the unit or individual that is directly  responsible for a specific item. According to a former MNSTC-I official,  hand receipts are critical to maintaining property accountability. However,  the orders did not require the consolidation of all records for equipment  distributed by the coalition to the Iraqi security forces.", "According to officials in the MNSTC-I Office of the Staff Judge Advocate,  although these orders were valid when they were issued in 2004, they are  no longer in effect. In addition, these orders have not been replaced with a  comprehensive order or orders that address the equipment distributed to  Iraqi security forces, according to MNSTC-I officials. For forces under the  Ministry of Interior, MNF-I issued two new orders in December 2005 to  address the problem of limited records for equipment distributed to  Ministry of Interior forces. Among other guidance, the orders established  accountability procedures for equipment MNC-I and MNSTC-I distribute to  Ministry of Interior forces, such as Iraqi police and national police. In  addition, MNF-I issued other orders related to some types of equipment.  However, according to MNSTC-I officials, MNF-I has not issued an order  or orders that address the accountability of all equipment distributed by  coalition forces to Iraqi military forces under the Ministry of Defense."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "MNF-I Cannot Fully Account for Iraqi Forces\u2019 Receipt of Equipment", "paragraphs": ["Two factors led to DOD\u2019s lack of full accountability for the equipment  issued to Iraqi security forces (see fig. 2). First, until December 2005,  MNSTC-I did not maintain a centralized record of all equipment  distributed to Iraqi security forces. Second, MNSTC-I has not consistently  collected supporting documents that confirm the dates the equipment was  received, the quantities of equipment delivered, or the Iraqi units receiving  the equipment.", "First, until December 2005, no centralized set of records for equipment  distributed to Iraqi security forces existed. MNSTC-I did not consistently  collect equipment distribution records as required in the property  accountability orders for several reasons. The lack of a fully operational  network to distribute the equipment, including national and regional level  distribution centers, hampered MNSTC-I\u2019s ability to collect and maintain  appropriate equipment accountability records. According to former  MNSTC-I officials, a fully operational distribution network was not  established until mid-2005, over 1 year after MNF-I began distributing large  quantities of equipment to the Iraqi security forces. In addition, staffing  weaknesses hindered the development of property accountability  procedures, according to former MNSTC-I and other officials. For  example, according to the former MNSTC-I commander, several months  passed after MNSTC-I\u2019s establishment before the command received the  needed number of staff. As a result, MNSTC-I did not have the personnel  necessary to record information on individual items distributed to Iraqi  forces. Further, according to MNSTC-I officials, the need to rapidly equip  Iraqi forces conducting operations in a combat environment limited  MNSTC-I\u2019s ability to fully implement accountability procedures.", "Our analysis of MNSTC-I\u2019s property book system indicates that MNSTC-I  does not have complete records confirming Iraqi forces\u2019 receipt of the  equipment, particularly for Iraqi military forces. MNSTC-I established  separate property books for equipment issued to Iraq\u2019s security  ministries\u2014the Ministry of Defense and Ministry of Interior\u2014beginning in  late 2005. At that time, they also attempted to recover past records.  MNSTC-I officials acknowledge that the property books did not contain  records for all of the equipment distributed and that existing records were  incomplete or lacked supporting documentation. We identified  discrepancies between data reported by the former MNSTC-I commander  and MNSTC-I property book records (see fig. 3).", "Although the former MNSTC-I commander reported that about 185,000  AK-47 rifles, 170,000 pistols, 215,000 items of body armor, and 140,000  helmets were issued to Iraqi security forces as of September 2005, the  MNSTC-I property books contain records for only about 75,000 AK-47  rifles, 90,000 pistols, 80,000 items of body armor, and 25,000 helmets.  Thus, DOD and MNF-I cannot fully account for about 110,000 AK-47 rifles,  80,000 pistols, 135,000 items of body armor, and 115,000 helmets reported  as issued to Iraqi forces as of September 22, 2005. Our analysis of the  MNSTC-I property book records found that DOD and MNF-I cannot fully  account for at least 190,000 weapons reported as issued to Iraqi forces as  of September 22, 2005.", "The second factor leading to the lapse in accountability is MNSTC-I\u2019s  inability to consistently collect supporting documents that confirm when  the equipment was received, the quantities of equipment delivered, and the  Iraqi units receiving the equipment. We requested and received a sample of  documents confirming equipment received by Iraqi units during specific  weeks in February, April, July, and November 2006. Due to the limited  number of these records, we cannot generalize the information across all  of MNSTC-I records. Our preliminary review of this sample found that in  the period prior to June 2006, MNSTC-I provided only a few supporting  documents confirming that Iraqi units had received the equipment. For the  period after June 2006, we found that MNSTC-I possessed more supporting  documents. According to MNSTC-I officials who rotated in country in June  2006, the command began to place greater emphasis on collecting  documentation of Iraqi receipt of equipment. However, MNSTC-I officials  also stated that security constraints make it difficult for them to travel  within Iraq and collect hard copies of all documentation. They depend  instead on warehouse staff to send the receipts via scanner, fax or  computer.", "Furthermore, the property books consist of extensive electronic  spreadsheets\u2014the January 2007 property book records for the Ministry of  Defense contained 227 columns and 5,342 rows. Staff identify erroneous  entries through periodic manual checks and report errors to the property  book officer, according to MNSTC-I officials. Although MNSTC-I issued a  draft Standard Operating Procedures handbook to help assigned  personnel input data accurately and produce relevant reports, these  procedures require multiple steps and could lead to the unintentional  inclusion of incorrect data in calculations and reports, making them prone  to error. MNSTC-I officials acknowledged they have identified numerous  mistakes due to incorrect manual entries, which required them to find the  original documentation to reverify the data and correct the entries.  MNSTC-I officials also have acknowledged that the spreadsheet system is  an inefficient management tool given the large size of the program, large  amount of data, and limited number of personnel available to maintain the  system. MNSTC-I plans to move the property book records from a  spreadsheet system to a database management system by summer 2007."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Complete and accurate records are an essential component of a property  accountability system for equipment issued to Iraqi security forces.  However, DOD and MNF-I cannot ensure that Iraqi security forces  received the equipment as intended. DOD\u2019s and MNF-I\u2019s lack of clear and  consistent guidance contributed to partial data collection in the field.  Further, insufficient staffing, the lack of a fully developed network to  distribute the equipment, and inadequate technology have hampered  record keeping and data collection. Given DOD\u2019s request for an additional  $2 billion to develop Iraqi security forces, improving accountability  procedures can help ensure that the equipment purchased with these  funds reaches the intended recipients.

Although we could not fully  determine the reliability and accuracy of these data, we determined that  they were sufficiently reliable to make broad comparisons against the  MNSTC-I property books and to assess major discrepancies between the  two reports. In assessing the documents supporting the January 2007  MNSTC-I property books, we were limited by MNSTC-I\u2019s inability to scan  large amounts of these supporting paper documents and provide them to  us electronically.
