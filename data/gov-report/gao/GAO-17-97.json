This report examines (1) the authorities enabling nonfederal sponsors to undertake studies or projects, (2) the extent to which such sponsors have undertaken federal projects and the information the Corps has about them, and (3) the Corps' and sponsors' views on lessons learned from projects. GAO reviewed federal laws and agency guidance; collected information about studies and projects led by nonfederal sponsors from 1986 through 2014 from all 38 Corps districts responsible for civil works; and interviewed Corps officials in 16 districts that have overseen at least one such study or project, as well as 20 nonfederal sponsors that have undertaken projects."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Authorities that allow nonfederal sponsors to undertake federal water resources projects, including feasibility studies and construction projects, have been included in various federal statutes since 1968. Until June 2014, when Congress enacted the Water Resources Reform and Development Act, five federal statutory authorities allowed nonfederal sponsors to undertake studies or construction of federal water resources projects such as flood control projects. The 2014 act amended and consolidated prior statutory provisions authorizing water resources projects.", "The number of federal water resources projects nonfederal sponsors have undertaken and the amounts they have been reimbursed for the federal share of these projects cannot be reliably determined. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) does not track this information at the headquarters level and has delegated the responsibility for tracking and overseeing such projects to the districts. While Corps headquarters collects information from the districts on reimbursements, the information that headquarters provided GAO did not match the information that the districts provided to GAO. For example, the number of reimbursed projects and the amount of reimbursements made to nonfederal sponsors were inconsistent in the two data sets. Corps headquarters officials could not fully explain why differences existed and could not identify any Corps policies or procedures that provide guidance to the districts on the type of information to collect and maintain on projects led by nonfederal sponsors. Federal standards for internal control call for all transactions and other significant events to be clearly documented, and for accurate and timely recording of transactions and events. Without documented guidance for districts regarding recordkeeping for projects led by nonfederal sponsors, the Corps does not have reasonable assurance that districts will consistently record information on such projects and that the information districts provide to headquarters on these projects will be accurate and reliable.", "Corps district officials and nonfederal sponsors GAO interviewed identified several lessons learned from projects undertaken by nonfederal sponsors. For example, officials and nonfederal sponsors frequently cited enhanced partnerships and communication as areas that worked well on projects led by nonfederal sponsors. In contrast, both Corps district officials and nonfederal sponsors cited various challenges in existing Corps guidance. For example, officials noted that Corps guidance does not clearly establish roles and responsibilities for these projects, and nonfederal sponsors said the Corps does not have clear guidance on the project implementation process. The Corps issued implementation guidance for feasibility studies led by nonfederal sponsors in February 2016 in which it clarified that it is generally not authorized to provide assistance to nonfederal sponsors undertaking feasibility studies, except in certain circumstances in which the Corps is permitted to provide limited technical assistance to nonfederal sponsors. The Corps has also developed draft guidance for construction projects led by nonfederal sponsors, which it estimates it will issue later in 2016."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Corps develop guidance for accurate recording of transactions and other relevant information about projects undertaken by nonfederal sponsors.

Located  within the Department of Defense, the Corps has both military and civilian  responsibilities. Through its Civil Works Program, in general, the Corps  plans, designs, constructs, operates, and maintains a wide range of water  resources projects. Congress typically authorizes these projects in water  resources development legislation for various purposes, including  constructing levees for flood risk management, deepening waterways for  navigational purposes, and building structures to control invasive species  for ecosystem restoration.", "The Corps typically becomes involved in water resources projects when a  local community perceives a need or experiences a problem that is  beyond its ability to solve, and a nonfederal sponsor contacts the Corps  for assistance. Nonfederal sponsors can be states, tribes, counties, local  governments or agencies, or nonprofit entities. Generally, water  resources development legislation requires that the Corps and a  nonfederal sponsor share the cost of the project, with the split of financial  responsibilities varying by project purpose. The Corps usually manages  these projects, which typically include a feasibility study\u2014an assessment  of whether a project is worth pursuing and how the problem should be  addressed\u2014as well as construction. In managing projects, the Corps  collaborates with the nonfederal sponsor, providing opportunities for the  nonfederal sponsor to help define the scope of the feasibility study and  contribute to project design to ensure that, to the extent possible, factors  affecting sponsoring communities are addressed during the planning  process.", "Congress authorizes and appropriates funds for the Corps to conduct  projects, but not every authorized project receives appropriations in a  given year. The Corps includes a prioritized list of projects in the  President\u2019s annual budget request because existing project authorizations  exceed the agency\u2019s annual appropriations available for these projects.  As we have previously reported, as of June 2014, the Corps reported a  backlog in its Civil Works Program of more than 1,000 authorized water  resources construction projects that had not received federal funding.  According to the Congressional Research Service, to concentrate limited  resources and move ongoing projects toward completion, Corps budget  requests have focused on funding projects near completion and have  limited new studies and projects. Moreover, as the Corps\u2019 inventory of  infrastructure ages and grows, an increasing share of the agency\u2019s  appropriations is used for operations and maintenance. As a result, in  recent years, funding for civil works construction projects has declined.  For example, annual appropriations for the Corps\u2019 civil works construction  projects, including new starts, have generally decreased from about $2.3  billion in fiscal year 2006 to $1.6 billion in fiscal year 2015.", "When the Corps has been unable to conduct feasibility studies or to  construct authorized water resources projects because of funding  constraints and competing priorities, nonfederal sponsors have at times  initiated the work under existing water resources legislation that allows  nonfederal sponsors to undertake feasibility studies or construction  projects. Under this legislation, when a nonfederal sponsor undertakes  and completes a feasibility study, the sponsor may be eligible for credit  toward its share of the cost of the construction of the project in the  amount equal to the cost of the study had it been undertaken by the  Corps. When a nonfederal sponsor undertakes a construction project or  part of a construction project that has been authorized by Congress, it  can request and may be eligible for credit toward its share of the larger  project or reimbursement for the cost of the federal share of the project,  provided that it meets the requirements and conditions established in the  applicable water resources legislation. In general, the authorities allowing  the Corps to reimburse nonfederal sponsors for construction projects  provide that reimbursement is subject to the enactment of federal  appropriations.", "You asked us to examine water resources projects undertaken by  nonfederal sponsors. This report examines (1) the authorities that enable  nonfederal sponsors to undertake a feasibility study or construct a  congressionally authorized water resources project, (2) the extent to  which nonfederal sponsors have undertaken federal water resources  projects and the information the Corps has about such projects, and (3)  Corps officials\u2019 and nonfederal sponsors\u2019 views on the lessons learned  from these projects.", "To identify authorities that enable nonfederal sponsors to undertake  feasibility studies or construction projects, we reviewed water resources  development legislation enacted from 1968 to June 2014 and interviewed  Corps headquarters officials.

All 38 districts responsible for civil works  responded to our data collection request, and we obtained information on  each of the projects led by nonfederal sponsors (e.g., feasibility studies,  construction of water resources projects, or separable elements of the  projects) that the Corps districts identified through the data collection  instrument. We also compared information we collected from the Corps  districts on reimbursements to nonfederal sponsors with information  provided by Corps headquarters. In addition, we reviewed relevant  agency guidance documents, such as Corps-issued engineer regulations  and partnership agreements between the Corps and nonfederal  sponsors, federal standards for internal control, and leading practices for  collaboration.", "To obtain views on lessons learned, we conducted telephone interviews  with Corps officials in the 16 districts that oversaw at least one feasibility  study or construction project undertaken by a nonfederal sponsor. We  also interviewed 20 of 28 nonfederal sponsors who agreed to participate  in our interviews about each of the projects they undertook and their  views on the process for conducting nonfederal sponsor-led feasibility  studies and construction projects. We conducted a content analysis on  selected questions related to the advantages and disadvantages of  nonfederal sponsor-led projects and lessons learned from the projects.", "In June 2014, Congress enacted the Water Resources Reform and  Development Act of 2014 (WRRDA 2014), which consolidated various  authorities for nonfederal sponsors to undertake such projects, among  other things.

Studies are  authorized through legislation, typically a Water Resources Development  Act (WRDA), or in some circumstances, a resolution by an authorizing  committee. In addition to congressional authorization, the Corps needs  an appropriation to conduct the study.", "Prior to WRRDA 2014, after receiving authorization and an appropriation,  the Corps conducted studies in two phases: reconnaissance and  feasibility. Corps district offices conducted reconnaissance studies at full  federal expense to determine if the problem warranted federal  participation in a feasibility study and how the problem could be  addressed. During the reconnaissance phase, the Corps also assessed  the level of interest and support from nonfederal entities such as state,  tribal, county, or local governments or agencies that might become  sponsors. If the Corps determined that further study was warranted, the  district office sought agreement from the local sponsor to share costs for  a feasibility study. WRRDA 2014 eliminated the reconnaissance phase  to accelerate the study process and allow the Corps to proceed directly to  the feasibility study. The purpose of the feasibility study is to further  investigate the problem and make recommendations on whether a project  is worth pursuing and how the problem should be addressed. Generally,  the cost of the feasibility study is split equally between the Corps and the  nonfederal sponsor. The district office conducts the study and  documents the results in a feasibility study report that includes a total  project cost estimate based on the recommended plan. The Chief of  Engineers reviews the feasibility report and upon deciding to recommend  the project for construction, signs the final decision document\u2014called the  Chief\u2019s Report\u2014and transmits it through the Assistant Secretary of the  Army for Civil Works and the Office of Management and Budget for  review. The Office of Management and Budget recommends to the  President whether to support or change the Corps\u2019 budget request, and  the President\u2019s budget request is transmitted to Congress. Congress may  then authorize the project\u2019s construction in a WRDA or other legislation.", "The purpose of the preconstruction engineering and design phase is to  complete any additional planning studies and all of the detailed technical  studies and designs needed to begin construction. During this time, the  Corps pursues congressional authorization for the project and  construction funding through the annual budget process. Under its budget  formulation process, the Corps prioritizes projects that it determines have  the highest expected returns for the national economy and the  environment, as well as those that reduce risk to human life. When the  Corps receives appropriations, which generally provide funding directly  for individual projects in increments over the course of several years, the  district enters into a cost-sharing agreement with a nonfederal sponsor.  The standard federal and nonfederal cost share percentages for  construction projects can vary by the purpose of the project, as shown in  table 1.", "Typically, the Corps manages the construction process, contracting out  the majority of construction work to private engineering and construction  contractors. Throughout the construction phase, the Corps oversees the  contractors\u2019 work, performing routine inspections to ensure it meets the  Corps\u2019 design and engineering specifications. During construction, the  Corps may request and Congress may enact scope or cost changes.  When construction is complete, the Corps may operate and maintain the  constructed project (e.g., navigation projects), or it may turn over  operation and maintenance to the nonfederal sponsor (e.g., most flood  damage reduction projects)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Process for Feasibility Studies and Construction Projects Led by Nonfederal Sponsors", "paragraphs": ["Alternatively, when a nonfederal sponsor undertakes a feasibility study or  construction project, the sponsor typically manages and funds the total  cost of the feasibility study or construction project and may later seek  reimbursement or credit for the federal share of the work it conducts.  Reimbursement refers to the Corps\u2019 repayment to a nonfederal sponsor  for the federal share of a construction project that the nonfederal sponsor  incurs in undertaking such work. Credit is a noncash offset toward the  local share of a feasibility study or construction project and is an alternate  means for the Corps to compensate a nonfederal sponsor for the federal  share of the costs it incurs when it undertakes such work.", "In the case of feasibility studies, a nonfederal sponsor may independently  undertake the study and submit a study report to the Secretary of the  Army. The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works then forwards  to Congress an assessment of whether the study report and process  complied with applicable federal laws and regulations and any  recommendation the Assistant Secretary has about the project. If  Congress later authorizes the project for construction, the nonfederal  sponsor may be eligible to receive credit for the federal share of the  feasibility study toward the nonfederal share of the construction project  costs.", "When a nonfederal sponsor undertakes construction of an authorized  federal water resources project, or separable element thereof, it first  enters into a partnership agreement with the Corps. The agreements  specify how the Corps and nonfederal sponsor will collaborate, generally  stating their respective roles and responsibilities and the terms and  conditions under which both parties will execute their responsibilities. The  agreements also establish the requirements the nonfederal sponsor must  meet to be eligible for credit or reimbursement for the federal share of the  construction costs. In general, to be eligible for credit or reimbursement,  nonfederal sponsors are required to design and construct the project in  accordance with applicable federal and state laws, regulations, standards,  and policies. In addition, the nonfederal sponsor is responsible for all  public and government agency coordination and for obtaining all  necessary federal and state permits. However, the nonfederal sponsor  can contract with the Corps to undertake these efforts at the nonfederal  sponsor\u2019s expense if such work does not delay the completion of other  Corps projects. Corps headquarters and district officials said that to be  eligible for credit or reimbursement for the federal share of the  construction of a project, nonfederal sponsors must meet the same  requirements that the Corps would adhere to if it led the construction  project, such as meeting the Corps\u2019 engineering and design standards.  The Corps maintains an oversight role, performing inspections of the  project as constructed and validating costs that the sponsor submits for  reimbursement or credit.

We identified five federal statutory authorities that  existed prior to changes enacted in WRRDA 2014 allowing nonfederal  sponsors to undertake a feasibility study or construction of harbors or  navigational improvements, shoreline protection projects, flood control  projects, or generally authorized federal water resources projects (see  table 2). The Corps confirmed that these are the relevant statutes that  allow nonfederal sponsors to undertake federal water resources projects.  In addition to these five broader statutory authorities, Congress may  authorize projects led by nonfederal sponsors in separate, project-specific  legislation. For example, Congress authorized a flood damage reduction  project in the 1993 Defense Appropriations Act.", "In June 2014, Congress enacted WRRDA 2014, which amended or  replaced most of the authorities outlined in table 2 and consolidated them  under two new provisions.

Similar to prior authorities, WRRDA  2014 authorizes nonfederal sponsors to study, design, and construct  water resources projects using their own funding, in accordance with  Corps engineering and design standards. The act also authorizes  nonfederal sponsors to receive credit or reimbursement for nonfederal  funds expended on the federal share of the project upon determination by  the Corps that the completed project adhered to federal law, regulations,  and applicable standards and conditions, such as the Corps\u2019 engineering  standards. A senior Corps headquarters official said that a significant  difference between WRRDA 2014 and previous water resources  development authorization acts is that WRRDA 2014 authorizes  nonfederal sponsors to undertake construction projects that have not yet  been authorized by Congress and to seek reimbursement for those  projects if they are subsequently authorized.

Sixteen of the 38 Corps districts responsible for civil works  projects oversaw these projects, which varied in geographic location and  project type. According to the data Corps districts provided in response to  our request, a majority (21) of the 32 water resources projects undertaken  by nonfederal sponsors were located in California and the states along  the Gulf of Mexico: Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. Other  water resources projects were scattered across the United States. For  instance, Georgia, Illinois, Kansas, Nebraska, Nevada, Oklahoma,  Oregon, and Virginia each had one project led by a nonfederal sponsor,  and Alaska had two projects.", "In addition to geographic variation, nonfederal sponsors undertook  projects for different project purposes and at different phases of the  project, based on responses from Corps district offices.

Subsequently, Corps headquarters officials said  that a possible explanation for the differences in the data the districts  provided to us and the data Corps headquarters collected from the  districts pertained to when headquarters began collecting the information.  Specifically, Corps headquarters officials said that they began collecting  annual reimbursement data from district offices in 2006, when Congress  enacted annual reimbursement limits.

Another nonfederal sponsor said that it completed  the remaining 6 miles of an 8-mile channel improvement project in the  time it took the Corps to complete the first 2 miles, at a cost of  approximately $25 million less than it would have cost if the Corps had  continued to build the project. In addition to cost savings, another  nonfederal sponsor said that it chose to lead a harbor deepening  feasibility study and construction project for its port because it thought it  could complete the work faster than if the Corps led the project. One  nonfederal sponsor explained that expediting project completion is  important because, in the case of flood control projects, a completed  project can help save lives and reduce property damage. For navigation  projects, expedited project completion may result in economic benefits,  such as increased commerce and tourism from deeper-draft ships having  the ability to enter ports that have been deepened, according to one  nonfederal sponsor. In 2013, we reported that, among other factors,  less than optimal federal funding contributes to cost increases on Corps- led projects, which result from the need to break work into smaller  segments and modify contracts to extend completion schedules.  Consistent with those findings and the views of nonfederal sponsors,  officials from 15 of the 16 Corps districts we interviewed discussed the  advantages of nonfederal sponsors\u2019 ability to act sooner and expedite  project timelines, such as that the nonfederal sponsors\u2019 more consistent  funding streams may help mitigate project delays and associated cost  escalations and enable communities to realize the benefits of projects  sooner."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Corps District Officials and Nonfederal Sponsors Identified Concerns about Reimbursement as the Main Disadvantage of Projects Led by Nonfederal Sponsors", "paragraphs": ["Corps district officials and nonfederal sponsors identified nonfederal  sponsors not receiving reimbursement for the federal share of water  resources projects as a primary disadvantage of undertaking such  projects. Specifically, Corps officials in 6 of the 16 districts we interviewed  noted that construction projects may be authorized in legislation but may  not receive appropriated funds, which may result in nonfederal sponsors  not getting reimbursed for projects they undertook. Ten of the 20  nonfederal sponsors we interviewed cited the risk of not being  reimbursed, especially given constrained federal budgets and the Corps\u2019  funding priorities, as a primary disadvantage of and potential deterrent to  undertaking projects. Nonfederal sponsors said they understood that  reimbursement from the Corps is subject to appropriated funds. However,  one nonfederal sponsor said that others have been deterred from  undertaking projects because of reimbursement concerns. That sponsor  also said that it could be difficult in the longer term to maintain a  collaborative partnership with the Corps if the likelihood of reimbursement  remains low.", "Relatedly, one nonfederal sponsor said that in addition to providing full  financial support for the project it undertook, it also spent time and  resources\u2014estimated at nearly $600,000\u2014to obtain its reimbursement  from the Corps. In three other cases, nonfederal sponsors said the Corps  did not conduct its final accounting and reimbursement in a timely  manner, placing additional burdens on nonfederal sponsors. For example,  in two cases, the Corps is conducting in 2016 the financial closeout for  projects that the nonfederal sponsors completed in 2006. One of these  nonfederal sponsors had to incur additional public debt to maintain the  Corps\u2019 escrow requirements while the Corps completed its final  accounting process. In another case, a nonfederal sponsor said it took  the Corps 6 years to reimburse them and 11 years to close out the project  after the nonfederal sponsor completed it. Corps headquarters officials  agreed that taking 10 years to perform the financial closeout for these  projects was a long time. However, the officials said that outstanding  reimbursement claims, contract modifications, and delays in validating  documentation to support nonfederal sponsor credits were some of the  reasons for the protracted time frame."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Corps District Officials and Nonfederal Sponsors Identified Challenges and Opportunities for Improvement", "paragraphs": ["Corps officials and nonfederal sponsors we interviewed identified several  challenges, as well as opportunities for improvement related to guidance  and information sharing. Specifically, both cited challenges with the  agency\u2019s guidance for nonfederal sponsors undertaking feasibility studies  or construction projects related to the clarity of roles and responsibilities,  as well as the project implementation process and necessary  documentation.", "Corps officials from three districts we interviewed said that it was  challenging not to have guidance clearly defining each party\u2019s roles and  responsibilities. Specifically, a district official said that in one case the  district worked with an experienced nonfederal sponsor that paid the  Corps $100,000 for oversight to help ensure that its project would be  eligible for reimbursement. However, the nonfederal sponsor also hired its  own contractors to manage quality control and assurance. The Corps  district official and nonfederal sponsor said this created some tension  between the Corps and nonfederal sponsor regarding what constituted a  reasonable level of oversight for reimbursable projects. The Corps district  official indicated that guidance clarifying roles and responsibilities and  level of oversight may help avoid duplication of efforts and cost. Another  district official stated that guidance on roles and responsibilities, as well  as the range of work products expected\u2014such as cost estimates\u2014may  help ensure a common understanding of expectations from the onset of a  study. The official said that the district worked independently with the  nonfederal sponsor to provide supplemental direction\u2014specifying the  type of reviews required and work products expected\u2014to more clearly  communicate the expectations involved in each step in the Corps\u2019 review  process. In another district, the official said that the nonfederal sponsor  became frustrated with delays in the Corps\u2019 review process and a lack of  clarity regarding who within the Corps was responsible for communicating  decisions to the nonfederal sponsor. According to officials from that  district, the result was that the nonfederal sponsor bypassed them and  communicated directly with the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil  Works for action and information on its project.", "In addition, both Corps district officials and nonfederal sponsors we  interviewed experienced challenges with the Corps\u2019 project  implementation process. Corps district officials from 7 of the 16 districts  we interviewed said that it can be challenging to work with nonfederal  sponsors undertaking water resources projects who have limited  experience partnering with the Corps since they tend to underestimate  what it takes to implement projects. One Corps district official said it can  be \u201cvery painful\u201d and take a lot of effort to help less experienced sponsors  understand the complexities of undertaking water resources projects  because the detailed information they need is not available in guidance  documents. In addition, officials from another district said that it is  challenging to convey to nonfederal sponsors the Corps\u2019 standards and  criteria for reimbursement eligibility.", "Nonfederal sponsors also shared similar views on challenges related to  the Corps\u2019 project implementation process. Eight of the 20 nonfederal  sponsors we interviewed said the Corps does not have clear guidance on  the project implementation process, which in some cases hindered the  nonfederal sponsors\u2019 ability to efficiently implement projects. As one  nonfederal sponsor stated, \u201cthe Corps has no clear-cut guidance for  nonfederal sponsors on how to navigate the process.\u201d The sponsor also  said that often projects were hampered by the Corps\u2019 identification of  requirements after the fact, or as a result of policy changes that occurred  during the process, which affected both project time frames and cost. In  addition, nonfederal sponsors said that the multiple, lengthy reviews  within the Corps\u2014at the district, division, and headquarters levels\u2014 contributed to confusion and delays and added costs during project  implementation. For example, one nonfederal sponsor said it took nearly  a year and a half, after submitting a letter indicating its interest in  undertaking a project, to sign an agreement with the Corps enabling the  sponsor to initiate the project. Two other sponsors noted that the process  of making changes to a project\u2019s design was cumbersome because of the  number and levels of review required before reaching the Chief of  Engineers in Corps headquarters.", "Officials from more than half of the Corps districts we interviewed (10 of  16) said they do not rely on the agency\u2019s guidance when collaborating  with nonfederal sponsors conducting feasibility studies and construction  projects. Instead, these officials indicated that they provide verbal  direction to nonfederal sponsors as needed throughout the feasibility  study or construction project for various reasons, including that the  guidance is outdated, does not clearly establish the roles and  responsibilities related to projects led by nonfederal sponsors, and does  not provide the level of specificity that nonfederal sponsors need. For  example, when we examined the guidance, we found that the Corps\u2019  primary guidance\u2014the Planning Guidance Notebook\u2014has not been  updated to reflect policy and process changes that the Corps has made  since its publication in 2000, such as information related to the Corps\u2019  planning process for feasibility studies. In addition, the guidance does  not delineate the specific roles and responsibilities of the Corps or  nonfederal sponsors for projects led by nonfederal sponsors.", "In February 2016, the Corps issued implementation guidance for  feasibility studies led by nonfederal sponsors under WRRDA 2014. In  this guidance, the Corps clarified that it is generally not authorized to  provide assistance to nonfederal sponsors undertaking feasibility studies,  except in certain circumstances in which the Corps is permitted to provide  limited technical assistance under the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act.

In addition, we identified project-specific  legislation that authorized nonfederal sponsors to undertake specific  water resources projects. We shared our list with Corps headquarters  officials to ensure that we had identified all relevant statutes.", "To determine the extent to which nonfederal sponsors have conducted  federal water resources projects and the information the Corps has on  them, we developed an online data collection instrument. We discussed  the types of information available and terminology with Corps  headquarters, division, and district officials. We used water resources  development legislation from 1986 as the starting point for our data  request because this legislation fundamentally changed the way the  Corps planned and financed federal water resources projects. We  pretested the data collection instrument with one district and made  adjustments to the instrument on the basis of this pretest. We  administered the data collection instrument to all 38 Corps districts  responsible for civil works projects. Using this instrument, we asked each  district to identify feasibility studies or construction projects from the  enactment of the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 that  nonfederal sponsors undertook in their districts under one or more of the  statutory provisions we identified, or under a project-specific  authorization. The data collection period was approximately May to  September 2014. We achieved a 100-percent response rate. Using the  data obtained with the instrument, we totaled the number of projects led  by nonfederal sponsors that were reported by districts. We also produced  descriptive information about these projects, including a summary of  project locations, project purposes, project phases, completion status,  and total estimated project costs using the answers to the following  questions from the online data collection instrument shown in table 3.", "We clarified and confirmed data we obtained through the data collection  instrument through follow-up interviews with Corps district officials. We  also compared information we collected from the Corps districts on  reimbursements to nonfederal sponsors with information provided by  Corps headquarters on reimbursements to nonfederal sponsors. Through  this process, we identified a number of discrepancies between the  reimbursement information on projects led by nonfederal sponsors  reported to us by Corps districts and the information provided by Corps  headquarters. We interviewed Corps headquarters officials to understand  the potential reasons for the discrepancies and asked them to reconcile  the differences. They added 13 projects to the list we collected directly  from the districts and modified some of the reimbursement amounts, but  they did not provide satisfactory explanations for all of the changes.  Therefore, the reimbursement data are reliable for reporting an estimated  aggregate reimbursement amount to give a sense of magnitude, but they  may not be accurate at the individual project level, as discussed in the  report. We also reviewed relevant agency guidance documents, such as  Corps-issued engineer regulations and policy documents that provide  implementation guidance, as well as partnership agreements between the  Corps and nonfederal sponsors, federal standards for internal control,  and leading practices for collaboration.", "To obtain views on lessons learned from projects led by nonfederal  sponsors, we conducted semistructured telephone interviews with Corps  officials from 16 districts that reported overseeing at least one feasibility  study or construction project undertaken by a nonfederal sponsor. We  conducted similar semistructured telephone interviews with several of the  nonfederal sponsors that undertook feasibility studies or construction  projects to get their perspectives on the lessons learned from these  projects. Specifically, we interviewed 20 of the 28 sponsors undertaking  32 projects. The remaining nonfederal sponsors either did not respond to  our request for an interview or did not have a representative with direct  knowledge of the project with whom we could speak. We analyzed the  information from the interviews we conducted with district officials and  nonfederal sponsors qualitatively, including conducting a content analysis  on selected questions related to the advantages and disadvantages of  projects led by nonfederal sponsors and lessons learned from these  projects.
