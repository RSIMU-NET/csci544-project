For these beneficiaries, Medicaid expenditures accounted for nearly two-thirds of overall spending. Also, states with high Medicaid spending often had lower Medicare spending but nearly always had greater overall spending for these beneficiaries. Furthermore, service use and health status often differed widely between high-Medicare-expenditure and high-Medicaid-expenditure disabled dual-eligible beneficiaries. Those with high Medicare expenditures were considerably more likely than those with high Medicaid expenditures to have multiple health conditions and use inpatient services but far less likely to use long-term services and supports.", "Dual-eligible special needs plans (D-SNP)\u2014Medicare Advantage (MA) private plans designed to target the needs of dual-eligible beneficiaries\u2014that fully integrated Medicare and Medicaid benefits often met criteria for high quality but had limited experience serving disabled dual-eligible beneficiaries or demonstrating Medicare savings. D-SNPs that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)\u2014the agency that administers Medicare and oversees Medicaid\u2014designated as Fully Integrated Dual-Eligible (FIDE) SNPs were far more likely to meet high quality criteria compared with other D-SNPs. However, relatively few FIDE-SNPs with high quality served disabled dual-eligible beneficiaries or reported lower costs for Medicare services than expected Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) spending in the same areas. Additionally, FIDE-SNPs that demonstrated the potential for Medicare savings often operated in service areas where D-SNPs with less integration of Medicaid benefits demonstrated more potential for Medicare savings (i.e., lower relative costs for Medicare services).", "Moderately better health outcomes for disabled dual-eligible beneficiaries in D-SNPs relative to those in traditional MA plans did not translate into lower levels of costly Medicare services (that is, inpatient stays, readmissions, and emergency room visits). These results were also similar whether dual-eligible beneficiaries were at risk for high Medicare spending (those with six or more chronic health conditions), aged (those age 65 and over), or aged and enrolled in FIDE-SNPs.", "These results suggest that CMS's expectations regarding the extent to which integration of benefits will produce savings through lower use of costly Medicare services may be optimistic. While operating specialized plans and integrating benefits could lead to improved care, GAO's results suggest that these conditions may not reduce dual-eligible beneficiaries' Medicare spending compared with Medicare spending in settings without integrated benefits.", "CMS reviewed a draft of the report and provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Dual-eligible beneficiaries\u2014those qualifying for both Medicare and  Medicaid benefits\u2014accounted for under one-fifth of each program\u2019s  population but over one-third of each program\u2019s spending in 2009. Dual- eligible beneficiaries are often in poorer health and require more care  compared with other Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. In 2009,  nearly 4 million dual-eligible beneficiaries (40 percent) were under age 65  and qualified for Medicare because they were disabled. Compared with  aged (65 and over) dual-eligible beneficiaries, disabled dual-eligible  beneficiaries have a higher incidence of mental illness and are less likely  to live in an institution. In 2009, the Medicare and Medicaid programs  spent an estimated $103 billion combined on all disabled dual-eligible  beneficiaries.", "Dual-eligible beneficiaries typically receive their Medicare and Medicaid  benefits through each program separately. For Medicare benefits,  beneficiaries may opt to enroll in Medicare\u2019s traditional fee-for-service  (FFS) program or in a private Medicare Advantage (MA) plan (Medicare  Part C), which is administered by a Managed Care Organization (MCO),  under contract with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS),  the agency in the Department of Health and Human Services that  administers the Medicare program and oversees state Medicaid  programs. In addition, dual-eligible beneficiaries may choose a type of  MA plan called a dual-eligible special needs plan (D-SNP), which is  designed to target the needs of this population. For Medicaid benefits,  beneficiaries generally enroll in their state\u2019s Medicaid FFS program or a  Medicaid managed care plan administered by an MCO under contract  with the state.", "Because the Medicare and Medicaid programs are separately responsible  for covering certain services for dual-eligible beneficiaries, there may not  be an incentive for one program to help control costs in the other  program. For example, CMS and others have noted that because state  Medicaid programs do not pay for most of the costs of acute  hospitalizations for dual-eligible beneficiaries, there is little incentive for states to ensure that nursing facilities provide a level of care that will  avoid unnecessary hospitalizations. In contrast, an incentive may exist for  providers to shift beneficiaries from one type of service to another to  increase their payments. For example, nursing facilities can benefit  financially if their residents are hospitalized for 3 days or more and then  returned because nursing facility care, which is typically reimbursed by  Medicaid, generally is reimbursed at a higher rate by Medicare for a  limited period of time following a hospital stay. These types of program  misalignments can result in unnecessary hospitalizations, which can  reduce quality of care and increase Medicare costs.", "Recently, Congress and CMS have placed greater emphasis on the  coordination and integration of Medicare and Medicaid benefits for dual- eligible beneficiaries. For example, the Medicare Improvements for  Patients and Providers Act of 2008 required D-SNPs to contract with state  Medicaid agencies to provide Medicaid benefits. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) established a type of  D-SNP, referred to as a Fully Integrated Dual Eligible (FIDE) SNP,  which\u2014unlike other D-SNPs\u2014is designed to integrate program benefits  for dual-eligible beneficiaries through a single managed care  organization, although payment is generally provided separately by each   In addition, highly integrated D-SNPs\u2014including FIDE-SNPs\u2014 program.that meet certain performance and quality-based standards may seek  CMS approval to offer benefits beyond what other MA plans may offer if  such benefits would help bridge the gap between Medicare and Medicaid  covered services.", "Only about one-third of the 2012 contracts contained any provisions for benefit  integration, and only about one-fifth provided for active care coordination between   D-SNPs and Medicaid agencies, which indicates that most care coordination was done  exclusively by D-SNPs, without any involvement of state Medicaid agencies. See GAO,  Medicare Special Needs Plans: CMS Should Improve Information Available about Dual- Eligible Plans\u2019 Performance, GAO-12-864 (Washington, D.C.: Sept. 13, 2012). offices, awarded contracts of up to $1 million to 15 states to design new  models of care that integrate the two programs\u2019 benefits. Later in 2011,  CMS announced a financial alignment demonstration that is intended to  further integrate the programs\u2019 services. CMS expects that the  demonstration will decrease incentives for cost shifting and increase care  coordination, resulting in improved care for beneficiaries and savings to  Medicare and Medicaid.", "You asked us to examine the characteristics, spending, and service use  of disabled dual-eligible beneficiaries to help provide insights for  potentially increasing quality while reducing Medicare and Medicaid  spending.

We excluded from  our analysis disabled dual-eligible beneficiaries who were not eligible for  full Medicaid benefits; were under age 21; qualified for Medicare due to  end-stage renal disease (ESRD); lived outside the 50 United States and  Washington, D.C.; did not have full Medicare coverage (Parts A and B)  for all eligible months; or were enrolled in MA for any part of the year. We  also excluded individuals who lived in Maine or Arizona because we did  not have complete data for these states. We defined high-expenditure  beneficiaries as those in the top quintile (top 20 percent) of total program  spending in their state. We used spending by state because of the  variation in states\u2019 Medicaid benefits. We analyzed MMLEADS and 2009  Medicare Master Beneficiary Summary File (MBSF) data to examine the  distribution of Medicare and Medicaid spending for high-expenditure  beneficiaries compared with other beneficiaries. We examined the  distribution of Medicare spending for all covered services (e.g., inpatient  hospital stays, outpatient hospital services, physician and other related  services, prescription drugs, post-acute care, and durable medical  equipment) and the distribution of Medicaid spending for users of different  types of long-term services and supports (LTSS) (e.g., services provided  in nursing facilities, intermediate care facilities, or in the community). We  also analyzed the patterns of program spending across states for high- expenditure beneficiaries.", "To examine service use and health status of high-Medicare-expenditure  and high-Medicaid-expenditure disabled dual-eligible beneficiaries, we  used 2009 data from MMLEADS and Medicare carrier claims to  determine the proportion of high-expenditure beneficiaries in each  program who used certain services. We excluded from this analysis the same beneficiaries we excluded from our analysis of spending patterns.  For Medicaid services, we focused on the use of different types of LTSS.  For Medicare services, we focused on the use of three costly acute  services\u2014inpatient stays, readmissions, and emergency room visits\u2014and  two other categories of services\u2014primary care and mental health. We  also determined the proportion of high-expenditure beneficiaries in each  program who had chronic and mental health conditions (as defined by  CMS\u2019s Chronic Conditions Data Warehouse).", "To calculate D-SNPs\u2019 performance on quality, we used quantile normalization to  compare plan performance against 13 measures related to either effectiveness of care or  readmissions in the SNP Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS)  Public Use Files for performance in 2012\u2014the most recent data available. Each of the  measures contained data for at least 75 percent of the D-SNPs in the Public Use Files.  We calculated a quality score by using the weighted average performance of D-SNPs that  reported data for all 13 measures (74 percent of D-SNPs with any data for these  measures). We weighted measures according to CMS\u2019s star rating methodology, which  recognizes 3 of the 13 measures as outcome-based and assigns those measures a  weight of 3 to signify relative importance. All D-SNPs categorized as high quality  performed better than the national average on at least 2 of the 3 outcome measures and  the majority of any measures for which the D-SNP reported data. We ensured these   D-SNPs were not in a contract under sanction by CMS. Our high-quality threshold aligned  similarly with performance of 4 stars and above in CMS\u2019s star ratings. The lowest  performing D-SNP in a one-plan contract that received at least 4 stars on CMS\u2019s 2014  Part C and overall ratings (which are mainly based on performance during 2012) received  a quality score at the 82nd percentile. Furthermore, among D-SNPs in contracts with a  star rating, 31 of the 35 D-SNPs that met our criteria for high quality also received an  overall rating of 4 stars or higher. None of the D-SNPs that met our criteria for high quality  received a rating below 3.5 stars. had at least 2 years of experience in serving this population. We  analyzed the 2013 contract year risk-adjusted bids of D-SNPs relative to  the expected Medicare FFS spending for those services in the same  service area. We used each plan\u2019s projected county enrollments and  CMS\u2019s projected county-level risk-adjusted FFS spending to compute a  weighted average of FFS spending in its service area. We compared  high-quality FIDE-SNPs that bid below or close to Medicare FFS  spending with D-SNPs that projected at least 95 percent of their  enrollment in the same service area. Because CMS approves benefits  flexibility for D-SNPs that meet standards for integration and quality, we  also separately examined the quality and relative bids of D-SNPs that  were approved for benefits flexibility in 2013. For additional context, we  used the quality and bids relative to Medicare FFS spending of highly  integrated D-SNPs that CMS approved for flexible benefits to help guide a  selection of four FIDE-SNPs with high quality of care and four other highly  integrated D-SNPs to interview about their models of care.", "To examine D-SNPs\u2019 and traditional MA plans\u2019 performance for disabled  dual-eligible beneficiaries on quality and resource use measures, we  analyzed data from the 2011 MBSF and 2011 Healthcare Effectiveness  Data and Information Set (HEDIS) Patient Level Files. Specifically, we  evaluated performance on 23 process measures and 7 health outcome  measures, as well as resource use measures for three costly acute  Medicare-covered services: inpatient stays, readmissions, and  emergency room visits.

Whether CMS and  participating states will be able to improve quality without increasing  overall program spending for disabled dual-eligible beneficiaries is  uncertain.", "While increasing the use of community-based LTSS may improve the  quality of care for disabled dual-eligible beneficiaries who utilize those  services, community-based LTSS users drove high combined  program spending for disabled dual-eligible beneficiaries. Likewise,  states with the highest per capita Medicaid spending for disabled  dual-eligible beneficiaries were usually among the states with the  highest overall program spending. In addition, the wide differences in  health characteristics between disabled dual-eligible beneficiaries with  the highest Medicare spending and those with the highest Medicaid  spending may indicate the potential challenge of providing additional  services without disproportionately impacting the costs of each  program. Although most disabled dual-eligible beneficiaries with the  highest Medicaid spending used community-based LTSS to assist  them with activities of daily living, these beneficiaries generally did not  have the numerous chronic conditions associated with those who had  the highest Medicare spending.", "Furthermore, if the models of care in the financial alignment  demonstrations or other integrated models build on fully integrated   D-SNP models, these efforts may improve the care provided to dual- eligible beneficiaries but may not produce significant Medicare  savings for dual-eligible beneficiaries. D-SNPs that fully integrated  Medicare and Medicaid benefits were far more likely than other   D-SNPs to meet criteria for high quality but usually operated under  fully integrated state programs that excluded disabled dual-eligible  beneficiaries from enrollment. Regardless of whether they served  disabled beneficiaries, high quality fully integrated D-SNPs did not  usually demonstrate the potential for Medicare savings. In addition,  many fully integrated D-SNPs that demonstrated the potential for  Medicare savings operated in service areas where D-SNPs with less  integration of benefits demonstrated more potential for Medicare  savings.", "Our findings also suggest that even if there is moderate improvement in  the performance of health outcome measures, and if dual-eligible  beneficiaries are enrolled in plans specifically designed for them, instead  of enrolled in traditional MA plans, these conditions are not necessarily  sufficient to reduce disabled dual-eligible beneficiaries\u2019 use of costly  Medicare services. Despite moderately better performance on health  outcome measures for both disabled and aged dual-eligible beneficiaries,  the fact that D-SNPs had similar levels of costly Medicare-covered  services (i.e., inpatient admissions, readmissions, and emergency room  visits) as traditional MA plans for this population has significant  implications for program costs.
