As part of the study, FRA plans to analyze train-handling and braking capabilities under varying conditions. FRA officials said they plan to share their research results with relevant stakeholders; however, FRA currently has no documented strategy for sharing the results of its research. FRA officials are also analyzing which parts of the country are reporting frequently blocked crossings. However, FRA officials said they do not plan to use information from either of these efforts to determine whether longer freight trains might contribute to increases in blocked crossings, and the officials believe the issues are unrelated.

As data on train-length in feet  are not publicly available, we requested information from these railroads.  Five of the seven railroads provided data on average train-length in feet  over time; however, only two railroads provided data for a period of at  least 10 years.

These data are the only publicly available  data on the number of railcars per train, and there are limitations to how  the data can be used. For example, the average number of railcars per  train cannot be used to precisely estimate train-length in feet due to  variations in cars\u2019 lengths.

A typical train consists of a locomotive\u2014the power and control unit  where the train operator sits at the front of the train\u2014followed by  connected railcars. The lead locomotive pulls the train and provides  control for other functions, including braking. Freight trains carry a variety  of freight using different types of railcars that vary in capacity, length, and  weight. When assembling a train, railroads consider a variety of factors\u2014 such as each car\u2019s weight, length, freight, and whether it is loaded or  empty\u2014when determining its position in the train. Train make up is also  dependent on external conditions, such as variations in terrain and  weather conditions. Railroads can place radio-controlled locomotives,  called distributed power (DP) units, throughout trains to spread out pulling  and pushing power, which we discuss in more detail below.", "Proper train makeup is critical for ensuring a train is able to effectively  negotiate track and prevent derailment, according to FRA. Improperly  assembled trains are more susceptible to derailment, in part because of  vertical, longitudinal, and lateral forces throughout the train\u2014also known  as \u201cin-train\u201d forces\u2014that can affect the stability of a train on its tracks,  depending on a variety of factors, including the train\u2019s speed and terrain.  For example, excessive \u201cin-train\u201d forces can cause a long, heavy train to  pull apart or climb off the track upon a change of grade (e.g., going up or  down hills) or when the train enters a curve.  \u201cUnit trains\u201d\u2014which carry a single commodity, such as coal or oil, to one  destination\u2014experience in-train forces that are easier for railroads to  model and engineers to predict because the railcars are generally uniform  in size and weight. In comparison, determining train makeup is more  complex in mixed freight trains, which can experience more unpredictable  in-train forces resulting from railcars of different weights, lengths, and  freight (e.g., bulk goods such as grain and coal, consumer goods such as  automobiles, or hazardous materials). For example, if a train is  assembled in a manner in which empty railcars alternate with loaded,  heavy railcars, braking can create compression at the couplers and cause  \u201cbuckling\u201d\u2014when an empty train car is compressed between heavier  railcars and derails from the train tracks."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Braking and Distributed Power", "paragraphs": ["Freight trains in the United States utilize air-braking systems to control  speed and stop. A conventional air-braking system is controlled by an air  pressure signal from the leading locomotive, which sends a signal  through the train to engage brakes. Because each railcar receives this  signal sequentially, it takes multiple seconds for railcars at the end of the  train to receive the air pressure signal and begin braking, depending on  the train\u2019s length. The application of air brakes generates in-train forces,  as railcars at the front of the train that have applied brakes will be pushed  by railcars further back that have not yet received the air signal.", "Other technologies, including two-way end-of-train devices and DP, are  frequently used by U.S. railroads in conjunction with conventional brakes  to provide improved braking performance or other benefits. End-of-train  devices measure brake pressure and transmit this information via radio  signal to the front of the train. An end-of train-device can also engage air  brakes at the rear end of a train in an emergency to decrease the time  required to apply the brakes on all cars. As previously mentioned,  railroads can also place radio-controlled locomotives, called DP units,  throughout trains to spread out pulling and pushing power and improve  braking. For example, engineers can engage a DP locomotive\u2019s air  brakes at the same time as a leading locomotive to decrease the time  needed to activate brakes throughout the train. (See fig. 2.) Engineers  can also use a locomotive\u2019s dynamic brake system, which uses traction  generated by the engine, to slow a train.", "While most railroads employ conventional brakes, railroads can also  employ electronically controlled pneumatic brakes\u2014which provide an  electronic brake signal instantaneously throughout a train\u2014allowing  railcars to brake faster than with conventional air brakes.

Railroads  are required to conduct annual performance evaluations of engineers to  ensure that they can safely operate trains according to federal railroad  safety requirements. Representatives of Class I railroads told us they  train their crews on trains and simulators with various routes, scenarios,  and train lengths.

In  2014, we found that trends in freight flows, if they continue as expected,  may exacerbate congestion issues in communities, particularly along  certain corridors. FRA officials told us that complaints about blocked  highway-rail grade crossings have increased in recent years. They noted  that blocked crossings are a local concern and it is not clear the extent to  which longer freight trains are contributing to increases in reporting about  such blockages. According to FRA, trains sometimes block crossings for  a limited time or for hours if an accident or mechanical problem occurs.  They noted that such blockages can be created by trains of any length  and that in their experience, railroads prioritize movement of longer trains,  making it less likely that such trains would be responsible for prolonged  blockages of crossings. Furthermore, officials from FRA and Class I  railroads and others we spoke with pointed out that longer trains may  decrease the frequency of blocked crossings, as railroads may run fewer  trains.", "In contrast, officials from the National League of Cities, as well as state  and local officials we spoke with, expressed concerns over increased  frequency of longer trains and their impact on grade crossing safety.  Although they also acknowledged that trains of any length can block  grade crossings, they raised concerns that longer trains prolong the  duration of a blockage and can block more crossings concurrently,  making it harder for vehicles to find an alternate route around the train.  Consequently, these stakeholders are concerned that longer trains create  increased delays for emergency responders and increase the likelihood of  unsafe behavior among motorists and pedestrians, as outlined below.", "Delayed emergency response. According to national, state, and local  officials we interviewed, longer trains pose concerns about the  potential for emergency response delays if responders encounter a  train blocking one or more crossings and cannot quickly find an  alternate route around it. (See fig. 3.) For example, officials in Mount  Victory, Ohio, reported that 22 freight trains travel through their town  daily, including a 16,000-feet train, which is nearly 3 miles long. This  train blocks 4-to-5 grade crossings concurrently, which increases the  time to access parts of the town, according to local officials. Our prior  work has found that blocked highway-railroad grade crossings can  have significant impacts on emergency response time and  outcomes. For example, we reported an instance of a fire that  destroyed a house while train traffic blocked the only two crossings in  the town and prevented fire crews from responding in time. In another  example, a local official in Texas said that one Class I railroad  assembles trains and conducts brake checks on the main line tracks  because the trains are too long to fit into sidings and railyards.  Executing such procedures on mainline track has blocked grade  crossings for up to several hours and poses safety challenges for  surrounding communities, according to this local official. As a result of  situations like these, communities are looking for ways to mitigate  delays in emergency services when emergency vehicles must find  ways around blocked grade crossings. For instance, some local  officials in Washington and Ohio said they have revised their  emergency response plans to avoid grade crossings that are likely to  be blocked.", "Motorist and pedestrian behavior. Stakeholders we spoke with  expressed concerns that longer trains may increase the likelihood of  unsafe behavior among motorists and pedestrians. For example,  fatalities can occur when motorists or pedestrians engage in risky  behavior such as trying to make it across the tracks before an  approaching train reaches the crossing. Moreover, pedestrians have  been known to crawl over, through, or under stopped trains (see fig.  4). For example, local officials in Ohio and Texas told us that they  have witnessed children crawling through stopped trains to get to  school. Research sponsored by FRA has identified driver behavior as  the main cause of highway-rail grade crossing collisions, but other  factors such as train and traffic volume can contribute to the risk of a  crash occurring.", "Although there are no current federal regulations that directly address  blocked crossings or limit the amount of time trains can block grade  crossings, some states and localities have attempted to address this  issue. For example, some states and localities have passed laws  limiting the duration of blocked crossings and proposed fines for  railroads, but state and local officials and other stakeholders we spoke  with said that federal law preempts such efforts. Other states and local  communities have attempted to address blocked crossings through  studies and communication with federal agencies and railroads, with  mixed success. For example, the Texas Department of Transportation  has undertaken mobility studies for the towns of El Paso and Laredo to  identify options to address blocked crossings, such as constructing  bridges or underpasses. According to officials with the Texas Department  of Transportation, these studies identified alternatives that may help  alleviate some of the vehicular/rail conflicts if they were implemented;  however, the implementation of alternatives for any potential projects are  constrained by the availability of funds. In other examples, local officials  from Ohio and Illinois told us they have contacted Class I railroads and  FRA to find solutions when idle trains lead to blocked crossings,  especially when emergency access is a concern but continue to face  challenges. Class I railroads and FRA officials said they work with local  communities to find solutions to these issues.", "Additionally, state and local officials noted that they do not have access to  information on the length of trains that travel through their communities.  Some added that freight railroads are not required to provide such data  and that local efforts to gather this information, such as through  videotaping train movements and analyzing data, are costly. This  circumstance makes it challenging for state and local officials to assess  the extent to which longer trains may or may not be contributing to  blocked crossings."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FRA Is Studying Operational Risks of Longer Trains but Lacks a Strategy for Sharing Research Results and Is Not Fully Assessing Community Risks", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FRA Is Studying Operational Risks of Longer Freight Trains", "paragraphs": ["In the fall of 2017, FRA began a study to understand operational risks of  long freight trains. The study is examining issues related to train  makeup and handling, including the use of DP locomotives, crew training  and fatigue, and braking performance for longer trains. The study intends  to identify strategies to reduce any risks identified. According to FRA, as  the railroad industry has increased the length of freight trains, past  accepted practices for train makeup and handling may not be appropriate  for longer trains. For example, according to FRA, the current performance  standard for air brakes was last updated in 1947 and based on tests for  trains with up to 150 cars. FRA officials stated the study will conduct air  brake tests to evaluate brake performance for trains with 150-to-250  railcars and use this data to conduct computer simulations of trains in a  variety of configurations\u2014for example, with and without DP and with DP  locomotives at different locations throughout a train\u2014to evaluate in-train  forces. According to FRA officials, this information will help FRA  determine whether rail safety issues exist for trains with over 150 railcars  and if regulatory actions are necessary.", "The study employs a two-phase approach that includes data analysis,  literature review, computer simulations, and brake testing. FRA officials  said the agency plans to complete the first phase of its study and issue a  report by the end of 2020 and issue a report on the second phase by the  end of 2021. Table 1, below, outlines specific tasks of the study by phase.", "As we previously mentioned, FRA provides oversight of railroad safety  through a variety of activities to ensure compliance with regulations, such  as conducting inspections of railroad operations and reviewing and  approving new and materially modified railroad crew training programs.  According to FRA officials, these activities address safety for all freight  trains, including longer trains. In addition to these activities, FRA plans to  begin new, more in-depth audits of Class I railroads\u2019 training programs on  a systematic basis in 2019 to determine whether engineers are being  adequately trained to operate longer trains and perform other types of  demanding service. According to FRA, these audits will determine  whether locomotive engineer certification programs are in compliance  with federal rail safety regulations. For example, federal regulations  require that railroads provide training to their engineers\u2014through  classroom lessons and in trains or simulators\u2014on the most demanding  type of service they may be called upon to perform. According to FRA  officials, this would include operation of longer freight trains in challenging  terrain. FRA plans to audit the training programs of three Class I railroads  by the end of 2019, selected based upon safety risk factors, with  additional audits of other railroads planned for the following year.

According to FRA officials, after internal review and approval, the agency  routinely shares its research results at conferences and on its website.  However, FRA\u2019s strategic plan for research and development, which  outlined how the agency shares research results and engages with  internal and external stakeholders in support of FRA\u2019s rail safety mission,  expired in 2017. More specifically, this plan outlined key internal and  external stakeholders and their roles\u2014including labor and industry  partners\u2014and specific outreach strategies, such as holding periodic,  public events to present FRA\u2019s research and development. This plan also  stated that FRA\u2019s research provides the scientific and technological basis  for its rulemaking and regulation enforcement and that effectively sharing the results of its studies increases the likelihood that its research will have  \u201creal world\u201d impacts. According to FRA officials, the agency is currently  updating its strategic plan for research and development, which will  outline FRA\u2019s goals and objectives for its research, and expects to finalize  the plan by the summer of 2019.

Further, our work on best practices for strategic planning has found that  formulating specific strategies and linking them with goals and objectives  is critical for agencies to achieve these goals and objectives.

Safety at grade crossings has been a longstanding issue in the  United States, and according to stakeholders we spoke with, some of  these issues may be exacerbated by longer trains. In 2006, as part of its  report on the impacts of blocked grade crossings on emergency response  services, FRA stated that future growth in rail and highway traffic will  likely increase blocked crossings, and more recently FRA officials stated  that this is still the case. In addition, while collisions at grade crossings  have declined over time, FRA also expects the risk of grade-crossing  incidents to grow as both rail and highway traffic increase during the next  decade. However, FRA officials also stated that there is no evidence that  more blocked crossings results in more grade-crossing incidents. Further,  according to FRA, the agency is not in a position to address community- specific public safety issues. We have previously reported that the  amount of time that grade crossings are blocked depends on a number of  factors and is typically a function of the number, speed, and length of  trains.", "Although there are no federal regulations directly addressing blocked  grade crossings, to gauge the extent of reported instances of blocked  crossings, in early 2018, FRA began to track data on the location of  blocked-crossing complaints from state rail-safety managers in nine  states.

However, FRA  officials said they do not plan to explore any potential impacts of longer  trains on grade crossings in communities, as FRA officials have stated  they do not believe that longer trains are having an impact on blocked  crossings. For example, FRA does not plan to use any of the information  gathered in its longer train study\u2014which will include a sampling of the  routes longer trains travel\u2014to inform the agency\u2019s work on blocked  crossings because FRA officials stated that they do not expect the study  will yield relevant information.
