The act also directs GAO to review each annual report. In response, GAO assessed the actions taken by DOD to comply with requirements of the act. To do so, GAO leveraged its recent reports on various aspects of the department's modernization management controls, and it reviewed, for example, the latest version of its business enterprise architecture and the associated transition plan and architecture federation strategy.

Notwithstanding this progress, aspects of these requirements and relevant guidance have yet to be fully satisfied. In particular, the military departments, under DOD's \"federated\" and \"tiered\" approach to establishing institutional modernization management controls, have lagged well behind DOD's corporate efforts, and the corporate efforts are still not yet where they need to be. For example, the latest version of DOD's corporate business enterprise architecture continues to add content needed to improve its completeness, consistency, understandability, and usability. Moreover, its latest architecture federation strategy is more detailed and explicit than the prior version. However, the corporate architecture is still missing important content, such as business rules for, and information flows among, certain business activities. Moreover, the architecture has yet to be federated. Specifically, the military departments, which are the largest members of the federation, do not yet have mature enterprise architecture programs, and the federation strategy aimed at accomplishing this is still evolving. GAO has existing recommendations to address these and other architecture issues. The updated enterprise transition plan, which provides a temporal investment roadmap for transitioning from the current architectural environment to the target environment, continues to identify systems and initiatives that are to fill business capability gaps and address the DOD-wide and component business priorities that are contained in the business enterprise architecture. However, the plan still does not include investments for all components and does not reflect key factors associated with properly sequencing planned investments, such as dependencies among investments and the capability to execute the plan. Furthermore, the military departments, which are the largest members of the business federation, have yet to fully develop their own architecturally-based transition plans. GAO has existing recommendations to address these and other transition plan issues. DOD and the military departments have yet to fully establish key investment review structures and have yet to define related policies and procedures for effectively performing both project-level and portfolio-based investment management. GAO has existing recommendations to address these and other investment issues. Until DOD fully implements GAO's existing recommendations relative to the act and related guidance, its business systems modernization will likely remain a high-risk program."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["For decades, the Department of Defense (DOD) has been challenged in  modernizing its timeworn business systems. In 1995, we designated DOD\u2019s  business systems modernization program as high risk, and we continue to  designate it as such today. As our research on public and private sector  organizations shows, two essential ingredients to a successful systems  modernization program are having a well-defined enterprise architecture  and an effective institutional approach to managing information  technology (IT) investments.", "Accordingly, we made recommendations to the Secretary of Defense in  May 2001 that included the means for effectively developing an enterprise  architecture and establishing a corporate, architecture-centric approach to  investment control and decision making. Between 2001 and 2005, we  reported that the department\u2019s business systems modernization program  continued to lack both of these, concluding in 2005 that hundreds of  millions of dollars had been spent on a business enterprise architecture  (BEA) and investment management structures that had limited value.  Accordingly, we made more explicit architecture and investment  management-related recommendations.", "To further assist DOD in addressing these modernization management  challenges, Congress included provisions in the Ronald W. Reagan  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005  that were  consistent with our recommendations. More specifically, the act required  the department to, among other things, (1) develop a BEA, (2) develop a  transition plan to implement the architecture, (3) identify systems  information in its annual budget submission, (4) establish a system  investment approval and accountability structure, (5) establish an  investment review process, and (6) certify and approve any system  modernizations costing in excess of $1 million. The act further requires  that the Secretary of Defense submit an annual report to congressional  defense committees on DOD\u2019s compliance with certain requirements of  the act not later than March 15 of each year from 2005 through 2009.  Additionally, the act directs us to submit to these congressional  committees\u2014within 60 days of DOD\u2019s report submission\u2014an assessment  of DOD\u2019s actions to comply with these requirements.", "As agreed with your offices, the objective of our review was to assess the  actions taken by DOD to comply with requirements of section 2222 of Title  10, U.S. Code. To accomplish this, we used our prior annual report under  the act as a baseline, analyzing whether the department had taken actions  to comply with those provisions of the act, related guidance, and our prior  recommendations that we had previously identified as not yet addressed.  In doing this, we also relied on the results of relevant reports that we have  issued since our prior annual report. We conducted this performance  audit at DOD headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, from March to May 2008,  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

For fiscal year 2008,  the department has received discretionary budget authority for about $546  billion and reports total obligations of about $492 billion to support  ongoing operations and activities related to the Global War on Terrorism.  Organizationally, the department includes the Office of the Secretary of  Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the military  departments, numerous defense agencies and field activities, and various  unified combatant commands that are either responsible for specific  geographic regions or specific functions.

Moreover, the department  recently reported that this systems environment is comprised of  approximately 3,000 separate business systems. For fiscal year 2007,  Congress appropriated approximately $15.7 billion to DOD, and for fiscal  year 2008, the department has requested about $15.9 billion in  appropriated funds to operate, maintain, and modernize these business  systems and associated IT infrastructure.", "As we have previously reported, the department\u2019s nonintegrated and  duplicative systems impair its ability to combat fraud, waste, and abuse. In  fact, DOD currently bears responsibility, in whole or in part, for 15 of our  27 high-risk areas. Eight of these areas are specific to the department,  while it shares responsibility for seven other governmentwide high-risk  areas. DOD\u2019s business systems modernization is one of the high-risk  areas, and it is an essential enabler to addressing many of the department\u2019s  other high-risk areas.

Moreover, when an enterprise architecture is  employed in concert with other important management controls, such as  portfolio-based capital planning and investment control practices,  architectures can greatly increase the chances that an organization\u2019s  operational and IT environments will be configured to optimize mission  performance. Our experience with federal agencies has shown that  investing in IT without defining these investments in the context of an  architecture often results in systems that are duplicative, not well  integrated, and unnecessarily costly to maintain and interface.", "One approach to structuring an enterprise architecture is referred to as a  federated enterprise architecture. Such a structure treats the architecture  as a family of coherent but distinct member architectures that conform to  an overarching architectural view and rule set. This approach recognizes  that each member of the federation has unique goals and needs as well as  common roles and responsibilities with the levels above and below it.  Under a federated approach, member architectures are substantially  autonomous, although they also inherit certain rules, policies, procedures,  and services from higher-level architectures. As such, a federated  architecture enables component organization autonomy while ensuring  enterprisewide linkages and alignment where appropriate. Where  commonality among components exists, there also are opportunities for  identifying and leveraging shared services.", "A service-oriented architecture (SOA) is an approach for sharing business  capabilities across the enterprise by designing functions and applications  as discrete, reusable, and business-oriented services. As such, service  orientation permits sharing capabilities that may be under the control of  different component organizations.

Develop a BEA that includes an information infrastructure that, at a    comply with all federal accounting, financial management, and  reporting requirements;  routinely produce timely, accurate, and reliable financial information  for management purposes;  integrate budget, accounting, and program information and systems;    provide for the systematic measurement of performance, including the  ability to produce timely, relevant, and reliable cost information;  include policies, procedures, data standards, and system interface  requirements that are to be applied uniformly throughout the  department; and    be consistent with OMB policies and procedures.  2.

First, DOD had yet to establish  a strategic planning process that results in a comprehensive, integrated,  and enterprisewide plan or set of plans that would guide transformation.  Second, DOD had yet to designate a senior official who could provide full- time attention and oversight to the business transformation effort.  Subsequently, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008  designated the Deputy Secretary of Defense as the department\u2019s Chief  Management Officer (CMO), created a Deputy CMO position, and  designated the undersecretaries of each military department as CMOs for  their respective departments. The act also required the Secretary of  Defense, acting through the CMO, to develop a strategic management plan  that, among other things, is to include a detailed description of  performance goals and measures for improving and evaluating the overall  efficiency and effectiveness of the business operations of the department.

In particular, we stated that DOD\u2019s BEA,  while addressing several issues previously reported by us, was still not  sufficiently complete to effectively and efficiently guide and constrain  business system investments across all levels of the department.

As such, the act  provides for an architecture that extends to all defense organizational  components. In 2006, the department adopted an incremental and  federated approach to developing such an architecture. Under this  approach, the department committed to releasing new versions of its BEA  every 6 months that would include a corporate BEA that was augmented  by a coherent family of component architectures. As we have previously  reported, such an approach is consistent with best practices and  appropriate given the DOD\u2019s scope and size.", "In 2007, we reported that the then current version of the BEA (version  4.1) resolved several of the architecture gaps associated with the prior  version and added content proposed by DOD stakeholders, but that gaps  still remained. On March 14, 2008, DOD released BEA 5.0 which addresses  some of these remaining gaps. For example, it improves the Financial  Visibility business enterprise area by expanding the Standard Financial  Information Structure data elements (i.e., types of data) associated with  information exchanges among operational nodes (e.g., organizational units  or system functions) to include data attributes (characteristics of data  elements). In addition, the latest version introduces data standards for the  Enterprise Funds Distribution initiative. Together, these additions bolster  the department\u2019s efforts to standardize financial data across DOD so that  information is available to inform corporate decision making.", "Version 5.0 of the BEA also addresses, to varying degrees, missing  elements, inconsistencies, and usability issues that we previously  identified. Examples of these improvements and remaining issues are  summarized below.", "The latest version includes performance metrics for the business  capabilities within enterprise priority areas, including actual performance  relative to performance targets that are to be met. For example, it states  that 62 percent of DOD assets are now using the Department of the  Treasury\u2019s United States Standard General Ledger compliant formats, as  compared to a target of 100 percent. Further, this version provides actual  baseline performance for operational activities (e.g., \u201cManage Audit and  Oversight of Contractor\u201d). As we previously reported, performance  models are an essential part of any architecture because having defined  performance baselines to measure actual performance against provides  the means for knowing whether the intended mission value to be delivered  by each business process is actually being realized.", "The latest version includes important \u201cAs Is\u201d information (e.g., current  capability problems and limitations that enterprise priorities are to  address and their root causes) for all six business enterprise priorities. As  we previously reported, such \u201cAs Is\u201d content is essential for analyzing  capability gaps that in turn inform the plan for transitioning from the \u201cAs  Is\u201d to the \u201cTo Be\u201d environments.", "The latest version includes 1,201 new business rules. As we previously  reported, business rules are important because they explicitly translate  business policies and procedures into specific, unambiguous rules that  govern what can and cannot be done. As such, they facilitate consistent  implementation of policies and procedures. Examples of new business  rules are that (1) each request for commercial export of DOD technology  must be processed within 30 days of request from the Department of State  or the Department of Commerce and (2) DOD must first seek to acquire  commercial items before developing military unique material. In addition  to adding business rules, Version 5.0 reflects the deletion of 1,046 business  rules that were no longer applicable and thus obsolete.", "Notwithstanding these additions and deletions, BEA 5.0 still does not  provide business rules for all business processes. For example, there are  no business rules for the \u201cPerform Acceptance Procedures for Other  Goods and Services\u201d business process under the Common Supplier  Engagement enterprise priority area. Also, business rules are defined at  inconsistent levels of detail. For example, the Travel Authorization  business rule states that each travel authorization must be processed in  accordance with the Allowance Law, however, it does not identify the  specific conditions that must be met. In contrast, the Trial Balance  Reporting business rule is more explicitly defined, specifically citing the  conditions under which actions are to be taken. Without well-defined  business rules, policies and procedures can be implemented inconsistently  because they will be interpreted differently by different organizations.", "The latest version includes updates on the information that flows among  operational nodes (i.e., organizations, business operations, and system  elements). Information flows are important because they define what  information is needed and where and how the information moves to and  from operational entities. In particular, Version 5.0 adds 240 new  information exchanges (e.g., Accounts Payable) among business  operations and 28 data exchanges (e.g., Acknowledge Inter-governmental  Order) among system elements. However, it still does not provide  information flows for all organizational units. For example, it does not  identify information exchanges among the organizations that support the  Human Resources Management enterprise priority area, and continues to  lack information flows among DOD corporate and components  organizations. Without such information exchanges, a common  understanding of the semantic meaning of the information moving among  these organizations does not exist. Moreover, Version 5.0 contains  information exchanges (e.g., Accounts Payable Account) that are not  attached or linked to any operational nodes. Further, this version\u2019s  information-related architecture products contain inconsistencies. For  example, \u201cAcceptance Results\u201d is identified as a new information  exchange in the integrated dictionary, but it is not in the operational  information exchange product.", "The latest version expands on the operational activities that are or will be  performed at each location and by each organization. For example, it now  identifies the Defense Logistics Agency as one of the organizations  involved in the \u201cAuthorize Return or Disposal\u201d activity. However, as was  the case with BEA Version 4.1, not all operational activities are assigned to  an organization. For example, the \u201cManage Capabilities Based Acquisition\u201d  activity is not assigned. In addition, BEA 5.0 still does not include the roles  and responsibilities of organizations performing the same operational  activity, which is important because not doing so can result in either  duplicative organizational efforts or gaps in activity coverage. Moreover,  BEA 5.0 still does not include the Foreign Military Sales operational  activity, which affects multiple DOD business missions and organizations.", "The latest version continues to lack important security architecture  content. For example, while DOD officials told us that the Enterprise  Information Environment Mission Area will provide infrastructure  information assurance services (e.g., secure, reliable messaging) for  business systems and applications, this information is not reflected in the  latest version. Also, this version still does not describe relevant  information assurance requirements contained in laws, regulations, and  policies, or provide a reference to where these requirements are  described. Such information is essential to adequately reflect security in  the BEA, and thereby ensure that designs for business systems,  applications, and services comply with applicable information assurance  requirements.", "Beyond the above discussed limitations, Version 5.0 also continues to  represent only the thin layer of corporate architectural policies,  capabilities, rules, and standards that apply DOD-wide (i.e., to all DOD  federation members). This means that Version 5.0 appropriately focuses  on addressing a limited set of enterprise-level (DOD-wide) priorities, and  providing the overarching and common architectural context that the  distinct and substantially autonomous member (i.e., component)  architectures inherit. However, this also means that Version 5.0 does not  provide the total federated family of DOD parent and subsidiary  architectures for the business mission area that are needed to comply with  the act.", "To produce the federated BEA, the BTA released an update to its  federation strategy in January 2008. (See fig. 3 for a simplified diagram of  DOD\u2019s federated BEA.) In April 2007, we reported on the prior version of  this strategy, concluding that while it provided a foundation on which to  build and align DOD\u2019s parent BEA with its subsidiary architectures, it  lacked sufficient details to permit effective and efficient execution.  Accordingly, we made recommendations to improve the strategy.", "The updated strategy, along with the associated global information grid  (GIG) strategy, partially addresses our recommendations. For example,  the strategies now provide high-level roles and responsibilities for  federating the architecture and additional definition around the tasks  needed to achieve alignment among DOD and component architectures. In  particular, the strategy for the business mission area provides for  conducting pilot programs across the components to demonstrate the  technical feasibility of architecture federation. BTA and CIO officials  described the strategy for federating DOD\u2019s architectures as still evolving.  They added that lessons learned from the pilots will be used to improve  and update the strategies. They also noted that subsequent releases of the  corporate BEA will reflect the evolving federation strategy by, for  example, defining enforceable interfaces to ensure interoperability and  information sharing.", "To help assist the department in its BEA federation efforts, we have made  a number of recommendations. While DOD agreed with these  recommendations, it did not implement one related to its latest annual  report. Specifically, we previously recommended that DOD include in its  annual report, required under the National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2005, the results of its BEA independent verification and  validation (IV&V) contractor\u2019s assessment of the completeness,  consistency, understandability, and usability of the federated family of  architectures. However, its latest annual report does not include this  information. According to BTA officials, this is because the contractor\u2019s  report was not finalized in time to include the results. While we have yet to  receive either the contractor\u2019s statement of work or the results of the  contractor\u2019s assessments, BTA officials provided us with a report dated  April 11, 2008, that summarizes selected IV&V contractor observations and  recommendations relative to the Version 5.0\u2019s ability to provide a  foundation for BEA federation. Overall, the summary confirms our  findings by stating that while the BEA provides a foundation for  federation, much remains to be done before the department will have a  complete family of architectures. In this regard, it provides several  recommendations, such as having BTA track, measure, and report on the  adoption of shared vocabularies and standards within the component  architectures. However, the summary does not demonstrate that the IV&V  contractor is being used to address the full scope of our recommendation.  For example, the summary does not address the extent to which the  department\u2019s federated family of architectures, including the related  transition plan(s), are complete, consistent, understandable, and useable.", "The challenges that the department faces in federating its BEA, and the  importance of disclosing to congressional defense committees the state of  its federation efforts, are amplified by our recent report on the current  state of the military departments\u2019 enterprise architecture programs.  Specifically, we reported in May 2008, that none of the three military  departments could demonstrate through verifiable documentation that it  had established all of the core foundational commitments and capabilities  needed to effectively manage the development, maintenance, and  implementation of an architecture, although in relative terms the state of  the Air Force\u2019s architecture efforts was well ahead of those of the Navy  and Army. Examples of their architecture limitations are discussed below.", "None of the military departments had fully defined its \u201cAs Is\u201d and \u201cTo Be\u201d  architecture environments and associated transition plans.

This is important because  security is relevant and essential to every aspect of an organization\u2019s  operations, and therefore the nature and substance of institutionalized  security requirements, controls, and standards should be embedded  throughout the architecture, and reflected in each system investment.", "None of the military departments was using an IV&V agent to help ensure  the quality of its architecture products. IV&V is a proven means for  obtaining unbiased insight into such essential architecture qualities as  completeness, understandability, usability, and consistency.", "None of the military departments had established a committee or group  with representation from across the enterprise to direct, oversee, and  approve its architecture. This is significant because the architecture is a  corporate asset that needs to be enterprisewide in scope and endorsed by  senior leadership if it is to be leveraged for optimizing operational and  technology change.", "None of the military departments could demonstrate that its IT  investments were actually in compliance with its architectures. This is  relevant because the benefits from using an architecture, such as  improved information sharing, increased consolidation, enhanced  productivity, and lower costs, cannot be fully realized unless individual  investments are actually in compliance with, among other things,  architectural rules and standards.", "To address these limitations, we have made recommendations aimed at  improving the management and content of these architectures.

However, we also reported that the  ETP was limited in several ways. On March 15, 2008, DOD released the  latest version of its ETP, which provides required information on 102  programs (systems and initiatives) that are linked to key transformational  objectives. For example, it includes specific time-phased milestones for  about 90 business system programs and performance metrics for about 75  of these. Further, the latest version of the ETP discusses progress made on  business system investments over the last 6 months, as well as  descriptions of planned near-term activities (i.e., next 6 months).", "The Defense Integrated Military Human Resources System program  completed all interface designs required for system deployment to the  Army and to defense agencies, and over half of the interface designs  required for deployment to the Air Force. It also states that system  interface testing and operational testing for the Army deployment will be  completed in the next 6 months.", "The Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System was fully  implemented following replacement of a proprietary software product  with an open source product and rehosting of this product to a new  facility.

It also discusses planned and ongoing gap analyses. For  example, it relates the DOD Electronic Mall investment to the Common  Supplier Engagement business enterprise priority area and describes how  it will address business capability gaps by providing access to off-the-shelf  finished goods and services from both commercial and government  sources. It also describes how related performance shortfalls will be  addressed through shorter logistics response time, improved visibility of  sources of supplies, one-stop tracking of order status, and improved ability  to shop for best price. As we stated, determining how business capability  gaps between the baseline and target architecture are to be addressed for  all priority areas is key to the department\u2019s transition plan\u2019s ability to  support informed investment selection and control decisions.", "The latest version provides a range of information for the 102 systems and  initiatives identified, such as 3 years of budget information for 67 of these  systems and initiatives.

At that time, BTA officials stated that  information for these defense agencies and combatant commands was  excluded because the ETP focused on those business-related  organizations having the majority of the tier 1 and 2 business investments,  and the majority of the defense agencies and combatant commands do not  have investments that meet this threshold criteria. However, not all DOD  components have developed subordinate transition plans. For example,  we recently reported that only one military department, the Air Force, had  developed a transition plan and that this plan was limited because it did  not include an analysis of the gap in capabilities between the military  departments\u2019 \u201cAs Is\u201d and \u201cTo Be\u201d environments.

However, it does not include other important  information needed to understand the sequencing of these investments. In  particular, the planned investments are not sequenced based on a range of  important factors cited in federal guidance, such as technology  opportunities, marketplace trends, fiscal and budgetary constraints,  institutional system development and acquisition capabilities, new and  legacy system dependencies and life expectancies, and the projected value  of competing investments. While the ETP has begun to incorporate some  top-down analysis based on gaps in the business enterprise priorities, the  plan continues to be largely based on a bottom-up planning process in  which ongoing programs were examined and categorized in the plan  around business enterprise priorities. For example, many of these  investments are dependent on Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES)  for its core services, and as such the plans and milestones for each should  reflect the incremental capability deployment of NCES. According to the  BTA official responsible for the ETP, the investments were sequenced  based on only fiscal year budgetary constraints. However, BTA officials  said that they intend to depict investment dependencies in future versions  of the ETP, especially program-to-program dependencies associated with  adoption of a service-oriented architecture approach.", "The latest version of the ETP also includes discussion of how the  department plans to use enterprise application integration, including  plans, methods, and tools for reusing applications that already exist while  also adding new applications and databases.

Moreover,  available information from the military departments shows that 35  additional investments have been precertified. Specifically, the Air Force,  Navy, and Army, report that 14, 19, and 2 investments, respectively, have  been precertified. In addition, both the Air Force and Navy reported that  they have reviewed and approved investments that are below the act\u2019s  thresholds, and thus do not require IRB certification or DBSMC approval.  Specifically, the Air Force reports 46 of these systems have been reviewed  and approved, while the Navy reports 4 additional systems reviewed and  approved. We have yet to receive comparable information from the Army.", "The basis for DOD\u2019s continuing efforts to certify and approve business  systems modernization investments as being compliant with the BEA are  essentially each individual program\u2019s assertion of compliance.

At the request of the Senate Armed Services Committee, we  have ongoing reviews of several major business systems investments that  include determining the extent to which these investments have  demonstrated compliance with the BEA."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Over the last year, DOD has continued to make important progress in  defining and implementing key institutional modernization management  controls, but much remains to be accomplished. In particular, the  corporate BEA, while continuing to improve, is still missing important  content, and it has yet to be federated through development of aligned  subordinate architectures for each of the department\u2019s component  organizations. Further, while the department has developed a strategy for  federating the BEA in this manner, this strategy is still evolving and has yet  to be implemented. Compounding this situation are recurring limitations  in the ETP, as well as the immaturity of the military service architecture  programs, to include their own transition plans. In addition, neither the  corporate nor the military departments\u2019 approaches to business systems  investment management have all the requisite structures and defined  policies and procedures in place to be considered effective investment  selection, control, and evaluation mechanisms. These architecture and  investment management limitations continue to put billions of dollars  spent each year on thousands of business system investments at risk.", "Development of a well-defined federated architecture and accompanying  transition plans for the business mission area, along with  institutionalization of effective business system investment management  policies and procedures across all levels of the department, are critically  important to addressing the business system modernization high-risk area.  Equally, if not more important is for the department to actually implement  the architecture and investment management controls on each and every  business system investment. While not a guarantee, having an  architecture-centric approach to investment management, combined with  following the other key system acquisition disciplines that are reflected in  our existing recommendations to the department, can be viewed as a  recipe for the business systems modernization program\u2019s removal from  our high-risk list.", "Related to implementing our existing recommendations is the  department\u2019s need to keep congressional defense committees fully  informed about its progress in federating the DOD corporate BEA, to  include the maturity of component organization architecture efforts and  the related transition plan(s). In its most recent annual report to  congressional defense committees pursuant to the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005, the department missed an  opportunity to do this by not including the results of its IV&V contractor\u2019s  assessments of the completeness, consistency, understandability, and  usability of the federated family of business mission area architectures,  including associated transition plans, as we previously recommended."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["Because we have existing recommendations to the Secretary of Defense  that address the issues raised in this report and that the department has  yet to fully implement, we are not making additional recommendations at  this time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["In comments on a draft of this report, signed by the Deputy Under  Secretary of Defense (Business Transformation), the department stated  that it appreciated our support in advancing its business transformation  efforts.

To address this,  we focused on five of the six requirements in section 2222, and related  best practices contained in federal guidance, that we identified in our last  annual report under the act as not being fully satisfied. Generally, these  five requirements are (1) development of a business enterprise  architecture (BEA), (2) development of a transition plan for implementing  the BEA, (3) inclusion of business systems information in DOD\u2019s budget  submission, (4) establishment of business systems investment review  processes and structures, and (5) approval of defense business systems  investments with obligations in excess of $1 million. (See the background  section of this report for additional information on the act\u2019s requirements.)  We did not include the sixth requirement because our 2006 annual report  under the act shows that it had been satisfied. Our methodology relative to  each of the five requirements is as follows:    To determine whether the BEA addressed the requirements specified in  the act, and related guidance, we analyzed version 5.0 of the BEA, which  was released on March 14, 2008, relative to the act\u2019s specific architectural  requirements and related guidance that our last annual report under the  act identified as not being met. We also reviewed version 5.0 to confirm  whether statements made in DOD\u2019s March 15, 2008, annual report about  the BEA\u2019s content were accurate. In addition, we reviewed DOD\u2019s  Business Mission Area Federation Strategy and Road Map Version 2.0  released in January 2008, comparing the strategy and any associated  implementation plans with prior findings and recommendations relative to  the content of the strategy. Further, we reviewed the Business  Transformation Agency\u2019s report of selected independent verification and  validation (IV&V) contractor observations and recommendations relative  to the Version 5.0\u2019s ability to provide a foundation for BEA federation, and  compared this to our prior finding and recommendation relative to the  content of an IV&V review of the BEA. Finally, we reviewed and leveraged  the applicable results contained in our recent reports on the military  departments\u2019 enterprise architecture programs, on the Air Force and  Navy\u2019s investment management processes, and our recent testimony on  DOD\u2019s Business Transformation.", "To determine whether the enterprise transition plan (ETP) addressed the  requirements specified in the act, we reviewed the updated version of the  ETP, which was released on March 15, 2008, relative to the act\u2019s specific  transition plan requirements and related guidance that our last annual  report under the act identified as not being met. We also reviewed the ETP  to confirm that statements in DOD\u2019s March 15, 2008, annual report about  the content of the ETP were accurate.", "To determine whether DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2009 information technology  budget submission was prepared in accordance with the criteria set forth  in the act, we reviewed and analyzed the department report entitled  \u201cReport on Defense Business System Modernization FY 2005 National  Defense Authorization Act, Section 332,\u201d dated February 2008 and  compared it to the specific requirements in the act.", "To determine whether DOD has established investment review structures  and processes, we focused on the act\u2019s requirements that our last annual  report under the act identified as not being met, obtaining documentation  and interviewing cognizant DOD officials about efforts to establish the one  IRB specified in the act that we previously reported had yet to be  established.

We also obtained documentation from the Air Force and  the Navy to ascertain the specific actions that were taken (or planned to  be taken) in order to perform the annual systems reviews as required  pursuant to the act.
