A major focus of transformation was to centralize the remaining loan functions performed by 68 district offices. SBA's implementation of early transformation efforts did not reflect key practices GAO recommended in a 2003 report as important for successful transformations. Consequently, its centralization of the guaranty purchase process for one of its loan programs resulted in backlogs and other problems reported by SBA's Inspector General. Some of SBA's actions also led to a reduction in staff at district offices and a decline in employee morale. GAO was asked to assess how SBA has (1) responded to GAO's 2003 recommendations, (2) addressed the impacts of transformation on employees, (3) defined the roles and responsibilities of district offices, and (4) assessed the centralization of loan functions. GAO reviewed documents related to SBA's transformation and reform efforts, interviewed SBA officials, and analyzed SBA employee survey data. GAO also visited 10 district offices and two centers and interviewed groups of employees."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In the past 2 years, SBA has applied key practices that support successful transformations to improve agency operations and, thereby, has taken actions to address recommendations GAO made in its 2003 report, including improving communication, performance management, and employee involvement. The Administrator appointed in 2006 emphasized the importance of transparency in his reform agenda and took actions to improve communications across the agency. The development of a performance management framework was a key step in linking the agency's reforms with strategic goals and employee roles. The Administrator also made a concerted effort to engage SBA's employees in improving the agency, and meetings with employees affirmed that these efforts had a positive effect. Some employees continued to feel that management does not consider their ideas and concerns. SBA recently conducted focus groups to understand these concerns and plans to implement initiatives to address them. SBA senior officials also said that they are taking steps to institutionalize these improvements. SBA leadership's commitment will be important to ensure that the agency's transformation and reforms are successful. SBA took some actions to address its low employee morale, which had declined significantly following the centralization efforts, as shown in the 2004 and 2006 Federal Human Capital Surveys. SBA's 2007 survey results suggest that these recent actions, such as improving communication and training, have had a positive impact on employees. The creation of SBA University in 2007 was an important action since it provided training and also showed that the agency was willing to invest resources in the development of employees. SBA officials said they are developing a core training program. However, SBA has not developed a training plan that lays out goals, strategies, and milestones. Such a plan would help to establish priorities and could assure employees that SBA remains committed to developing its employees. SBA continues to define the roles and responsibilities of the district offices, as evidenced by its recent determination that district offices should retain a role in loan processes that have been centralized. District directors and employees made positive comments about the flexibility they had in using resources to meet office goals. But they also said that they still were adjusting to new responsibilities and the reduction of staff in their offices. SBA recently re-engineered its guaranty purchase process. Its measures to track progress have emphasized the timeliness of the process, completeness of packages lenders submit, and customer service. SBA reviews each purchase decision and is developing a new quality assurance review process, but has not yet developed performance measures to track the quality of its purchase reviews. SBA Inspector General audits have noted concerns about the quality of purchase reviews and found that the center's purchase reviews do not adequately prevent improper payments. Performance measures could provide more attention to the quality of reviews."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Over the past 6 years, the Small Business Administration (SBA) has sought  to transform the agency and improve its ability to fulfill its primary  mission\u2014to promote small business development and entrepreneurship.  SBA\u2019s transformation efforts also focused on improving the efficiency of  its business and loan processes to help mitigate budget constraints and  other resource issues, such as the impending retirement eligibility of a  large portion of its workforce. SBA carries out its mission of supporting  small businesses primarily with programs providing access to credit,  mostly by guaranteeing loans through its 7(a) and other loan programs and  by providing entrepreneurial assistance through partnerships with private  entities that offer small business counseling and technical assistance. SBA  also administers various small business procurement programs and its  8(a) Business Development program that are designed to assist small and  small disadvantaged businesses in obtaining federal contracts and  subcontracts. Additionally, SBA makes loans to businesses or individuals  trying to recover from a major disaster.", "SBA\u2019s approach to transformation evolved from restructuring the agency  to emphasizing agency performance. Initially, a major focus of  transformation was SBA\u2019s intent to centralize loan functions and some of  its other small business programs. As centralization freed up employees in  the district offices, SBA also intended to better define the role of district  offices to focus on marketing and outreach to small businesses and  managing SBA\u2019s relationships with lenders and other private-sector  partners. In 2003, we assessed SBA\u2019s implementation of the initial phase of  its transformation strategy and made several recommendations to address  weaknesses that we found, such as SBA overlooking two-way  communication with and involvement of employees in the process. We  recommended that SBA follow key practices important to successful  organizational transformation involving leadership, setting goals and  timelines, communication, and employee involvement.", "Following the issuance of our 2003 report, SBA created a new center\u2014the  National Guaranty Purchase Center (NGPC)\u2014for handling the guaranty  purchase of defaulted 7(a) loans guaranteed by SBA and loan liquidations.  SBA staffed the NGPC by requiring certain employees in district offices to  either take the reassignment and relocate to the new center in Herndon,  Virginia, or accept a buyout and lose their job with SBA. This action  contributed to a significant reduction in employee morale, as indicated in  employee survey results in the 2004 and 2006 Federal Human Capital  Survey (FHCS), which the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)  administers on behalf of federal agencies. The FHCS data are used to rank  agencies on a \u201cBest Places to Work\u201d index score, which measures  employee satisfaction. According to the Best Places rankings for 2007,  which are based on the 2006 employee survey results, SBA ranked lowest  among the 30 large federal agencies. In 2004, SBA\u2019s Office of Inspector  General (OIG) also reported problems arising from SBA\u2019s centralization  efforts at the NGPC and noted that the implementation of the center had  not been well planned. In addition, district offices lost staff as a result of  the centralization as employees moved to Herndon, lost their jobs, or  accepted the buyout. In 2006, SBA completed its loan centralization efforts  with the creation of the Standard 7(a) Loan Guaranty Processing Center  operating out of two locations in Citrus Heights, California, and Hazard,  Kentucky. This center has responsibility for processing 7(a) loan guaranty  applications for lenders who do not have delegated authority to make 7(a)  loans without SBA\u2019s final approval.", "In response to your request, we reviewed the status of SBA\u2019s efforts to  transform and improve agency operations since our 2003 report and SBA\u2019s  actions to address the impacts some efforts have had on employees and  morale. Specifically, this report examines (1) SBA\u2019s progress in  transforming agency operations and addressing GAO\u2019s recommendations  on key practices for successful transformation, (2) how SBA has  addressed the impacts of transformation on its employees, (3) how SBA  has defined the roles and responsibilities of its district offices, and (4) how  SBA\u2019s approach for implementing centralization of its loan functions has  changed since transformation began and how it has assessed its  centralization efforts.", "To respond to these objectives we reviewed agency planning and  implementation documents related to SBA\u2019s efforts to transform and  improve agency performance, analyzed SBA employee survey data, and  interviewed key officials at SBA headquarters in Washington, D.C. We also  reviewed information documenting SBA\u2019s actions to implement  recommended practices important to successful organizational  transformation. We conducted site visits at 10 district offices and the two  loan centers in Citrus Heights, California, and Herndon, Virginia, that were  created under SBA\u2019s transformation efforts. To provide national coverage,  one district office was selected from each of SBA\u2019s 10 geographical  regions. We conducted site visits in California, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa,  Montana, New Jersey, Oregon, Texas, Vermont, and Virginia. Additionally,  at these locations we met with employees to obtain their perspectives on  the implementation and results of SBA\u2019s transformation efforts. While the  limited number of offices we visited is too small for generalizing the  information obtained to all district offices, the recurring nature of the  observations and perspectives expressed across these offices, along with  other material we examined, suggest that these views were not limited to  the offices we visited. To facilitate frank discussions, we met with district  and center directors and employees separately. We also analyzed  responses to certain questions in SBA\u2019s 2004 and 2006 FHCS and its 2007  annual employee survey to identify issues related to transformation\u2019s  impact on employees, including morale. Additionally, we met with  representatives of a lenders\u2019 organization directly affected by SBA\u2019s  transformation and SBA union officials to discuss the impact of  transformation on staff. Finally, we reviewed recent and ongoing OIG  audit work addressing SBA\u2019s centralization initiative and also met with  representatives from that office to discuss their audit results, including  recommendations they made to the agency. In conducting our work, our  focus was on the transformation process itself and its impacts, rather than  on assessing SBA\u2019s administration of its various programs.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2007 to September 2008  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. Appendix I provides a detailed  description of our objectives, scope, and methodology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In response to budget reductions in the 1990s, SBA streamlined its field  structure by downsizing the 10 regional offices, shifting its workload to  district or headquarters offices, eliminated most of the region\u2019s role as  intermediate management layer between headquarters and the field  (district offices), and created the Office of Field Operations to assume the  intermediary role. Prior to this restructuring, SBA had changed its service  delivery model\u2014moving from making loans directly to small businesses to  guaranteeing loans made by commercial lenders. SBA previously had  provided loans directly to small businesses largely through its district  offices. SBA\u2019s 7(a) loan guaranty program exemplifies how the service  delivery model changed. The program has several delivery methods\u2014such  as the certified and preferred lender programs\u2014in which SBA has  delegated different functions to lenders. For instance, certified lenders  must perform a thorough credit analysis on the loan application packages  they submit to SBA so that SBA can heavily rely on that analysis in making  SBA\u2019s  credit and eligibility decisions, thereby shortening the time for SBA  loan processing. Preferred lenders have delegated authority to make SBA- guaranteed loans, subject only to a brief eligibility review and assignment  of a loan number by SBA. SBA provides final approval for loans made  under the regular 7(a) program for loans made by lenders who have not  been approved as certified or preferred lenders.", "SBA has 68 district offices that operate as the frontline provider or conduit  of SBA services and programs. Specifically, district offices provide  counseling and training services to individuals or businesses that aid in the  formation, management, financing, or operation of a small business  enterprise. District offices provide information on and promote SBA  products to lending partners, the small business community, and groups  such as chambers of commerce and trade associations. Finally, district  offices are charged with completing statutorily mandated reviews, such as  section 8(a) program participant reviews that ensure participants continue  to qualify for the program and are meeting program requirements.", "When we reported on SBA in 2003, the agency had started or was planning  transformation efforts to better align resources and functions with the  changed organizational structure. The transformation effort was to be  done in three phases that included two key initiatives. We reported on the  first phase of these efforts. The first initiative focused on changing the role  of district offices (through a pilot in three district offices) to emphasize  outreach to small businesses about SBA\u2019s products and services and  linking these businesses to the appropriate resources, including lenders.  For instance, SBA provided training to employees on marketing and  outreach, developed new job descriptions for its marketing and outreach  specialist positions, and reorganized staff in the offices. However, we  found that budget constraints impeded work on this initiative and could  continue to do so. We also found that the agency\u2019s budget requests for  transformation were inconsistent and lacked a detailed plan that showed  priorities and linked resources to desired results.", "The second initiative focused on centralizing loan functions to improve  efficiency and consistency of the loan approval, guaranty purchase, and  liquidation processes for SBA\u2019s 7(a) loan program. In March 2003, the  liquidation center in Santa Ana, California, that typically worked on  disaster loans began a pilot program to process new 7(a) liquidations and  guaranty purchase cases from the three pilot district offices. According to  SBA, the centralization achieved processing efficiencies. In phases two  and three of its transformation, SBA had planned to establish a new 7(a)  liquidation and guaranty purchase center near Washington, D.C., and  expand the centralization initiative until all of the loan functions  performed by its 68 district offices were centralized. However, we found  that SBA\u2019s centralization efforts also could be impeded by the challenge of  trying to ensure that job realignments and relocations from multiple field  offices would result in having experienced staff at the centralized  locations. We also noted that relocations could prove disruptive for  employees by decreasing morale and productivity and, thus, could  negatively affect SBA\u2019s operations. Between 2004 and 2006, SBA created  two centers to conduct work that had been previously performed in the  district offices. As part of their respective missions, these centers provide  assistance and oversight, as necessary, to lenders. Specifically, the NGPC  in Herndon, Virginia, processes guaranty purchase requests and assists  lenders during loan liquidation and the Standard 7(a) Loan Guaranty  Processing Center (operating out of two locations in Citrus Heights,  California, and Hazard, Kentucky) has responsibility for processing 7(a)  loan guaranty applications for lenders who have not been approved as   preferred lenders.", "SBA\u2019s workforce has declined significantly since the 1990s. During the  restructuring in the 1990s, SBA\u2019s workforce decreased from over 3,800  employees to about 3,100 employees\u2014a decrease of about 19 percent.  Between 2000 and 2007, when additional restructuring occurred, SBA\u2019s  workforce decreased further by about 26 percent. As of September 2007,  SBA had 2,166 employees.", "Our 2003 report noted that transforming an organization is challenging. We  further concluded that while SBA had made progress with its endeavors,  weaknesses we identified in SBA\u2019s approach could be mitigated by using  the key practices discussed in the report. Moreover, comprehensive and  strategic planning would minimize challenges, including problems with  employee morale and productivity. In particular, we said that more two- way communication, transparency, and employee involvement would  improve the effort as the agency moved forward with transformation.  Accordingly, we made recommendations related to how SBA could use the  key practices to increase the potential for a successful transformation. We  discuss our recommendations related to best practices, including actions  taken by SBA, in this report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SBA Has Applied Key Practices to Implement Change and Has Begun Addressing Employee Concerns about Involvement and Continued Leadership Commitment", "paragraphs": ["SBA has made progress in applying key practices to implement change and  has begun addressing remaining employee concerns about involvement  and continued leadership commitment.

SBA also has  made efforts to solicit employees\u2019 ideas and feedback and has begun to  examine employees\u2019 continued concerns about their involvement in  decisions that affect their work. Finally, some SBA employees expressed  concerns about the commitment of future leadership to the current  initiatives, but senior career officials said that they planned to continue  positive efforts."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "SBA Leadership Has Emphasized Transparency and Communication", "paragraphs": ["SBA\u2019s current leadership has emphasized transparency and communication,  addressing our prior recommendation that the agency improve its  communication strategy. In 2003, during the early stages of its transformation,  we made this and five other recommendations to SBA because we found the  agency\u2019s transformation plans were not transparent enough to allow related  progress to be tracked and frequent two-way communication was lacking  within SBA (see table 1). In July 2006, 3 years after transformation began and  following the unsuccessful outcome of some transformation initiatives and  other agency challenges that we discuss elsewhere in this report, SBA  underwent a change in leadership with the appointment of a new  Administrator. Under its new Administrator, SBA\u2019s leadership took steps to  increase transparency in the agency\u2019s actions and improve its communication  efforts. For fiscal year 2008, SBA developed a comprehensive  communications plan that addressed challenges from the previous year with  regard to negative reports about its disaster program, primary loan program,  and other aspects of the agency. The plan included strategies for improving  internal and external communications and detailed steps for making these  improvements. It also assigned responsibility for each communication area  such as SBA\u2019s Web site, marketing, and internal communications to specific  individuals within SBA\u2019s communications office. Senior leaders at SBA  acknowledged that effective communication had become a key area of focus  when the Administrator began his term, and identified communication  deficiencies.", "When we met with managers and staff in SBA\u2019s district offices, many told  us that under new leadership, agencywide communication had improved  significantly and that employees were more informed about ongoing  agency initiatives. Both managers and staff attributed these improvements  to the Administrator\u2019s commitment to transparency and communication,  noting that he had personally taken steps to directly communicate agency  plans and updates to all employees. In previous work reviewing practices  that empowered and involved federal employees, we noted that top  leadership commitment is crucial to instilling a common vision across the  organization and creating an environment that is receptive to innovation.  SBA officials told us that, early in his term, the Administrator had visited  the district offices and informed employees that they could contact him  directly by e-mail, and in two of the locations that we visited, district  directors told us that employees had communicated with the  Administrator. The Administrator also continued town hall meetings, as  the previous Administrator had done, and implemented video broadcast  meetings and messages that were accessible to all employees, including  those in the field.", "In addition to the Administrator\u2019s individual efforts, SBA has used e-mail  and conference calls to improve its internal communications. For  example, employees said that SBA distributes agencywide e-mails on  procedural notices. Regular conference calls also provide headquarters  and field employees with opportunities to share information. For example,  the Office of Field Operations\u2014which acts as a liaison between  headquarters and the field\u2014participates in a weekly conference call with  the district offices that various program offices in headquarters also  sometimes participate in, and the program offices hold conference calls  with field employees who work in those areas. On the local level, the  district offices also participate in weekly regional conference calls with  their respective regional Administrators.", "As part of its efforts to improve communications specifically between  headquarters and the field, SBA also developed a 10-member field advisory  council (FAC), comprising one district director from each region, which  gives district office management an opportunity to communicate field  issues and concerns directly to headquarters. The FAC\u2019s purpose is to  provide input and feedback directly to the Administrator and senior  management regarding the implementation of agency policy and programs  on operations in the field level and on SBA\u2019s customers. District directors  serve on the FAC on a rotational basis for an initial period of 18 months  and can be reconfirmed for subsequent terms. The FAC participates in  weekly conference calls with senior leaders and meets with the  Administrator several times a year. During our visits to the district offices,  several district directors told us that the FAC was an effective tool for two- way communication between headquarters and the field, particularly for  sharing the field perspective with headquarters officials. For example, one  district director said that the FAC was useful for discussions related to  staff resources in the field, and several identified their regional  representatives or said that they could share issues with their regional  representatives to be raised in FAC meetings. SBA has also updated its  internal (intranet) and external (Internet) Web sites to provide more  useful information than provided in the past, such as program area  resources to its employees and revised program guidance to its customers.  Although some employees indicated that SBA\u2019s Internet site was more  user-friendly than its intranet site in searching for information, others  provided examples of intranet improvements, such as resources to help  with conducting marketing and outreach with lenders\u2014a major aspect of  the district offices\u2019 role following centralization.", "As noted, many district office employees we interviewed indicated that  SBA\u2019s current leadership had improved agencywide communication  significantly. Employees said they were aware that communication was  now a priority for the agency and said that in the past, leadership\u2019s actions  had been unclear or not communicated to them. Partly because of more  open communication from the top and because district directors were  more informed than in the past, some district office employees said that  communication had improved in their offices. Some also noted that  communication with other areas in the agency, such as the loan centers,  had improved. However, several district office employees said they  experienced challenges communicating with headquarters officials. For  example, they said that headquarters officials were not consistently  responsive to their communications or were unable to answer their  questions during scheduled conference calls."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SBA Leadership Has Refocused Agency Priorities with a New Performance Management System", "paragraphs": ["In addition to a new Performance Management Office (PMO) and a  comprehensive performance management system, SBA also applied other  key transformation practices that we recommended the agency adopt,  including finalizing a transformation plan, identifying who would lead  transformation efforts, and developing a performance management system  that reflected agency goals and employees\u2019 roles. As discussed above, SBA  came under new leadership in 2006, and with the appointment of a new  Administrator, SBA\u2019s existing draft transformation strategy was never  approved. Instead, the Administrator introduced a strategy to carry out  remaining transformation objectives in a manner that addressed  deficiencies in past implementation efforts and focused on SBA\u2019s mission  and priorities.", "The new strategy, which shifted SBA from organizational restructuring to  improving performance, emphasized four specific priorities that made up  the Administrator\u2019s reform agenda: (1) meeting all compliance  requirements, (2) ensuring that all SBA programs operated efficiently and  effectively, (3) improving communication, and (4) providing effective  employee training. This agenda is generally consistent with key  transformation practices that we identified. Several SBA officials with  whom we spoke pointed out that some of the negative impacts of past  transformation efforts\u2014including a significant reduction in SBA\u2019s overall  workforce and directed reassignments of district office employees to a  new centralized loan center\u2014had caused transformation to take on a  negative tone across the agency. Our discussions with employees in many  of the district offices confirmed this. Thus, the Administrator replaced  \u201ctransformation\u201d with the term \u201creform agenda\u201d to describe SBA\u2019s efforts  to move forward, although it still aimed at accomplishing important  transformation objectives. For example, transformation objectives  included (1) focusing on SBA\u2019s customers, (2) empowering employees,  and (3) becoming more results-driven and performance-based. Similarly,  the reform agenda was created on the foundation of SBA being (1)  outcomes-driven; (2) customer-focused; (3) employee-enabled; and (4)  accountable, efficient, and transparent. While we found that SBA\u2019s earlier  transformation strategy remained a draft plan, the new strategy, which has  been presented as its performance management framework (PMF)  (discussed below), has been implemented.", "To provide the infrastructure for SBA\u2019s performance management efforts,  including overseeing SBA\u2019s strategic plan and goals, in January 2007, the  Administrator established a new office, the Performance Management  Office (PMO) and a new position, the Associate Administrator for  Performance Management. At SBA, the Chief Financial Officer (CFO)  serves concurrently in this new position. The PMO serves as an internal  resource for SBA\u2019s program offices, assisting them with data analysis,  project management, and operational improvement. It reports on agency  performance internally and externally (for example, performance and  accountability and Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) reporting).  It also oversees and tracks SBA\u2019s implementation and progress on the  President\u2019s Management Agenda initiatives and recommendations. In a  report discussing action steps proposed by selected performance  management experts for improving performance management in federal  agencies, such experts stated that creating an office such as the PMO  increases the focus on performance as an organizational priority.  Additionally, the report lists \u201cperformance tracking and dialogue,\u201d for  which the PMO is responsible, as one of eight management practices that  contribute to a performance culture. Moreover, the PMO is in line with  recent efforts by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to promote  program performance across the federal government.", "SBA further encouraged a collaborative approach to performance  accountability by designating managers at various levels to lead initiative  teams as \u201cchampions\u201d or \u201cproject owners\u201d of specific activities, thereby  allowing them the opportunity to participate in leadership\u2019s vision for SBA  and addressing employees\u2019 concerns about being uninformed and  uninvolved in past transformation efforts. In our report on practices that  empowered employees, we also note that using employee teams to help  accomplish agency missions and involving employees in planning and  sharing performance information with them are effective tools. In some  instances, SBA designated employee champions to oversee improvements  in specific programs or agency functions, and some initiatives had  champions in headquarters and the field. For example, for initiatives  involving staff support and training and SBA\u2019s work with small businesses  in underserved markets, program managers served as headquarters  champions, while regional Administrators or district directors served as  field champions.", "Following this approach, at the district office level, district directors also  designated individual employees as champions of local initiatives related  to the district offices\u2019 mission and goals. District office initiatives are  separate from output-related goals that SBA establishes for the district  offices, such as loan volume. Instead, SBA considers initiatives to be  \u201cvalue-added\u201d activities, such as leveraging resource partner services to  serve small businesses and outreach to faith-based and community  organizations, women, veterans, and other groups. District directors told  us that SBA requires each office to submit a plan each fiscal year to  accomplish the initiatives that are key to its local market and allocate  resources from its existing budget. In some cases, district office  employees had responsibility for initiatives that were related to their  primary roles.", "SBA\u2019s new PMF is the core component of its efforts to improve agency  performance. According to SBA, the objectives of the PMF are to (1)  prioritize objectives, (2) manage existing resources to meet priorities, (3)  target items that produce measurable impacts, (4) discontinue activities  not critical to success, (4) improve accountability, and (5) foster agency  collaboration to achieve collective priorities. SBA documents state that  the PMF allows SBA and its program offices to be more accountable,  performance-oriented, transparent, and customer-focused\u2014in line with  the reform agenda\u2014and provides the agency with flexibility by allowing  prioritization of limited resources to best fit the needs of SBA\u2019s customers.", "In the PMF, SBA\u2019s priorities\u2014including the reform agenda and other  Administrator priorities, program office priorities, and goals and  initiatives\u2014form the basis for major area (program and district office)  operating plans (see fig. 1). In developing its operating plans, SBA looks at  the resources available to accomplish the metrics or milestones for each  activity (compliance requirement, goal, or value-added initiative)  performed in a given area. For example, district office operating plans  include metrics for loans made to certain groups or communities that SBA  targets, as well as the staff and budget allocation for achieving the loan  goal. In turn, the agency assesses operations by using performance  scorecards that include metrics and other measures for tracking the  progress of goals and other activities. The scorecard then provides  detailed information on the progress made toward achieving each metric  within the operating plan.", "For fiscal year 2007, SBA developed new operating plans and streamlined  scorecards to show fewer, higher-impact items, making 100 percent  compliance with statutory requirements a priority. For the district offices,  the number of scorecard items decreased from about 40 to less than 10.  District office employees said that they preferred having fewer scorecard  goals that they could work toward and that they had greater autonomy to  achieve. In the past, district office scorecard items included some goals for  which the district offices depended on local resource partners such as  SCORE (formerly the Service Corps of Retired Executives), Small  Business Development Centers (SBDC), and Women\u2019s Business Centers  (WBC) to achieve. For example, while the district offices have goals for  training and counseling that they provide to small businesses, they  previously also had goals for training and counseling that their resource  partners provided to small businesses. Although some employees viewed  the new scorecard as an improvement, others noted that some of their  current responsibilities were not reflected in the new scorecard and that  the district office did not receive credit for work on these additional  responsibilities. For example, since SBA centralized its loan functions, the  scorecard does not account for any of the assistance that district offices  provide to the loan centers. Because district office staff resources were  limited, the employees felt that they should receive credit for all the work  they performed.", "As figure 1 indicates, the priorities set within the PMF also are reflected in  SBA\u2019s staffing decisions, employee roles and responsibilities, employee  training, and personal business commitment plans that serve as individual  performance contracts for employees.", "Scorecards then help measure performance on goals and objectives  related to these functions and documents. For example, the personal  business commitment plans of senior officials link their performance to  goals in the scorecards for their respective areas.", "Finally, accountability for achieving results related to agency priorities is a  key aspect of the PMF. SBA senior officials track the progress of PMF  priorities monthly, and program managers are required to prepare monthly  reports on scorecard metrics and meet with the Administrator and Deputy  Administrator to discuss targets that have been met and action plans for  addressing outstanding targets. (We provide an example of district office  scorecard compliance requirements and goals in our discussion of the  district offices\u2019 roles and responsibilities.) Additionally, SBA holds regular  progress review meetings at various levels in the agency, in part to create a  culture of peer-based accountability and facilitate performance  improvements agencywide. Several SBA employees with whom we spoke  said that they understood the PMF, and others noted that it clarified the  agency\u2019s goals. One program office official added that SBA had made  progress with the PMF by helping managers to make the connection  between agency goals and their individual program offices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SBA Has Made Some Efforts to Solicit Employees\u2019 Ideas and Feedback and Has Begun to Examine Employees\u2019 Continued Concerns about Their Involvement", "paragraphs": ["SBA\u2019s current approach to organizational change offers some avenues for  employee involvement, but some employees, including union  representatives, expressed concerns about limited involvement or about  providing input and seeing results. SBA has taken steps to involve district  offices and solicit their feedback and ideas, but most of these initiatives  involve district directors who may not always reflect district employees\u2019  concerns or ideas. As noted above, district directors have an opportunity  to serve on the FAC and communicate field issues and concerns to SBA  headquarters. Additionally, in 2007, SBA implemented an informal \u201cdistrict  director in residence\u201d effort that allows district directors to work on  temporary assignments in headquarters, where they can be exposed to  headquarters operations and provide a field perspective on initiatives and  activities that affect the field. Similarly, some headquarters managers have  served in temporary field positions, such as acting district director, where  they can manage field employees and provide feedback on the impact of  headquarters directives on field personnel. For example, we met with a  district director and an assistant district director who had worked in  headquarters on initiatives that incorporated technology to make  improvements to the 8(a) Business Development program. In both  instances, the officials were able to provide practical input for these  initiatives because the district offices are responsible for monitoring and  assisting more than 9,600 firms in SBA\u2019s 8(a) program and for  communicating with other federal agencies that contract with these firms.", "Some district office employees with whom we met acknowledged that  headquarters generally sought more input from the field regarding  policies, procedures, and new program initiatives than in the past. SBA\u2019s  intranet also has a comments and suggestions tool that all employees can  use to submit their ideas to the agency. In one location, the district  director pointed out that two district office employees had submitted ideas  that headquarters accepted for implementation\u2014one for pursuing an  initiative with the state to coguarantee SBA loans and encourage local  lenders to make more SBA loans.", "However, district office employees remained concerned that they had little  input in decisions that directly affected their work, and employees  generally agreed that they were not certain that management incorporated  their input when final decisions were made. For example, several recalled  providing input for procedure revisions and developing new loan programs  but said that the programs that headquarters had ultimately implemented  were less attractive to (that is, cost-effective for) local lenders, making it  challenging for district offices to market the programs and meet their loan  goals.", "In addition, results from an OPM survey of SBA\u2019s employees reflect an  ongoing concern employees have about their involvement in decisions that  affected their work. As shown in figure 2, about 32 percent of employees  surveyed in 2004, 2006, and again in 2007 had negative responses regarding  their involvement in decisions that affected their work. Similarly, the rate  of positive employee responses has shown little change over the years, and  SBA\u2019s 2007 positive employee response of 45 percent was notably lower  than the 2006 governmentwide positive response of 54 percent.", "Representatives from SBA\u2019s employee union reported insufficient  interaction with agency leadership and limited involvement in  management decisions. For example, the representatives said that  changing leadership within SBA\u2019s human capital office made it difficult to  establish relationships and that SBA\u2019s senior leadership had not been  responsive to the union\u2019s efforts to collaborate. They also said that the  union had not had opportunities to provide input for and negotiate on  agency initiatives that affected employees, such as the new field staffing  model, and they felt that SBA unilaterally changed agreements without  seeking the union\u2019s input. However, SBA officials said that federal union  contracts typically allow management some discretion with regard to  union involvement. Specifically, they told us that decisions affecting the  agency\u2019s mission, budget, and staff resources were made at the  management level and did not involve the union. For example, they stated  that SBA management would not negotiate with the union on SBA\u2019s  development of its field staffing model. In addition, they said that there  was some misunderstanding among union representatives in this regard.", "We have previously reported that employee involvement strengthens the  transformation process by including frontline perspectives and  experiences. Specifically, employee involvement helps to create the  opportunity to establish new networks and break down existing  organizational silos, increase employees\u2019 understanding and acceptance of  organizational goals and objectives, and gain ownership for new policies  and procedures. More specifically, in relation to eliciting feedback, OPM  suggests that federal agencies could increase the usefulness of employee  surveys by combining survey results with other personnel information or  with additional feedback tools such as focus groups. In doing so,  agencies could better determine the rationale behind employee survey  responses and more accurately assess their human capital environment.", "SBA\u2019s employee survey results and comments from employees with whom  we met suggest that some employees were still not satisfied with the  extent of their involvement in work-related decisions. In line with OPM\u2019s  suggestion, SBA officials said that they had begun efforts to examine  several employee issues that they identified from human capital surveys  for fiscal years 2005 through 2007. The officials said that they had followed  up on questions that had the highest negative responses, including the  question on employees\u2019 satisfaction with their level of involvement in  decisions that affected their work.

When we spoke with managers and staff at SBA prior to the nomination,  many said that under Administrator Preston, SBA\u2019s approach to leadership  had improved significantly, and some expressed concerns about the  commitment of future leadership to progress at SBA. In particular, some  employees were uncertain about whether positive actions would continue  under the next Administrator and anticipated that a new Administrator  might take the agency in a different direction, which could lead to the  dismantling of many improvements.

She said that while a new  Administrator would have new ideas, she felt that it would be important to  sustain practices and initiatives that had led to noticeable improvements in  the agency\u2019s capacity to implement a new vision or priorities. In particular,  she pointed out that SBA\u2019s efforts, such as the PMF, and improved  communication, had improved its capacity to operate more effectively and  efficiently, which would help any new programs or policies under a new  Administrator. Additionally, the Chief of Staff told us that as the officials  develop a transition plan for the next administration, they would include  support for the positive actions that Administrator Preston implemented.  Our previous work on key practices that support transformations noted  that frequent turnover of political leadership in the federal government  often made it difficult to sustain and inspire attention to make needed  changes.

The employee survey results in  2004 and 2006 showed a lack of respect for and trust in SBA leadership  and a concern about training opportunities. According to SBA officials, the  new Administrator made improving employee morale a priority.", "As discussed earlier, SBA leadership sought to improve communication  and transparency across the agency. The new SBA Administrator\u2019s efforts  to communicate with employees included soliciting information from  employees and visiting field locations to obtain their input on how to  improve agency operations and morale. For example, during his first year  at SBA, the Administrator attended 32 employee meetings and visited 23  district offices. At these meetings, he would ask managers to leave the  room and tell employees that the discussions would remain confidential  and individual employees\u2019 comments would not be shared outside the  meetings. According to employees with whom we met, the new  Administrator\u2019s positive and open management style generally improved  morale within the agency.

We have noted in  previous work that training and development can play a key role in helping  agencies address the challenge of transformation and cultural change and  help ensure that their workforces possess the knowledge, skills, and  competencies needed to work effectively in a rapidly changing and  complex environment.", "Prior to the arrival of SBA\u2019s new Administrator in July 2006, the range of  training available to SBA staff was limited, in part because SBA had not  invested in training due to budget constraints. Most training was on the job  or offered online. Recognizing that many employees had taken on new  roles and responsibilities, the Administrator supported the need to  develop a training program. This program\u2014SBA University\u2014started in  2007. The first sessions were for field office employees, with the goal of  training them in the new roles and responsibilities incurred as part of  transformation. SBA held three sessions of week-long training during late  July and August 2007, with more than 1,300 employees from field offices  across the country. The agency organized the sessions around seven  modules of instructor-led training\u2014(1) lender relations, (2)  entrepreneurial development, (3) government contracting and business  development, (4) public communications, (5) administration, (6) servicing  centers, and (7) government contracting representatives. Within each  module, some courses were program-specific, such as 8(a) annual reviews,  while other courses were skill-specific, such as customer service. The  agency offered another round of training under the SBA University in April  2008 for SBA managers (including managers in district offices and  headquarters). Additional training is scheduled in 2008 for managers and  headquarters employees. District office employees and management  officials with whom we met generally were positive about SBA University.", "In addition, the positive reaction to the new emphasis on training was  reflected in the 2007 employee survey results. For example, as shown in  figure 4, employee response to an item asking about satisfaction with  training shows a 13 percentage point increase in positive responses in 2007  compared to the 2006 survey. However, SBA\u2019s positive response of 49  percent was lower than the 2006 governmentwide positive response of 54  percent and about a quarter of employees continue to express  dissatisfaction with their training. Some employees told us that though  they believed SBA University was a positive gesture to show that the  agency would invest in training, they felt that many of the courses did not  adequately prepare them to carry out their job responsibilities. Other  employees told us that they were overqualified for some of the courses  and would have benefited from more advanced training.", "SBA officials acknowledged that SBA University was a first step in  developing a training program. They told us that SBA had not developed a  training curriculum in recent years because of limited budgetary resources  but that the agency was in the process of developing a curriculum focusing  on core competencies needed for SBA\u2019s mission-critical positions. As  noted in SBA\u2019s 2007 Human Capital Plan, SBA has identified six mission- critical occupations including (1) leadership (such as members of the  Senior Executive Service and district directors); (2) lender relations and  business development specialists; (3) contracts specialists, procurement  analysts, and contracting officers; (4) loan specialists; (5) human  resources specialists; and (6) information technology specialists.  According to SBA officials, SBA has begun to develop core courses for the  leadership and acquisition-related occupations. For example, SBA has  developed a plan for leadership succession, including strategies for  developing leaders, an implementation schedule, and an evaluation  monitoring plan. They said that they started developing curriculums for  these two occupations first partly because courses were available through  external training resources. SBA officials stated that they planned to  develop core curriculums to address the skills for the other mission- critical occupations. SBA officials told us that they have been working  with the Office of Field Operations and subject matter experts in the  district offices to identify the core competencies for the mission-critical  occupations in the district offices. In addition, they plan to review  individual development plans prepared by employees to identify training  needs. Officials said that one of the challenges of developing and  delivering training is ensuring that competent instructors with the right  skills are available to teach courses\u2014especially because vendors with the  appropriate subject matter expertise may not be available to deliver the  training. They added that while they started with acquisition-related and  leadership curriculums, the next core courses probably would be for  business development specialists.", "SBA also has created an Executive Development Council that provides  direction, oversight and support for the development of leaders within  SBA and development of employees at all levels of the organization.  According to the council\u2019s February 2008 charter, it will create a vision of  development for SBA and design a developmental strategy that supports  SBA\u2019s mission and strategic goals.", "Though SBA has taken several positive steps related to training and  development, SBA has not yet documented a comprehensive and strategic  approach to training in a training plan. SBA\u2019s Human Capital Plan  describes the agency\u2019s training and development initiatives\u2014specifically,  it describes the SBA University initiative as designed to advance and  integrate employee learning with other critical business functions\u2014but it  does not provide any details on how and when training would be  delivered. And while SBA\u2019s Fiscal Year 2009 Performance Plan notes that  the agency will design and institutionalize its long-term plan for the SBA  University, this effort is still under way. Our previous work has shown that  adequate planning allows agencies to establish priorities and determine  the best ways to leverage investments to improve performance. For  instance, a documented training plan would link the core competencies  and mission-critical positions with specific goals, strategies, and  milestones for developing and implementing core courses. A training plan  can also present a business case for proposed training and development  investments, including linkages with the agency\u2019s strategic objectives,  anticipated benefits, and projected costs. Without a plan for the rest of  SBA\u2019s core curriculum, SBA lacks some accountability for ensuring that  the training efforts would continue to be implemented.

For example, select district office employees have begun assisting the  loan centers with their loan and customer service functions, such as  helping lenders prepare guaranty purchase requests. District offices also  now have a formal role in providing disaster assistance. SBA defines  district office roles and responsibilities through the annual compliance  goals and requirements on the district office scorecards, but district  offices can determine what actions they need to take to meet their goals,  particularly in marketing and outreach.

More specifically, SBA has created discrete roles for district  offices to assist the loan centers in working with lenders. For example, as  part of an SBA initiative to address problems arising from its centralization  efforts at the NGPC, in February 2008, designated district office employees  received training on the guaranty purchase process so that they could help  lenders prepare complete and high-quality packages. (We discuss the  changes related to centralized loan processing in more detail later in this  report.)", "SBA also has established a joint marketing and customer service initiative  between the Office of Capital Access and the district offices to develop a  targeted and focused approach to marketing and outreach to the top  lenders nationwide and in each district. According to SBA, the purpose of  this initiative is to engage the top lenders, ensure that their purchase  request packages and other loan paperwork are being processed in a  timely manner and that SBA is responsive to their concerns, and identify  opportunities to increase SBA lending activities. According to SBA, the  guaranty purchase training and joint marketing and customer service  initiatives are not new roles but are in line with the district office\u2019s current  roles and responsibilities. These initiatives have provided district offices  with regular and concrete interactions with lenders, which the district  office employees we interviewed said they had lost as a result of  centralization.", "District offices also now have a more formalized support role in providing  disaster assistance than they did previously. Under SBA\u2019s 2007 Disaster  Recovery Plan, district offices will provide \u201csurge capacity\u201d for large  disasters (on scales approaching or exceeding the 2005 Gulf Coast  hurricanes, which was the highest level of catastrophic disaster activity  that SBA has faced to date) by helping process loan applications.  According to the plan, district offices also would be responsible for  conducting local media outreach and coordinating local resources. All of  the district offices we visited had employees who received disaster  assistance training. Some of the employees in these offices found this  training informative. However, some employees expressed concern about  the availability of future training and refresher courses because it might be  several years before the next large-scale disaster occurred. Prior to the  creation of the plan, district office employees volunteered to help process  disaster loans on an ad hoc basis, and some employees we interviewed  indicated that they had volunteered to work on the backlog of applications  from victims of the Gulf Coast hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma.  However, we previously found that during the Gulf Coast hurricanes, SBA  did not have a centralized and coordinated strategy for drawing upon  district office staff resources, which contributed to the large backlog of  disaster loan applications the agency experienced.", "As the overall function of the district offices has changed, the roles of  individual employees also have changed and some employees continue to  face challenges adjusting to their revised responsibilities. In the shift from  loan-related functions to marketing and outreach, SBA removed the loan  officer and loan servicing specialist positions from the district offices. The  agency reclassified these employees primarily into one of two positions:  lender relations specialist or business development specialist (see fig. 5).  Lender relations specialists are responsible for conducting outreach to  lenders through visits and training on SBA\u2019s programs. Business  development specialists are responsible for marketing SBA\u2019s programs;  conducting outreach to businesses and other economic development and  community organizations, such as local chambers of commerce;  conducting training, counseling, and technical assistance; and performing  compliance activities. As part of their primary responsibilities, business  development specialists also might have specific collateral duties in  support of the office\u2019s oversight, such as conducting annual reviews of  8(a) firms, and coordination of SBA\u2019s programs and resource partners. The  position descriptions contain a checklist of these duties, such as lead  contact positions for SBA\u2019s resource partners. For example, in one office  we visited, one business development specialist also served as the 8(a)  business development and point of contact for the Historically  Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) program. Another business  development specialist was the point of contact for the WBC and was also  responsible for lender training.

Some of the employees said that they had performed  marketing and outreach to some degree prior to centralization but that  these functions were now their primary focus. Employees we interviewed  indicated that since the loan functions had been centralized, their work  had become less structured, provided fewer tangible accomplishments,  and provided less regular interaction with lenders. Their new  responsibilities also required them to travel more than they had  previously. These changes have challenged some employees more than  others, particularly those employees who used to process loans. However,  SBA officials in the Office of Field Operations indicated that the new roles  were meant to encompass more than one function and some district office  employees concurred that they were now expected to be generalists rather  than specialists. Moreover, SBA\u2019s recent initiatives to refine the district  office roles might provide district office staff with more tangible  accomplishments and interaction with lenders. However, the business  development specialists who conduct the 8(a) annual reviews said that  their roles had not changed as a result of transformation, but that for  some, the number of firms for which they were responsible had  increased. Moreover, because of the emphasis on compliance  requirements in the PMF, the significant amounts of time they spent  meeting goals for annual reviews left them little time to work with clients  to develop their businesses.

However, the district directors in the  district offices we visited generally indicated that SBA gives them the  flexibility to determine the actions they need to take to achieve their  scorecard goals and tailor activities to their local markets. For example,  district directors indicated that they can determine the number and types  of events their employees should attend to market SBA\u2019s programs.

Most of the offices we  visited indicated that their staffing levels had decreased substantially after  the transformation began due to factors such as reassignments, attrition,  buyouts, and retirements and that these decreased staffing levels, at times,  strained their ability to carry out their mission. According to SBA data on  staff, by 2009, 34 percent of staff will be eligible to retire in fiscal year  2009, and according to an SBA official, half of those are in the district  offices. However, the views on whether office staffing levels were  adequate enough to meet district office goals and other responsibilities  were mixed. Some district directors believed that they had enough staff  resources to carry out their responsibilities, while others believed they  could use additional employees. SBA uses a field staffing model that is  based on factors such as market size and the number of 8(a) firms in a  district to staff district offices. District directors in several offices  appreciated the greater transparency the current model provided over the  old one, in which a board met in closed sessions to make staffing  decisions. However, some district directors believed that the model was  not fully in tune with their resource needs. For example, several district  directors said that while they had some flexibility in assigning specific  responsibilities to staff to meet local market needs, they could not control  the actual staffing process or ensure that positions were staffed  effectively. In several locations, employees we interviewed noted that the  agency did not have a succession plan for the district offices. As a result of  operating with fewer staff, individual employees at district offices  indicated that their workloads had increased and that they often found  themselves taking on multiple responsibilities for which they did not  always receive training because there were not enough individuals  available to do any one function.

The circumstances at the time of the  NGPC and 7(a) loan guaranty processing centralizations, including  budgetary pressures and leadership, were dissimilar in some respects.   However, based on our meetings with SBA and review of documentation,  it appears that SBA\u2019s standard 7(a) loan guaranty processing centralization  was better planned and implemented than the NGPC centralization. First,  there was greater transparency and communication about the 7(a) loan  guaranty processing centralization across the agency. SBA sent all  employees a notice of this centralization, as well as an implementation  schedule. In contrast, district office staff in some offices we visited  indicated that there had been limited communication regarding the  implementation of the NGPC centralization. Second, the 7(a) loan  guaranty processing centralization took place in phases\u2014with the transfer  of loan files from district offices to the center occurring between  December 2006 and March 2007\u2014unlike the NGPC centralization, in  which all district offices sent their files to NGPC at once. Third, SBA  appears to have based staffing levels for the 7(a) loan guaranty processing  center on workload analyses and did not use directed reassignments to  staff the center, as it did with the NGPC, which helped mitigate negative  employee morale issues. Both lenders and district office employees have  indicated that they have had positive experiences with the Standard 7(a)  Loan Guaranty Processing Center.", "While the initial implementation of the NGPC lacked transparency,  communication regarding the activities at the NGPC\u2014including the  ongoing re-engineering reforms (to be discussed later in this section)\u2014has  improved since the center was first formed. The Office of Financial  Assistance, which manages SBA\u2019s loan programs, holds monthly  conference calls with employees across the agency to discuss the NGPC  re-engineering efforts, participates in Office of Field Operations  conference calls, briefs field managers at agencywide management  conferences, and reports weekly to the Administrator on the center\u2019s  progress. The NGPC also has a Campaign Advisory Board that includes  district office and regional representatives to provide input and feedback  on the re-engineering efforts. For example, according to SBA, the field  representatives on the Campaign Advisory Board suggested the customer  support role, in which employees of district offices now help lenders  prepare their guaranty purchase applications. While some district office  employees and lenders continue to experience communication issues with  NGPC in terms of responsiveness, they indicated that overall  communication with NGPC has improved."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SBA Has Started to Assess Its Centralization Initiatives and Re-engineer Center Operations but Has Not Yet Developed Measures to Track the Quality of Its Purchase Reviews", "paragraphs": ["Since SBA completed its centralization efforts, the agency has shifted its  focus to re-engineering the operations of its centers, beginning with the  NGPC. Through its re-engineering efforts\u2014which have been designed to  enhance workflow, redesign processes, and streamline procedures\u2014SBA  has taken actions to improve many of the problems that occurred as a  result of the implementation of the NGPC centralization in 2004, such as  the backlogs of files and inadequate staffing levels for loan specialist  positions, which delayed the NGPC decisions on lender\u2019s requests for  guaranty purchases on defaulted loans. One key aspect of the re- engineering effort is the Brand Promise Restored (BPR) Campaign, which  seeks to restore SBA\u2019s reputation with lenders who have been frustrated  by these delays and a lack of responsiveness on the part of NGPC staff to  their concerns. The BPR\u2019s key objectives, based on the recommendations  of an outside consulting firm and input from various stakeholders within  SBA, including district offices, are to reduce the center\u2019s backlog of more  than 4,000 loans; improve purchase review and decision turnaround times;  and reduce lender errors in submitting applications (thereby improving the  completeness of loan packages so that files are not sent back to lenders  due to errors); and improve customer service.", "Furthermore, SBA has established performance measures to assess the  progress of its re-engineering effort at the NGPC. In a weekly report to the  Administrator and senior management officials, the NGPC provides  information on measures such as reductions in backlogs, production  targets for new purchase requests, and turnaround times. The NGPC also  tracks measures related to district office assistance to lenders in preparing  purchase requests and improving the completeness of files that the center  receives, including the rate at which purchase applications can be  reviewed without having to be sent back to lenders for revisions. SBA said  that its other loan centers have similar performance measures, but the  performance measures may differ in certain respects due to differing  functions. For example, the Standard 7(a) Loan Guaranty Processing  Center has a separate set of measures that are similar, including cycle  times for completing processing functions and monthly production  outputs, but that have different targets, such as a processing turnaround  goal of 6 days rather than 45 days for the NGPC. Finally, because  reforming NGPC was such a key priority within SBA, the center  established weekly milestones that included steps such as pilot testing the  new guaranty purchase manual, which were reported to the Administrator.", "The SBA OIG indicated that the NGPC has improved the efficiency of its  guaranty purchase process as a result of its re-engineering and BPR effort.  In its 2007 audit of the guaranty purchase process, the OIG made six  recommendations, including that the center develop a plan to improve the  quality of the purchase reviews and ensure adequate supervisory review  and require loan officers to document their purchase decisions. According  to the OIG, SBA has closed all but one recommendation, which relates to  the recovery of certain improper purchase payments. Moreover, SBA  indicated that it had increased the staffing levels for the NGPC from about  40 to about 100 (including contractors) based on a staffing model the  agency developed to address the OIG\u2019s recommendation that the agency  fully staff the NGPC at the appropriate level.  Finally, SBA indicated that is  has cleared the backlog or pre-purchase reviews and most of its backlog of  secondary market purchases since the BPR campaign began.", "While SBA has established process-oriented measures, it is still developing  its quality assurance process and has not established measures  management routinely track to assess the effectiveness of its guaranty  purchase process and resulting decisions. The measures the center does  use relate to the front-end completeness of files lenders submit to the  NGPC, rather than the quality of purchase decisions. SBA officials told us  they have a quality assurance initiative under way that should address  some of the deficiencies in their quality assurance process but that this  effort is still in its initial stages. The NGPC currently controls for quality by  using the \u201crule of 3,\u201d in which the recommendation for each purchase  decision made by a loan specialist is reviewed by an \u201capprover\u201d and legal  counsel before it is finalized. To encourage quality purchase reviews, SBA  officials said its performance review process for loan specialists includes  standards that measure how well loan specialists conduct reviews, with  respect to accuracy, for example, by tracking how often their  recommendations have to be substantially revised. The center also uses a  \u201ctriage process\u201d to ensure that the most complex cases are handled by the  most experienced loan specialists. According to SBA, the goal of its quality  assurance review initiative is to create a system that routinely examines all  parts of the loan process to identify where in the loan process most errors  occur. SBA officials also said they hope to remove the variability out of the  purchase process, though there will always be some level of employee  judgment involved. SBA officials said that its efforts under the Improper  Payments Information Act of 2002 established a baseline on its error rate  for improper payments for 7(a) guaranty purchases and that this  information is used to measure and improve the quality of guaranty  purchase reviews.", "While the OIG has noted improvements in the NGPC\u2019s operations, it also  has expressed to us ongoing concerns about the quality of purchase  decisions at the NGPC, particularly with respect to the incidence of  improper purchase payments. SBA\u2019s review of lender requests for guaranty  purchases on defaulted loans is an important tool for assessing lender  compliance on individual loans and protecting SBA from making  erroneous purchase payments. According to the OIG\u2019s 2008 management  challenges report, past OIG audits of early defaulted loans and SBA\u2019s  guaranty purchase process have shown that SBA has not consistently been  able to detect lenders\u2019 failures to administer SBA loans in compliance with  SBA requirements and prudent lending practices, resulting in improper  payments. For example, in a May 2007 audit of the guaranty purchase  process, the OIG estimated that the rate of improper payments for all 7(a)  loans that received a purchase review at the NGPC from October 1, 2004,  through May 31, 2005, could be 17 percent (approximately $36 million).  This estimated rate is substantially higher than the 1.56 percent that SBA  reported for the 7(a) program in fiscal year 2006. SBA disagreed with the  OIG\u2019s estimate because it covered a different time period and because it  did not believe that the sample used by the OIG was representative of  SBA\u2019s entire 7(a) loan portfolio. In general, both estimates are difficult to  compare because they covered different time periods and employed  different sampling methods. Additionally, neither estimate incorporates  reviews of purchase decisions completed under the recently re-engineered  guaranty purchase process. The OIG has an ongoing audit of SBA\u2019s  compliance with the Improper Payment Information Act that it expects to  complete in February 2009 and continues to express concern that SBA  may underreport its improper payment rate. In 2006, the OIG surveyed the  NGPC\u2019s existing quality assurance review  process, which was designed to  provide SBA with valid reviews, independent of the purchase approval  process, to ensure the proper interpretation and consistent  implementation of policies and procedures and consistent and accurate  guaranty purchase decisions, thereby minimizing losses from improper  payments. The OIG found that under SBA\u2019s quality assurance review  process at the time, SBA reviewed a number of loan purchase decisions,  that may have been sufficient to assess compliance with the Improper  Payments Information Act of 2002 but did not adequately cover the high- risk loan categories identified in their former quality assurance review  plan. As a result, the OIG found that the NGPC was unable to ensure with  any degree of reliability that guaranty purchase decisions made by the  NGPC staff were complete, consistent, and accurate. We also previously  found that this type of management challenge could increase the risk of  improper payments. The NGPC does not have this quality assurance  review process at this time because of SBA\u2019s ongoing effort to replace and  improve its quality assurance review process for all of its centers.", "SBA has efforts under way to improve its quality assurance review process  but without measures focused on the quality of its purchase review  process that management tracks regularly, SBA will not be able to assess  whether its re-engineered process is also successful in producing  appropriate purchase decisions that are in compliance with laws and  regulations. According to the Government Performance and Results Act of  1993, agencies should develop a range of performance indicators, such as  quantity, quality, timeliness, cost, and outcome, to help managers balance  their priorities among several agency goals. Moreover, the creation and  review of performance indicators help strengthen an agency\u2019s internal  control standards, which help to ensure both the effectiveness and  efficiency of an agency\u2019s operations. Reliance on any single type of  measure could create a perverse incentive for managers to achieve one  subgoal at the expense of the others. For example, without a measure that  reflects the quality assurance, managers and employees at the NGPC could  focus more on the turnaround time measures, and consequently, the  quality of the purchase reviews could suffer leading to improper payments."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["SBA\u2019s earlier efforts to restructure or transform agency operations have  had some associated adverse effects on SBA employee morale and  operations. However, in the past 2 years SBA has made progress in  addressing these negative effects\u2014by applying key practices that support  successful transformations to improve agency operations and taking  actions to address the recommendations we made in our 2003 report. The  Administrator appointed in 2006 emphasized the importance of  transparency in his reform agenda, made a concerted effort to improve  communications across the agency, and engaged employees in improving  the agency. Our meetings with employees affirmed that these efforts had a  positive effect on many employees. We also found that though SBA had  also taken some actions to obtain feedback and ideas from employees,  many employees we interviewed, including union officials, continued to  feel that SBA\u2019s management did not sufficiently consider their ideas and  concerns. SBA recently conducted focus groups to better understand  employee concerns, specifically explored the concerns about employee  involvement, and plans to implement pilot initiatives to address them.  Such actions are important because a feeling of lack of involvement can  affect employee productivity and job satisfaction and could hinder SBA\u2019s  ability to meet goals and improve its operations. We also note that many  employees were concerned about the continuation of key efforts  undertaken under Administrator Preston. Senior SBA career officials  stated that continuing positive efforts was important to the agency and  have taken steps to identify such efforts and institutionalize them. Such  long-term commitments by senior leaders are important for ensuring that  transformation and agency reforms are successful.", "SBA\u2019s 2007 employee survey results suggest that recent actions, such as  improving communication and training, have had a positive impact on  employees, but also point to continuing concerns about these issues. SBA  has recognized the need to provide better training\u2014another area of  continued concern for employees\u2014to support employees whose roles and  responsibilities changed as a result of transformation. Specifically, the  creation of SBA University in 2007 was an important action not only in  terms of providing training and demonstrating that the agency was willing  to commit resources to invest in the development of employees. SBA  officials also have been developing a training program that includes core  curriculums for different staff positions. However, SBA has not developed  a strategic training plan that lays out goals, strategies, and milestones. In  an environment of constrained budgets and reduced staff resources,  training is a key means to maximize or leverage the talents and skills of  employees. A strategic plan would help to establish priorities and  determine the best ways to leverage training investments to improve  performance. In addition, a plan that is shared with employees could  assure them that SBA continues to be committed to developing its  employees.", "The most dramatic effects of transformation occurred in SBA\u2019s district  offices. In some ways, transformation still is occurring in the district  offices as their roles and responsibilities continue to evolve. For instance,  SBA recently determined that district offices still could have a role in the  guaranty purchase review process, despite the centralization of this  function. But the recent changes have introduced other concerns. In  particular, district office employees continue to experience some  frustration as they adjust to their new responsibilities and work toward  achieving their goals with fewer resources. As SBA continues to adjust  priorities and operations to achieve its goals, employing key practices  relating to communications and employee involvement will position the  agency in good stead in this area, as well.", "The centralization of the remaining loan functions previously performed  by district offices was another key aspect of SBA\u2019s transformation and  those initiatives have been completed. But the functioning of the centers\u2014 particularly the NGPC\u2014represents a work in progress. SBA recently has  re-engineered the guaranty purchase process and center operations and  developed measures to track progress. The emphasis has been on  improving the efficiency of the guaranty process because of the need to  reduce significant backlogs and the desire to provide good customer  service to lenders. SBA said that it has been developing a new quality  assurance review process and that its performance reviews of loan  specialists also rates them on the accuracy of their reviews, but it has not  yet developed any performance measures that management uses regularly  to track the quality of its purchase reviews. However, performance  measures focused on timeliness and volume, without a similar focus on  quality in the purchase review process, could provide the wrong incentives  for managers and employees and ultimately could result in improper  payments and increased costs to the program. The OIG also has noted  concerns about SBA\u2019s purchase reviews and believes that SBA\u2019s improper  payment rate for its purchased guaranties may be much higher than what  SBA currently reports. By focusing on the quality of purchase reviews and  developing measures that track the quality of purchase decisions, SBA  could help better ensure that the process produces decisions that are well  supported, defensible, and balance the needs of lenders with the need to  enforce requirements that protect the integrity of the loan guaranty  process and prevent improper payments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making two recommendations to the Administrator of SBA:    To support SBA\u2019s development of a core curriculum for SBA University  and communicate SBA\u2019s training development efforts to employees, SBA  should develop a strategic training plan with specific goals, strategies, and  milestones.", "To ensure that its streamlined purchase guaranty process also provides an  incentive to focus on quality and thereby results in good purchase  decisions, SBA should develop performance measures that will provide  information on the quality of its guaranty purchase reviews."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to SBA for review and comment.

In addition to agreeing to our recommendation to  develop measures that focus on the quality of purchase reviews, SBA  stated that the NGPC will continue to build on the quality processes in  place and is developing new quality assurance review plans for NGPC and  other processing centers that will be implemented during fiscal year 2009.   Specifically, SBA provided additional information on how it measures  quality in its processes for reviewing, recommending, and approving  guaranty purchases.  For example, NGPC tracks the number of work items  of its loan specialists returned for substantial revision and randomly  samples processed guaranty purchase disbursements to test them for  accuracy.  SBA stated that this information helps to identify areas where  training is needed and ultimately contributes to improving the quality of its  reviews.  Though these actions were not reflected in the NGPC weekly  management reports provided to us and therefore it is unclear to what  extent these measures are regularly tracked by SBA management, we  agree that these actions help SBA improve the quality of its purchase  reviews.

Specifically, we focused on (1) SBA\u2019s progress in  transforming agency operations and addressing GAO\u2019s recommendations  on key practices for successful transformation, (2) how SBA has  addressed the impacts of transformation on its employees, (3) how SBA  has defined the roles and responsibilities of its district offices, and (4)  SBA\u2019s efforts to assess its initiatives for centralization of its loan functions  and how its approach for implementing centralization has changed since  transformation began.", "To respond to these objectives overall, we reviewed agency planning and  implementation documents related to SBA\u2019s transformation and  interviewed key officials at SBA headquarters in Washington, D.C., to  obtain information about their roles and experiences with SBA  transformation initiatives. SBA officials we met with included the SBA  Acting Administrator (formerly Deputy Administrator), Chief of Staff, and  senior officials representing the Office of Human Capital Management, the  Office of Field Operations, the Office of Capital Access, and the  Performance Management Office. In conducting our work, we focused on  the transformation process itself and its impacts, rather than on making  assessments of SBA\u2019s administration of its various programs. To obtain  documentary and testimonial information about district office involvement  and experiences with various SBA transformation initiatives, we  interviewed district directors and groups of employees from 10 of SBA\u2019s 68  district offices. To provide national coverage, one district office was  selected from each of SBA\u2019s 10 geographical regions. These district offices  were located in California, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Montana, New Jersey,  Oregon, Texas, Vermont, and Virginia. In addition, we conducted site visits  to the National Guaranty Purchase Center in Herndon, Virginia, and the  Standard 7(a) Loan Processing Center in Citrus Heights, California, to  observe and collect information and experiences about SBA\u2019s  centralization initiatives. We visited the National Guaranty Purchase  Center because it was the first centralization effort completed under  transformation and the Standard 7(a) Loan Processing Center because it  was SBA\u2019s most recent (and last) centralization completed under  transformation to be able to compare and contrast SBA\u2019s approaches to  the two efforts. During both our district office and loan center site visits  we held two meetings\u2014-one with the offices\u2019 directors followed by a  group interview with office employees. All office employees were eligible  to participate in the meetings. We requested that the employee meeting be  open to all staff based on availability and also that the office director could  recommend staff for participation. We further requested that the group  interview with employees be conducted without the presence of  management. We also met with officials from SBA\u2019s Office of Inspector  General (OIG) to discuss any audit results or major challenges related to  the agency\u2019s transformation initiatives. Finally, we discussed the effect of  transformation on lenders and staff with, respectively, representatives of a  lenders\u2019 organization and SBA union officials. Questions prepared for the  interviews, as well as the information obtained from them, were used to  address issues related to each of our reporting objectives.", "To determine SBA\u2019s progress on its transformation initiatives since 2002,  its actions to implement key practices that are important to successful  organizational transformation, and how the agency\u2019s emphasis evolved  over time, we reviewed and analyzed past GAO reports, SBA\u2019s responses  to GAO report recommendations, agency documents, and SBA OIG  reports. In particular, we looked at differences and similarities between  the new Administrator\u2019s reform agenda and the prior Administrator\u2019s  transformation initiatives. In addition to examining district offices\u2019  involvement and implementation of transformation activities, we reviewed  the approaches SBA took on its transformation, management\u2019s leadership  of transformation efforts, positive and negative consequences of  transformation, internal coordination, communication, performance  management, and training. We reviewed documentation such as SBA  rosters identifying the transformation leadership and implementation team  members and their specific responsibilities; relevant SBA transformation  policy and procedures; examples of communication modes used (type and  frequency); and employee surveys. In particular, we reviewed agency  documents and interviewed SBA management officials and employees to  determine whether SBA has implemented the recommendations made in  GAO\u2019s October 2003 transformation report noted above, which was based  on best practices for mergers and transformation identified by GAO. In  addition, we obtained and analyzed    SBA documents related to its new performance management system;   current and previous scorecards that track the performance of agency  components relative to the specific goals on which they are measured;    operating plans that lay out strategies to achieve goals; information illustrating lines of communication and areas covered (for  example, press, marketing, Web development, speechwriting, strategic  alliances with external parties such as trade groups, and multimedia);  and  the agency\u2019s communications plan that discusses its approach for  addressing internal and external communication, along with  descriptions of the responsibilities of its Office of Communication and  Public Liaison, Office of Management and Administration, the Office of  the Congressional Liaison, and the intergovernmental group.", "We analyzed the information we obtained from these document reviews  and interviews to determine    what actions SBA has taken to incorporate key practices and  implementation steps for organizational transformations,    whether SBA\u2019s transformation laid out goals for the transformation,   what communication strategies SBA used to promote frequent two-way  communication at all levels of the agency and with stakeholders,    what actions SBA has taken to involve employees and ensure that their  concerns and ideas are considered,    how SBA has aligned its transformation activities to achieve agency  performance and strategic goals, and    how SBA\u2019s performance management system linked overall agency  goals to individual goals.", "To assess how SBA has addressed the impacts of its transformation  activities on employees, we discussed this matter in interviews with  officials from the various headquarters officers, the district office  directors, and groups of employees at the 10 district offices we selected.  The number of participants in our employee group interviews ranged from  5 to 12 (and represented from about 21 percent to 100 percent of the  employees assigned to the various locations). While the limited number of  offices we visited is too small for generalizing the information obtained to  all district offices, the recurring nature of the observations and  perspectives expressed across these offices, along with other material we  examined, suggest that these views were not limited to the offices we  visited. To distinguish specific activities affecting employees as a result of  transformation, we reviewed materials that included SBA\u2019s fiscal year 2007  Human Capital Plan, Information and Technology Strategic Plan, fiscal  year 2007 Annual Performance Report, fiscal year 2009 congressional  submission (for budget), the performance management framework, and  the SBA OIG\u2019s Most Serious Management Issues Reports for fiscal years  2005, 2006, and 2007. We also analyzed results from the Office of  Personnel Management\u2019s (OPM) 2004 and 2006 Federal Human Capital  Surveys of SBA staff and SBA\u2019s 2007 Annual Employee Survey to help  identify specific impacts of transformation on employees and the effect of  actions SBA had taken to address those impacts. In particular, we  examined such areas as employee morale, training, communication, and  employee involvement in decisionmaking\u2014to the extent they were  relevant to our prior 2003 report\u2019s recommendations. To assess the  reliability of the OPM survey data and SBA\u2019s 2007 survey, we discussed the  conduct of these surveys with knowledgeable OPM officials. We also  obtained a copy of SBA\u2019s 2007 survey data set and replicated selected  survey results. We determined that these survey data were sufficiently  reliable for purposes of this report.", "For determining how and to what extent SBA has defined the roles and  responsibilities of district offices, we used information from the interviews  we conducted. We also obtained and reviewed documentation related to  the roles and responsibilities of district office staff before and after  transformation and reform agenda activities.
