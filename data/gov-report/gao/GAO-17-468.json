According to an Office of the Deputy for Force Training official, the working group held its first meeting in January 2017 and a second meeting in February 2017. According to that official, the Office of the Deputy for Force Training is in the process of developing future working group meeting agendas to discuss topics such as validating training requirements. In addition, some of the military services have taken steps to review and validate common military training. For example, according to officials, the Navy and Marine Corps annually review and validate mandatory training requirements, while the Army reviews and validates mandatory training requirements biennially or as directed.

According to estimates provided by service officials, it would take an individual less than 20 hours to complete all common military training requirements. Nevertheless, the military services are taking steps to reduce training time for some mandatory training requirements by updating their guidance, combining similar training topics, and eliminating redundancies.

Although DOD Instruction 1322.31  does not require the services to independently review and validate  common military training core curriculums, some military service officials  we interviewed indicated that common military training requirements are  generally accepted as validated requirements because they appear in  DOD guidance. Each service has published guidance that contains  information on what steps it employs to review and validate mandatory  training requirements. Service guidance also contains information on the  offices, committees, or steering groups that play a key role in reviewing  and validating mandatory training requirements.

The Common Military Training Working Group charter directs the group to  review common military training requirements for effectiveness. However,  as of March 2017, the group had not yet begun to evaluate training. A  former official in the Office of the Deputy for Force Training said that  evaluation of training was an important but difficult task, and discussed  two approaches that he intended the working group to consider to  evaluate whether training is effective: (1) measuring whether individuals  have completed training; and (2) assessing the outcome of training from  the trainer\u2019s perspective.", "We found that some military service boards and committees have made  independent efforts to assess the effectiveness of their respective  mandatory military training courses, including common military training.  For example, in 2015 the Army Mandatory Training Task Force evaluated  the accessibility and effectiveness of current training materials. The  charter of the Navy Planning Board for Training calls for it to review the  impact of the annual requirements. Air Force Instruction 36-2201 directs  the Air Force Learning Committee to monitor the mandatory training  impact and improve the focus, currency, and relevancy of its curriculums  and training.

According to Navy officials, these topics were redundant under the Command Indoctrination Program and  were already required as annual training by most Navy commands.", "Some of the 11 common military training proponents have also made  independent efforts to assess the effectiveness of their respective  courses. Officials from 6 proponents with whom we spoke stated that they  had previously made efforts to assess the effectiveness of their  mandatory training requirements; officials from 1 proponent stated that  they would conduct an assessment in the future; and officials from the  remaining 4 stated that they had not evaluated training. For example, the  Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office conducted surveys in  2010, 2012, 2014, and 2016 to assess the effectiveness of the sexual  assault and sexual harassment training received by servicemembers,  according to an official from that office. The Defense Suicide Prevention  Office states in its strategic plan that it will evaluate the efficacy of suicide  prevention programs. The DOD Strategy for Suicide Prevention states  that DOD will use evidence-based training curriculums and periodically  review, evaluate, and update these curriculums. Other proponents have  taken steps to assess the amount of knowledge that individuals gain from  training in order to make adjustments as needed to the training courses  offered. For example, the Combating Trafficking in Persons training  contains a survey at the end of the computer-based version of the course.  A proponent official said that the results of the survey data are used to  make updates to training based on participant feedback.

The DOD Instruction does not state which method of  delivery the military services must use to complete training requirements.  For example, according to an official in the Office of the Deputy Chief of  Staff (G-3/5/7), current policy states that all mandatory training  requirements must have alternative methods of delivery that do not rely  solely on on-line, computer-based delivery. Some services\u2019 guidance  provides instruction on course delivery methods that individuals could use  and commanders could apply at their discretion to complete mandatory  training requirements. For example, Marine Corps Bulletin 1500 cites the  Marine Corps\u2019 distance learning system and commander-led unit training  as delivery methods that may be considered. According to OPNAV  Instruction 1500.22H, the Navy offers command-discretion training in  which commanders have multiple options for topic delivery, such as  locally generated or standardized training products, and, in cases of  complete discretionary training, local commanders may determine when  and how training is provided.

Additionally, military  service personnel we interviewed said that servicemembers prefer  computer-based training because it allows them to complete training  requirements in a shorter period and avoid hours of classroom  instruction. However, personnel at other units stated that there were  disadvantages to computer-based training, such as losing the impact that  unit leaders provide, having to repeat the same training subject each  year, and not retaining as much information as they would from  discussions in classroom-style courses.

However, an official in the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff (G-3/5/7)  said that the time it takes soldiers to complete either computer-based or  face-to-face training varies greatly based on such factors as computer  availability, pre-test options, instructors, and audiences. Therefore, it is  difficult to estimate averages. One servicemember anecdotally remarked  that completion of common military training takes about 8 hours, while  another said it takes from 1 to 3 hours, per month.

According to Navy guidance from July  2016, the Navy continued to reduce mandatory training requirements in  fiscal year 2017 and placed additional control at the discretion of local  command leadership. The Air Force issued a memo in August 2016  outlining steps to address training demands such as establishing a task  force to streamline training, among other things, and focusing on  computer-based training requirements and their effect on the force. Some  air wings at Air Combat Command and the Air Force Global Strike  Command recently issued guidance that allows unit commanders to  provide some mandatory training courses in a briefing format to  accomplish training and enhance efficiencies. Most recently, the Marine  Corps published an updated version of its mandatory training  requirements in the Marine Corps Bulletin in September 2016. In addition  to updating guidance, a Marine Corps Training and Education Command  official noted that the Marine Corps has reduced mandatory training  requirements since 2015 by an estimated 7.0 hours by consolidating  stand-alone classes addressing Child Abuse, Domestic Violence, Combat  Operational Stress Control, Substance Abuse, Family Advocacy, and  Suicide Prevention with the Unit Marine Awareness and Prevention  Integrated Training. According to Marine Corps officials, the Marine  Corps\u2019 2017 transition to leader-led, discussion-based training for specific  annual training requirements could reduce the time needed to conduct  training, as it takes less time to refresh Marines on topics that were  covered in detail during entry-level training."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We are not making recommendations in this report.
