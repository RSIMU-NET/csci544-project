Enhancements to the NSC's capabilities following the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the effects of Hurricane Katrina were factors that contributed to these delays. Given the delivery delays, the Coast Guard must continue to rely on HECs that are becoming increasingly unreliable. Coast Guard officials said that the first NSC's capabilities will be greater than those of an HEC; however, the Coast Guard cannot determine the extent to which the NSC's capabilities will exceed those of the HECs until the NSC's support assets are operational, which will take several years. To mitigate these operational gaps, the Coast Guard plans to upgrade its HECs and use existing aircraft and small boats until unmanned aircraft and new small boats are operational, but because the mitigation plans are not yet finalized, the costs are largely unknown. Also, the Coast Guard has not yet completed operational requirements for the unmanned aircraft or new small boats. As a result, the Coast Guard has not determined the cost of the HEC upgrade plan or the operational gap created by the delay in fielding new support assets for the NSC. The Coast Guard's logistics support plans for its transition to the NSC from the HEC are not finalized, and it has not yet fully determined transition costs. The contractor developed the initial NSC logistics plans, but Coast Guard officials said the plans lacked needed details, such as how the contractor would support the NSC after it becomes fully operational, and so, in 2007, the Coast Guard took over logistics planning. Coast Guard acquisition guidance states that an Integrated Logistics Support Plan should be completed by the time production of an asset is started. Although the first NSC has already been delivered, the Coast Guard has not yet finalized this plan, but expects to do so by October 2009. While the Coast Guard has developed an interim plan, it did not commit to including required logistics support documents to be used or time frames for completing them in the Integrated Logistics Support Plan because it is in the process of determining how to finalize the plan. Ensuring the plan includes these documents and time frames would better prepare the Coast Guard to support the NSC and aid it in making operational decisions given that the Coast Guard has not yet developed a deployment plan or completed cost estimates of the logistics transition from the HEC to the NSC."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Deepwater program is the largest acquisition program in Coast Guard  history\u2014estimated at more than $24 billion\u2014and is intended to replace or  modernize the Coast Guard\u2019s aging vessels, aircraft, and some  communications systems. The first-in-class National Security Cutter (NSC)  Bertholf is undergoing final trials as the Coast Guard prepares it for full  operational service in 2010. We have earlier reported that the Coast Guard  has experienced delays with the delivery of the NSC, and the estimated  production costs of the NSC class have increased from about $3.5 billion  in 2007 to about $4.7 billion in 2009.

To identify any  operational effects from delays in the delivery of the NSC class, we  reviewed the 2007 Deepwater Acquisition Program Baseline and the 2008  NSC Acquisition Plan. We compared the 2007 and 2008 delivery schedules  to measure the effects of delivery delays on the number of NSC  operational days available to the Coast Guard over the next 9 years. We  also analyzed Coast Guard data from fiscal years 2003 through 2008 to  determine the number of HEC operational days available to the Coast  Guard. To assess the reliability of the operational hour and vessel  condition data obtained from the Coast Guard, we reviewed data systems  manuals and directives to ensure that the systems included controls for  maintaining the integrity of the data. We also interviewed officials  knowledgeable about the data and the systems that produced them. On the  basis of our assessments, we determined that the data were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of this report.

At the start  of the Deepwater acquisition, the Coast Guard chose a system-of-systems  strategy that was to replace the legacy assets with an integrated package  of assets, rather than using a traditional acquisition approach of replacing  individual classes of legacy assets through a series of acquisitions. To  carry out this acquisition, the Coast Guard awarded a competitive contract  to a systems integrator, which for the Deepwater program was a  contractor composed of two major companies\u2014Lockheed Martin  Corporation and Northrop Grumman Corporation. Acting as a joint  venture called \u201cIntegrated Coast Guard Systems\u201d (the contractor), these  companies were responsible for designing, constructing, deploying,  supporting, and integrating the various assets to meet projected  Deepwater operational requirements. However, after experiencing a  number of management challenges under the system-of- systems  approach, the Coast Guard recognized that it needed to increase  government oversight and transferred Deepwater system integration and  program management responsibilities, including logistics planning, back to  the Coast Guard in April 2007. Furthermore, when the Coast Guard  assumed the lead role for Deepwater program management, it decided to  consider future work and potential bids on these assets outside of the  existing Deepwater contract. By taking this action, the Coast Guard in  some cases decided to restart the planning and design of the individual  assets. In addition, the Coast Guard took over logistics planning for some  assets from the contractor. For example, the Coast Guard, rather than the  contractor, is now developing the NSC logistics planning documents  including the key logistics document\u2014the Integrated Logistics Support  Plan.", "The Deepwater program represents the largest acquisition in the Coast  Guard\u2019s history, and the program has experienced some serious  performance and management problems, such as cost overruns, schedule  slippages, and assets designed and delivered with significant defects. Since  2001, we have reviewed the Deepwater program and informed Congress,  the Department of Homeland Security, and the Coast Guard of the risks  and uncertainties inherent with the system-of-systems approach. In March  2004, we made recommendations to the Coast Guard to address three  broad areas of concern: improving program management and oversight,  strengthening contractor accountability, and promoting cost control  through greater competition among potential subcontractors. In April  2006, June 2007, and March 2008, we issued follow-on reports describing  the Coast Guard\u2019s efforts to address these recommendations and provided  information on the status of various Deepwater assets, including that the  Coast Guard\u2019s increased management and oversight of the Deepwater  acquisition had resulted in improvements to the program. In June 2008,  we reported on additional changes in Deepwater management and  oversight that resulted in improvements to the program and that the Coast  Guard\u2019s mitigating strategies for the loss of patrol boats were achieving  results in the near term.", "Since the Coast Guard took over the acquisition and management  responsibilities for the Deepwater program from the contractor in 2007, it  has realized that its knowledge of how the various proposed assets would  work together to help meet mission needs were limited because the  contractor, in some cases, had developed the plans for these assets  without using all of the input from the Coast Guard. In 2001, the contractor  completed a study documenting the capabilities, types, and mix of assets  the Coast Guard needed to fulfill its Deepwater missions, referred to as the  Fleet Mix Study. The Coast Guard has initiated a follow-on study to update  the work originally completed by the contractor. The goals of this study  include validating mission performance requirements and revisiting the  number and mix of assets to be procured. The results of this study are  expected in the summer of 2009, at which time Coast Guard leadership  will assess the results and plan for future asset procurement decisions.  According to Coast Guard officials, the Coast Guard plans to update the  Fleet Mix Study every 4 years and, as a result, the Deepwater program may  change in terms of the numbers and types of specific assets needed.", "While the final number may change as a result of the Fleet Mix Study, the  Coast Guard currently is projected to take delivery of a total of eight NSCs  between 2008 and 2017.

The NSC class is to replace  the Coast Guard\u2019s aging HEC class and is to provide several capabilities  that the HECs do not have, such as the ability to collect, analyze, and  transmit classified information; carry, launch, and recover unmanned  aircraft, thereby increasing the cutter\u2019s surveillance capabilities and range;  more easily and safely launch small boats from and return them to the  cutter; and travel away from shore for longer time periods.", "In 2007, the Commandant of the Coast Guard stated that the NSC will be  the most sophisticated and capable cutter the Coast Guard has ever  operated, with vastly improved capabilities over legacy HECs. The more  capable NSCs, for example, are designed to enable the Coast Guard to  screen and target vessels faster, and more safely and reliably before they  arrive in U.S. waters. As a result of the increased capabilities of the NSCs,  the Coast Guard plans to replace 12 HECs with 8 NSCs.

However, the Coast Guard\u2019s system for tracking operational hours captures  hours logged in support of the primary mission that a vessel conducts while on patrol; thus, any  secondary missions that may have been performed on a patrol by these multimission vessels would  not necessarily be reflected in the operational hour data.", "Prior to fiscal year 2005, the Other Law Enforcement mission area contained the Enforcement of  Laws and Treaties-Other employment category which captured those law enforcement activities that  did not fall under drug interdiction, fisheries enforcement, or migration interdiction operations.", "There are currently 12 HECs in the Coast Guard, with 2 of them based on  the East Coast and another 10 on the West Coast and in Hawaii. To  accomplish its missions, cutters like the HEC typically deploy and operate  with support assets that aid the cutter in performing its mission  requirements. These may include small boats, cutter-based air assets (such  as helicopters), or land-based aircraft (such as fixed-wing aircraft or  helicopters). According to the Coast Guard officials, pairing support assets  with a cutter increases its surveillance and intelligence gathering range  and improves its search and rescue capabilities.", "To maximize the time that the NSC can operate at sea each year without  requiring its crews to be away from their home port more than allowed  with the HEC, the Coast Guard plans to use a \u201ccrew rotational concept.\u201d  Under this concept, the Coast Guard plans to have four crews staff and  operate three cutters on a rotating basis. By using the crew rotational  concept, the Coast Guard hopes that each NSC will be able to provide 230  days away from home port per year as compared to the 185 days away  from home port per year provided by each HEC. Days away from home  port is a Coast Guard measure that reflects the level of operations for a  cutter.

Coast Guard  officials said that they do not yet know what the new operational  requirements will be, but that they plan for the new small boats to have  greater capabilities than the legacy small boats, which will further enhance  the capabilities of the NSC. The Coast Guard planned to finalize the  operational requirements by summer 2009, and Coast Guard officials  anticipate deployment of the small boats by the end of calendar year 2010.  However, until these operational requirements and a determined delivery  schedule are in place, the Coast Guard is unable to quantify the  operational gap that will be created by the absence of the new small boats  that were to have been deployed on the NSC."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Coast Guard Is Addressing National Security Cutter Onboard Deficiencies", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the gaps created by lost operational days and the absence of  the unmanned aircraft and small boats, the Coast Guard has identified  several operational deficiencies onboard NSC-Bertholf that it plans to  address by the end of calendar year 2010. In particular, according to Coast  Guard officials, three deficiencies are to be addressed before the cutter is  certified as fully operational in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010.  Details on these three deficiencies are as follows:    First, NSC-Bertholf currently lacks a shipboard sensitive  compartmented information facility required for participation in  certain Department of Defense missions and exercises. Coast Guard  officials told us that building such a facility was a post-9/11  requirement the manufacturer did not have time to integrate into NSC- Bertholf. This facility is to improve communication of sensitive and  classified information with other Coast Guard and Department of  Defense assets and shore facilities. Work on the facility is underway  and the Coast Guard plans to complete the installation and testing in  February 2010. According to Coast Guard officials, the Coast Guard  will also be responsible for installing similar facilities on the future  NSCs, as they will not be installed by the contractor during  construction for security reasons.", "Second, full installation of technology that aids the movement of  helicopters into the NSC\u2019s two hangars is not yet complete, because  the helicopters that are to be deployed with the NSC have not yet been  modified to use this technology. NSC-Bertholf is equipped with a  system designed to automatically secure helicopters after landing and  then move them into a hangar. According to Coast Guard officials, this  system reduces the number of crew members needed to assist in  landing the helicopter and increases the safety of the landing process.  The system has been installed on NSC-Bertholf, but the Coast Guard  has not yet completed the modification of the helicopters to enable  them to integrate with the system. Therefore, the Coast Guard plans to  manually tie down and move the helicopters until the modification is  complete, which, according to Coast Guard officials, is planned for  March 2010. Coast Guard officials stated that the system is to be  included during construction of all future NSCs.", "Third, the functionality of the stern ramp and doors used to launch  small boats on NSC-Bertholf is limited. Coast Guard officials reported  that the doors do not open and close as expected and that the doors  are safe to operate only when the NSC is moving at speeds of 5 knots  or less, because sections of the doors protrude into the water at the  edge of the cutter when they are opened. The stern launch system  facilitates the launch and recovery of small boats and requires fewer  crew to operate than traditional side-launch systems that rely on  cranes to both lower the small boats into the water and then raise  them on to the cutter when their missions are completed. Replacement  doors have been designed that angle up, away from the water, and are  equipped with a mechanism that will better handle their weight to  enable them to operate more reliably and safely. According to the  Coast Guard, the new doors are to be retrofitted to NSC-Bertholf when  the cutter goes in for a maintenance period, planned for March 2010,  and are to be installed on future NSCs during their construction.", "Until these onboard deficiencies are addressed and the NSC\u2019s unmanned  aircraft and new small boats are delivered, the NSC will be operating  without planned assets that would enhance its capabilities over those of  an HEC. Coast Guard officials stated, though, that even without the  planned unmanned aircraft and new small boats, NSC-Bertholf\u2019s  capabilities will be greater than those of an HEC when it is certified as  fully operational at the end of fiscal year 2010. In particular, the officials  stated that, among other things, the NSC will have improved habitability,  increased transit speeds, better fuel efficiency, and a superior weapons  system.

The Coast Guard has also begun a  management initiative to increase the number of operational days  available from the HECs, given delays in deploying the NSCs. However,  because these plans have not yet been finalized and the Coast Guard could  not provide estimated completion dates, the extent to which these plans  will help mitigate the loss of cutter operational days faced by the Coast  Guard cannot be fully determined at this time. More specifically, the Coast  Guard\u2019s mitigation plans include three key elements, as follows:    First, the Coast Guard plans to overhaul or replace equipment on  selected HECs through an HEC sustainment program. According to  Coast Guard officials, the purpose of the program is to replace  obsolete or increasingly unsupportable parts and equipment to lower  the cost of future HEC maintenance and increase the number of days  that the HECs are able to operate each year. Depending on the state of  each individual HEC, the sustainment program could include repairs or  upgrades to the hull and propulsion machinery, fire alarm systems, air- conditioning and refrigeration systems, or other equipment that has  become difficult to maintain. According to Coast Guard officials, they  do not expect that all of the HECs will receive these upgrades; rather,  the selection of the cutters to be upgraded is to be based on an  analysis of their condition. Coast Guard officials stated that the  analysis of the condition of the HECs is expected to begin in 2011, and  that the work to overhaul the selected cutters is to begin in 2015, with  work on the first selected HEC to be completed in 2016. Based on  these time frames, there will be a loss of cutter operational days  resulting from the deteriorating condition of the HECs for at least the  next 7 years, until 2016. During the years in which the Coast Guard  carries out the sustainment program, the operational gap created by  lost cutter operational days could widen because each HEC selected  for upgrade is to be taken out of service for 1 year while the necessary  work is completed. Coast Guard officials noted that this is required in  order for HECs to continue operations until the NSCs are deployed  and that they intend to coordinate the HEC upgrades, the HEC  decommissioning schedule, and the deployment of the NSCs to ensure  that a combination of 12 HECs and NSCs are available for operations  while HECs are removed from service for upgrades. The Coast Guard  officials said that they have drafted the sustainment program proposal,  but it was not finalized at the time of our review and the Coast Guard  does not have an estimated date for when it will be completed. The  officials added that they could not predict whether this program would  be funded.", "Second, in 2007, the Coast Guard implemented a management initiative  to (1) clearly define HEC maintenance goals, (2) enumerate tasks to  achieve those goals, (3) assign personnel responsible for each goal,  and (4) provide a means of measuring whether the goal had been  achieved, in order to improve the readiness of the HECs based on the  West Coast and Hawaii. For example, the Coast Guard personnel  responsible for the HECs\u2019 maintenance were assigned the goal of  improving HEC engineering equipment readiness, including tasks such  as reducing the time taken to address failures in essential equipment to  less than 15 days. Similarly, the commanding officers of each HEC  were assigned the goal of improving scheduled preventive  maintenance completion rates and to keep records to measure how  much of this maintenance was completed. Through regular analysis of  the measures associated with each goal or task, the responsible  personnel are to identify issues that may impact mission readiness,  develop and implement corrective actions, and evaluate the  effectiveness of those actions. While this management initiative is still  ongoing, Coast Guard officials stated that they believe it has been  successful. For example, the officials told us that from 2006\u2014the year  before the initiative began\u2014through 2008, the number of HEC  equipment failures that impacted missions declined by over 50 percent.", "Third, in advance of the HEC sustainment program, the Coast Guard  intended to increase funding for HEC maintenance by $10 million  during fiscal year 2010. However, Coast Guard officials reported that  their request for the funding\u2014intended to enable the Coast Guard to  complete HEC maintenance that had been deferred over time and  address the near-term maintenance needs of the HECs until the  sustainment program begins\u2014was not included in the fiscal year 2010  budget."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Coast Guard Plans to Address Operational Gaps Caused by Delays in the Delivery of Unmanned Aircraft and Small Boats with Existing Assets, Thus Costs May Not Increase", "paragraphs": ["According to the Coast Guard, operational gaps caused by delays in the  delivery of unmanned aircraft and small boats are to be addressed through  the use of existing aircraft and small boats and thus, it likely would not  incur new costs. The unmanned aircraft is intended to increase the NSC\u2019s  surveillance capabilities, while the small boats are designed to assist the  Coast Guard in conducting vessel boardings, pursuing and interdicting  other vessels, and conducting search and rescue operations. The Coast  Guard has not yet finalized the operational requirements of these assets;  therefore, it is not yet able to quantify the gap in aircraft surveillance and  small boat missions created by their absence.", "Manned aircraft currently provide surveillance support to the HECs and  other Coast Guard vessels and could be assigned to support NSC missions,  as needed. While existing aircraft would provide the NSCs with a level of  air support comparable to that currently provided to the HECs, a Coast  Guard study found that manned aircraft cannot provide the same level of  surveillance capabilities that would be provided by a cutter-based  unmanned aircraft. Because the NSCs are to replace decommissioned  HECs, Coast Guard officials told us that the level of support provided by  the manned aircraft to the NSCs is not expected to be greater than that  currently provided to the HECs. Therefore, the Coast Guard would,  theoretically, not incur new costs in assigning existing air assets to the  NSC as the HECs are decommissioned and no longer need air support.", "According to Coast Guard officials, the Coast Guard plans to deploy the  first NSC with existing small boats until new small boats are acquired.  During its operational testing period, NSC-Bertholf is using a prototype  small boat delivered by the contractor, as well as small boats used on the  HEC class. According to Coast Guard officials, there is no additional cost  to use these small boats beyond the funds already allocated for small boat  operations. Furthermore, Coast Guard officials told us that the  configuration of the small boats on the NSC will enhance its small boat  capabilities relative to the HECs. In particular, the NSC will be equipped  with three small boats, rather than the two small boats on the HECs, and  will be able to launch and recover small boats in rougher seas than the  HEC. Nevertheless, the lack of operational requirements and a delivery  schedule for new small boats precludes the Coast Guard from quantifying  the gap between the capabilities of the existing small boats and those that  it intends to acquire.

The Coast Guard is required to follow the  MSAM when designing and producing new assets. Specifically, the MSAM  requires a management approach that begins with the identification of  deficiencies in overall Coast Guard capabilities and then proceeds through  a series of structured phases and decision points to: (1) identify  requirements for performance, (2) develop and match these requirements  with a proposed solution (e.g., asset needed), (3) demonstrate the  feasibility of the proposed asset, and (4) produce the desired asset. The  MSAM process provides a number of benefits that have the potential to  improve acquisition outcomes, such as ensuring that the new systems and  equipment are optimally supportable and the necessary logistics support  resources are in place and acquired at an optimal cost.

The Deepwater contractor developed  the initial NSC logistics plans, but in 2007, the Coast Guard assumed  responsibility for NSC logistical planning because, according to Coast  Guard officials, the contractor\u2019s plans were deficient. Coast Guard officials  stated that they were concerned that the contractor was not completing  NSC logistics plans quickly enough and the plans had insufficient detail.  For example, Coast Guard officials said that the contractor\u2019s logistics  plans did not include the necessary details, such as how the contractor  would support the NSC after it becomes fully operational. As part of the  logistics shift from the contractor to the Coast Guard, in 2007, the Coast  Guard contracted with the Department of the Navy to assess the logistics  readiness level of NSC-Bertholf. While not required by the MSAM at the  time the review was contracted for, Coast Guard officials said that the  review helped them focus on areas where logistics planning for the NSC  were lacking. Coast Guard officials added that the review proved to be  very useful for logistics planning and, as a result, they revised the MSAM  to now require this review before new assets transition to fully operational  status.", "Published in May 2008, the Logistics Readiness Review focused on nine  areas of logistics readiness and identified logistics gaps in those areas. The  areas of logistics readiness included the adequacy of the spare parts and  supplies available to support NSC-Bertholf, the adequacy of technical  support document and plans, and the adequacy of the NSC logistical  support facilities, among others. In total, the Navy identified 34 gaps  within the 9 logistics areas and developed recommendations on how the  Coast Guard could take appropriate action to address those gaps. The  Navy identified 18 of the 34 gaps as \u201chigh priority,\u201d which means that the  gap introduces significant risk to near-term supportability and  workarounds either do not exist or they introduce additional risk. For  example, the review found that the Coast Guard had not conducted a  sufficient number of analyses to determine NSC crew training needs.  According to Coast Guard officials, the Coast Guard generally agreed with  the Logistic Readiness Review\u2019s findings and has made some progress in  addressing the recommendations identified. According to Coast Guard  officials, the Coast Guard plans to address 31 of the 34 recommendations.  However, according to Coast Guard officials, the Coast Guard has decided  not to address three recommendations because the costs of addressing  these recommendations outweighed the benefits. For example, the review  found that the lifting capability of the crane used to hoist items from the  pier onto the NSC was insufficient and made a recommendation to address  this deficiency. Coast Guard officials stated the Navy\u2019s finding was based  on the projected capability of the crane and countered that its actual lift  capabilities are sufficient to meet the needs of the NSC.", "Coast Guard officials stated that the NSC logistics transition from the  contractor to the Coast Guard either created or increased the significance  of several of the gaps identified. For example, under the contractor- supported model, the Coast Guard would have been responsible for a  limited amount of NSC maintenance. However, because the Coast Guard  now plans to support the NSC with its own staff, it must train personnel  and upgrade facilities. Appendix II provides more detail on the review\u2019s  findings and the status of the Coast Guard\u2019s progress in implementing the  recommendations made to address the gaps identified.

For  example, one high-priority gap cited the lack of training for Coast Guard  personnel who will be supporting NSC-Bertholf, so, according to Coast  Guard officials, the Coast Guard is training these personnel as needs arise.  Despite progress, more work needs to be done.

Our review of the Interim Support Plan, however,  found that while the plan assigns responsibility to a Coast Guard unit for  activities in all 10 logistics areas, it does not provide the level of detail that  would be required by the MSAM for an NSC Integrated Logistics Support  Plan. In particular, as shown in table 5, we found that 5 of the 10 areas  covered in the Interim Support Plan do not contain a planning section that  describes the detailed documents the Coast Guard plans to use to support  the NSC in each logistics area. In addition, none of the 10 logistics areas  contain detailed time frames for when the planning information is to be  developed and finalized. For example, while the interim plan makes note  of the \u201cTraining\u201d logistics area, the plan does not contain any dates to  guide the Coast Guard\u2019s planning of this area.

According to Coast Guard  officials, as of May 2009, the Coast Guard had spent $550,000 on  purchasing agreements it developed with equipment manufacturers to  help bridge the gap between contractor-supported and Coast Guard- supported logistics and plans to allocate $5.6 million for these agreements  from 2008 through 2011. Coast Guard officials stated the Coast Guard has  used these agreements to purchase parts and extend equipment  warranties, among other things. Additionally, Coast Guard officials stated  that the Coast Guard plans to enter into other commercial contracts for  NSC maintenance from 2008 through 2011, but cannot estimate the costs  of those contracts because it does not have historical maintenance data on  the NSC\u2019s new equipment that are needed to estimate the frequency of  equipment failures and the costs of repairing them. Coast Guard officials  stated that the Coast Guard currently has a 5-year study underway to  develop more accurate maintenance cost estimates.", "Regarding maintenance personnel salaries, Coast Guard officials said that  separating the personnel costs for the logistics transition from HECs to  NSCs is difficult because maintenance execution costs are determined  based on the service life of the cutters and transition costs are not  accounted for separately. As such, these officials could not estimate the  maintenance personnel cost component of the logistics transition.  Although the Coast Guard has estimated shore side maintenance costs for  NSCs that are to use Alameda as a home port, Coast Guard officials stated  that they have not determined how quickly the support needs for HECs  will diminish as NSCs begin conducting missions and HECs are  decommissioned. With this in mind, Coast Guard officials stated that the  Coast Guard plans to phase out personnel positions currently dedicated to  supporting HECs and replace them with personnel dedicated to support  NSCs. According to Coast Guard officials, the Coast Guard currently has  79 maintenance personnel positions in Alameda to support four HECs and  could not estimate the cost for these positions. These officials stated the  Coast Guard has added 11 NSC maintenance positions in Alameda, at a  cost of $940,000 per year, and estimate that it will need 108 additional  maintenance personnel to support the first three NSCs at a cost of about  $9 million per year for all three combined. Furthermore, Coast Guard  officials stated that they expect the maintenance execution cost estimates  to change after the Coast Guard completes a study to determine the  number of shore-side personnel needed to support the NSC\u2014the lack of  that study was identified in the Logistics Readiness Review as high  priority."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The NSC, the first cutter class delivered to the Coast Guard under the  Deepwater program, is to be instrumental in carrying out the Coast  Guard\u2019s missions as it replaces the aging and increasingly unreliable HEC  class. Although the Coast Guard assumed responsibility for NSC logistical  planning in 2007 because it believed that the contractor\u2019s plans did not  contain sufficient details, the Coast Guard has yet to complete the  Integrated Logistics Support Plan, as required by the MSAM. The Coast  Guard has developed an interim support plan to guide logistics planning  for the NSC until the Integrated Logistics Support Plan is finalized, but the  interim plan lacks MSAM-required details, such as maintenance planning  and supply support that are critical in determining the number of people  and supplies the Coast Guard will need to support the NSC. Further, while  the Coast Guard expects to complete the Integrated Logistics Support Plan  by October 2009, the plan may not include the required details of logistics  support documents to be used and time frames for completing them  because the Coast Guard is still determining how to proceed with  finalizing the plan and did not commit to including these details.  Identifying these details and time frames for the completion of logistics  planning documents could strengthen the Coast Guard\u2019s efforts to support  the NSC in the 10 logistics areas by providing a roadmap to guide its  personnel of actions to take and when to take them, better position the  Coast Guard to more effectively transition to the NSC, better ensure that  the Coast Guard\u2019s cost estimates are reasonable, and reduce uncertainties  for the Coast Guard (which must budget for such costs in advance) and  Congress (which must appropriate the funds)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To meet MSAM requirements and aid the Coast Guard in making  operational decisions, GAO recommends that the Commandant of the  Coast Guard ensure that as the Coast Guard finalizes the Integrated  Logistics Support Plan for the NSC, that the plan includes the required  logistics support documents to be used and the time frames for completing  them."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["In June 2009, we requested comments on a draft of this report from the  Department of Homeland Security and the Coast Guard.
