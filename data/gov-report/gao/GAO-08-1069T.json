GAO was asked to conduct a forensic audit and related investigations to (1) determine whether GAO could substantiate the allegation of lost and stolen property at IHS and identify examples of wasteful purchases and (2) identify the key causes of any loss, theft, or waste. GAO analyzed IHS property records from fiscal years 2004 to 2007, conducted a full physical inventory at IHS headquarters, and statistically tested inventory of information technology (IT) equipment at seven IHS field locations in 2007 and 2008. GAO also examined IHS policies, conducted interviews with IHS officials, and assessed the security of property."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Millions of dollars worth of IHS property has been lost or stolen over the past several years. Specifically: IHS identified over 5,000 lost or stolen property items, worth about $15.8 million, from fiscal years 2004 through 2007. These missing items included all-terrain vehicles and tractors; Jaws of Life equipment; and a computer containing sensitive data, including social security numbers. GAO's physical inventory identified that over 1,100 IT items, worth about $2 million, were missing from IHS headquarters. These items represented about 36 percent of all IT equipment on the books at headquarters in 2007 and included laptops and digital cameras. Further, IHS staff attempted to obstruct GAO's investigation by fabricating hundreds of documents. GAO also estimates that IHS had about 1,200 missing IT equipment items at seven field office locations worth approximately $2.6 million. This represented about 17 percent of all IT equipment at these locations. However, the dollar value of lost or stolen items and the extent of compromised data are unknown because IHS does not consistently document lost or stolen property, and GAO only tested a limited number of IHS locations. Information related to cases where GAO identified fabrication of documents and potential release of sensitive data was referred to the HHS Inspector General for further investigation. GAO identified that the loss, theft, and waste can be attributed to IHS's weak internal control environment. IHS management has failed to establish a strong \"tone at the top,\" allowing property management problems to continue for more than a decade with little or no improvement or accountability for lost and stolen property and compromise of sensitive personal data. In addition, IHS has not effectively implemented numerous property policies, including the proper safeguards for its expensive IT equipment. For example, IHS disposed of over $700,000 worth of equipment because it was \"infested with bat dung.\""]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to discuss the results of our investigation of  lost or stolen property at the Indian Health Service (IHS). In June 2007, we  received information from a whistleblower through GAO\u2019s FraudNET  hotline alleging gross mismanagement of property at IHS and wasteful  spending. Specifically, the whistleblower, who was a cognizant property  official, alleged that IHS could not locate 1,180 pieces of accountable  personal property valued at over $1.8 million. The lost or stolen equipment  included computers and other potentially sensitive information technology  (IT) equipment at IHS headquarters. The whistleblower also claimed that  officials at IHS headquarters wrote off millions of dollars worth of missing  inventory without holding anyone financially liable. Based on the  significance of these claims, we conducted an investigation to determine  whether the whistleblower\u2019s allegations were valid. We described the  results of the investigation in a recent report that was issued last month.", "Today, our testimony will summarize the results of our investigation and  will describe the (1) substantiation of the allegation of lost or stolen  property at IHS, (2) identification of examples of wasteful purchases and  (3) identification of the key causes of any loss, theft, or waste that we  detected.", "As detailed in our recent report, to substantiate the allegation of lost or  stolen property at IHS, we analyzed IHS property documents that  identified lost or stolen property from fiscal year 2004 through fiscal year  2007. We conducted a full physical inventory of property at IHS  headquarters and performed random sample testing of IT equipment  inventory at seven IHS field locations that we selected based on book  value of inventory and geographic proximity. We did not attempt to  quantify the level of waste at IHS, but we identified instances of waste  through observations during our equipment inventories at headquarters  and random sample testing at the selected field locations. Although we did  not perform a systematic review of IHS internal controls, we identified the  key causes of lost and stolen property and waste by examining IHS  policies and procedures, conducting interviews with IHS officials, and  assessing the physical security of property through our inventory testing.", "We conducted this forensic audit and related investigations from  September 2007 to June 2008 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and  perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a  reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit  objectives. Despite IHS efforts to obstruct our audit by making  misrepresentations and fabricating hundreds of documents, we were still  able to accomplish our objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained  provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our  audit objectives.

Specifically, we found that thousands of computers and other  property, worth millions of dollars, have been lost or stolen over the past  several years. We analyzed IHS reports for headquarters and the 12 regions  from the last 4 fiscal years. These reports identified over 5,000 property  items, worth about $15.8 million, that were lost or stolen from IHS  headquarters and field offices throughout the country. The number and  dollar value of this missing property is likely much higher because IHS did  not conduct full inventories of accountable property for all of its locations  and did not provide us with all inventory documents as requested. Despite  IHS attempts to obstruct our investigation, our full physical inventory at  headquarters and our random sample of property at 7 field locations,  identified millions of dollars of missing property."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "IHS Records Indicate at Least $15.8 Million of Property Is Lost or Stolen", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis of Report of Survey records from IHS headquarters and field  offices show that from fiscal year 2004 through fiscal year 2007, IHS  property managers identified over 5,000 lost or stolen property items  worth about $15.8 million. Although we did receive some documentation  from IHS, the number and dollar value of items that have been lost or  stolen since 2004 is likely much higher for the following reasons. First, IHS  does not consistently document lost or stolen property items. For  example, 9 of the 12 IHS regional offices did not perform a full physical  inventory in fiscal year 2007. Second, an average of 5 of the 12 regions did  not provide us with all of the reports used to document missing property  for each year since fiscal year 2004, as we requested. Third, we found  about $11 million in additional inventory shortages from our analysis of  inventory reports provided to us by IHS, but we did not include this  amount in our estimate of lost or stolen property because IHS has not  made a final determination on this missing property. Some of the  egregious examples of lost or stolen property include:  In April 2007, a desktop computer containing a database of uranium  miners\u2019 names, social security numbers, and medical histories was  stolen from an IHS hospital in New Mexico. According to an HHS  report, IHS attempted to notify the 849 miners whose personal  information was compromised, but IHS did not issue a press release to  inform the public of the compromised data.", "From 1999 through 2005, IHS did not follow required procedures to  document the transfer of property from IHS to the Alaska Native Tribal  Health Consortium, resulting in a 5-year unsuccessful attempt by IHS to  reconcile the inventory. Our analysis of IHS documentation revealed  that about $6 million of this property\u2014including all-terrain vehicles,  generators, van trailers, pickup trucks, tractors, and other heavy  equipment\u2014was lost or stolen.", "In September 2006, IHS property staff in Tucson attempted to write off  over $275,000 worth of property, including Jaws of Life equipment  valued at $21,000.

Specifically, of the 3,155 pieces of IT equipment recorded in the records  for IHS headquarters, we determined that about 1,140 items (or about 36  percent) were lost, stolen, or unaccounted for. These items, valued at  around $2 million, included computers, computer servers, video  projectors, and digital cameras.

For example, the IHS Director over  property misrepresented to us that IHS was able to find about 800 of the  missing items from the whistleblower\u2019s complaint. In addition, an IHS  property specialist attempted to provide documentation confirming that  571 missing items were properly disposed of by IHS. However, we found  that the documentation he provided was not dated and contained no  signatures. Finally, IHS provided us fabricated receiving reports after we  questioned them that the original reports provided to us were missing key  information on them.

Specifically, we estimate that for the 7 locations, about  1,200 equipment items or 17 percent, with a value of $2.6 million were lost,  stolen or unaccounted for.

Although some of these may  be older items that were not properly disposed, we did find that many  employees, including administrative assistants, were assigned two  computer monitors, a printer and scanner, a blackberry, subwoofer  speakers, and multiple computer laptops in addition to their computer  desktop. Many of these employees said they rarely used all of this  equipment, and some could not even remember the passwords for  some of their multiple laptops.", "IHS purchased numerous computers for headquarters staff in excess of  expected need.

As of  February 2008, 25 of these computers and monitors\u2014valued at about  $30,000\u2014were in storage at IHS headquarters.

Furthermore, IHS management has not properly updated its personal  property management policies, which IHS has not revised since 1992.  Moreover, IHS did not (1) conduct annual inventories of accountable  property; (2) use receiving agents for acquired property at each location  and designate property custodial officers in writing to be responsible for  the proper use, maintenance, and protection of property; (3) place  barcodes on accountable property to identify it as government property;  (4) maintain proper individual user-level accountability, including custody  receipts, for issued property; (5) safeguard IT equipment; or (6) record  certain property in its new property management information system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Implementation of GAO Recommendations Will Lead to Better Management of IHS Property", "paragraphs": ["To strengthen IHS\u2019s overall control environment and \u201ctone at the top\u201d, we  made 10 recommendations to IHS to update its policy and enforce  property management policies of both the HHS and IHS.

HHS disagreed with our  recommendation to establish procedures to track all sensitive equipment  such as blackberries and cell phones even if they fall under the  accountable dollar threshold criteria. We made this recommendation  because we identified examples of lost or stolen equipment that contained  sensitive data, such as a PDA containing medical data for patients at a  Tucson, Arizona area hospital. According to an IHS official, the device  contained no password or data encryption, meaning that anyone who  found (or stole) the PDA could have accessed the sensitive medical data.  While we recognize that IHS may have taken steps to prevent the  unauthorized release of sensitive data and acknowledge that it is not  required to track devices under a certain threshold, we are concerned  about the potential harm to the public caused by the loss or theft of this  type of equipment.
