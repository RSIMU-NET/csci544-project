Industry practices for cost-efficient fleets include the development of utilization criteria related to the mission of a vehicle and periodic fleet assessments using these criteria to determine the appropriate fleet size and composition. If unneeded vehicles are identified, they are disposed of. However, the agencies GAO reviewed have not established policies that contain clearly defined utilization criteria that would allow them to determine the number and type of vehicles they need. Further, agencies are not routinely conducting periodic fleet assessments. Two agencies, the Navy and the Forest Service within the Department of Agriculture, conduct assessments; however, these assessments are either inconsistently applied or the results are not enforced. Some agencies have begun to recognize the need to revise their guidelines to provide better criteria for determining their vehicle needs. GAO's work and reviews by inspectors general identified numerous instances where agencies were retaining vehicles they did not need, with potential savings ranging from thousands to millions of dollars if these vehicles were eliminated. For example, the Department of the Interior's Inspector General reported that a significant portion of the department's 36,000 vehicles were underutilized and estimated savings of $34 million annually if these vehicles were disposed of. GSA's Office of Governmentwide Policy and the Office of Management and Budget have recently taken a number of actions to require agencies to better manage and improve the cost-efficiency of their fleets. The Office of Governmentwide Policy is currently revising the Federal Management Regulation to require agencies to (1) appoint a central fleet manager with control over all aspects of fleet management, including fleet budgets, which are now generally controlled at the local level; (2) establish utilization criteria and periodically review fleet size; and (3) fund a fleet management information system. The Office of Governmentwide Policy plans to work in a cooperative effort with agencies to implement the revised regulation. However, based on discussions with officials from the agencies GAO reviewed, GAO anticipates that GSA will face opposition to its requirement for centralized budget control over the fleets. In 2002, the Office of Management and Budget began requiring agencies to report, as part of their budget submissions, the size, composition, and cost of their fleets for the current year and to project costs for the next 3 fiscal years."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies spend about $1.7 billion annually to acquire, operate, and  maintain a fleet of about 387,000 trucks, passenger vehicles, and other  vehicles, such as ambulances and buses.

According to GSA data, the size of the federal  fleet has remained fairly constant over the last 6 years. However, during  the last decade, concerns have been raised about whether agencies are  acquiring more vehicles than they need to meet their missions. These  concerns culminated in an April 2002 letter to federal agencies, in which  the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), stated that  the size of the federal fleet seemed, in many cases, to be excessive and  that significant reductions may be in order.", "You asked us to determine (1) the extent to which agencies ensure that  their fleets are the right size to meet agency missions, (2) whether  potential savings could result from the disposal of unneeded vehicles, and  (3) what actions are being taken on a governmentwide basis to improve  fleet management practices. We conducted our work at the Departments  of Agriculture, Army, Navy, Homeland Security, and Veterans Affairs; all of  which account for about 200,000 vehicles, or about 53 percent of the  federal government\u2019s fleet. Within the Department of Veterans Affairs, we  focused on the Veterans Health Administration because it is responsible  for agencywide fleet management. Within Agriculture, we focused our  review on the Forest Service, Natural Resources Conservation Service  (NRCS), and Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), which  account for about 75 percent of Agriculture\u2019s vehicles. Because the  Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was formed only recently and its  various organizational elements are currently operating under fleet  policies from their legacy agencies, we limited our review to the actions  the department is taking to leverage its buying power when acquiring  vehicles and to develop departmentwide fleet management guidelines. We  interviewed officials and analyzed information provided by these agencies,  as well as GSA and OMB. We focused our work on agencies\u2019 justifications  for acquiring and retaining vehicles and did not assess their vehicle  operation, maintenance, or disposal practices.

In 1986, Congress enacted legislation that  required agencies, among other things, to collect and analyze the costs of  their motor vehicle operations, including acquisition decisions, in order to  improve the management and efficiency of their fleets and to reduce  costs. Two years later, we reported that most agencies had not conducted  the required studies. In 1992, an interagency task force identified obstacles  to cost-efficient fleet management, including the continued lack of  compliance with the 1986 legislative requirements, and stated that  agencies lacked basic information to effectively and efficiently manage  their fleets. In 1994, we reported, among other things, that successful fleet  practices included oversight at the headquarters level to ensure that  uniform written policies and guidance are provided throughout the  organization and fleet management information systems to provide  accurate data about the fleet. We also reported that agencies need to  conduct periodic reviews to ensure their fleets are the right size and  composition.", "The vehicle fleets at the agencies we reviewed are widely dispersed. For  example, the Army and Navy operate vehicles throughout the world, while  the Veterans Affairs fleet is spread across medical centers, national  cemeteries, and other locations throughout the country. The approximate  number of vehicles operated by the agencies included in our review is  shown in figure 1.", "The Office of Governmentwide Policy within GSA develops policies,  disseminated through the Federal Management Regulation, and bulletins  for agency vehicle fleet management. Federal agencies, however, are  responsible for managing their own fleets, including making decisions  about the number and type of vehicles they need and how to acquire them.  OGP also collects data from agencies via the Federal Automotive  Statistical Tool (FAST) concerning fleet size, composition, and costs.  Although GSA uses these data in annual reports to OMB on the  government\u2019s fleet size and costs, GSA officials told us that much of the  data are inaccurate because of the different systems agencies use to  collect and report information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Fleet Management Attention Is Needed to Ensure That Fleets Are the Right Size and Composition", "paragraphs": ["The agencies we reviewed cannot ensure that their vehicle fleets are the  right size and composition to meet their missions because of a lack of  attention to key fleet management practices.

In addition,  agencies have not implemented periodic assessments to determine  whether they have the right number and type of vehicles in the fleet.

Some agencies establish  the number of miles traveled, such as the 12,000 miles per year in GSA\u2019s  guidance, as a criterion to measure vehicle utilization. However, this  criterion is not appropriate for the mission of some vehicles, such as those  used for utility work, medical transportation, or security. Therefore,  agency officials often ignore mileage standards. None of the agencies  assigned a value to other criteria, such as number of trips per day or hours  on station, to measure vehicle use when mileage is not an appropriate  measure.", "Following are some examples of cases we found where the application of  specific criteria related to the mission of a vehicle would give local fleet  managers a more accurate basis on which to make decisions about  fleet size:    At one Veterans Affairs medical center, vehicles are used to transport  veterans from their homes to outpatient rehabilitation activities in a  metropolitan area outside of Boston. Veterans Affairs officials told us that  using only a mileage standard to justify the need for the vehicles is  inappropriate because they are used within a confined area. The officials  agreed that a better measure would be the number of trips or the number  of veterans served.", "The Department of Defense prescribes that the military services establish  utilization measures, such as passengers carried or hours used, to measure  the need for a vehicle when mileage is not appropriate. However, neither  Army nor Navy guidelines incorporate these types of utilization criteria.", "Natural Resources Conservation Service policy includes only one criterion  to establish fleet size, which is a ratio of employees to vehicles. The  definition of employees includes full- and part-time employees and  volunteers, regardless of roles or job description.", "Further, agencies generally do not conduct periodic assessments of their  fleets. Decisions about whether to acquire and retain vehicles are made at  the local level with little or no headquarters oversight. These local-level  decisions are frequently based on the availability of funds rather than on a  validated need. For example, directors of Veterans Affairs medical centers  and state conservationists at the Natural Resources Conservation Service  determine whether or not to acquire vehicles based on the availability of  funds. The Army allows local commanders to acquire vehicles with  available funds without further justification within established allocation  levels. However, these levels have not been reviewed since 1991, 13 years  ago.", "The Navy and the Forest Service conduct periodic assessments of fleet  size, but the results of the assessments are either not enforced or not  conducted in a systematic manner. The Navy\u2019s Transportation Equipment  Management Centers (TEMC) conduct utilization assessments to  recommend fleet inventory levels for Navy commands, yet the commands  are not required to implement the recommended inventory levels. The  Forest Service\u2019s guidelines contain instructions for a systematic review of  vehicle utilization at local sites, but these reviews are not consistently  performed at the locations we visited, and the local sites are not required  to report the results of the reviews to agency headquarters."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Agencies Are Taking Steps to Improve Fleet Management Practices", "paragraphs": ["Some agencies have begun to focus more attention on fleet management  practices that they believe will improve the efficiency of their fleets. At the  start of fiscal year 2004, the Army and Navy reorganized to centralize the  management of facilities and equipment, including vehicles that are not  related to combat forces, at various commands and installations. The Navy  established the Naval Installations Command and the Army established the  Installation Management Agency for this purpose. Navy and Army officials  told us that these organizations should result in increased attention to fleet  management, including the enforcement of the TEMCs\u2019s recommended  inventory level in the Navy and the revision of outdated vehicle allocation  levels in the Army. Officials told us that these organizations will provide  more centralized oversight of the Army and Navy vehicle fleets, but  individual commands will continue to determine the need for vehicles  within the established inventory objectives or allocation levels. At the time  of our review, it was too early to determine the impact these  reorganizations will have on improving fleet management practices.", "In addition, some agencies are reviewing their guidelines in an attempt to  include more specific requirements for fleet management. For example,  Veterans Affairs officials told us that they are developing a vehicle manual  with detailed guidance on how to measure utilization and hope to issue it  in the fall of 2004. Department of Defense officials are in the process of  revising the department\u2019s guidelines and are considering requiring the  application of utilization criteria tied to the mission of a vehicle to  determine the need for vehicles. In early 2003, DHS established a Fleet  Commodity Council to review strategic sourcing issues, including how the  department can leverage its purchasing power when acquiring vehicles.

In 2003, a U.S. Army Audit Agency report identified one Army garrison that  had retained 99 excess vehicles in its fleet.", "A 2001 Veterans Affairs\u2019 Inspector General report noted that accountability  over the department\u2019s owned vehicles at a medical center could not be  reasonably assured. For example, agency auditors found one vehicle that  had been parked behind a laundry facility and had not been moved since it  was purchased in 1997. The report described the acquisition of the vehicle  as unjustified.", "Appendix VII contains additional examples of reports that highlight  potential savings if unnecessary vehicles were eliminated from agencies\u2019  fleets.", "In other cases, locations have reduced their fleet size\u2014primarily because  of pressure to cut their budgets\u2014and consequently realized savings, as  illustrated in the following examples:     A Navy command decreased its fleet from 156 to 105 vehicles over the  course of a year, resulting in savings of about $12,000 per month. A Navy  official explained that the decrease in vehicles was driven by cuts in the  command\u2019s budget.", "A Veterans Affairs medical center, in an effort to find potential savings,  reduced its fleet by 12 vehicles, with estimated savings of about $57,000  per year.  In the 1990s, a Forest Service region eliminated 500 leased vehicles when  the agency reduced its workforce due to budget reductions, according to a  regional official.", "However, because these reductions were not based on the application of  utilization criteria to identify vehicle needs, there is no guarantee that the  fleets are the right size to meet the agencies\u2019 missions.", "Industry practice for cost-efficient fleets also calls for an assessment of  the type of vehicles being acquired. Savings can be realized by changing  the composition of the fleet\u2014buying vehicles that are less expensive and  less costly to operate and maintain. We found cases where local level  officials had taken this step. For example, in assessing the need for  vehicles to expand community outreach services, program officials at a  Veterans Affairs medical center are replacing 15 passenger vans with less  expensive sedans and minivans that will still allow them to accomplish the  program\u2019s goals. In another case, a local Navy fleet manager was able to  help a security organization reduce its fleet costs by using less expensive  trucks for carrying dogs used by law enforcement officials."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Governmentwide Initiatives to Improve Fleet Management Practices", "paragraphs": ["As a result of a review of governmentwide fleet practices, GSA\u2019s Office of  Governmentwide Policy (OGP) and OMB are taking actions to require  agencies to better manage and improve the cost-efficiency of their fleets.  In 2002, OGP initiated a review of federal agencies\u2019 fleet management  practices in cooperation with OMB. Twenty-one agencies responded to a  GSA survey, which found, among other things, that the vast majority of  agencies lack utilization criteria by which to determine vehicle needs and  identify underutilized vehicles. The survey further found that many  agencies have little control over fleet budgets and allocation levels for  vehicles and lack effective fleet management information systems. Based  on the survey results, OGP is currently revising the Federal Management  Regulation to require agencies to improve fleet management practices by,  among other things, (1) appointing a central fleet manager, (2) periodically  reviewing fleet size, and (3) funding a fleet management information  system.", "In 1994, we reported that the primary role of a central fleet manager is  to establish and monitor written policies, collect and analyze fleet data,  and look for opportunities to improve fleet operations. OGP officials  believe that effective fleet management requires centralizing control at  the headquarters level over all decisions related to fleet size. Thus,  OGP will require agencies to appoint a senior management official with  decision-making authority and control over all aspects of the agency\u2019s  fleet program, including the entire fleet budget and approval of local-level  decisions. However, we anticipate strong opposition to this requirement,  based on our discussions with agency officials outside of GSA. Many of the  headquarters officials we interviewed believe that local-level fleet  managers, given the right tools, are in the best position to make decisions  on the need for vehicles and that centralized oversight, rather than control  over the budgets and decision making, would be more appropriate.", "The revised regulation will also require agencies to develop criteria against  which to evaluate the need for vehicles and to use these criteria in  performing annual fleet assessments. OGP officials told us that the  regulation will not include examples of the different criteria that could be  used to determine vehicle needs. Instead, this type of information will be  incorporated in GSA bulletins issued periodically to agencies and posted  on the GSA Web site. Based on the results of the 2002 survey, OGP had  planned to recommend that agencies base their decisions about the need  for vehicles on a staff-to-vehicle ratio; however, officials told us they will  require agencies to consider other measures more appropriate to a  vehicle\u2019s mission. As discussed above, industry practices include  establishing multiple utilization criteria, such as mileage, number of trips  per day and hours on station, because of the differing nature of  agency missions.", "OGP further intends to require agencies to fund a fleet management  information system that would allow them to accurately collect  information on the cost to acquire, operate, and maintain their fleets.  This initiative will allow agencies to better forecast fleet funding and make  well-founded decisions about when to replace vehicles. OGP plans to issue  guidelines defining the minimum functional requirements for the system.  Officials we spoke with at Defense, DHS, and Veterans Affairs stated that  they believe that developing a fleet management system is important, but  they are at varying stages of exploring options, requesting bids from  contractors, and requesting funding.", "While OGP believes it has the authority to require agencies to follow its  regulation and guidelines, enforcement will be another matter. OGP  officials plan to work with agencies in a cooperative effort, through  workshops and federal fleet conferences, to help them implement the  requirements in the upcoming regulation, which they expect to issue in  October 2004. They are also considering issuing \u201creport cards\u201d on the  progress agencies are making in implementing and following the revised  regulation.", "OMB has also taken steps to hold agencies accountable for more effective  fleet management practices. In 2002, OMB began requiring agencies, as  part of their budget submission, to report the size, composition, and  cost of their fleets for the current year and to project costs for the next  3 fiscal years. The narrative in the report must also detail the reasons for  any significant changes in fleet size, discuss the methodology used to  assign vehicles, and identify any impediments to managing the fleets.

Until agencies develop and apply utilization criteria tied to  the mission of the vehicles in their fleets, they will not know how many  vehicles they need to meet their missions. Moreover, by not using such  criteria to assess their fleets periodically, agencies are missing the  potential opportunity to identify excess vehicles, reduce their fleets, and  save money. While some agencies have started to take actions to improve  fleet management, at this time it is unclear how successful these efforts  will be in providing more efficient fleet management. Because of its role in  providing fleet management policy, GSA\u2019s Office of Governmentwide  Policy is in a position to take the lead in assisting agencies to develop  appropriate utilization criteria and to assess their fleet size and  composition. That office, in conjunction with OMB, has taken steps to  focus attention at a governmentwide level on the need to improve fleet  management practices. However, the plan to require agencies to centralize  budget control over their fleets is a contentious one, and it remains to be  seen how agencies will respond once the draft regulation is issued.

All of the agencies  generally concurred with our findings and recommendations. The written  comments are reproduced in appendixes II through VI.", "GSA noted that the primary contributor to the lack of progress in fleet  management improvement has been the absence of strong management  support for fleet reform and the consequent lack of resources for acquiring  management information systems. GSA observed, however, that many  agencies are becoming more aware of these issues. GSA also noted that  although our report discusses three revisions to the Federal Management  Regulation that GSA is in the process of drafting, these three revisions are  part of a comprehensive package of 10 recommendations for fleet  management reform that came out of GSA\u2019s Federal Fleet Review  Initiative. We focused our review on the key revisions directly related to  the justification for acquiring and retaining vehicles. GSA also stated that,  while it agrees that local managers are best qualified to know their  requirements, only a central manager can provide the consistent oversight,  policy, and budget review that has been lacking in many agencies, and it is  this deficiency GSA seeks to address by its requirement that each agency  appoint a senior management official with decision-making authority and  control over all aspects of the agency\u2019s fleet program, including the fleet  budget. As we note in our report, during the course of our audit work, it  was clear that the agency officials we spoke with were opposed to GSA\u2019s  position on this matter. We did not assess the ramifications of GSA\u2019s  proposal as part of our review. In addition, GSA expressed disappointment  that we did not recommend that agencies fund a fleet management  information system. Because we found that agencies are in different stages  of implementing such systems, and because GSA already plans to require  such systems in its revised Fleet Management Regulation, we did not  believe it was necessary for us to recommend this action.", "The Departments of Agriculture and Veterans Affairs agreed with our  recommendations but raised concerns about GSA\u2019s planned revision to the  Federal Management Regulation that would require agencies to centralize  budget authority for fleet management. Veterans Affairs strongly opposes  such a requirement. It noted that, in a system as large and complex as the  department\u2019s, such a massive administrative responsibility would be  unwieldy and inefficient and would require significant additional resource  support. The department believes that oversight at the local level is the  preferred approach to fleet management. Agriculture noted that the  budget is a complex process involving detailed review and comparison of  vehicle costs. It stated that changing priorities, such as national  emergencies, require intense local management of the fleet to ensure a  high state of mission-readiness and that, therefore, increased  centralization of the budget process would not be in the best interest of  overall fleet efficiency and mission success. As we point out in our report,  the issue of centralized budget authority is a contentious one. It will need  to be addressed by the agencies, OMB, and GSA.", "Agriculture also expressed concern that our recommendation on the need  to establish utilization criteria would lead to a set of national criteria that  all local fleet managers would be required to use. That is not the intent of  our recommendation. Our recommendation is aimed at having each  agency establish utilization criteria based on the specific mission of the  vehicles in its fleet. Where a single criterion such as mileage, for example,  is inappropriate, local officials need to have alternative criteria available,  such as hours on station or number of clients served, to validate the need  for vehicles. We believe it is the responsibility of agencies to establish  clearly defined utilization criteria and guidelines to allow local officials to  appropriately apply these criteria.", "The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) agreed with our  recommendations and emphasized that it has undertaken efforts, in a  relatively short time frame, to establish a departmentwide fleet  management program. It noted that the process used by its Bureau of  Customs and Border Protection for assessing vehicle utilization based on a  variety of factors is considered a best practice and will be extended to the  rest of the department. In addition, DHS stated that an updated  management directive on motor vehicle management sets forth the  requirement for maintaining systems for effective control and  accountability of motor vehicle assets and for maintaining the minimum  number of vehicles needed to meet requirements. The directive is  currently being reviewed within the department. In DHS\u2019s view, these two  actions meet the requirement to establish effective oversight mechanisms  to ensure that fleet utilization criteria are defined and fleet assessments  are carried out and reviewed on a regular basis. While these are positive  actions, DHS needs to ensure that oversight is maintained and that  periodic fleet assessments are conducted using the appropriate criteria.", "Veterans Affairs stated that it will address our recommendations with  several planned initiatives which, when completed, should rectify  identified weaknesses. For example, the department will convene a  national work group to develop a broad-based fleet management  operations manual that will include a section that defines utilization  criteria based on vehicle missions. The department is also reviewing  various options for establishing a systemwide software application to be  used as an oversight tool for managing the fleet.", "The Department of Defense agreed with our recommendations. It stated  that action will be taken to ensure that utilization criteria, which may be  comprised of existing mileage goals or other appropriate criteria, will  apply to all nontactical vehicles. It will also require components to review  their vehicle inventories annually against fleet assessments and to conduct  on-site surveys or inspections on a minimum 3-year cycle (resources  permitting) with the purpose of purging or fully justifying underutilized  vehicles.", "In oral comments, OMB representatives told us that they agree with our  findings and recommendations and will consider incorporating the  recommended changes to agencies\u2019 reporting requirements in new  guidance for the fiscal year 2006 budget cycle.", "As arranged with your offices, unless you publicly announce its contents  earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days from its  issue date.
