GAO assessed (1) the extent to which physicians are enrolled and serving children in Medicaid and CHIP and accepting these and other children as new patients, and (2) the extent to which physicians experience difficulty referring children in Medicaid and CHIP for specialty care, as compared to privately insured children. GAO conducted a national survey of nonfederal primary and specialty care physicians who serve children, and asked about their enrollment in state Medicaid and CHIP programs, whether they served and accepted Medicaid and CHIP and privately insured children, and the extent to which they experienced difficulty referring children in Medicaid and CHIP and privately insured children to specialty care.

On the basis of its 2010 national survey of physicians, GAO estimates that more than three-quarters of primary and specialty care physicians are enrolled as Medicaid and CHIP providers and serving children in those programs. A larger share of primary care physicians (83 percent) are participating in the programs--enrolled as a provider and serving Medicaid and CHIP children--than specialty physicians (71 percent). Further, a larger share of rural primary care physicians (94 percent) is participating in the programs than urban primary care physicians (81 percent). Nationwide, physicians participating in Medicaid and CHIP are generally more willing to accept privately insured children as new patients than Medicaid and CHIP children. For example, about 79 percent are accepting all privately insured children as new patients, compared to about 47 percent for children in Medicaid and CHIP. Nonparticipating physicians--those not enrolled or not serving Medicaid and CHIP children--most commonly cite administrative issues such as low and delayed reimbursement and provider enrollment requirements as limiting their willingness to serve children in these programs. Physicians experience much greater difficulty referring children in Medicaid and CHIP to specialty care, compared to privately insured children. On the basis of the physician survey, more than three times as many participating physicians--84 percent--experience difficulty referring Medicaid and CHIP children to specialty care as experience difficulty referring privately insured children--26 percent. For all children, physicians most frequently cited difficulty with specialty referrals for mental health, dermatology, and neurology.

In 2010,  more than 42 million children received health care coverage through  Medicaid or CHIP, and this number is expected to increase. But simply  having coverage does not ensure that a beneficiary can access physicians  and needed services. Access to health care for children in Medicaid and  CHIP is affected, in part, by the number of physicians who are  participating\u2014that is, who are not only enrolled in state Medicaid and  CHIP programs, but also providing services to these children.", "The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), an agency within  the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), oversees state  Medicaid and CHIP programs at the federal level, including monitoring  children\u2019s access to primary care and specialty care.

States  generally provide Medicaid and CHIP services through two service  delivery and financing models\u2014fee-for-service and managed care.

In this report, we address  1.  the extent to which physicians are enrolled as Medicaid and CHIP  providers and serving children in these programs, and the extent to  which physicians are accepting these and other children as new  patients; and 2.  the extent to which physicians experience difficulty referring children  in Medicaid and CHIP for specialty care, as compared to privately  insured children.", "To answer our two research objectives, we conducted a national survey of  physicians who serve children. We surveyed a nationally representative  sample of physicians from each of three groups\u2014specialty care  physicians, primary care physicians in urban areas, and primary care  physicians in rural areas\u2014all of whom were practicing physicians in the  United States who were office- or hospital-based and age 65 or younger,  provided direct patient care to children (age 0-18), and were not federal  employees. We received responses from 932 eligible physicians, and had a  response rate of 35 percent. We performed a nonresponse bias analysis to  determine whether any bias was introduced in the results due to the  absence of responses from some members of the sample. We also  performed additional analysis of the survey data to determine whether  certain characteristics, such as age, gender, and the percentage of children  served, influenced responses to our survey questions. We found that  physicians\u2019 willingness to serve and accept children in Medicaid and CHIP  was not influenced by these factors. Our survey methodology allowed us  to generalize our results to the total population of physicians who serve  children in the United States, and to four groups of physicians who serve  children: primary care physicians, specialty care physicians, rural primary  care physicians, and urban primary care physicians. The survey was  administered from August 5, 2010, to October 31, 2010. All estimates are  based on self-reported information from the survey respondents and have  a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percent or less at the 95 percent  confidence level, unless otherwise noted. (For more information on the  scope and methodology of our survey, see app. I.) The survey included  questions about physicians\u2019 enrollment in state Medicaid and CHIP  programs, whether they serve and accept children (age 0-18) in Medicaid  and CHIP as new patients, the share of their child patients that are covered  by Medicaid and CHIP, whether they experience difficulty referring  children to specialists, and factors that may affect their own willingness to  participate in Medicaid and CHIP. We also reviewed related literature on  physician supply and participation in public programs, including Medicaid.  In addition, we reviewed certain provisions of the Patient Protection and  Affordable Care Act (PPACA) that may affect physicians\u2019 participation in  the program, and interviewed officials from CMS and selected provider  associations.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2009 through June  2011 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

Medicaid is a federal-state program for certain categories of  low-income children, families, and individuals. In fiscal year 2010,   34.4 million children had health coverage through Medicaid. CHIP is also a  federal-state program and provides health care coverage to children 18  years of age and younger living in low-income families whose incomes  exceed the eligibility requirements for Medicaid. In fiscal year 2010,   7.7 million children had health care coverage through CHIP.", "State Medicaid and CHIP programs are required to cover certain groups of  individuals and offer a minimum set of services, including services  provided by primary care and specialty care physicians, and services  provided in hospitals, clinics, and other settings. States are also  responsible for enrolling physicians as Medicaid and CHIP providers. For  Medicaid programs, federal law establishes that state Medicaid payments  to providers must be sufficient to enroll enough providers so that care and  services are available to beneficiaries at least to the extent that they are  available to the general population in the same geographic area. On May  6, 2011, CMS issued a proposed regulation regarding this requirement.  The proposed regulation is intended to promote standardized and  transparent methods for states to review and monitor Medicaid  beneficiaries\u2019 access to covered services delivered under a fee-for-service  delivery model. Under the proposed regulation, state monitoring of  Medicaid beneficiaries\u2019 access is anticipated to be an ongoing and evolving  process. The proposed regulation describes different approaches states  may use to assess Medicaid beneficiaries\u2019 access to care, and identifies  different actions states may take to address access problems. In addition,  the proposed regulation includes a requirement for states to annually  assess Medicaid beneficiaries\u2019 access to a different subset of covered  services and then make the results of these assessments available to the  public. Figure 1 illustrates how the supply of primary care physicians  varies among states and within states.", "Like all children, children in Medicaid and CHIP depend on physicians and  other health care providers for regular health screenings to monitor their  health, development, and growth. In addition to primary health care needs,  these screenings are important in identifying conditions that may warrant  specialty care and services. Medicaid programs are required to provide  regular health screenings, under the benefit known as Early and Periodic  Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT) services, for eligible  children. We and others have reported, however, that many children in  Medicaid and CHIP are not receiving well-child checkups, all required  health screening services, or needed specialty services. For example:  In August 2009, we reported that, on the basis of parents\u2019 reports in the  Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), about 40 percent of  children in Medicaid and CHIP had not had a well-child checkup over a  2-year period.", "In May 2010, HHS\u2019s Office of Inspector General reported that in nine  states, three of four children in Medicaid did not receive all required  covered health screening services.", "In April 2011, on the basis of MEPS, we reported that for 12 percent of  children in Medicaid and CHIP 17 years of age and younger who  needed health care services, such as tests or treatments, their families  had difficulties accessing those services. In addition, an estimated   24 percent of children in Medicaid and CHIP 17 years of age and  younger who needed specialists had problems accessing specialty  services.", "We also reported, in April 2011, that monitoring access to specialty care  for children in Medicaid and CHIP was important because the National  Survey of Children\u2019s Health\u2014which is based on responses from parents or  guardians\u2014showed that these children had problems accessing needed  services. We also found that the required state reports submitted to CMS  regarding services provided to children in Medicaid lacked detail. For  example, the reports do not indicate whether children referred to  providers for treatment actually receive the services they need. We  recommended that the Administrator of CMS work with states to identify  additional improvements that could be made to the annual reports that  states are required to submit to CMS, including options for capturing  information on children\u2019s receipt of the services for which they are  referred.
