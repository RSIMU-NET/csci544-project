U.S. public diplomacy activities include the efforts of the Broadcasting Board of Governors, which oversees all nonmilitary U.S. international broadcasting by the Voice of America (VOA) and several other broadcast entities. Such broadcasting helps promote a better understanding of the United States and serves U.S. interests by providing overseas audiences with accurate and objective news about the United States and the world. GAO has issued three reports over the past 4 years examining the organizational, marketing, resource, and performance reporting challenges faced by the Board. Our recommendations to the Board have included the need to address the long-standing issue of overlapping language services (i.e., where two services broadcast in the same language to the same audience) and to strengthen the Board's strategic planning and performance by placing a greater emphasis on results. The Board has taken significant steps to respond to these and other recommendations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Broadcasting Board of Governors has responded to a disparate organizational structure and marketing challenges by developing a new strategic approach to broadcasting which, among other things, emphasizes reaching large audiences through modern broadcasting techniques. Organizationally, the existence of five separate broadcast entities has led to overlapping language services, duplication of program content, redundant newsgathering and support services, and difficulties coordinating broadcast efforts. Marketing challenges include outmoded program formats, poor signal delivery, and low audience awareness in many markets. Alhurra television broadcasts to the Middle East and Radio Farda broadcasts to Iran illustrate the Board's efforts to better manage program content and meet the needs of its target audiences. Although we have not validated available research data, the Board claims that the application of its new approach has led to dramatic increases in listening rates in key Middle East markets. To streamline its operations, the Board has used its annual language service review process to address such issues as how resources should be allocated among language services on the basis of their priority and impact, what degree of overlap should exist among services, and whether services should be eliminated because they have fulfilled their broadcast mission. Since 1999, the Board has identified more than $50 million in actual or potential savings through this process. In response to our recommendations on the Board's strategic planning and performance management efforts, the Board revised its strategic plan to make reaching large audiences in strategic markets the centerpiece of its performance reporting system. The Board also added broadcaster credibility and audience awareness to its array of performance measures and plans to add a measure of whether VOA is meeting its mandated mission."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to provide an overview of the three reports  we have issued over the past 4 years on the operations of the Broadcasting  Board of Governors.

Early implementation of this strategy has focused on markets  relevant to the war on terrorism, in particular the Middle East and central  Asia.", "Drawing from our published reports as well as recent testimony on U.S.  public diplomacy, I will talk today about (1) organizational and marketing  obstacles and the Board\u2019s efforts to overcome them, (2) what the Board  has done to manage its limited resources, and (3) the status of Board  efforts to develop meaningful performance goals and measures. I will also  discuss our recommendations to the Board and the status of its response  to them. As part of our work to prepare for this testimony, we met with  Board staff to obtain updated program data and current information on the  steps the Board has taken to respond to our recommendations.

In addition to serving as a reliable source of news and information, VOA is  responsible for presenting U.S. policies through a variety of means,  including officially labeled government editorials. Radio/TV Marti,  RFE/RL, and RFA were created by Congress to function as \u201csurrogate\u201d  broadcasters, designed to temporarily replace the local media of countries  where a free and open press does not exist. Created by the Bush  administration and the Board, the Middle East Television Network draws  its mission from the core purpose of U.S. international broadcasting,  which is to promote and sustain freedom by broadcasting accurate and  objective news and information about the United States and the world to  audiences overseas.", "In addition to the stand-alone entities that make up U.S. international  broadcasting, Congress and the Board have created other broadcast  organizations to meet specific program objectives. Congress created Radio  Free Iraq, Radio Free Iran, and Radio Free Afghanistan and incorporated  these services into RFE/RL\u2019s operations. Under its new strategic approach  to broadcasting, the Board and the Bush administration created Radio  Sawa, the Afghanistan Radio Network (ARN), Radio Farda, and Alhurra to  replace poorly performing services, more effectively combine existing  services, and create new broadcast entities where needed. Figure 1  illustrates the Board\u2019s current organizational structure.", "VOA, RFE/RL, and RFA are organized around a collection of language  services that produces program content. In some countries, more than one  entity broadcasts in the same language. These overlapping services are  designed to meet the distinct missions of each broadcast entity. Currently,  42 of the Board\u2019s 74 language services (or 57 percent) target the same  audiences in the same languages. While some degree of overlap is to be  expected given the varying missions of the broadcast entities, the Board  has concluded that this level of overlap requires ongoing analysis and  scrutiny.", "The Board\u2019s budget for fiscal year 2003 was approximately $552 million,  with nearly half of its resources used to cover transmission, technical  support, Board and IBB management staff salaries, and other support  costs. Among the broadcast entities, funds are roughly equally divided  among VOA and the four other U.S. broadcasting entities.

As we reported in July 2003, the Board has adopted a  new approach to broadcasting that is designed to overcome several of  these challenges. The Board\u2019s key organizational challenge is the disparate  mix of broadcast entities it is tasked with managing. To address this  problem, the Board has adopted a \u201csingle system\u201d approach to  broadcasting whereby broadcast entities are viewed as content providers  and the Board assumes a central role in tailoring this content to meet the  demands of individual markets. The Board also faces marketing challenges  that include the lack of a unique reason for listeners to tune in, the general  lack of target audiences within broadcast markets, and poor-to-fair signal  quality for many of the broadcast services. Recent initiatives such as Radio  Sawa and Alhurra have addressed these deficiencies, and the Board has  required that all broadcast services, to the extent feasible, address these  issues as well."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Disparate Structure of Broadcast Operations Remains an Ongoing Challenge", "paragraphs": ["The Board\u2019s major organizational challenge is the need to further  consolidate and streamline its operations to better leverage existing  resources and generate greater program impact in priority markets.  According to the Board\u2019s strategic plan, \u201cthe diversity of the Broadcasting  Board of Governors\u2014diverse organizations with different missions,  different frameworks, and different constituencies\u2014makes it a challenge  to bring all the separate parts together in a more effective whole.\u201d As  noted in our 2003 report, senior program managers and outside experts  with whom we spoke supported considering the option of consolidating  U.S. international broadcasting efforts into a single entity.", "The Board intends to create a unified broadcasting system by treating the  component parts of U.S. international broadcasting as a single system.  Under this approach, VOA and other U.S. broadcast entities are viewed as  content providers, and the Board\u2019s role is to bring this content together to  form new services or entities as needed. The single-system approach to  managing the Board\u2019s diversity requires that the Board actively manage  resources across broadcast entities to achieve common broadcast goals. A  good example of this strategy in action is Radio Farda, which combined  VOA and RFE/RL broadcast content to produce a new broadcast product  for the Iranian market. In the case of Radio Sawa, the Board replaced  VOA\u2019s poorly performing Arabic service with a new broadcast entity. The  Board\u2019s experience with implementing Radio Sawa suggests that it can be  difficult to make disparate broadcast entities work toward a common  purpose. For example, Board members and senior planners told us they  encountered some difficulties attempting to work with officials to launch  Radio Sawa within VOA\u2019s structure and were later forced to constitute  Radio Sawa as a separate grantee organization. While this move was  needed to achieve the Board\u2019s strategic objectives, it contributed to the  further fragmentation of U.S. international broadcasting."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "New Initiatives Address Marketing Challenges", "paragraphs": ["The Board\u2019s strategic plan comments openly on the marketing challenges  facing U.S. international broadcasters, specifically that many language  services lack a unique reason for listeners or viewers to tune in; few  language services have identified their target audiences\u2014a key first step in  developing a broadcast strategy; many language services have outmoded  formats and programs with an antiquated, even Cold War, sound and style;  and three-quarters of transmitted hours have poor or fair signal quality.", "Consistent with its \u201cMarrying the Mission to the Market\u201d philosophy, the  Board has sought to address these deficiencies in key markets with new  initiatives in Afghanistan, Iran, and the Middle East that support the war  on terrorism. The first project under the new approach, Radio Sawa  (recently added to the new Middle East Television Network), was  launched in March 2002 using many of the modern, market-tested  broadcasting techniques and practices prescribed in its strategic plan,  including identifying a target audience, researching the best way to attract  the target audience, and delivering programming to the Middle East in a  contemporary and appealing format. The Board\u2019s other recent initiatives  also have adhered to this new approach by being tailored to the specific  circumstances of each target market. These initiatives include the  Afghanistan Radio Network, Radio Farda service to Iran, and the Alhurra  satellite service to the Middle East. Table 1 describes the Board\u2019s recent  projects that support the war on terrorism.", "Although we have not validated available research data, the Board claims  that implementation of these marketing improvements has led to dramatic  increases in audience listening rates. For example, based on surveys  conducted by ACNielsen, the Board maintains that Radio Sawa is now the  number one international broadcaster in six countries in the Middle East,  reaching an average weekly audience of about 38 percent of the general  population and about 49 percent of its 15- to 29-year-old target audience  across all six countries. These levels far exceed the 1 to 2 percent  audience reach of the VOA Arabic service, which Radio Sawa replaced. In  addition, the Board\u2019s main research contractor\u2014Intermedia\u2014has  indicated that as of March 2004, Radio Farda is the leading international  broadcaster in Iran\u2014achieving an average weekly listenership of 15  percent, which is 10 percent more than the combined weekly audiences  for VOA and RFE/RL\u2019s prior services to Iran. Board officials have told us  that preliminary audience reach data for the Board\u2019s satellite channel  Alhurra will be available by June of this year. While the audience numbers  on Radios Sawa and Farda appear to be very positive, as we reported in  July 2003, U.S. broadcasters suffer from a credibility problem. To address  this issue, we recommended that the Board adopt measures of broadcaster  credibility, which the Board has recently implemented.", "In addition to these new initiatives, the Board has tasked all language  services with adopting the tenets of its new approach, such as identifying a  target audience and improving signal quality, to the maximum extent  possible within existing budget constraints. They hope that these  improvements will lead to significant audience boosts for a number of  higher- and lower-priority services that suffer from very low listening  rates. For example, data from the Board\u2019s 2003 language review show that  more than one-quarter of all language services had listening rates of fewer  than 2 percent at that time."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Language Service Review Used to Reallocate Millions to Higher- Priority Broadcast Needs", "paragraphs": ["The Board manages its limited resources through its annual language  service review process, which is used to address such issues as how  resources should be allocated among services based on their priority and  impact, how many broadcast services should be carried, what degree of  overlap and content duplication should exist among services, and  whether services should be eliminated because they have fulfilled their  broadcast mission. This process responds to the congressional mandate  that the Board periodically review the need to add and delete language  services. The Board has interpreted this mandate to include the expansion  and reduction of language services. Since 1999, the Board has identified  more than $50 million in actual or potential savings through the language  service review process by moving resources from lower- to higher-priority  services, by eliminating language services, and by reducing language  service overlap and transmission costs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Review Process Used to Address Complex Resource Issues", "paragraphs": ["As noted in our July 2003 report, the Board\u2019s strategic plan concludes that  if U.S. international broadcasting is to become a vital component of U.S.  foreign policy, it must focus on a clear set of broadcast priorities. The plan  notes that trying to do too much at the same time fractures this focus,  extends the span of control beyond management capabilities, and siphons  off precious resources. As discussed in our report, the Board determined  that current efforts to support its broadcast languages are \u201cunsustainable\u201d  with current resources, given its desire to increase impact in high-priority  markets. Our survey of senior program managers revealed that a majority  supported significantly reducing the total number of language services and  the overlap in services between VOA and the surrogate broadcasters. We  found that 18 of 24 respondents said that too many language services are  offered. When asked how many countries should have more than one U.S.  international broadcaster providing service in the same language, 23 of 28  respondents said this should occur in only a few countries or no countries  at all.", "The Board\u2019s annual language service review process serves as the Board\u2019s  principal tool for managing these complex resource questions. This  process has evolved into an intensive program and budget review that  culminates with ranked priority and impact listings for each of the Board\u2019s  74 language services. These ranked lists become the basis for proposed  language service reductions or eliminations and provide the Board with an  analytical basis for making such determinations using measures of U.S.  strategic interests, audience size, press freedom, and a host of other  factors. Since the first language service review process began in 1999 and  up through 2002, the Board has reduced the scope of operations of over 25  language services based on their priority and impact rankings and  reallocated about $19.7 million to help fund higher-priority broadcast  needs such as Radio Sawa and Radio Farda.", "As discussed in our February 2004 report, a clear example of the language  service review process in action was the Board\u2019s recent proposal to  eliminate 17 Central and Eastern European language services which  served to reduce the overall number of language services and eliminate  several overlapping services where the Board believed each broadcast  entity\u2019s mission had been completed. This decision resulted in  nonrecurring budget savings of about $8.8 million for fiscal year 2004 and  recurring annual savings of about $12.1 million. Our only criticism of this  decision was that the Board\u2019s language service review process did not  include a measure of press freedom that gauges whether the press acts  responsibly and professionally. This is a significant omission in the  Board\u2019s current measure, given the congressional concern that RFE/RL\u2019s  broadcast operations not be terminated until a country\u2019s domestic media  meet this condition. Board officials acknowledged that their existing  press freedom measure could be updated to include information on media  responsibility and professional quality, and work is under way to develop a  more comprehensive measure for the Board\u2019s 2004 language service  review."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Review of Overlapping Language Services Implemented", "paragraphs": ["In our September 2000 report, we cited the Board\u2019s concerns about  overlapping language services and its plans to address this issue in  subsequent iterations of the language service review process. In our July  2003 report we again raised the issue of language service overlap and  content duplication between VOA and the surrogates. We also noted that  while the Board\u2019s strategic plan identified overlap as a challenge, it failed  to answer questions about when it is appropriate to broadcast VOA and  surrogate programming in the same language.", "The Board has responded to our observations and recommendations by  incorporating a review of overlapping services in its language service  review process for 2003. The Board developed several approaches to  dealing with overlap. For example, services can be \u201cmerged\u201d by having one  service subsume another (as was the case with Radio Farda). A second  approach is to run alternating services, as is the case with the Afghanistan  Radio Network, which runs VOA and RFE/RL programming on a single  broadcast stream. Another approach is to simply terminate one or both  overlapping services. All of the Board\u2019s overlapping services were  assessed with these different approaches in mind. As a result of this  analysis, the Board identified an estimated $4.9 million in fiscal year 2004  and 2005 savings from overlap services that could be redirected to higher- priority broadcasting needs, such as expanded Persian language television  for Iran and expanded Urdu language radio for Pakistan."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Strategic Planning and Performance Management System Revised to Place a Greater Focus on Results", "paragraphs": ["Mr. Chairman, the Board has revised its strategic planning and  performance management system to respond to the recommendations in  our July 2003 report aimed at improving the measurement of its results.

Board officials have stated that this measure would help the Board  understand a key factor in audience share rates and what could be done to  address audience share deficiencies.
