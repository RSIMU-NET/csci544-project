Hence, the uses of information technology (IT)--in delivering clinical care, performing administrative functions, and supporting the public health infrastructure--have the potential to yield both cost savings and improvements in the care itself. In 2003, GAO reported on benefits to health care that could result from using IT--both cost savings and measurable improvements in the delivery and quality of care. GAO also reported on federal agencies' existing and planned information systems intended to support our nation's preparedness for and ability to respond to public health emergencies and the status of health care standards setting initiatives. Congress has asked GAO to summarize our work on reported benefits of the use of IT for health care delivery and on IT initiatives supporting public health preparedness and response."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The use of IT can yield benefits in clinical care and associated administrative functions as well as in public health. Health care organizations reported that electronic medical records (EMR) improved the delivery of care because, among other reasons, more complete medical documentation was available to support the provider's diagnosis. In addition, EMRs could greatly facilitate the reporting of public health information associated with the early detection of and response to disease outbreaks. One hospital replaced outpatients' paper medical charts with EMRs, realizing about $8.6 million in annual savings. This hospital also established electronic access to laboratory results and reports, replacing its manual process for handling medical records and saving another $2.8 million a year. In addition, the lessons learned that were reported to us by health care organizations that have successfully implemented solutions could be used by other organizations to accelerate the adoption of health IT. These lessons recognize the importance of reengineering business processes, gaining users' acceptance of IT, providing adequate training, and making systems secure. Regarding public health, federal agencies identified 72 existing and planned information systems--34 surveillance systems, 18 supporting technologies, 10 communications systems, and 10 detection systems. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is currently implementing its Public Health Information Network comprised of a number of disease surveillance and communications systems, including the Health Alert Network. This network is an early warning and response system that is intended to facilitate communication among federal, state, and local agencies during public health emergencies. GAO also reported that identification and implementation of health care data, communications, and security standards--which are necessary to support compatibility and interoperability of agencies' various IT systems--remained incomplete across the health care sector. To address the challenges of coordinating the many IT initiatives and implementing a consistent set of standards, GAO recommended last year that the Secretary of Health and Human Services develop a strategy for public health preparedness and response, to include setting priorities for IT initiatives and establishing mechanisms to monitor the implementation of standards throughout the health care industry. Since that time, progress has been made in identifying standards. The Office of Management and Budget's e-government initiative, the Consolidated Health Informatics initiative, has identified a number of standards to be applied to new federal development efforts and modifications of existing systems. This initiative is intended to promote the interoperability of information systems. However, implementing these standards across the federal government is still a work in progress. Until these standards are implemented, information-sharing challenges will remain. In April of this year, Executive Order 13335 established a National Health IT Coordinator and called for a strategic plan to guide the nationwide implementation of interoperable health IT. As this plan moves forward, it will be essential to have continued leadership, clear direction, measurable goals, and mechanisms to monitor progress."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss the benefits that effective  implementation of information technology (IT) can bring to the  health care industry.

According to  the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, the health care  industry generally uses less IT than other industries, and the extent  and types of IT deployed vary by setting and institution.  The health  care industry has recognized that IT can improve the quality of care,  promote patient safety, reduce costs of both care and administrative  functions, and expedite response to public health emergencies.", "Public health officials are increasingly concerned about our  exposure and susceptibility to infectious disease and food-borne  illness because of global travel, increased volume of food imports,  and the evolution of antibiotic-resistant pathogens.  Public health  experts maintain that a strong infrastructure could provide the  capacity to prepare for and respond to both acute and chronic  threats to the nation\u2019s health, whether they are bioterrorism attacks,  emerging infections, disparities in health status, or increases in  chronic disease and injury rates.", "IT can play an essential role in supporting federal, state, local, and  tribal governments in public health activities and clinical care  delivery. For public health emergencies in particular, the ability to  quickly exchange data from provider to public health agency\u2014or  from provider to provider\u2014is crucial in detecting and responding to  naturally occurring or intentional disease outbreaks. It allows  physicians to share individually identifiable information with public  health agencies for use in performing public health activities.", "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has  previously acknowledged several IT limitations in the public health  infrastructure. For example, basic capability for disease surveillance  systems to detect and analyze disease outbreaks is lacking for  several reasons. First, health care providers have traditionally used  paper- or telephone-based systems to report disease outbreaks to  approximately 3,000 public health agencies. This is a labor-intensive,  burdensome process for local health care providers and public  health officials, often resulting in incomplete and untimely data.  Second, not all public health agencies have access to the Internet or  to secure channels for electronically transmitting sensitive data.", "Several types of systems can play vital roles in identifying and  responding to public health emergencies, including acts of  bioterrorism.

Last October, we identified 20 examples of reported cost  savings or other benefits at 14 health care organizations that had  implemented IT solutions in their clinical care environments. The  rapidly rising costs of health care, along with an increasing concern  for the quality of care and the safety of patients, are driving health  care organizations to use IT to automate clinical care operations and  their associated administrative functions. IT is now being used for,  among other things, EMRs, order management, Internet access for  patient and provider communications, and automated billing and  financial management.", "Health care delivery organizations identified instances that resulted  in cost savings from the use of IT as a result of reductions in costs  associated with medication errors, communication and  documentation of clinical care and test results, staffing and paper  storage, and processing of information.

This network is an  early warning and response system intended to provide federal,  state, and local agencies with better communications during public  health emergencies.  The Department of Defense is using its  Electronic Surveillance System for the Early Notification of  Community-based Epidemics (ESSENSE) to support early  identification of infectious disease outbreaks in the military by  comparing analyses of data collected daily with historical trends.

We also identified other standards setting initiatives (e.g., CHI and  HIPPA) and raised concerns about coordinating these initiatives.", "To address the challenges of coordinating the many IT initiatives  and implementing a consistent set of standards, we recommended  that the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), in  coordination with other key stakeholders, establish a national IT  strategy for public health preparedness and response, including  specific steps toward improving the nation\u2019s ability to use IT in  support of the public health infrastructure.  Specifically, we  recommended, among other things, that the Secretary set priorities for information systems, supporting technologies,  and other IT initiatives; define activities for ensuring that the various standards-setting  organizations coordinate their efforts and reach further  consensus on the definition and use of standards; establish milestones for defining and implementing all standards; create a mechanism\u2014consistent with HIPAA requirements\u2014to  monitor the implementation of standards throughout the health  care industry.", "Since our May 2003 report, HHS has continued its efforts to identify  applicable standards throughout the health care industry and across  federal health care programs.  For example, in May 2004, the CHI  initiative\u2014one of OMB\u2019s e-government projects\u2014announced fifteen  additional standards that build on the initial five announced in  March 2003.  Federal agencies are expected to include the standards  in their architectures and when they build, acquire, or modify  systems.  Current plans for the CHI initiative call for it to be  incorporated into HHS\u2019s Federal Health Architecture by September  2004.  This architecture is still evolving, and many issues\u2014such as  coordination of the various standards setting efforts and  implementation of the standards that have been identified\u2014are still  works in progress.  Until these standards are more fully  implemented, federal agencies and others associated with the public  health infrastructure cannot ensure that their systems will be  capable of exchanging data with other systems when needed and  consequently cannot ensure effective preparation for and response  to public health emergencies, including acts of bioterrorism.", "In addition, in April of this year, the President issued an Executive  Order, which calls for the establishment of a National Health  Information Technology Coordinator and the issuance of a broader  strategic plan to guide the nationwide implementation of  interoperable health care information systems.  The coordinator is  also specifically tasked with creating incentives for the use of health  IT and accelerating the adoption of EMRs, among other things.
