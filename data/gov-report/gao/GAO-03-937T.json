The case weights, however, are about 10 years old, and the data on which the weights are based are as much as 15 years old. Changes since 1993, such as the characteristics of cases filed in federal district courts and changes in case management practices, may have affected whether the 1993 case weights continue to be a reasonably accurate measure of the average time burden on district court judges resulting from a specific volume and mix of cases. The Judicial Conference's Subcommittee on Judicial Statistics has approved a research design for updating the current case weights, and we have some concerns about that design. The design would include limited data on the time judges actually spend on specific types of cases. The proposed design would not include collecting actual data on the non-courtroom time that judges spend on different types of cases. Estimates of the non-courtroom time required for specific types of cases would be based on estimates derived from the structured, guided discussions of about 100 experienced judges meeting in 12 separate groups (one for each geographic circuit).

Some types of cases may  demand relatively little time, and others may require many hours of work.  To measure the case-related workload of district court judges, the Judicial  Conference has adopted weighted case filings. The purpose of the district  court case weights was to create a measure of the average judge time that  a specific number and mix of cases filed in a district court would require.  Importantly, the weights were designed to be descriptive not  prescriptive\u2014that is, the weights were designed to develop a measure of  the national average amount of time that judges actually spent on specific  types of cases, not to develop a measure of how much time judges should  spend on specific types of cases. Moreover, the weights were designed to  measure only case-related judge workload. Judges have noncase-related  duties and responsibilities, such as administrative tasks, that are not  reflected in the case weights.", "With few exceptions, such as cases that are remanded to a district court  from the courts of appeals, each civil and criminal case filed in a district  court is assigned a case weight.  Each case filed in a district court is  assigned a case weight based on the subject matter of the case. The weight  of the overall average case is 1.0. All other weights were established  relative to this national average case. Thus, a case with a weight of 0.5  would be expected to require on average about half as much judge time as  the national average case, and a case with a value of 2.0 would be  expected to require on average about twice as much judge time as the  national average case. Case weights for criminal felony defendants are  applied on a per defendant basis. For example, the case weight for  heroin/cocaine distribution is 2.27. If such a case involved two defendants,  the court would be credited with a weight of 4.54\u2014two times the assigned  case weight of 2.27. Of course, the actual amount of time a judge may  spend on any specific case may be more or less than the national average  for that type of case.", "Total weighted filings for a district are determined by summing the case  weights associated with all the cases filed in the district during the year.  Weighted case filings per authorized judgeship\u2014is the total annual  weighted filings divided by the total number of authorized judgeships for  the district. For example, if a district had total weighted filings of 4,600  and 10 authorized judgeships, its weighted filings per authorized judgeship  would be 460. The Judicial Conference uses weighted filings of 430 or  more per authorized judgeship as an indication that a district may need  one or more additional judgeships. Thus, a district with 460 weighted  filings per authorized judgeship could be considered for an additional  judgeship.", "The Judicial Conference approved the use of the current district court  case weights in 1993. The weights are based on a \u201ccase-tracking time  study,\u201d conducted between 1987 and 1993, in which judges recorded the  amount of time spent on each of their cases included in the study. The  study included about 8,100 civil cases and about 4,200 criminal cases.  Overall, the weighted case filings, as approved in 1993, are a reasonably  accurate method of measuring the average judge time that a specific  number and mix of cases filed in a district court would require. The  methodology used to develop the case weights was reasonable.

Changes since the case weights  were finalized in 1993, such as changes in the characteristics of cases filed  in federal district courts and in case management practices, may affect  how accurately the weights continue to reflect the time burden on district  court judges today. For example, since 1993, new civil causes of action  (such as telemarketing issues) and criminal offenses (such as new  terrorism offenses) needed to be accommodated within the existing case- weight structure. According to FJC officials, where the new cause of  action or criminal offense is similar to an existing case-weight type, the  weight for the closest case type is assigned.

The design for the new case weights relies on three sources of data  for specific types of cases: (1) data from automated databases identifying  the docketed events associated with cases; (2) data from automated  sources on the time associated with courtroom events for cases, such as  trials or hearings; and (3) estimated time data from structured, guided  discussion among experienced judges on the time associated with  noncourtroom events for cases, such as reading briefs or writing opinions.", "Although the proposed methodology appears to offer the benefit of  reduced judicial burden (no time study data collection), potential cost  savings, and reduced calendar time to develop the new weights, we have  two principal concerns about the research design\u2014the challenge of  obtaining reliable, comparable data from two different automated data  systems for the analysis and the limited collection of actual data on the  time judges spend on cases.", "The design assumes that judicial time spent on a given case can be  accurately estimated by viewing the case as a set of individual tasks or  events in the case. Information about event frequencies and, where  available, time spent on the events would be extracted from existing  administrative data bases and reports and then used to develop estimates  of the judge-time spent on different types of cases. For event data, the  research design proposes using data from new technology (the Case  Management/Electronic Case Filing System) that is currently being  introduced into the court system for recording case management  information. However, not all courts have implemented the new system,  and data from the existing and new systems will have to be integrated to  obtain and analyze the event data. FJC researchers, who would conduct  the research, recognize the challenges this poses and have developed a  strategy for addressing the issues, which includes forming a technical  advisory group from FJC, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, and  individual courts to develop a method of reliably extracting and  integrating data from the two case management systems for analysis.", "Second, the research design does not require judges to record time spent  on individual cases. Actual time data would be limited to that available  from existing reports on the time associated with courtroom events and  proceedings for different types of cases. However, a majority of district  judges\u2019 time is spent on case-related work outside the courtroom. The time  required for noncourtroom events would be derived from structured,  guided discussions of groups of 8 to 13 experienced district court judges in  each of the 12 geographic circuits (about 100 judges in all). The judges  would develop estimates of the time required for different events in  different types of cases within each circuit, using FJC-developed \u201cdefault  values\u201d as the reference point for developing their estimates. These default  values would be based in part on the existing case weights and in part on  other types of analyses. Following the meetings of the judges in each  circuit, a national group of 24 judges (2 from each circuit) would consider  the data from the 12 circuit groups and develop the new weights.", "The accuracy of judges\u2019 time estimates is dependent upon the experience  and knowledge of the participating judges and the accuracy and reliability  of the judges\u2019 recall about the time required for different events in  different types of cases\u2014about 150 if all the case types in the current case  weights were used.

We found that adjusted case filings are based on data available  from standard statistical reports for the courts of appeals. The measure is  not based on any empirical data about the judge time required by different  types of cases in the courts of appeals.", "The Judicial Conference\u2019s policy is that courts of appeals with adjusted  case filings of 500 or more per three-judge panel may be considered for  one or more additional judgeships. Courts of appeals generally decide  cases using constantly rotating three-judge panels. Thus, if a court had   12 authorized judgeships, those judges could be assigned to four panels of  three judges each. In assessing judgeship needs for the courts of appeals,  the Conference may also consider factors other than adjusted case filings,  such as the geography of the circuit or the median time from case filings to  dispositions.", "Adjusted case filings are used for 11 of the 12 courts of appeals. It is not  used for the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. A FJC study of that  court\u2019s workload determined that adjusted case filings were not an  appropriate means of measuring the court\u2019s judgeship needs. The court  had a high proportion of administrative agency appeals that occurred  almost exclusively in the Court of Appeals for D.C. and were more  burdensome than other types of cases in several respects\u2014e.g., more  independently represented participants per case, more briefs filed per  case, and a higher rate of case consolidation.", "Essentially, the adjusted case filings workload measure counts all case  filings equally, with two exceptions. First, cases refiled and approved for  reinstatement are excluded from total case filings. Second, two-thirds of  pro se cases\u2014defined by the Administrative Office as cases in which one  or both of the parties are not represented by an attorney\u2014are deducted  from total case filings (that is, they are effectively weighted at 0.33). For  example, a court with 600 total pro se filings in a fiscal year would be  credited with 198 adjusted pro se case filings (600 x 0.33). The remaining  nonpro se cases would be weighted at 1.0 each. Thus, a court of appeals  with 1,600 case filings (excluding reinstatements)\u2014600 pro se cases and  1,000 nonpro se cases\u2014would be credited with 1,198 adjusted case filings  (198 discounted pro se cases plus 1,000 nonpro se cases). If this court had  6 judges (allow two panels of 3 judges each), it would have 599 adjusted  case filings per 3-judge panel, and, thus, under Judicial Conference policy,  could be considered for an additional judgeship.", "The current court of appeals workload measure represents an effort to  improve the previous measure. In our 1993 report on judgeship needs  assessment, we noted that the restraint of individual courts of appeals, not  the workload standard, seemed to have determined the actual number of  appellate judgeships the Judicial Conference requested. At the time the  current measure was developed and approved, using the new benchmark  of 500 adjusted case filings resulted in judgeship numbers that closely  approximated the judgeship needs of the majority of the courts of appeals,  as the judges of each court perceived them. The current courts of appeals  case-related workload measure principally reflects a policy decision using  historical data on filings and terminations. It is not based on empirical data  regarding the judge time that different types of cases may require.

The letter also noted that the workloads of the courts of appeals entail  important factors that have defied measurement, including the significant  differences in the courts\u2019 case processing techniques. The Deputy Director  of FJC, in a May 27, 2003, letter agreed that the estimated data on  noncourtroom judge time in the new study would not permit the  calculation of standard errors.
