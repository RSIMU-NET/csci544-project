By law, DHS is to lead and coordinate efforts to protect several thousand CIKR assets deemed vital to the nation's security, public health, and economy. In 2006, DHS created the National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP) to outline the approach for integrating CIKR and increased its emphasis on resiliency in its 2009 update. GAO was asked to assess the extent to which DHS (1) has incorporated resiliency into the programs it uses to work with asset owners and operators and (2) is positioned to disseminate information it gathers on resiliency practices to asset owners and operators. GAO reviewed DHS documents, such as the NIPP, and interviewed DHS officials and 15 owners and operators of assets selected on the basis of geographic diversity. The results of these interviews are not generalizable but provide insights."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DHS's efforts to incorporate resiliency into the programs it uses to work with asset owners and operators is evolving but program management could be strengthened. Specifically, DHS is developing or updating programs to assess vulnerability and risk at CIKR facilities and within groups of related infrastructure, regions, and systems to place greater emphasis on resiliency. However, DHS has not taken commensurate efforts to measure asset owners' and operators' actions to address resiliency gaps. DHS operates its Protective Security Advisor Program, which deploys critical infrastructure protection and security specialists, called Protective Security Advisors (PSA), to assist asset owners and operators on CIKR protection strategies, and has provided guidelines to PSAs on key job tasks such as how to establish relationships between asset owners and operators and DHS, federal, state, and local officials. DHS has provided training to PSAs on resiliency topics, but has not updated PSA guidelines to articulate the role of PSAs with regard to resiliency issues, or how PSAs are to promote resiliency strategies and practices to asset owners and operators. A senior DHS official described plans to update PSA guidelines and the intent to outline this plan in October 2010, but did not provide information on what changes would be made to articulate PSA roles and responsibility with regard to resiliency. By developing measures to assess the extent to which asset owners and operators are addressing resiliency gaps and updating PSA guidance, DHS would be better positioned to manage its efforts to help asset owners and operators enhance their resiliency. DHS faces barriers disseminating information about resiliency practices across the spectrum of asset owners and operators. DHS shares information on potential protective measures with asset owners and operators and others including state and local officials (generally on a case-by-case basis) after it has completed vulnerability assessments at CIKR facilities. DHS officials told GAO that they have considered ways to disseminate information that they collect or plan to collect with regard to resiliency. However, DHS faces barriers sharing information about resiliency strategies. For example, given the voluntary nature of the CIKR partnership, DHS officials stated that DHS should not be viewed as identifying and promoting practices which could be construed by CIKR partners to be standards. Also, according to DHS officials, the need for and the emphasis on resiliency can vary across different types of facilities depending on the nature of the facility. For example, an oil refinery is inherently different than a government office building. DHS's efforts to emphasize resiliency when developing or updating the programs it uses to work with owners and operators creates an opportunity for DHS to position itself to disseminate information about resiliency practices within and across the spectrum of asset owners and operators. By determining the feasibility of overcoming barriers and developing an approach for disseminating information on resiliency practices within and across sectors, DHS could better position itself to help asset owners and operators consider and adopt resiliency strategies."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DHS develop resiliency performance measures, update PSA guidelines, and determine the feasibility of developing an approach to disseminate resiliency information.

The infrastructure damage  and resulting chaos disrupted government and business functions alike,  producing cascading effects far beyond the physical location of the storm.  Threats against critical infrastructure are not limited to natural disasters.  For example, in 2005, suicide bombers struck London\u2019s public  transportation system, disrupting the city\u2019s transportation and mobile  telecommunications infrastructure. In March 2007, we reported that our  nation\u2019s critical infrastructures and key resources (CIKR)\u2014assets and  systems, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that their  incapacity or destruction would have a debilitating impact on national  security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or  any combination of those matters\u2014continue to be vulnerable to a wide  variety of threats. According to the Department of Homeland Security  (DHS), because the private sector owns the vast majority of the nation\u2019s  CIKR\u2014banking and financial institutions, telecommunications networks,  and energy production and transmission facilities, among others\u2014it is  vital that the public and private sectors work together to protect these  assets and systems.", "The Homeland Security Act of 2002 created DHS and gave the department  wide-ranging responsibilities for, among other things, leading and  coordinating the overall national critical infrastructure protection effort.  Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-7 further defined critical  infrastructure protection responsibilities for DHS and those federal  agencies\u2014known as sector-specific agencies (SSAs)\u2014responsible for  particular CIKR sectors, such as the chemical, commercial facilities,  communications, energy, and transportation sectors. HSPD-7 directed  DHS to establish uniform policies, approaches, guidelines, and  methodologies for integrating federal infrastructure protection and risk  management activities within and across the 17 CIKR sectors. The  directive also gave DHS the authority to establish additional sectors and in  2008, DHS established an 18th sector for critical manufacturing.", "In accordance with the Homeland Security Act and in response to HSPD-7,  DHS issued the first National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP) in  June 2006, which provides the overarching approach for integrating the  nation\u2019s CIKR protection initiatives into a single national effort. DHS  issued a revised NIPP in January 2009. The NIPP sets forth a risk  management framework and details the roles and responsibilities for DHS,  SSAs, and other federal, state, regional, local, tribal, territorial, and private  sector partners implementing the NIPP, including how they should use  risk management principles to prioritize protection activities within and  across sectors. Within the NIPP framework, DHS has emphasized the  importance of collaboration and partnering with and among the various  partners and its reliance on voluntary information sharing between the  private sector and DHS. The NIPP provides the framework for developing,  implementing, and maintaining a coordinated national effort to protect  CIKR in the 18 sectors. Each of the CIKR sectors is represented in the  federal planning process by a SSA; a government coordinating council  (GCC) to represent each sector\u2019s interests among government agencies;  and a sector coordinating council (SCC) that includes private sector  representatives of the sector. Each sector is responsible for developing  sector-specific plans and sector annual reports. The sector-specific plans  are to provide the means by which the NIPP is implemented across the  sectors, as well as a national framework for each sector that guides the  development, implementation, and updating of state and local homeland  security strategies and CIKR protection programs. Sector annual reports  articulate the progress of the sector\u2019s CIKR protection and resiliency  efforts, challenges, and needs to other sectors, government agencies, CIKR  partners, the Executive Office of the President, and Congress.", "As part of its risk management strategy, DHS has established a National  Critical Infrastructure Prioritization Program which uses a tiered approach  to identify nationally significant CIKR to enhance decision making related  to CIKR protection. These assets and systems can include a range of  businesses or facilities in a local geographic area, such as refineries,  chemical facilities, or commercial facilities, as well as the information  systems and data systems that ensure their continued operation. CIKR  identified through the program include several thousand level 1 or level 2  assets and systems which are those that if destroyed or disrupted, could  cause some combination of significant casualties, major economic losses,  or widespread and long-term disruptions to national well-being and  governance capacity. According to DHS, the overwhelming majority of the  assets and systems identified through this effort are classified as level 2.  Only a small subset of assets meet the level 1 consequence threshold\u2014 those whose loss or damage could result in major national or regional  impacts similar to the impacts of Hurricane Katrina or the September 11,  2001 attacks. We placed the protection of the federal government\u2019s  information systems and the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure on our high- risk list in 1997 because the security of the information systems, networks,  and data that sustain the operations of CIKR is essential to preventing  disruptions in critical operations across and among CIKR.", "Over the last several years, various stakeholders, including members of  Congress, academia, and the private sector have questioned DHS\u2019s  approach to critical infrastructure protection. These stakeholders have  expressed concerns that DHS has placed most of its emphasis on  protection\u2014actions to deter the threat, mitigate vulnerabilities, or  minimize the consequences associated with an attack or disaster\u2014rather  than resiliency\u2014which, according to DHS, is the ability to resist, absorb,  recover from, or successfully adapt to adversity or a change in conditions.  In response to your request that we study DHS\u2019s revisions to the NIPP and  efforts by DHS to address resiliency as part of its national planning efforts,  in March 2010 we reported that DHS had increased its emphasis on the  concept of critical infrastructure resiliency as a part of its national CIKR  planning efforts. Specifically, DHS has increased its emphasis on  resiliency in the most recent edition of the NIPP and has directed SSAs to  address resiliency in their sector-specific plans, which SSAs intend to  publish later this year.", "To further address your request, this report focuses on DHS efforts to  work with asset owners and operators to incorporate and enhance  resiliency, commensurate with DHS\u2019s increased emphasis on resiliency in  the NIPP. Specifically, we assessed the extent to which DHS    has taken action to incorporate resiliency into the programs it uses to  work with asset owners and operators, and is positioned to disseminate information it gathers about resiliency  practices to asset owners and operators within and across sectors.", "To assess the extent to which DHS has taken action to incorporate  resiliency into the programs it uses to work with asset owners and  operators, we reviewed DHS policies, procedures, and documents on  partnering and information sharing between the public and private sectors  including the NIPP; sector-specific plans; and sector annual reports. We  interviewed senior DHS officials responsible for planning, coordinating,  and overseeing the national effort to reduce risk to CIKR to obtain  information on DHS\u2019s efforts to work with CIKR partners, including asset  owners and operators. Furthermore, we reviewed DHS documents on  programs used to assess vulnerability and risk at CIKR facilities and the  tools DHS uses to assess vulnerability to examine the extent to which, and  in what context, the concept of resiliency was used as part of those  assessments. Because it was out of the scope of our work, we did not  assess the implementation or results of these assessments. In addition, we  reviewed and analyzed DHS documents and reports resulting from these  vulnerability assessments. We selected 4 of 17 sectors\u2014the chemical,  commercial facilities, communications, and energy sectors\u2014based on our  analysis of sector-specific plans published in fiscal year 2007. In making  our selections, we focused on the extent to which the plans (1) discussed  the concept of resiliency while considering key terms associated with  resiliency\u2014resilience, resilient, and continuity (business or operational  continuity) and (2) provided key information on various factors\u2014 including goals and objectives, measuring performance, and processes for  prioritizing assets and assessing vulnerability\u2014called for in DHS  guidelines for developing these plans. We used our analysis to rank the  sectors and conferred with various DHS officials familiar with the sector  plans about the results of our analysis. Based on these discussions, we  selected 2 of the highest and 2 of the lowest ranked sectors in terms of  discussing resiliency concepts and providing key information.", "We also used our selection methodology as the basis for interviewing  representatives\u2014owners and operators\u2014of assets, also known as  facilities, in two geographic locations. These facilities were (1) designated  as a level 1 or 2 asset on the DHS critical asset list and (2) located in areas  that had recently been affected by disasters (hurricanes in Texas and  wildfires in California). We chose these locations to visit considering the  type of disaster and geographic dispersion. During our site visits, we  interviewed representatives of 15 individual assets, including  representatives that worked on-site and in the corporate office, to  determine the extent to which they receive guidance on resiliency from  and partner with DHS. Among other things, we focused on the role of  Protective Security Advisors (PSAs) who serve as liaisons between DHS  and security stakeholders, to include asset owners and operators, in local  communities. We also reviewed PSA program guidance and interviewed 10  of 93 PSAs to discuss their roles and responsibilities in partnering with  asset owners and operators to incorporate resiliency practices and their  knowledge of resiliency policies, practices, and techniques. We selected  these PSAs from a nonprobability sample based on a variety of factors  including geographic location, the number of CIKR assets in a location,  and types and frequency of natural disasters in the region. While the  results of our interviews cannot be generalized to reflect the views of all  asset owners and operators or PSAs nationwide, the information obtained  provided us with the perspectives of various asset owners and operators  and PSAs about critical infrastructure protection and resiliency. We also  interviewed DHS officials about their plans for revising the various  assessment programs and tools and compared the results of our work with  The Standard for Program Management, which provides guidelines for  successfully managing programs and projects. We also compared the  results of our efforts and DHS\u2019s PSA guidance with criteria in the  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government and the  Standard for Program Management.", "To assess the extent to which DHS is positioned to disseminate  information it gathers about resiliency practices with asset owners and  operators within and across sectors, we reviewed DHS policies,  procedures, and documents including the NIPP, sector-specific plans, and  sector annual reports on CIKR information sharing with a particular focus  on DHS\u2019s approach to information sharing on protective measures and  resiliency practices and strategies with asset owners and operators. We  interviewed DHS officials on their efforts to share information and  facilitate the sharing of information on resiliency practices. In addition, we  interviewed representatives of 15 assets in Texas and California about the  mechanisms, policies, and practices DHS uses to facilitate the sharing of  information related to resiliency, what resiliency-related practices  associated with disasters they had identified, the extent to which they  have implemented or are continuing to implement such practices into their  daily operations, and whether they shared these best practices with DHS  and other CIKR partners.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2008 through  September 2010 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards.

For example, while the focus of the Tennessee  Valley Authority RRAP was energy sector sites and resources, DHS and its  partners examined sites and resources in those sectors, like water and  dams, which appeared to be obvious interdependencies. However, they  also found that they needed to examine sites and resources in those  sectors that appeared less obvious but were interdependent because they  were intricately connected to the Tennessee Valley Authority operations,  like sites and resources in the transportation sector. Also, in fiscal year  2010, DHS started an RRAP in Atlanta that focused primarily on  commercial facilities. DHS\u2019s related vulnerability assessment of sites (see  the discussion below for additional details of these assessments) and  resources associated with the water sector in Atlanta showed that an  accident or attack involving one component of the water sector could  disrupt the operations of sites or resources of other sectors in the  geographic area covered by the RRAP. By discovering this vulnerability,  and taking steps to address it, asset owners and operators in various  sectors that were provided this information were better positioned to be  able to work together to mitigate this potential problem.

According to the NIPP, the use of performance  measures is a critical step in the NIPP risk management process to enable  DHS and the SSAs to objectively and quantitatively assess improvement in  CIKR protection and resiliency at the sector and national levels. The NIPP  states that while the results of risk analyses help sectors set priorities,  performance metrics allow NIPP partners to track progress against these  priorities and provide a basis for DHS and the SSAs to establish  accountability, document actual performance, facilitate diagnoses,  promote effective management, and provide a feedback mechanism to  decision makers. Consistent with the NIPP, senior DHS officials told us  that they have recently begun to measure the rate of asset owner and  operator implementation of protective measures following the conduct of  the ECIP security survey. Specifically, in a June 2010 memorandum to the  Assistant Secretary for NPPD, the Acting Director of PSCD stated that 234  (49 percent) of 437 sites where the ECIP security survey had been  conducted implemented protective measures during the 180-day period  following the conduct of the ECIP survey. The Acting Director reported  that the 234 sites made a total of 497 improvements across the various  categories covered by the ECIP security survey, including information  sharing, security management, security force, physical security, and  dependencies while 239 sites reported no improvements during the period.  The Acting Director stated that the metrics were the first that were  produced demonstrating the impact of the ECIP program, but noted that  PSCD is reexamining the collection process to determine whether  additional details should be gathered during the update to the ECIP  security survey planned for October 2010. However, because DHS has not  completed its efforts to include resiliency material as part of its  vulnerability assessment programs, it does not currently have performance  metrics of resiliency measures taken by asset owners and operators.", "Moving forward, as DHS\u2019s efforts to emphasize resiliency evolve through  the introduction of new or revised assessment programs and tools, it has  the opportunity to consider including additional metrics of resiliency  measures adopted at the facilities it assesses for vulnerability and risk,  particularly as it revises the ECIP security survey and develops the  resiliency dashboard. Moreover, DHS could consider developing similar  metrics for the SAV at individual facilities and the RRAP and mini-RAP in  the areas covered by RRAPs and mini-RAPs. By doing so, DHS could be  able to demonstrate its effectiveness in promoting resiliency among the  asset owners and operators it works with and would have a basis for  analyzing performance gaps. Regarding the latter, DHS managers would  have a valuable tool to help them assess where problems might be  occurring or alternatively provide insights into the tools used to assess  vulnerability and risk and whether they were focusing on the correct  elements of resiliency at individual facilities or groups of facilities."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DHS Has Made Training on Resiliency Available to PSAs, but Guidelines on PSA Roles and Responsibilities Do Not Reflect DHS\u2019s Growing Emphasis on Resiliency", "paragraphs": ["DHS uses PSAs to provide assistance to asset owners and operators on  CIKR protection strategies. Although DHS had begun to train PSAs about  resiliency and how it applies to the owners and operators they interact  with, DHS has not updated PSAs\u2019 guidance that outlines their roles and  responsibilities to reflect DHS\u2019s growing emphasis on resiliency. In April  2010, DHS provided a 1-hour training course called \u201cAn Introduction to  Resilience\u201d to all PSAs at a conference in Washington, D.C. The training  was designed to define resilience; present resilience concepts, including  information on how resilience is tied to risk analysis and its link to  infrastructure dependencies and interdependencies; discuss how  resilience applies to PSAs, including a discussion of the aforementioned  updates to programs and tools used to do vulnerability assessments; and  explain how DHS\u2019s focus on resilience can benefit asset owners and  operators. According to the Acting Deputy Director of PSCD, PSCD is  expected to deliver the training to PSAs again during regional conferences  to foster further discussions about resiliency and to give PSAs an  additional opportunity to ask questions about the training they received in  April 2010.", "Although DHS\u2019s training discusses how resiliency applies to PSAs and how  it can benefit asset owners and operators, DHS has not updated guidance  that discusses PSA roles and responsibilities related to resiliency. The  guidance DHS has provided to PSAs on certain key job tasks, issued in  2008, includes discussions about how PSAs are to (1) implement their role  and responsibilities during a disaster; (2) conduct vulnerability  assessments; and (3) establish or enhance existing strong relationships  between asset owners and operators and DHS, federal, state, and local law  enforcement personnel. However, the guidance does not articulate the role  of PSAs with regard to resiliency issues, or how PSAs are to promote  resiliency strategies and practices to asset owners and operators. For  example, our review of DHS\u2019s engagement guidance for PSAs showed that  the guidance does not explicitly discuss resiliency; rather, it focuses  primarily on protection. Specifically, the executive summary of the  guidance states that one of the key infrastructure protection roles for DHS  in fiscal year 2008 was to form partnerships with the owners and operators  of the nation\u2019s identified high-priority CIKR, known as level 1 and level 2  assets and systems. The guidance describes particular PSA responsibilities  with regard to partnerships, including (1) identifying protective measures  currently in place at these facilities and tracking the implementation of  any new measures into the future; (2) informing owners and operators of  the importance of their facilities in light of the ever-present threat of  terrorism; and (3) establishing or enhancing existing relationships  between owners and operators, DHS, and federal, state, and local law  enforcement personnel to provide increased situational awareness  regarding potential threats, knowledge of the current security posture at  each facility, and a federal resource to asset owners and operators. There  is one reference to a resiliency-related concept in an appendix where DHS  indicated that the criteria to identify level 2 assets in the Information  Technology sector should be \u201cthose assets that provide incident  management capabilities, specifically, sites needed for rapid restoration or  continuity of operations.\u201d", "PSA program officials said that they are currently developing guidelines on  a number of issues as DHS transitions from a CIKR program heavily  focused on protection to one that incorporates and promotes resiliency.  They said that PSAs do not currently have roles and responsibilities  specific to \u201cresiliency\u201d because resiliency is a concept that has only  recently gained significant and specific attention. They added that PSA  roles and responsibilities, while not specifically mentioning resiliency,  include component topics that comprise or otherwise contribute to  resiliency as it is now defined. Nonetheless, the Acting Deputy Director of  IP\u2019s PSCD said that he envisions updating PSA guidance to incorporate  resiliency concepts and that he intends to outline his plan for doing so in  October 2010 as part of IP\u2019s program planning process. However, he was  not specific about the changes he plans to make to address resiliency  concepts or whether the PSA\u2019s roles and responsibilities related to  resiliency would be articulated. According to standards for internal  control in the federal government, management is responsible for  developing and documenting the detailed policies and procedures to  ensure that they are an integral part of operations. By updating PSA  guidance that discusses the role PSAs play in assisting asset owners and  operators, including how PSAs can work with them to mitigate  vulnerabilities and strengthen their security, PSA program officials would  be better positioned to help asset owners and operators have the tools  they need to develop resilience strategies. This would be consistent with  DHS efforts to train PSAs about resiliency and how it affects asset owners  and operators. Updating PSA guidelines to address resiliency issues would  also be consistent with DHS\u2019s efforts to treat resiliency on an equal footing  with protection, and would comport with DHS guidance that calls for SSAs  to enhance their discussion of resiliency and resiliency strategies in SSPs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DHS Could Better Position Itself to Disseminate Information about Resiliency Practices with Asset Owners and Operators within and across Sectors", "paragraphs": ["DHS\u2019s efforts to emphasize resiliency in the programs and tools it uses to  work with asset owners and operators also creates an opportunity for DHS  to better position itself to disseminate information about resiliency  practices to asset owners and operators within and across sectors.  Currently, DHS shares information on vulnerabilities and protective  measures on a case-by-case basis. However, while it is uniquely positioned  and has considered disseminating information about resiliency practices,  DHS faces barriers in doing so and has not developed an approach for  sharing this information more broadly, across sectors."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DHS Shares Information on Vulnerabilities and Protective Measures on a Case-by-Case Basis", "paragraphs": ["According to the NIPP, its effective implementation is predicated on active  participation by government and private-sector partners in meaningful,  multidirectional information sharing. The NIPP states that when asset  owners and operators are provided with a comprehensive picture of  threats or hazards to CIKR and participate in ongoing multidirectional  information flow, their ability to assess risks, make prudent security  investments, and develop appropriate resiliency strategies is substantially  enhanced. Similarly, according to the NIPP, when the government is  provided with an understanding of private-sector information needs, it can  adjust its information collection, analysis, synthesis, and dissemination  accordingly. Consistent with the NIPP, DHS shares information on  vulnerabilities and potential protective measures with asset owners and  operators after it has collected and analyzed information during SAVs and  ECIP security surveys performed at their individual facilities. This  information includes vulnerabilities DHS has identified, and corresponding  steps these owners and operators can take to mitigate these  vulnerabilities, including options for consideration, which are suggestions  presented to owners and operators to help them resolve vulnerabilities  identified during DHS\u2019s assessments. For example, DHS issues SAV  reports to owners and operators that, among other things, identify  vulnerabilities; help them identify their security posture; provide options  for consideration to increase their ability to detect and prevent terrorist  attacks; and enhance their ability to mitigate vulnerabilities. Regarding the  ECIP security survey, DHS provides owners and operators an ECIP  \u201cdashboard\u201d which shows the results for each component of the survey for  a facility using an index, called the Protective Measures Index (PMI),  which are scores DHS prepares for the facility and individual components  that can be compared to other similar facilities\u2019 scores. SAV reports and  the ECIP dashboard generally focus on similar protection issues, such as  facility or physical security, security personnel, and access control. The  SAV reports and the ECIP dashboard discuss some continuity of  operations issues that could be considered resiliency related. For example,  the ECIP dashboard contains PMIs focused on whether the facility has a  continuity plan and conducts continuity exercises, while the SAV report  discusses whether the facility would be able to operate if resources such  as electricity, water, or natural gas were not available. As discussed  earlier, DHS is currently updating the SAV to include, among other things,  an assessment of resiliency characteristics and gaps, and is taking action  to develop a resiliency dashboard similar to that used under the ECIP  security survey.", "Senior IP officials also stated that they share information on steps owners  and operators can take to protect their facilities via Common  Vulnerabilities, Potential Indicators, and Protective Measures (CV/PI/PM)  reports. DHS develops and disseminates these reports to various  stakeholders, generally on a need-to-know basis, including specific owners  and operators, such as those that have been included in assessments by  PSAs; law enforcement officials, emergency responders, and state  homeland security officials; and others who request access to the reports.  These reports, which focus on vulnerabilities and security measures  associated with terrorist attacks, are intended to provide information on  potential vulnerabilities and specific protective measures that various  stakeholders can implement to increase their security posture. According  to DHS, these reports are developed based on DHS\u2019s experiences and  observations gathered from a range of security-related vulnerability  assessments, including SAVs, performed at infrastructures over time, such  as the chemical and commercial facilities sectors and subsectors and asset  types within those sectors, such as the chemical hazardous storage  industry or the restaurant industry, respectively. For example, like other  CV/PI/PM reports, DHS\u2019s report on the restaurant industry gives a brief  overview of the industry; potential indicators of terrorist activity; common  vulnerabilities; and protective measures. Common vulnerabilities include  unrestricted public access and open access to food; potential indicators of  terrorist activity include arson, small arms attack, persons wearing  unusually bulky clothing to conceal explosives, and unattended packages;  and protective measures include developing a comprehensive security  plan to prepare for and respond to food tampering and providing  appropriate signage to restrict access to nonpublic areas. The CV/PI/PM  reports discuss aspects of resiliency such as infrastructure  interdependencies and incident response, but they do not discuss other  aspects of resiliency. For example, the report on restaurants discusses  protective measures including providing security and backup for critical  utility services, such as power or water\u2013\u2013efforts that may also enhance the  resiliency of restaurants. Moving forward, as its efforts to emphasize  resiliency evolve, DHS could consider including other aspects of resiliency  in the CV/PI/PM reports."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS Is Uniquely Positioned to Disseminate Information about Resiliency Practices but Faces Barriers", "paragraphs": ["Senior IP officials told us that they have considered ways to disseminate  information that DHS currently collects or plans to collect with regard to  resiliency. However, they have not explored the feasibility of developing  an approach for doing so. Senior IP officials explained that given the  voluntary nature of the CIKR partnership, DHS should not be viewed as  identifying or promoting practices, particularly best practices, which could  be construed to be standards or requirements. They said that DHS goes to  great lengths to provide assurance to owners and operators that the  information gathered during assessments will not be provided to  regulators. They also stated that they provide owners and operators  assurance that they will not share proprietary information with  competitors. For example, certain information that they collect is  protected under the Protected Critical Infrastructure Information (PCII)  program, which institutes a means for the voluntary sharing of certain  private sector, state, and local CIKR information with the federal  government while providing assurance that the information will be exempt  from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, among other  things, and will be properly safeguarded. DHS has established a PCII  program office, which among other things, is responsible for validating  information provided by CIKR partners as PCII, and developing protocols  to access and safeguard information that is deemed PCII.", "IP senior officials further explained that DHS relies on its private-sector  partners to develop and share information on practices they use to  enhance their protection and resilience. They said that the practices  shared by sector partners, including best practices, are largely identified  and developed by the private sector, at times with the support of its  partners in government such as the SSAs. DHS facilitates this process by  making various mechanisms available for information sharing, including  information they deem to be best practices. For example, according to  senior IP officials, DHS\u2019s Homeland Security Information Network-Critical  Sectors (HSIN-CS) was designed to provide each sector a portal to post  useful or important information, such as activities or concepts that  private-sector partners discern to be best practices on protection and  resiliency topics. They also said that one factor to consider is that  resiliency can mean different things to different sectors, as measures or  strategies that are applicable or inherent to one sector may not be  applicable to another given the unique characteristics of each sector. For  example, the energy sector, which includes oil refineries, is inherently  different than the government facilities sector, which includes government  office buildings. In our March 2010 report on DHS\u2019s increased emphasis on  resilience in the NIPP, we reported that DHS officials told us that the  balance between protection and resiliency is unique to each sector and the  extent to which any one sector increases the emphasis on resiliency in its  sector-specific plans will depend on the nature of the sector and the risks  to its CIKR. Further, the Branch Chief of IP\u2019s Office of Information  Coordination and Analysis Office explained that differences in corporate  cultures across the spectrum of companies could be a barrier to widely  disseminating information on resiliency practices because it is often  challenging to translate information, such as what constitutes a success or  failure, from one company to another. He further stated that differences in  the regulatory structures affecting different industries may be a factor that  could limit the extent to which certain types of information could be  disseminated.", "We recognize that DHS faces barriers to sharing information it gathers on  resiliency practices within and among sectors. However, as the primary  federal agency responsible for coordinating and enhancing the protection  and resiliency of critical infrastructure across the spectrum of CIKR  sectors, DHS is uniquely positioned to disseminate this information which  would be consistent with the NIPP\u2019s emphasis on information sharing. By  working to explore ways to address any challenges or barriers to sharing  resiliency information, DHS could build upon the partnering and  information-sharing arrangements that CIKR owners and operators use in  their own communities. For example, our work at CIKR assets along the  Gulf Coast in Texas and in southern California showed that asset owners  and operators viewed resiliency as critical to their facilities because it is in  their best interests to either keep a facility operating during and after an  event, or rebound as quickly as possible following an event. They said that  they rely on a variety of sources for information to enhance their ability to  be more resilient if a catastrophic event occurs, including information- sharing or partnering arrangements within and among CIKR partners and  their local communities. Each of the 15 owners and operators we  contacted in Texas and California said that they have partnering  relationships with their sector coordinating councils, local/state  government, law enforcement, emergency management, or mutual aid  organizations. Furthermore, 14 of the 15 said that they work with these  organizations to share information, including best practices and lessons  learned, from recent disasters. Among the owners and operators we  contacted:    Representatives of one facility said that following a recent event, their  company shared lessons learned with the local mutual aid association  and various trade associations. These officials said that they also share  best practices within the industry and across their facilities in other  locations on an ongoing basis and that the company is currently  organizing a committee made up of security staff from each facility  within the organization whose primary responsibility is expected to be  the sharing of best practices.", "Officials representing another facility told us that following an event or  a drill, they critique the event and their response to garner any lessons  learned or best practices. They said that they share information with  the local fire department and a regional trade association. These  officials stated that they will share information with other trade  association members if they believe that it would be beneficial to  others, but will not discuss proprietary information.", "Officials representing a different facility said that, following a  hurricane in the same area, the company\u2019s managers from various  facilities met to share lessons learned and adopted best practices from  other facilities within the same company and with external partners,  including a mutual aid organization and local emergency responders.  They said that they also have learned from the experiences of others\u2014 after an explosion at a similar company\u2019s facility, they became aware  that the other company had located its administration building too  close to the company\u2019s operations, thereby jeopardizing employee  safety.", "By developing an approach for disseminating information it gathers or  intends to gather with regard to resiliency, DHS would then be in a  position to reach a broader audience across sectors or in different  geographic locations. Senior IP officials said that they agree that  disseminating information on resiliency practices broadly across the CIKR  community would be a worthwhile exercise, but questioned whether they  would be the right organization within DHS to develop an approach for  sharing resiliency information. They said that IP does not currently have  the resources to perform this function and suggested that an organization  like the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) might be more  appropriate for sharing information on resiliency because it already has  mechanisms in place to share information on practices organizations can  adopt to deal with all-hazards events, including terrorism. For example,  FEMA manages DHS\u2019s Lessons Learned Information Sharing portal, called  LLIS.gov, which is a national online network of lessons learned and best  practices designed to help emergency response providers and homeland  security officials prevent, prepare for, and respond to all hazards,  including terrorism. According to FEMA officials, LLIS.gov contains  information on critical infrastructure protection and resiliency and system  users, such as state and local government officials, are encouraged to  submit content which is then vetted and validated by subject matter  experts before being posted to the system. FEMA officials explained that  FEMA does not actively collect information from system users, but  encourages them to submit documents for review and possible inclusion  into LLIS.gov. According to FEMA, access to LLIS.gov is restricted to  members that request access to the system, particularly emergency  response providers and homeland security officials. In March 2010,  FEMA\u2019s Outreach and Partnerships Coordinator for Lessons Learned  Information Sharing told us that LLIS.gov had about 55,000 members, of  which approximately 89 percent were representatives of state and local  government; about 6 percent were representatives of private-sector  organizations; and about 5 percent were representatives of the federal  government.", "Regardless of which DHS organization would be responsible for  disseminating information on resiliency practices, we recognize that DHS  will face challenges in addressing any barriers it believes could hinder its  ability to disseminate resiliency information. As part of this effort, DHS  would have to determine what resiliency information it is collecting or  plans to collect that might be most appropriate to share and what  safeguards would be needed to protect against the disclosure of  proprietary information within the confines of the voluntary nature of the  CIKR partnership. Also, in doing so, DHS could consider some of the  following questions:    What additional actions, if any, would DHS need to take to convey that  the information is being gathered within the voluntary framework of  the CIKR partnership?", "To what extent does DHS need to take additional actions, if any, to  provide assurance that the information being disseminated is  nonregulatory and nonbinding on the owners and operators that  access it?", "What additional mechanisms, if any, does DHS need to establish to  provide assurance that reinforces the PCII process and how can  resiliency practices information be presented to avoid disclosures of  information that is PCII security sensitive or proprietary in nature?", "What mechanism or information system is most suitable for  disseminating resiliency practices information, and which DHS  component would be responsible for managing this mechanism or  system?", "What approach should DHS take to review the information before it is  disseminated to ensure that resiliency practices identified by DHS at  one facility or in one sector are valid and viable, and applicable across  facilities and sectors?", "What additional resources and at what additional cost, if any, would  DHS need to devote to gathering and broadly disseminating  information about resiliency practices across facilities and sectors?", "What actions can DHS take to measure the extent to which asset  owners and operators are using resiliency information provided by  DHS, and how can DHS use this information to make improvements, if  needed?", "By determining the feasibility of overcoming barriers and developing an  approach for disseminating resiliency information, DHS could better  position itself to help asset owners and operators consider and adopt  resiliency strategies, and provide them with information on potential  security investments, based on the practices and experiences of their  peers both within and across sectors."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["In the wake of concerns by stakeholders, including members of Congress,  academia, and the private sector that DHS was placing emphasis on  protection rather than resilience, DHS has increased its emphasis on  critical infrastructure resiliency in the NIPP.
