CMP is required to give priority to activities that benefit firearms safety, training, and competition for youth and that reach as many youth participants as possible. CMP also charges fees for individuals to participate in some of its programs.", "The Army and CMP have established procedures to address federal requirements for the transfer and sale of surplus firearms. Both organizations established procedures to carry out the transfer of surplus Army firearms as identified in a 2016 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) and a 2018 Memorandum of Agreement, both between the Army and CMP. To address requirements for selling surplus firearms, CMP uses a combination of procedures, including an application requiring prospective customers to provide proof of citizenship and age, among other things, and a check against the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. Per the MOU, the Army's Tank-automotive and Armaments Command oversees the Army's costs and reimbursements from CMP for certain costs associated with storing, transporting, and administering the transfer of surplus firearms.", "The primary source of CMP's revenues from fiscal years 2008 through 2017 was from the sale of surplus rifles, which, according to CMP's internal financial documents, generated $196.8 million in revenue. CMP also sold commercial ammunition and memorabilia, which, according to the same documents, generated $76.4 million in revenue. Further, according to its Internal Revenue Service filings for this time frame, CMP reported earning $49.8 million in interest and dividends from its investment account. CMP began selling surplus M1911 handguns in November 2018 and had just begun generating revenue from these sales at the time of GAO's review. The profit that CMP realized from the sales of surplus rifles could not be determined because CMP's methodology to calculate expenses did not account for all of CMP's costs associated with the sale of these rifles. GAO estimates future sales of CMP's surplus handgun and rifles currently available for sale could generate as much as $104.9 million, or enough to fund CMP's operations for several years. Further, as of September 30, 2017, CMP reported having cash of $3.6 million, and an investment account valued at $188.6 million. This could also allow CMP to continue operations for several years."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 1996  authorized the Corporation for the Promotion of Rifle Practice and  Firearms Safety, which operates and is commonly referred to as the  Civilian Marksmanship Program (CMP), to sell certain types of surplus  Army firearms to U.S. citizens.

In other instances, TACOM relies on the  Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) to ship the surplus firearms to CMP. If  DLA transfers the surplus firearms, the firearms are either shipped  directly to CMP or to the DLA facilities located in Anniston, Alabama,  where they are released to CMP. Under the MOU, CMP reimburses the  Army for certain costs associated with transportation, supply depot  operations, and administrative support. Both CMP and DLA officials told  us that surplus firearms located at DLA\u2019s facilities in Anniston, Alabama,  did not incur shipping cost to the Army because CMP arranges the  transfer from the DLA facilities directly to CMP\u2019s facilities also located in  Anniston, Alabama. For example, according to TACOM and CMP officials  the Army did not incur any transportation costs for transferring 8,000  surplus M1911 handguns to CMP in January 2018. According to an Army  official, this was because CMP transported 6,736 M1911 handguns from  the DLA facility, an additional 1,242 M1911 handguns from the Center of  Military History Museum Support Center, and 22 M1911 handguns from  TACOM facilities\u2014all located in Anniston, Alabama\u2014back to its own  facility in Anniston for storage.", "In addition to firearms from domestic locations, the Secretary of the Army  may also recover certain surplus firearms furnished to foreign countries  on a grant basis under the Foreign Assistance Act and transfer them to  CMP.

For example, according to CMP officials, to count and verify the  inventory of incoming shipments of surplus firearms, CMP staff open and  inspect each box of surplus firearms upon receipt of the firearms in their  facilities in Anniston, Alabama. CMP staff then inventory each firearm by  matching the unique serial number found on the receiver of each firearm  to the manifest included with the shipment. CMP then enters these firearms into its inventory using each firearm\u2019s unique serial number. After  shipping firearms to CMP, the MOU requires TACOM to update the  Army\u2019s Unique Item Tracking database for tracking the firearms, which it  does by serial number.

Once the application procedures we  described above are completed, CMP staff then enter the prospective  customer\u2019s information into the system used by the Federal Bureau of  Investigation to perform background checks. CMP intends this National  Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) to address certain  federal requirements for the sale of firearms that we identified above. For  example, the NICS background check analyzes various databases to  determine whether a prospective customer falls into any of the categories  of persons prohibited from being sold or receiving a firearm.", "The prohibitions involve sale to or receipt by a prospective customer who  is under indictment for or has been convicted in any court of a crime  punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding 1 year; is a fugitive  from justice; or has been convicted in any court of a misdemeanor crime  of domestic violence, among other things. The NICS background check  also searches databases to identify a prospective customer who has  been discharged from the U.S. Armed Forces under dishonorable  conditions, was a U.S. citizen but has since renounced his or her  citizenship, or is an unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled  substance.", "Additionally, CMP uses the NICS background check to confirm the  applicant is of the minimum age necessary to purchase either a rifle or a  handgun. Specifically, CMP uses the NICS background checks to ensure  the applicant is at least 18 in order to purchase a surplus rifle or a  minimum of 21 in order to purchase a surplus handgun. If an age is  entered into NICS that is younger than the minimum age required for  purchasing a firearm, the system will not continue performing the  background check and will notify CMP staff that the buyer is not old  enough to purchase the firearm(s).", "During our site visits to CMP\u2019s southern headquarters in Anniston,  Alabama in August 2018 and November 2018 we observed CMP  employees performing the NICS background checks for 10 of 11  transactions, and we observed that the employees were unable to  proceed with the background check without certain required information.  Specifically, CMP employees demonstrated the result of a change to the  birthdate while processing the sale of a surplus M1911 handgun so that  the customer would be under 21 years of age.

Our review of the  procedures associated with the reimbursement account included  obtaining cash collection vouchers submitted to the Army by CMP and  TACOM briefings presented at CMP\u2019s biannual Board of Director\u2019s  meetings. Further, we interviewed TACOM and Defense Logistics Agency  (DLA) officials to gain an understanding of how reimbursable costs are identified and requested from CMP.

We used CMP\u2019s IRS filings to provide information on revenue  generated from overall sales, investments, and programs, as well as on  the growth of CMP\u2019s investment account. We relied on the internal  financial documents for a more granular account of the revenue CMP  generated specifically from the sale of surplus rifles as well as  commercially purchased ammunition and memorabilia.

Specifically, to determine the range of potential revenue for the  sale of surplus handguns, we asked CMP to provide information on the  sales prices for each of the three grades of preordered M1911 handguns.  CMP reported that it had sold 632 surplus M1911 handguns as of  December 13, 2018 and further that it had identified another 145 surplus  handguns as unsellable. To determine the number of surplus handguns  remaining to be sold, we subtracted both the 632 surplus handguns CMP  reported as sold and the 145 surplus handguns CMP had determined to  be unsellable from the total of 8,000 surplus M1911 handguns the Army  originally transferred to CMP. To calculate the range of potential revenue  from the remaining 7,223 surplus M1911 handguns, we then multiplied  the 7,223 remaining surplus handguns by the lowest and the highest  sales prices, $850 and $1,050 respectively. This gave us a range of  revenue from the future sales of from $6.14 million to $7.58 million. We  then added the known $663,600 in revenue from the sale of the 632  service grade handguns CMP identified to our low and high end  calculations to determine the range of future revenue of from $6.8 million  to $8.2 million from the sale of surplus M1911 handguns.", "To determine potential future revenue associated with the sale of surplus  rifles, we reviewed inventory and sales data provided by CMP and used  this information to estimate potential future revenue based on the average  price of the surplus rifles CMP has sold from fiscal years 2008 through  2017.
