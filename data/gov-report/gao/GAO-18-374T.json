These challenges contribute to GAO's continuing inclusion of DOE's and NNSA's management of major contracts and projects on the list of agencies and program areas that are at high risk of fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement, or are in need of transformation.

In April 2017, GAO found a misalignment between NNSA's modernization plans and the estimated budgetary resources needed to carry out those plans. Specifically, GAO found that NNSA's estimates of funding needed for its modernization plans sometimes exceeded the budgetary projections included in the President's planned near-term and long-term modernization budgets by billions of dollars. GAO also found that the costs of some major modernization programs\u2014such as for nuclear weapon refurbishments\u2014may also increase and further strain future modernization budgets. GAO recommended in April 2017 that NNSA include an assessment of the affordability of its modernization programs in future versions of its annual plan on stockpile stewardship; NNSA neither agreed nor disagreed with that recommendation.", "DOE also faces challenges with addressing its environmental liabilities\u2014the total cost of its cleanup responsibilities. In February 2017, GAO found that DOE was responsible for over 80 percent ($372 billion) of the U.S. government's estimated $450 billion environmental liability. However, this estimate does not reflect all of DOE's cleanup responsibilities. Notably, this estimate does not reflect all of the future cleanup responsibilities that DOE may face. For example, in January 2017, GAO found that the cost estimate for DOE's proposal for separate defense and commercial nuclear waste repositories excluded the costs and time frames for site selection and site characterization, and therefore full costs are likely to be billions of dollars more than DOE's reported environmental liabilities. To effectively address cleanup, GAO has made at least 28 recommendations to DOE and other federal agencies, which could reduce long-term costs as well as environmental risks more quickly. Of these, 13 remain not implemented.", "DOE has taken several important steps that demonstrate its commitment to improving contract and project management, but challenges persist. Specifically, DOE's revised project management order, issued in May 2016, made several changes in response to recommendations GAO made in prior years, such as requiring that projects develop cost estimates and analyses of alternatives according to our best practices. However, DOE's recent efforts do not address several areas, such as acquisition planning for major contracts and aspects of program and project management, where the department continues to struggle. GAO has made several recommendations related to these areas, and DOE has generally agreed with and begun to take action on most of them.", "Finally, NNSA faces challenges in implementing its nonproliferation programs. For example, in September 2017, GAO found that selected programs in NNSA's Office of Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation (DNN) did not measure performance against schedule and cost baselines, as recommended by program management leading practices because DNN's program management policy did not require programs to measure performance in this way. GAO recommended that DNN revise its policy to require programs to measure performance against cost and schedule baselines. NNSA indicated it plans to take action to revise its policy."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO has previously suggested that Congress consider changes to the laws governing environmental cleanup activities.

NNSA is responsible for managing  the nation\u2019s three nuclear security missions: ensuring a safe, secure, and  reliable nuclear deterrent; achieving designated reductions in the nuclear  weapons stockpile; and supporting the nation\u2019s nuclear nonproliferation  efforts. In support of these missions, NNSA\u2019s February 2016 budget  justification for the Weapons Activities appropriations account included  about $49.4 billion for fiscal years 2017 through 2021 to implement its  weapons modernization plans. More recently, in November 2017, NNSA  issued its Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan, which included  about $10.2 billion for weapons activities for fiscal year 2018.", "In support of its missions, NNSA implements a range of nonproliferation  programs under its Office of Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation. These  programs include efforts to secure, consolidate, and dispose of weapons- usable nuclear materials and radiological sources; reduce the risks of  nuclear smuggling; enhance international export controls and  International Atomic Energy Agency nuclear safeguards; and support  research and development of new nonproliferation technologies.", "EM is responsible for decontaminating and decommissioning nuclear  facilities and sites that are contaminated from decades of nuclear  weapons production and nuclear energy research. In February 2017, we  reported that, since its inception in 1989, EM has spent over $164 billion  on cleanup efforts, which include retrieving, treating, and disposing of  nuclear waste.", "Both NNSA and EM face critical challenges in fulfilling their missions.  Since the end of the Cold War, key portions of the nuclear security  enterprise\u2019s weapons production infrastructure have become outdated,  prompting congressional and executive branch decision makers to call on  DOE to develop plans to modernize this infrastructure. The Department  of Defense\u2019s (DOD) 2010 Nuclear Posture Review identified long-term  modernization goals and requirements, including sustaining a safe,  secure, and effective nuclear arsenal through increasing investments to  rebuild and modernize the nation\u2019s nuclear infrastructure, some of which  dates back to the 1940s. In January 2017, the President directed the  Secretary of Defense to initiate a new Nuclear Posture Review to ensure  that the U.S. nuclear deterrent is modern, robust, flexible, resilient, ready,  and appropriately tailored to deter 21st-century threats and reassure our  allies. This review was released in February 2018.", "As NNSA works to modernize the nuclear security enterprise, EM must  address the legacy of 70 years of nuclear weapons production and  energy research by DOE and its predecessor agencies. These activities  generated large amounts of radioactive waste, spent nuclear fuel, excess  plutonium and uranium, and contaminated soil and groundwater. They  also contaminated thousands of sites and facilities, including land,  buildings, and other structures and their systems and equipment. Various  federal laws, agreements with states, and court decisions require the  federal government to clean up environmental hazards at federal sites  and facilities, such as nuclear weapons production facilities. DOE\u2019s  approach to addressing these environmental liabilities is often influenced  by numerous site-specific factors, stakeholder agreements, and legal  provisions. For years, we and others have reported on shortcomings in  DOE\u2019s approach to addressing its environmental liabilities, including  incomplete data on the extent of cleanup needed.", "DOE relies primarily on contractors to carry out its programs, and it is the  largest civilian contracting agency in the federal government. In fiscal  year 2017, it spent approximately 90 percent of its $32 billion in annual  funding on contracts and major capital asset projects. We designated  DOE\u2019s contract management\u2014which has included both contract  administration and project management\u2014as a high-risk area in 1990  because DOE\u2019s record of inadequate management and oversight of  contractors had left it vulnerable to fraud, waste, abuse, and  mismanagement. In our 2017 high-risk update, we reported that NNSA  and EM continued to demonstrate a strong commitment and top  leadership support to improve contract and project management\u2014a key  criterion for removing agencies and program areas from our High-Risk  List.

More than 80 percent of  these liabilities are DOE\u2019s responsibility.

In that report, we identified two areas of misalignment  between NNSA\u2019s modernization plans and the estimated budgetary  resources needed to carry out those plans, which could result in  challenges to NNSA in affording its planned portfolio of modernization  programs. First, we found that NNSA\u2019s estimates of funding needed for its  modernization plans sometimes exceeded the budgetary projections  included in the President\u2019s planned near- and long-term modernization  budgets. In the near-term (fiscal years 2018 through 2021), we found that  NNSA may have to defer certain modernization work beyond that time  period to execute its program within the planned budget, which could  increase modernization costs and schedule risks.

Second, the costs of some major  modernization programs\u2014such as for nuclear weapon refurbishments\u2014 may also increase and further strain future modernization budgets.

As we reported in April 2017, this is caused by a misalignment  between NNSA\u2019s budget estimates for certain nuclear modernization  programs and the President\u2019s budgets for that period. We concluded  that this deferral could exacerbate a significant bow wave of  modernization funding needs that NNSA projects for the out-years  beyond the FYNSP and could potentially increase modernization costs  and schedule risks.", "As we have previously reported, such bow waves occur when agencies  defer costs of their programs to the future, beyond their programming  periods, and they often occur when agencies are undertaking more  programs than their resources can support. As NNSA\u2019s fiscal year 2017  budget materials show, its modernization budget estimates for fiscal  years 2022 through 2026\u2014the first 5 years beyond the FYNSP\u2014may  require significant funding increases. For example, in fiscal year 2022,  NNSA\u2019s estimates of its modernization budget needs are projected to rise  about 7 percent compared with the budget estimates for fiscal year 2021,  the last year of the FYNSP, as shown in figure 1.", "The analysis in our April 2017 report showed that NNSA has shifted this  modernization bow wave to the period beyond the FYNSP time frame in  each of the past four versions of the annual Stockpile Stewardship and  Management Plan. For example, in the Fiscal Year 2014 Stockpile  Stewardship and Management Plan, NNSA\u2019s budget estimates for its  modernization programs increased from a total of about $9.3 billion in  fiscal year 2018, the last year of the FYNSP, to about $10.5 billion in  fiscal year 2019, the first year after the FYNSP\u2014an increase of about 13  percent. Similar patterns showing a jump in funding needs immediately  after the last year of the FYNSP are repeated in the funding profiles  contained in the fiscal year 2015, 2016, and 2017 plans. As we have  previously reported, deferring more work to future years can increase cost  and schedule risks and can put programs in the position of potentially  facing a backlog of deferred work that grows beyond what can be  accommodated in future years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Long-term Misalignment between Modernization Plans and Estimated Budgetary Resources", "paragraphs": ["The Fiscal Year 2017 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan  shows that NNSA\u2019s overall modernization budget estimates for fiscal  years 2022 through 2026\u2014the out-years beyond the FYNSP\u2014may  exceed the projected funding levels in the President\u2019s budgets for that  period, raising further questions about the affordability of NNSA\u2019s nuclear  modernization plans. According to NNSA\u2019s data, the agency\u2019s estimated  budget needed to support modernization totals about $58.4 billion for  fiscal years 2022 through 2026, and the out-year funding projections  contained in the President\u2019s fiscal year 2017 budget for the same period  total about $55.5 billion. The President\u2019s out-year funding projections,  therefore, are approximately $2.9 billion, or about 5.2 percent, less than  NNSA estimates it will need over the same period.", "Despite this potential shortfall, NNSA\u2019s Fiscal Year 2017 Stockpile  Stewardship and Management Plan concludes that the modernization  program is generally affordable in the years beyond the FYNSP for two  reasons. First, the President\u2019s out-year funding projections are sufficient  to support NNSA\u2019s low-range cost estimates for its modernization  programs for fiscal years 2022 through 2026. Based on NNSA data, the  low-range cost estimates for fiscal years 2022 through 2026 total  approximately $54.4 billion and the President\u2019s out-year funding  projections total about $55.5 billion. Figure 2 illustrates data from the  2017 plan showing NNSA\u2019s budget estimates in nominal dollars, including  high- and low-range cost estimates for its modernization program, along  with the out-year funding projections from the President\u2019s fiscal year 2017  budget, for fiscal years 2022 to 2026. Second, NNSA concludes that its  modernization programs are generally affordable beyond the FYNSP  because the agency\u2019s estimated modernization budget needs will begin to  decrease in fiscal year 2027.", "In our April 2017 report, we noted that NNSA\u2019s conclusion\u2014that its  modernization program is affordable because the President\u2019s out-year  funding projections fall within NNSA\u2019s modernization cost ranges\u2014is  overly optimistic. This is because the conclusion is predicated on  optimistic assumptions regarding the cost of the modernization program  beyond the FYNSP, particularly for fiscal years 2022 through 2026. For  the program to be affordable, NNSA\u2019s modernization programs would  need to be collectively executed at the low end of their estimated cost  ranges. The plan does not discuss any options NNSA would pursue to  support or modify its modernization program if costs exceeded its low- range cost estimates. In addition, the Fiscal Year 2017 Stockpile  Stewardship and Management Plan states that the nominal cost of  NNSA\u2019s modernization program is expected to decrease by  approximately $1 billion in fiscal year 2027. In that year, according to the  2017 plan, it is anticipated that NNSA\u2019s estimated budgets for its  modernization program will begin to fall in line with projections of future  presidential budgets. However, as we noted in our April 2017 report, the  decrease that NNSA anticipates in its modernization funding needs  beginning in fiscal year 2027 may not be achievable if the projected  mismatch between NNSA\u2019s estimates of its modernization budget needs  and the projections of the President\u2019s modernization budget for fiscal  years 2022 through 2026 is not resolved. This mismatch creates  concerns that NNSA will not be able to afford planned modernization  costs during fiscal years 2022 through 2026 and will be forced to defer  them to fiscal year 2027 and beyond, continuing the bow wave patterns  discussed above."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Potential Rising Costs of Some Modernization Programs May Further Strain NNSA\u2019s Modernization Budgets", "paragraphs": ["Our April 2017 report identified misalignment between NNSA\u2019s estimate  of its budget needs and NNSA\u2019s internal cost range estimates for several  of its major modernization programs.

However, for some years, NNSA\u2019s low- range cost estimates exceeded the budget estimates for some of the  programs, suggesting the potential for a funding shortfall for those  programs in those years. Specifically, we found that the low-range cost  estimates for the W88 Alteration 370 program and all LEPs discussed in  our April 2017 report exceeded their budget estimates for some fiscal  years within the 10-year time period from fiscal year 2017 to 2026. As  we reported in 2013 and 2016, this misalignment indicates that NNSA\u2019s  estimated budgets may not be sufficient to fully execute program plans  and that NNSA may need to increase funding for these programs in the  future.", "Additionally, in April 2017 we found that the costs of two ongoing nuclear  weapon LEPs and the W88 Alteration 370 program may increase in the  future, based on NNSA information that was produced after the release of  the fiscal year 2017 budget materials. These potential cost increases  could further challenge the extent to which NNSA\u2019s budget estimates  support the scope of modernization efforts. The LEPs facing potential  cost increases include:", "B61-12 LEP.

Notably, this estimate does  not reflect all of the future cleanup responsibilities that DOE may face.  In addition, DOE has not consistently taken a risk-informed approach to  decision-making for environmental cleanup, and DOE may therefore be  missing opportunities to reduce costs while also reducing environmental  risks more quickly. Our recent work in this area has also identified  opportunities where DOE may be able to save tens of billions of dollars.", "As we have previously reported, DOE\u2019s total reported environmental  liability has generally increased over time. Since 1989, EM has spent over  $164 billion to retrieve, treat, and dispose of nuclear and hazardous  waste and, as of 2017, it had completed cleanup at 91 of 107 sites across  the country (the 91 sites were generally viewed by DOE as the smallest  and least contaminated sites to address). Despite billions spent on  environmental cleanup, DOE\u2019s environmental liability has roughly doubled  from $176 billion in fiscal year 1997 to the fiscal year 2016 estimate of  $372 billion. Between 2011 and 2016, EM spent $35 billion, primarily to  treat and dispose of nuclear and hazardous waste and construct capital  asset projects to treat the waste (see fig. 3 for EM\u2019s annual spending and  growing environmental liability). According to documents related to DOE\u2019s fiscal year 2016 financial statements, half of DOE\u2019s environmental liability  resides at two cleanup sites: the Hanford Site in Washington State and  the Savannah River Site in South Carolina.", "In its fiscal year 2016 financial statement, DOE attributed recent  environmental liability increases to (1) inflation adjustments for the current  year; (2) improved and updated estimates for the same scope of work,  including changes resulting from deferral or acceleration of work; (3)  revisions in technical approach or scope for cleanup activities; and (4)  regulatory and legal changes. Notably, in recent annual financial reports,  DOE has cited other significant causes for increases in its liability. Other  causes have included the lack of a disposal path for high-level radioactive  waste\u2014because of the termination of the Yucca Mountain repository  program\u2014and delays and scope changes for major construction projects  at the Hanford and Savannah River sites.", "We also reported in February 2017 that DOE\u2019s estimated liability does not  include billions in expected costs. According to federal accounting  standards, environmental liability estimates should include costs that are  probable and reasonably estimable, meaning that costs that cannot yet  be reasonably estimated should not be included in total environmental  liability. Examples of costs that DOE cannot yet estimate include the  following:", "DOE has not yet developed a cleanup plan or cost estimate for the  Nevada National Security Site and, as a result, the cost of future  cleanup of this site was not included in DOE\u2019s fiscal year 2015  reported environmental liability. The nearly 1,400-square-mile site has  been used for hundreds of nuclear weapons tests since 1951. These  activities have resulted in more than 45 million cubic feet of  radioactive waste at the site. According to DOE\u2019s financial statement,  since DOE is not yet required to establish a plan to clean up the site,  the costs for this work are excluded from DOE\u2019s annually reported  environmental liability.", "DOE\u2019s reported environmental liability includes an estimate for the  cost of a permanent nuclear waste repository, but these estimates are  highly uncertain and likely to increase. In March 2015, in response to  the termination of the Yucca Mountain repository program, DOE  proposed separate repositories for defense high-level and commercial  waste. In January 2017, we reported that the cost estimate for DOE\u2019s  new approach excluded the costs and time frames for site selection  and site characterization. As a result, the full cost of these activities  is likely billions of dollars more than what is reflected in DOE\u2019s  environmental liability. In our annual report on Fragmentation,  Overlap, and Duplication in the federal government that we issued in  May 2017, we reported that DOE may be able to save billions of  dollars by reassessing the rationale for its March 2015 proposal. In  June 2017, a bill that could result in renewed efforts to open the  Yucca Mountain repository was introduced in the House of  Representatives.", "In addition, according to the DOE Inspector General, DOE may have  insufficient controls in place to accurately account for its environmental  liabilities. In November 2016, the DOE Inspector General reported a  significant deficiency in internal controls related to the reconciliation of  environmental liabilities.", "Moreover, DOE does not consistently take a risk-informed decision- making approach to its environmental cleanup mission to more efficiently  use resources. As our reports and those by other organizations issued  over the last 2 decades have found, DOE\u2019s environmental cleanup  decisions have not been risk-based, and there have been inconsistencies  in the regulatory approaches followed at different sites. We and others  have pointed out that DOE needs to take a nation-wide, risk-based  approach to cleaning up these sites, which could reduce costs while also  reducing environmental risks more quickly.", "In 2006, the National Research Council reported that the nation\u2019s  approach to cleaning up nuclear waste\u2014primarily carried out by  DOE\u2014was complex, inconsistent, and not systematically risk- based. For example, the National Research Council noted that the  current regulatory structure for low-activity waste is based primarily on  the waste\u2019s origins rather than on its actual radiological risks. The  National Research Council concluded that by working with regulators,  public authorities, and local citizens to implement risk-informed  practices, waste cleanup efforts can be done more cost-effectively.  The report also suggested that statutory changes were likely needed.", "In 2015, a review organized by the Consortium for Risk Evaluation  with Stakeholder Participation reported that DOE was not optimally  using available resources to reduce risk. According to the report,  factors such as inconsistent regulatory approaches and certain  requirements in federal facility agreements caused disproportionate  resources to be directed at lower-priority risks. The report called for a  more systematic effort to assess and rank risks within and among  sites, including through headquarters guidance to sites, and to  allocate federal taxpayer monies to remedy the highest priority risks  through the most efficient means.", "In May 2017, we reported on DOE\u2019s efforts to treat a significant  portion of the waste in underground tanks at the Hanford Site. We  found that DOE chose different approaches to treat the less  radioactive portion of its tank waste\u2014which DOE refers to as \u201clow- activity waste\u201d (LAW)\u2014at the Hanford and Savannah River Sites. At  the Savannah River Site, DOE has grouted about 4 million gallons of  LAW since 2007. DOE plans to treat a portion of the Hanford Site\u2019s  LAW with vitrification, but it has not yet treated any of Hanford\u2019s LAW  and faces significant unresolved technical challenges in doing so. In  addition, we found that the best available information indicates that  DOE\u2019s estimated costs to grout LAW at the Savannah River Site are  substantially lower than its estimated costs to vitrify LAW at Hanford,  and DOE may be able to save tens of billions of dollars by  reconsidering its waste treatment approach for a portion of the LAW at  Hanford. Moreover, according to experts that attended a meeting we  convened with the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and  Medicine, both vitrification and grout could effectively treat Hanford\u2019s  LAW. Experts at our meeting also stated that developing updated  information on the effectiveness of treating a portion of Hanford\u2019s  waste, called supplemental LAW, with other methods, such as grout,  may enable DOE to consider waste treatment approaches that would  accelerate DOE\u2019s tank waste treatment mission, thereby potentially  reducing certain risks and lifecycle treatment costs. We recommended  that DOE (1) develop updated information on the performance of  treating supplemental LAW with alternate methods, such as grout,  before it selects an approach for treating supplemental LAW; and (2)  have an independent entity develop updated information on the  lifecycle costs of treating Hanford\u2019s supplemental LAW with alternate  methods. DOE agreed with both recommendations.", "Since 1994, we have made at least 28 recommendations related to  addressing the federal government\u2019s environmental liability to DOE and  others and 4 suggestions to Congress to consider changes to the laws  governing cleanup activities. Of these, 13 recommendations remain  unimplemented. If implemented, these steps would improve the  completeness and reliability of the estimated costs of future federal  cleanup responsibilities and lead to more risk-based management of the  cleanup work.

The Secretary of Energy issued two memorandums, in December 2014 and June 2015, that lay out a series of  changes to policies and procedures to improve project management.  These changes were included in DOE\u2019s revised project management  order, DOE Order 413.3B, issued in May 2016. As noted in the  memorandums, some of these changes are in response to  recommendations we made in prior years, such as requiring that projects  develop cost estimates and analyses of alternatives according to our best  practices.", "DOE also made significant efforts to improve its performance in  monitoring and independently validating the effectiveness and  sustainability of corrective measures and now partially meets our  monitoring criterion for removing agencies and program areas from our  High-Risk List. For example, the Secretary improved the department\u2019s  senior-level monitoring capability. The Secretary strengthened the Energy  Systems Acquisition Advisory Board by changing it from an ad hoc body  to an institutionalized board responsible for reviewing all capital asset  projects with a total project cost of $100 million or more. The Secretary  also created the Project Management Risk Committee, which includes  senior DOE officials and is chaired by a new departmental position\u2014the  Chief Risk Officer.

The size and duration  of DOE\u2019s management and operating (M&O) contracts\u201422 M&O  contracts with an average potential duration of 17 years, representing  almost three-quarters of DOE\u2019s spending in fiscal year 2015\u2014underscore  the importance of planning for every M&O acquisition. In August 2016, we  examined DOE\u2019s use of M&O contracts. According to DOE officials we  interviewed at that time, one of the primary reasons DOE uses M&O  contracts is because they are easier to manage with fewer DOE  personnel because they are less frequently competed and have broadly  written scopes of work, among other attributes. We found that DOE did  not consider acquisition alternatives beyond continuing its long-standing  M&O contract approach for 16 of its 22 M&O contracts. We concluded  that without considering broader alternatives in the acquisition planning  phase, DOE cannot ensure that it is selecting the most effective scope  and form of contract, raising risks for both contract cost and performance.  We recommended in our August 2016 report that DOE establish a  process to analyze and apply its experience with contracting alternatives.  DOE generally concurred with our recommendation, and, in November  2016, issued updated guidance requiring acquisition planning documents  to contain a thorough discussion of alternatives beyond simply extending  or competing M&O contracts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Quality of Enterprise-Wide Cost Information", "paragraphs": ["We have previously reported that the effectiveness of DOE\u2019s monitoring  of its contracts, projects, and programs depends upon the availability of  reliable enterprise-wide cost information on which to base oversight  activities. For example, reliable enterprise-wide cost information is  needed to identify the cost of activities, ensure the validity of cost  estimates, and provide information to Congress to make budgetary  decisions. However, we have found that meaningful cost analyses across  programs, contractors, and sites are not usually possible because  NNSA\u2019s contractors use different methods of accounting for and tracking  costs. NNSA developed a plan to improve and integrate its cost reporting  structures; however, we found in January 2017 that this plan did not  provide a useful road map for guiding NNSA\u2019s effort. For example, we  found that NNSA did not define strategies and identify resources needed  to achieve its goals, which is a leading practice for strategic planning.  NNSA\u2019s plan contained few details on the elements it must include, such  as its feasibility assessment, estimated costs, expected results, and an  implementation timeline. We concluded that, until a plan is in place that  incorporates leading strategic planning practices, NNSA cannot be  assured that its efforts will result in a cost collection tool that produces  reliable enterprise-wide cost information that satisfies the information  needs of Congress and program managers. We recommended that  NNSA develop a plan for producing cost information that fully  incorporates leading planning practices. NNSA agreed with our  recommendation.", "In addition, as we have previously noted, quality data are needed for DOE  to manage its risk of fraud. The Fraud Reduction and Data Analytics Act  of 2015 establishes requirements aimed at improving federal agencies\u2019  controls and procedures for assessing and mitigating fraud risks through  the use of data analytics. In a March 2017 report, however, we found  that because DOE does not require its contractors to maintain sufficiently  detailed transaction-level cost data that are reconcilable with amounts  charged to DOE, it is not well positioned to employ data analytics as a  fraud detection tool. We found that the data were not suitable either  because they were not for a complete universe of transactions that was  reconcilable with amounts billed to DOE or because they were not  sufficiently detailed to determine the nature of costs charged to DOE. We  concluded that, without requiring contractors to maintain such data, DOE  will not be well positioned to meet the requirements of the Fraud  Reduction and Data Analytics Act of 2015 and manage its risk of fraud  and other improper payments. We recommended that DOE require contractors to maintain sufficiently detailed transaction-level cost data that  are reconcilable with amounts charged to the government.", "DOE did not concur with our recommendation. This is because, according  to DOE, the recommendation establishes agency-specific requirements  for DOE contractors that are more prescriptive than current federal  requirements and that its M&O contractors, not DOE, are responsible for  performing data analytics and determining what data are needed to do so.  DOE\u2019s response to our recommendation is concerning because it  demonstrates that DOE does not fully appreciate its responsibility for  overseeing contractor costs. We believe that the use of data-analytic  techniques by DOE employees could help mitigate some of the  challenges that limit the effectiveness of DOE\u2019s approach for overseeing  M&O contractor costs. However, effectively applying data-analytics  depends on the availability of complete and sufficiently detailed contractor  data. Therefore, by implementing our recommendation DOE could take  the important steps necessary to require contractors maintain sufficiently  detailed transaction-level cost data that are reconcilable with amounts  charged to the government."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Program and Project Management", "paragraphs": ["Although, as mentioned previously, DOE has taken some steps to  improve program and project management, our recent work has shown  that DOE continues to face several challenges in these areas. Specifically  on program management:  In November 2017, we found that NNSA had established program  management requirements, such as developing cost and schedule  estimates for its uranium, plutonium, tritium, and lithium programs and  had established managers\u2019 roles and responsibilities for these  programs. However, officials told us that the programs had not fully  met these requirements primarily because of staff shortages. We  recommended that NNSA determine the critical staff skills it will need  for these programs and use that information to address staffing  shortages. NNSA agreed with our recommendation.", "In a September 2017 report on the NNSA\u2019s uranium program, we  found that NNSA had not developed a complete scope of work, a life- cycle cost estimate, or an integrated master schedule for the overall  uranium program\u2014all of which are considered leading practices\u2014and  it had no time frame for doing so. We reported that NNSA plans to  do so for the specific Uranium Processing Facility project, as  required by DOE\u2019s project management order. However, NNSA had  not developed a complete scope of work for key program  requirements, including important and potentially costly repairs and  upgrades to existing buildings in which NNSA intends to house some  uranium processing capabilities. We concluded that because NNSA  had not developed a complete scope of work for the overall uranium  program, it did not have the basis to develop a life-cycle cost estimate  or an integrated master schedule for the entire uranium program,  which runs counter to best practices identified in GAO\u2019s cost  estimating and scheduling guides. We recommended that NNSA set a  time frame for completing the scope of work, life-cycle cost estimate,  and integrated master schedule for the overall uranium program.  NNSA generally agreed with this recommendation and has ongoing  efforts to complete these actions.", "In September 2017, we found that DOE\u2019s program to re-establish the  production of a plutonium isotope used to provide electrical power for  the National Aeronautics and Space Administration missions had  made progress but that it faced a number of technical and  organizational challenges to meeting production goals. Specifically,  we found that NNSA had not developed an implementation plan that  identifies milestones and interim steps that can be used to  demonstrate progress in meeting production goals. Our prior work has  shown that plans that include milestones and interim steps help an  agency to set priorities, use resources efficiently, and monitor  progress in achieving agency goals. In our September 2017 report,  we made three recommendations, including that DOE develop such a  plan for its plutonium isotope production approach and that DOE  assess the long-term effects of known production challenges and  communicate these effects to the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration. DOE concurred with our recommendations.", "Our prior work also demonstrates that DOE continues to face project  management challenges in terms of having reliable performance data or  conducting reliable analyses of alternatives. Specifically,  In a January 2018 report, we found management challenges  associated with NNSA\u2019s life extension programs (LEP). For  example, we found that NNSA had begun implementing requirements  for using earned value management (EVM) \u2014a tool used across  industry and government for conducting cost and schedule  performance analysis\u2014in three LEPs, but it had not adopted a key  best practice that could help the agency better manage risk for LEPs.  Specifically, we found that NNSA does not require an independent  team to validate the EVM systems used by NNSA\u2019s contractors for  LEPs against the national EVM standard. We concluded that without  requiring validation of EVM systems, NNSA may not have assurance  that its LEPs are obtaining reliable EVM data for managing their  programs and reporting their status. We recommended that NNSA  require an independent team to validate contractor EVM systems  used for LEPs. NNSA agreed with our recommendation but stated  that it already relies on a DOE project management office to  independently validate contractor EVM systems. However, as we  reported, DOE has not independently validated contractor EVM  systems at six of the seven contractor sites that are responsible for  conducting LEP activities.", "In May 2015, we reported that DOE initiated a new project, the Low  Activity Waste Pretreatment System project, to accelerate waste  treatment at Hanford. We found that this project was selected on the  basis of similar past proposals without consideration of other  potentially viable alternatives, contrary to requirements in DOE\u2019s  project management order. We also reported that DOE\u2019s cost and  schedule estimates for completion of the project were not conducted  according to best practices and were therefore not reliable. We  recommended that DOE re-evaluate alternatives and that it revise the  cost and schedule estimates in line with best practices. DOE generally  agreed with our recommendations but not some of the conclusions. In  September 2017, amid concerns about project cost growth and  schedule delays, DOE directed the contractor to conduct a new  analysis of alternatives to identify options that will allow the project to  be completed within current cost and schedule estimates. The  department has suspended work on the project pending a decision on  its design.", "We will continue to monitor EM\u2019s management and oversight of its  operations activities and DOE\u2019s risk-informed cleanup decisions to  address environmental liabilities, as part of our ongoing work for this  subcommittee."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Major Legacy Projects", "paragraphs": ["As previously mentioned, in response to a 2015 memorandum on project  management policies from the Secretary of Energy, DOE instituted  project management reforms that\u2014if fully implemented\u2014will help ensure  that future projects are not affected by the challenges that have persisted  for DOE\u2019s major legacy projects. Although DOE has taken action on  certain major projects, we found that it has not consistently applied these  reforms, and in particular, DOE has not applied such reforms to its largest  legacy cleanup project at its Hanford Site in Washington state. As we  found in a May 2015 report, DOE continues to allow construction of  certain Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP) facilities at  DOE\u2019s Hanford Site before designs are 90 percent complete. This  contrasts with DOE\u2019s revised project management order that now  requires a facility\u2019s design to be at least 90 percent complete before  establishing cost and schedule baselines and cost and schedule  estimates that meet industry best practices. The WTP is DOE\u2019s largest  project, and it has faced numerous technical and management challenges  that have added decades to its schedule and billions of dollars to its cost.  We recommended in May 2015 that DOE (1) consider whether to limit  construction on the WTP until risk mitigation strategies are developed to  address known technical challenges, and (2) determine the extent to  which the quality problems exist, in accordance with its quality assurance  policy, for the facilities\u2019 systems that have not been reviewed to determine  if additional vulnerabilities exist. However, as of September 2016, DOE  had not yet implemented our recommendations. In December 2016, DOE  announced that the cost estimate for one portion of the WTP\u2014the part  needed to treat a fraction of the low-activity waste\u2014had increased to  nearly $17 billion.

In recently completed reviews of  DNN programs, we have identified several challenges NNSA faces in how  it measures performance and conducts program management of these  efforts. Specifically,  In September 2017, we found that four DNN programs did not have  schedule and cost estimates covering their planned life cycles and did  not measure performance against schedule and cost baselines as is  recommended by program management leading practices. NNSA  officials explained that in general this is due in part to high levels of  uncertainty in planning the selected programs\u2019 work scope or  schedules, particularly in working with partner countries; however, we  noted that uncertainty should not prevent these programs from  establishing more complete or longer-term estimates to account for  the time and resources they need to achieve their goals and track  their performance. In addition, we observed that DOE\u2019s cost  estimating guide, which applies to NNSA programs, describes  approaches for programs to incorporate risk and uncertainty in  estimates. But we found that DNN\u2019s program management policy,  which was updated in February 2017, did not outline requirements for  programs to establish life-cycle estimates or measure performance  against schedule and cost baselines. We recommended that DNN  revise its program management policy to require DNN programs to  follow life-cycle program management, such as requiring life-cycle  estimates and measuring against baselines. Updating the DNN policy  to include requirements and guidance on cost estimating and tracking  performance against schedule and cost baselines could help ensure  that NNSA managers and Congress have better information on (1)  how much DNN programs may cost, (2) the time they may need to  achieve their goals, and (3) how effectively they are being executed  compared to plans. Although NNSA neither agreed nor disagreed with  the recommendation, it indicated that it plans to take action to revise  its policy to address the recommendation.", "In February 2017, we found that NNSA was unable to demonstrate  the full results of its research and development technology for  preventing nuclear proliferation. Specifically, we reported that DNN\u2019s  Research and Development program did not consistently track and  document projects that result in technologies being transitioned or  deployed. Furthermore, we found that DNN\u2019s Research and  Development project performance was difficult to interpret because  the program\u2019s performance measures did not define criteria or provide  context justifying how the program determined that it met its targets.  We concluded that this, in turn, could hinder users\u2019 ability to determine  the program\u2019s progress. NNSA officials said that final project reports  did not document their assessment of performance against baseline  targets and that there was no common template for final project  reports. We noted that documenting assessments that compare final  project performance results against baseline targets for scope of work  and completion date could enhance NNSA\u2019s ability to manage its  programs in accordance with these standards. We also concluded  that more consistently tracking and documenting the transitioned and  deployed technologies that result from DNN\u2019s projects could also  facilitate knowledge sharing within DNN. This would also provide a  means by which to present valuable information to Congress and  other decision makers about the programs\u2019 results and overall value.  We recommended that NNSA consistently track and document results  of DNN Research and Development projects and document  assessments of final project results against baseline performance  targets. NNSA agreed to take actions in response to both  recommendations.", "In June 2016, we found that the Nuclear Smuggling Detection and  Deterrence (NSDD) program had developed a program plan but that  the plan did not include measurable goals and performance measures  aligned to the goals. As a result, we concluded that the NSDD  program may not be able to determine when it has fully accomplished  its mission and risked continuing to deploy equipment past the point of  diminishing returns. We recommended that NSDD develop a more  detailed pr ogram plan that articulates when and how it will achieve its  goals, including completing key activities, such as the deployment of  radiation detection equipment to partner countries.
