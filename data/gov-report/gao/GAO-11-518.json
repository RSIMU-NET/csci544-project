In 2005, the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act-A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) reauthorized this program and made changes, such as allocating funds by formula to subrecipients in three areas--large urban, small urban, and rural--through designated recipients (usually transit agencies and states). SAFETEA-LU required GAO to periodically review JARC. This third report under the mandate examines (1) the progress FTA and recipients have made in reducing the instances and amounts of funds they allowed to lapse without using them; (2) the challenges recipients have faced in implementing JARC; and (3) the tradeoffs, according to stakeholders, of proposals to revise JARC during the next surface reauthorization process. For this work, GAO reviewed FTA grant data; interviewed officials from FTA, 9 designated recipients, 10 subrecipients, and industry associations; and reviewed recent proposals to revise JARC. GAO is not making recommendations in this report. DOT officials reviewed a draft of this report and provided technical corrections, which were incorporated as appropriate."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Since GAO's last report on JARC in 2009, the instances of recipients letting their funds lapse--allowing the funds to be reapportioned to all recipients-- have decreased. Recipients have 3 years from the time of apportionment to use the funding before it is reapportioned. In fiscal year 2008, 29 designated recipients, or 11.2 percent, let their entire fiscal year 2006 apportioned funds lapse. In fiscal year 2010, 11 designated recipients, or 4.3 percent, let their entire fiscal year 2008 apportioned funds lapse. In addition, the amount of funds lapsing has decreased. In fiscal year 2008, $16.7 million (12 percent) of apportioned funds lapsed, and fiscal year 2010, $10.2 million (6.5 percent) of apportioned funds lapsed. A few recipients have allowed a large amount of funds to lapse; however, others have made progress in using JARC funds, in part due to FTA's efforts. The designated recipients GAO interviewed reported that they have overcome many of the challenges identified in our 2009 report. This improvement was due in part to actions taken by FTA, such as issuing guidance on project eligibility and providing workshops to help officials in areas where a large portion of JARC funds had lapsed. However, three challenges remain. First, some JARC funds have been allowed to lapse because subrecipients have difficulty providing the local funding required to receive JARC funding. Second, three recipients we interviewed faced challenges coordinating with human service organizations, as required. Finally, officials from three of the five states we interviewed said that the funding classifications they receive either do not align with local demands for JARC services or create confusion among local area recipients. Stakeholders have proposed changing JARC. Officials GAO interviewed cited various tradeoffs to these proposals. Some proposals would combine JARC with other transit programs designed to help people who are elderly and/or have disabilities. Proponents of these proposals cited potential benefits such as increased flexibility to use funding to meet specific needs, while critics of these proposals were concerned that targeted populations will no longer receive the same amount of funding unless they are protected."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Access to transportation is critical for enabling low-income individuals to  find and retain employment. To help provide this access, Congress  established the Job Access and Reverse Commute program (JARC) in  1998. Administered by the U.S. Department of Transportation\u2019s (DOT)  Federal Transit Administration (FTA), JARC provides grants to states and  localities to fill gaps in transportation services for low-income individuals  needing access to jobs and related services, such as child care and  training. JARC funds can also be used to fund public transportation  projects designed to transport residents of urbanized areas and other than  urbanized (rural) areas to suburban employment opportunities regardless  of income. In 2005, JARC was reauthorized through the Safe, Accountable,  Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act\u2013A Legacy for Users  (SAFETEA-LU), which authorized $602.5 million for the program for fiscal  years 2006 through 2009. In March 2011, JARC\u2019s funding authorization was  extended through fiscal year 2011, with the Surface Transportation  Extension Act of 2011.", "SAFETEA-LU required us to evaluate JARC 1 year after the legislation  took effect and every 2 years thereafter. We previously reported that JARC  provides an important benefit to low-income individuals, but also that  states and localities have not always submitted projects for FTA to  obligate JARC funds within the allowable time period. When these  unobligated funds lapse most of the funds are lost to the original states  and/or large urbanized areas when they are reapportioned to all recipients.  Thus, most of the benefit of those funds is lost to individuals in those areas  who might have benefited from JARC services. FTA reapportions lapsed  funds across all recipients in subsequent years, including those areas that  allowed funds to lapse. Our 2009 report identified challenges, such as  delays in issuing final program guidance and identifying designated  recipients, faced by designated recipients and subrecipients and we  recommended actions that FTA or Congress could take to address these  challenges. In response to our 2009 report, DOT indicated that FTA  continues to provide guidance and technical assistance to help recipients  address the challenges of JARC and continues to discuss opportunities to  simplify the program in the next reauthorization. In addition, DOT  indicated that a decrease in the percentage of funds recipients allowed to  lapse after fiscal year 2009, compared with the prior fiscal year, indicates  that recipients are improving their efforts to meet the challenges that had  caused funds to lapse. Anticipating the reauthorization of SAFETEA-LU  during 2009, several stakeholders\u2014including legislators, DOT, and public  interest groups\u2014proposed modifications to JARC. These proposed  changes include funding changes, revisions to specific program  requirements, and merging JARC with various other transit programs.", "This report\u2014our third in response to the SAFETEA-LU mandate\u2014 addresses FTA\u2019s progress in implementing changes to JARC. Our specific  reporting objectives were to determine:  1.  the progress FTA and designated recipients have made in reducing the  instances and amounts of lapsed funds;  2.  the challenges designated recipients and subrecipients have faced in  3.  the tradeoffs, according to stakeholders, of proposals to revise JARC  in the surface transportation reauthorization process.", "To address these objectives, we reviewed relevant laws and FTA guidance.  We also interviewed FTA officials, select JARC designated recipients and  subrecipients, and industry stakeholders. We obtained and analyzed data  from FTA\u2019s Transportation Electronic Awards and Management system  and FTA\u2019s Web site to determine the amount of FTA\u2019s apportionments for  JARC and the extent to which JARC funds have been allowed to lapse. We  assessed the reliability of these data by comparing FTA\u2019s data with data  from designated recipients and interviewing FTA officials about their  procedures. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of our report. To examine challenges recipients have  encountered in implementing the program, we interviewed 9 designated  recipients and 10 subrecipients in five states and compared the challenges  they reported to those we identified in our 2009 report. We selected the  designated recipients based on criteria that included jurisdictions where  funds had been allowed to lapse as well as states identified through  industry association contacts. We selected subrecipients that covered the  three areas that were apportioned JARC funding under SAFETEA-LU\u2014 large and small urbanized areas plus rural areas\u2014as well as those that  designated recipients recommended. Since we used a nongeneralizable  sampling approach, the results of these interviews cannot be used to make  inferences about all designated recipients and subrecipients. We also  interviewed stakeholders and officials from industry associations,  including the American Association of State Highway and Transportation  Officials and the Community Transportation Association of America, to  obtain their broader views on challenges associated with implementing  JARC and potential program modifications. To determine the advantages  and disadvantages of JARC modification proposals, we reviewed  published proposals and discussed modification concepts with designated  recipients, subrecipients, and stakeholder organizations.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2010 through May 2011 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives. See appendix I for more information about  our scope and methodology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Congress created JARC in the 1998 Transportation Equity Act for the 21st  Century to support the nation\u2019s welfare-reform goals\u2014including helping  adults meet new work requirements to receive federal assistance. A  purpose of JARC was to improve the mobility of low-income individuals  through grants that states and localities could use to provide additional or  expanded transportation services and thus provide more opportunities for  individuals to get to work. Accessing entry-level jobs can be challenging  for low-income individuals, many of whom do not own cars, have poorly  maintained cars that are not sufficient for daily commuting, or do not have  access to transit options that link them to jobs.", "In 2005, SAFETEA-LU made several changes to JARC. Notably, SAFETEA- LU created a formula to distribute $602.5 million over 4 years beginning  with fiscal year 2006 and required that state or local recipients be  designated to competitively allocate JARC funds. These recipients are  responsible for distributing funds to other agencies. SAFETEA-LU  required that 40 percent of JARC funds be apportioned annually among  states for projects in small urbanized and rural areas (those with  populations of 50,000\u2013199,999 and less than 50,000, respectively). It also  required that the remaining 60 percent be apportioned among large  urbanized areas (those with populations of 200,000 or more). In fiscal year  2010, a total of $175 million in JARC funds were apportioned to designated  recipients.", "JARC funds must be obligated within a certain time period, can be used  for some administrative activities, and must be supplemented by local  funding. Funds must be obligated within 3 years from the time of  apportionment or they lapse. Lapsed funds are reapportioned among all  states and large urbanized areas in the following fiscal year. For example,  $18.6 million in JARC funds apportioned for fiscal year 2006 was allowed  to lapse, per FTA records, at the end of fiscal year 2008. Accordingly, FTA  increased the JARC apportionments for fiscal year 2009 by $18.6 million.  The reapportionment process allows lapsed JARC funds to be used in  other areas. SAFETEA-LU authorizes states and large urbanized areas to  use 10 percent of JARC funds for administrative activities, including  planning and coordination activities. Currently, the federal government\u2019s  cost share for JARC projects is limited to no more than 80 percent for  capital costs and no more than 50 percent of operating costs. For example,  if a subrecipient purchases a bus with JARC funds, it is eligible for up to 80  percent federal funding; however if JARC funding is used for operating the  bus (bus drivers, fuel, etc.), it is eligible for up to 50 percent federal  funding.", "SAFETEA-LU also required JARC recipients to fulfill specific requirements  and follow specific processes (see fig. 1).", "In addition to the requirement that a recipient be designated to  competitively allocate JARC funds, SAFETEA-LU required that designated  recipients certify that JARC projects are derived from locally developed,  coordinated public transit-human service transportation plans. The  coordinated planning process must include representatives of public,  private, and nonprofit transportation and human services providers and  participation by the public. Furthermore, SAFETEA-LU required that  states and large urbanized areas develop and conduct a competitive  selection process for their projects. After projects are selected, states and  urbanized areas must apply to FTA to fund the projects.", "Recipients have used JARC funds for a wide variety of projects to help  low-income workers get to jobs and related activities. Many projects  expand the service area or extend the hours of existing bus routes. For  example, in Danbury, Connecticut, JARC funds were used to add evening  and weekend hours to an existing bus route. Some projects fund van pools  that take groups of workers to work sites. For example, JARC funds were  used for both capital and operating expenses for a van pool to  employment centers from a rural area in Texas. Other projects pay for  vehicle loans or vehicle repairs. For example, a human service  organization in Dodgeville, Wisconsin\u2014a rural area without transit\u2014uses  JARC funds to provide low-interest car loans to low-income workers. As of  2009, the program helped 352 low-income individuals obtain loans to  purchase a car for work. See appendix II for more information on types of  projects supported by JARC funds.", "In addition to JARC, other federal transit programs support transportation  for specific purposes and populations. For example, the New Freedom  program, created by SAFETEA-LU, supports new public transportation  services and public transportation alternatives beyond those required by  the Americans with Disabilities Act. In fiscal year 2010, $99 million was  apportioned for this program. The Elderly Individuals and Individuals with  Disabilities program (commonly referred to as the Section 5310 program),  has existed since 1975. The Section 5310 program originally provided  formula funding for capital projects to help meet the transportation needs  of elderly individuals and persons with disabilities. In 1991, Congress  expanded the Section 5310 program to allow funds to be used to acquire  services to promote the use of private-sector providers and to coordinate  with other human service agencies and public transit providers. In fiscal  year 2010, $134 million was apportioned to state agencies for Section 5310.  SAFETEA-LU requires that both of these programs, as with JARC, certify  that projects be derived from a locally developed, coordinated public  transit-human services transportation plan. FTA\u2019s Urbanized Area Formula  Grant Program (Section 5307) and Other Than Urbanized (Rural) Area  Grant Program (Section 5311) also provide formula funds for general  public transit programs. The Section 5307 program provides transit  funding for large and small urbanized areas, while the Section 5311  program provides transit funding for rural areas. In fiscal year 2010, $4.6  billion was apportioned for these programs: $4.1 billion for the Section  5307 program and $438 million for the Section 5311 program.", "In our 2009 report on JARC, we found that about 14 percent of the fiscal  year 2006 JARC funds lapsed, in part due to the fact that some applicants  did not meet administrative requirements, such as developing a  coordinated public transit-human service transportation plan, in time to  apply for funds. We also found that recipients faced several challenges in  implementing JARC, including the inability to provide the required local  match, and that overall, the effort required to obtain JARC funds was  disproportionate to the relatively small amount of funding available."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recipients\u2014with FTA Help\u2014Have Made Progress Using Apportioned Funds, but a Few Areas Continue to Let Funds Lapse", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Recipients Have Made Progress Using JARC Funds", "paragraphs": ["JARC funds have been apportioned to 258 geographic areas and each year  since SAFETEA-LU was enacted the number of designated recipients  allowing JARC funds to lapse has decreased.

As noted in our 2009 JARC report, the American Association of  State Highway and Transportation Officials proposed consolidating JARC  with FTA\u2019s Urbanized Area Formula Grant Program (Section 5307) and  Other Than Urbanized (Rural) Area Grant Program (Section 5311). The  Community Transportation Association of America proposed new urban  and rural transit programs that would each include JARC elements. The  National Transportation Policy Project proposed combining JARC in an  essential access program that would include the Safe Routes to School  program, the Over the Road Bus Accessibility program, as well as New  Freedom and Section 5310 programs.", "In general, consolidating JARC with other programs could offer greater  program efficiency and flexibility:    The U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Transportation and  Infrastructure reported that its proposal would reduce the administrative  burden on both the grantees and FTA by creating a unified program  application to achieve a variety of mobility and access goals.", "Combining JARC with the New Freedom and Section 5310 programs  would, as noted in support for two plans, maintain the importance of  coordination already implied by the locally developed, coordinated public  transit-human services transportation plan already required by SAFETEA- LU.", "Four recipients we talked with would like to see a combination of  programs as it could give them more flexibility in terms of how they  allocate the grants to meet the transportation gaps specific to their area.  For example, one state said it has more demand for services to help people  who are elderly and/or have disabilities than for JARC grants and could  better respond to state priorities by shifting its JARC funds to New  Freedom or Section 5310 programs.", "Combining JARC and related programs may have disadvantages for some  stakeholders:    As we noted in our 2009 JARC report, associations representing people  who are elderly and those with disabilities expressed concern that  consolidating these programs with JARC would jeopardize transportation  to these populations. Without a set-aside for various populations, some  may not be assured that the funding levels would remain steady for their  population group. The consolidation proposal by the U.S. House of  Representatives Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure provided  minimum funding targets to protect funds for specific populations during  the first year of the consolidated program and other protections in later  years. However, officials in one state that we interviewed were concerned  that while it would increase flexibility, it would not simplify reporting.", "Not every designated recipient may want the flexibility to determine  funding allocations between the populations now served by the current  programs because creating more discretion for designated recipients will  also bring more political pressure to their role, according to a state  program director.", "Two recipients indicated that FTA\u2019s implementation of a consolidated  program would impact the extent to which they would benefit from this  flexibility. In other words, if FTA were to still treat these as separate  programs in terms of reporting, it may not decrease the administrative  burden.", "An official from a small urbanized area transit system said that the current  programs are easy to explain to local officials as separate programs and  the reporting requirements are straight-forward. Combining programs  might result in a more complex program that could be more difficult to  explain and could involve complicated reporting to track benefits provided  to different population groups."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Proposals to Alter JARC Funding Could Improve Program Effectiveness and Help Prevent Funds from Lapsing, but Might Reduce Overall Scope of JARC", "paragraphs": ["The JARC proposals we examined addressed two types of funding  changes\u2014increasing the federal funds directed to the program and  changing the match ratios that JARC subrecipients have to meet in their  project proposals. Two proposals we examined suggested increasing the  amount of funding for JARC or its successor program.", "Transportation for America\u2019s proposal would increase funding by an  unspecified amount for a new program that consolidates the JARC, New  Freedom, and Section 5310 programs. According to the proposal, the  advantage of this change would be to help low-income and other  populations that are inadequately served by existing transit programs.", "The 2008 Obama-Biden Plan proposed doubling JARC funding in order to  ensure that additional federal public transportation dollars flow to the  highest-need communities.", "In addition, three proposals we reviewed would adjust match  requirements:    The Community Transportation Association of America\u2019s proposal would  reduce local operating match requirements from 50 percent to 20 percent.", "The 2008 DOT proposal\u2014Refocus. Reform. Renew. A New Transportation  Approach for America\u2014would reduce the local match requirement for  both capital and operating expenses to 10 percent.", "S. 176, 111th Cong. (2009) would reduce the local match requirement for  operating expenses of a JARC project as an incentive for projects that  coordinate with programs serving other transportation-disadvantaged  populations.", "Reducing the local matching requirement could reduce the incidence of  lapsed JARC funds. As previously discussed, some recipients told us that  lack of match was a reason that their apportioned funds were allowed to  lapse. Other recipients said that their current matching funds are just  enough to support their current grants and they expect that it will be more  difficult for those match sources to sustain their JARC support in the  future. Lower match rates could have the disadvantage of reducing the  overall spending for JARC. For example, we earlier reported that matching  funds are important to maintaining recipients\u2019 level of spending for a  program. Thus, if project sponsors rely more heavily on federal funds  then fewer local funds will likely be used to support programs, and total  program expenditures may decline."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Proposals Suggest Improving JARC\u2019s Coordination with Other Transportation Programs for the Transportation- Disadvantaged", "paragraphs": ["SAFETEA-LU required recipients of FTA\u2019s three grant programs for the  transportation-disadvantaged to develop a coordinated plan. We  previously noted that JARC recipients in three areas we spoke to still  indicated that coordination with human service organizations was  difficult. We reported in 2009 that some recipients had suggested that  federal agencies that provide and allow funds to be used for transportation  services should require grantees to participate in coordinated  transportation planning efforts.", "A reauthorization proposal, as previously noted, would provide an  incentive for projects that coordinate at least two of the three FTA grant  programs for the transportation-disadvantaged. Coordination among all  federal transportation programs for the transportation-disadvantaged has  been a concern noted in our prior reports. Our reports in 2003 and 2004  analyzed federal spending aimed at transportation-disadvantaged  populations. While the full extent of such spending could not be  determined, available data showed federal expenditures of $2.4 billion, of  which just $317 million, or 13 percent, was by DOT programs.  Furthermore, we reported in 2011 that, to assure coordination benefits are  realized, Congress may want to consider requiring key programs to  participate in coordinated planning. The American Public Transportation  Association\u2019s 2008 proposal would require changes in authorizing laws for  transportation, health, and human services to assure coordination and  cost-sharing between agencies for human services transportation. The  Community Transportation Association of America\u2019s 2009 proposal for  streamlined urban, rural, and intercity programs would, according to the  proposal, end the proliferation of stand-alone transportation programs,  each with its own guidance, regulations and purposes.

We did not include  restored funding of $1.9 million for California and almost $1 million for  Washington, D.C., in our analysis of funds allowed to lapse because these  designated recipients had access to the funds in subsequent fiscal years.  Although these funds show up as lapsed in FTA\u2019s Transportation  Electronic and Awards Management system data, they were restored for  specific reasons such as initial coding errors.
