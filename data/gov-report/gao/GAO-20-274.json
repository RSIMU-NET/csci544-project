GAO was asked to review issues related to families\u2014including family units\u2014arriving at the southwest border.", "This report examines the extent to which DHS has identified, collected, documented, and shared information its components need to inform processes for family members apprehended at the border. GAO analyzed DHS documents; interviewed DHS officials; and visited DHS locations in Arizona, California and Texas, where CBP apprehensions of family units increased in 2017.

DHS's U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) apprehends family members and determines how information about each individual\u2014and his or her relationship to other family members\u2014will be collected and documented. Other DHS components, such as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), use information collected at the time of apprehension to inform how those who are members of a family, including children, will proceed through immigration proceedings. Family members apprehended at the border and placed into expedited removal that indicate an intention to apply for asylum, or a fear of persecution or torture or fear of return to their home country, are referred to DHS's U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for a credible fear screening. However,", "DHS has not identified the information its components collectively need about apprehended family members. Each DHS component collects information to meet its own operational needs, and does not consider the information needs of other components. For example, the information about family members that CBP needs differs from the information about family members that USCIS needs. CBP officials told us they would not generally identify spouses and children age 18 to 21 apprehended with a parent as family members, although USCIS's definition of a dependent for credible fear screening purposes includes spouses and unmarried children under age 21.", "CBP collects information about certain family members for its operational purposes, but does not collect and document information at the time of apprehension that other DHS components may later need. Specifically, CBP collects and documents information about parents and their children under age 18 who are apprehended together. However, consistent with regulation, USCIS policy is to include any dependents who arrived concurrently with the principal applicant, such as a spouse or unmarried child under age 21, on a principal applicant's positive credible fear determination if the dependent wants to be included. According to USCIS and ICE officials, it can be difficult to identify spouses and children age 18 to 21 because CBP does not regularly document such family relationships.", "DHS does not have a mechanism to link the records of family members apprehended together across its components that need this information. As a result, DHS components may not have access to all the information about family members they need to make effective operational decisions.", "Because DHS has not identified the information all of its components collectively need to process family members apprehended at the border, collected and documented that information at the time of apprehension, and evaluated options to share that information across components, consistent with leading practices in collaboration, DHS risks removing individuals from the United States who may have been eligible for relief or protection based on their family relationship."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making four recommendations to DHS, including that DHS identify the information its components collectively need to process family members apprehended together, collect and document that information at the time of apprehension, and evaluate options for developing a unique identifier shared across DHS's data systems to link family members apprehended together.

In  particular, apprehensions of family unit members at the southwest border  increased from fiscal year 2017 (about 105,000) to fiscal year 2018  (about 161,000), and further increased dramatically in fiscal year 2019 (to  about 527,000), according to CBP data.", "When CBP apprehends individuals who are determined to be ineligible for  admission into the United States, or otherwise removable, and who claim  to be related, Border Patrol agents and OFO officers make decisions  about how information about each individual and his or her relationship to  other family members will be documented. In addition, agents and officers  decide, on a case by case basis and in consultation with U.S. Immigration  and Customs Enforcement (ICE), whether each individual will be  detained, released to await immigration removal proceedings, or removed  from the United States. In full immigration removal proceedings,  noncitizens may apply for various forms of protection or relief, including  asylum. If placed into expedited removal proceedings instead of full  removal proceedings, noncitizens are to be ordered removed from the  United States, without further hearing before an immigration judge, unless  they indicate an intention to apply for asylum, a fear of persecution or  torture, or a fear of return to their home country (referred to throughout  this report as making a \u201cfear claim\u201d). In such cases, they are referred to  DHS\u2019s U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for a credible  fear screening.

Further, we conducted site visits to ICE adult  detention centers and family residential centers. Specifically, in the  Tucson, Arizona region (July 2018), we visited Border Patrol\u2019s Tucson  sector headquarters and OFO\u2019s Tucson Field Office headquarters and the  Nogales port of entry. In the San Diego, California region (September  2018), we visited Border Patrol\u2019s San Diego sector headquarters and  Imperial Beach station; the San Ysidro port of entry; and an ICE single  adult detention facility. In the Rio Grande Valley, Texas region (October  2018), we visited CBP\u2019s Central Processing Center; Border Patrol\u2019s  McAllen station; the Hidalgo and Brownsville ports of entry; and ICE\u2019s  Port Isabel single adult detention facility. In the San Antonio, Texas region  (February 2019), we visited ICE\u2019s San Antonio field office headquarters;  an ICE single adult detention facility; South Texas Family Residential  Center; and Karnes County Residential Center.

We also considered the geographic proximity of multiple  CBP and ICE facilities to maximize observations. We selected two ICE  family residential centers for field visits to examine unique aspects of ICE  and USCIS processing of credible and reasonable fear claims made by  members of family units. During these visits to USCIS asylum offices and  ICE detention facilities, we observed USCIS asylum officers conducting  credible or reasonable fear screenings of single adults and family unit  members either in person or via telephone. In total, we observed more  than 20 credible and reasonable fear interviews across our site visits. Our  observations during site visits are not generalizable to all Border Patrol,  OFO, and ICE operations along the southwest border, but provided us the  opportunity to learn more about how policies and procedures for  processing families are implemented and how CBP, ICE, and USCIS  coordinate their efforts.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2018 to February 2020 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

DHS components and other federal  agencies use the term \u201cfamily\u201d for individuals with a variety of  relationships such as step-, half-, foster, or adoptive family members.  Some family relationships, including parent-child, may be claimed upon  apprehension, but CBP may determine that the relationship is invalid. For  example, CBP may determine that (1) those claiming a familial  relationship are not related or (2) their relationship does not meet the  relevant component or agency\u2019s operational definition of family. For the  purposes of this report, \u201cfamily\u201d refers generally to noncitizens with  claimed familial relationships.", "Unaccompanied alien child (UAC).

Federal immigration law does not specifically define the term  \u201cfamily unit.\u201d However, CBP and ICE policy and guidance documents  generally define a family unit as the inverse of a UAC. In other words, a  family unit includes a noncitizen child under the age of 18, who has no  lawful immigration status in the United States, accompanied by a  noncitizen parent or legal guardian who is able to provide care and  physical custody.

Agents and officers also collect biometric  information, such as photographs and fingerprints, from certain  individuals. Border Patrol agents and OFO officers use fingerprints to  run records checks against federal government databases to determine if  individuals have any previous immigration or criminal history. Agents and  officers are to enter information about the individuals in the appropriate  automated data system as soon as possible, in accordance with CBP  policy. Border Patrol agents and OFO officers print copies of the  information they enter into their data systems to create a paper file,  known as an \u201cA-file,\u201d for each noncitizen they apprehend.

To do so, for example, they are to review any available  documentation, such as birth certificates; monitor interactions between  adults and children; and use their law enforcement training, such as  interview skills, to help assess the validity of family relationships. After  making decisions about the validity of familial relationships, agents and  officers are to decide whether and how family members will be detained  together while in CBP custody. According to CBP\u2019s 2015 National  Standards on Transport, Escort, Detention, and Search, CBP \u201cwill  maintain family unity to the greatest extent operationally feasible, absent  a legal requirement or articulable safety or security concern that requires  separation.\u201d", "According to CBP officials, if individuals are determined to be ineligible for  admission into the United States, agents and officers must decide how to  process them, which may include placing them into full or expedited  immigration removal proceedings, consistent with the Immigration and  Nationality Act. In full removal proceedings, individuals have the  opportunity to present evidence to an immigration judge to challenge their  removal from the United States and apply for various forms of relief or  protection, including asylum. In expedited removal proceedings, the  government can order individuals removed from the United States without  further hearings before an immigration judge unless they indicate an  intention to apply for asylum, a fear of persecution or torture, or a fear of  return to their home country. Most arriving noncitizens are eligible to be  placed into expedited removal proceedings, with certain exceptions,  according to Border Patrol and OFO officials. Individuals placed in  expedited removal proceedings and who express a fear of persecution or  torture are generally subject to mandatory detention under the  Immigration and Nationality Act pending a final determination of credible  fear of persecution.

ORR provides interim care  for UAC at its shelters and identifies qualified sponsors in the United  States to take custody of the child while the child waits for his or her full  immigration proceedings.

Specifically, CBP, as the  apprehending agency at the border, needs information about family  members apprehended together for the purposes of, among other things,  informing how family members are to be detained while in CBP custody.  In addition, USCIS needs information on family members to identify individuals who may be eligible dependents for credible fear screening  purposes. ICE needs information on family members to assist USCIS in  identifying eligible dependents and to assist ORR in identifying individuals  who may be eligible sponsors for UAC based on their family relationship.", "While each DHS component has identified the information needed to  meet its own specific requirements regarding family members, DHS has  not identified information needs regarding family members across its  components, resulting in a lack of shared understanding of all  components\u2019 needs and fragmented information collection.

Regarding family units, CBP (including Border Patrol and OFO)  generally collects information about members of family units\u2014including  parents and their children under age 18\u2014who are apprehended together.  CBP components assign a unique identifier to a family unit that allows  members\u2019 records to be linked. CBP components use the information they  collect about members of family units to inform how they are to be  detained while in CBP custody and to determine how their immigration  proceedings are to proceed. In addition, CBP may collect information  about certain other relationships among family members apprehended  together because CBP and its components\u2014Border Patrol and OFO\u2014 have policies that allow certain family members who are not defined as  family units to be detained together while in CBP custody.

As another example, family members who Border  Patrol or OFO agents or officers determine need to be detained together,  such as a parent and their child over age 18 with significant medical  needs, may also be held together in CBP custody.", "Border Patrol and OFO have developed processes to collect information  about the relationships between family members who are to be detained  together, including Border Patrol assigning them a \u201cfamily group\u201d number  in Border Patrol\u2019s data system and OFO documenting the relationship  between a juvenile accompanied by a non-parent family member, to  facilitate their detention together while in CBP custody. However, CBP  generally does not collect information about certain family members\u2014 such as spouses or children age 18 to 21\u2014because CBP does not have  a need to collect such information if, for example, those family members  will not be detained together.

At the credible fear screening interview,  USCIS is to document the name, country of nationality, and alien number,  if known, for the spouse and name, date of birth, country of nationality,  and alien number, if known, for the child or children of all individuals being  screened for credible fear.", "In addition, consistent with regulation, it is USCIS policy to include any  dependents who arrived concurrently with the principal applicant, such as  a spouse or unmarried child under the age 21, on a principal applicant\u2019s  positive credible fear determination if the dependent wants to be included.  This results in both the principal applicant and any dependents being  issued a Notice to Appear for full removal proceedings. In addition,  USCIS\u2019s training on screening families for credible fear states that  families do not need to be detained together to be included in a positive  determination.", "In other words, a principal applicant in a credible fear screening may be  detained at one of ICE\u2019s family residential centers and his or her  dependent spouse or child between the ages of 18 and 21 may be  detained separately at an adult detention facility. Specifically, since ICE\u2019s  adult detention facilities are segregated by gender, a female might be  detained in a separate adult detention facility from her male spouse. If a  parent or spouse receives a positive credible fear screening, his or her  dependent\u2019s case could be linked and both family members could receive  a notice to appear in immigration court for full immigration proceedings.", "According to USCIS headquarters officials, USCIS relies on information  obtained during the credible fear screening interview to identify family  members because the information that USCIS receives from CBP about  the circumstances of an apprehension generally does not include details  about spouses or children age 18-21. Further, USCIS officials said that  family members over age 18 who are apprehended together may be  detained in separate ICE facilities and referred to USCIS for fear  screenings at different times, which makes it difficult for USCIS and ICE  to locate such family members. In addition, USCIS officials said that ICE  is often not aware of the family relationship between family members if  they are detained separately. Specifically, although ICE is responsible for  detaining noncitizens who express fear of returning to their home country  before they are screened for such fear by USCIS, ICE officials  responsible for detention management told us that (1) they are often not  aware of family relationships between family members detained  separately and (2) they treat anyone over age 18 as an adult and do not  consider that a child age 18 to 21 or a spouse could be a dependent on a  credible fear claim.", "ICE. In addition to assisting USCIS in identifying eligible dependents for  credible fear screening purposes, ICE assists ORR in identifying qualified  sponsors for UAC. According to ORR, qualified sponsors include, among  others, and in order of preference: parent or legal guardian; an immediate  relative who previously served as a primary caretaker of the child; an  immediate relative who did not previously serve as a primary caretaker of  the child; and other distant relatives or unrelated adults with a pre- established relationship with the child. When a child apprehended by CBP  is classified as a UAC and transferred to ORR\u2019s custody, CBP is to  provide ORR with information about family members with whom the UAC  was apprehended. However, officials from ORR told us that they  sometimes receive UAC referrals\u2014either through an automated system  or via email\u2014from CBP with no information about family members with  whom the child was apprehended, but subsequently learn from the child  that the child was apprehended with a family member.", "According to ICE and ORR officials, when ORR has questions about  potential sponsors for a child in their care, they coordinate with officials  from ICE\u2019s juvenile and family management program to obtain additional  information about the circumstances of the child\u2019s apprehension or family  members with whom a child was traveling. ICE officials stated that CBP  generally provides the information on family members traveling with UAC  to ORR, if CBP is aware of such information; however, according to ICE  officials, children may not share all relevant details about their family  members with CBP agents and officers when they are apprehended, and  they may be more comfortable sharing such details once they are in ORR  custody. ICE officials said that they can search their data systems,  including law enforcement records, for information about the  circumstances of a child\u2019s apprehension, which ORR uses when  evaluating potential sponsors for the child. ORR cannot access such law  enforcement records. For example, ICE can use Border Patrol\u2019s \u201cevent\u201d  unique identifier to search for information about adults who Border Patrol  apprehended at the same time as a child, and can use this information to  attempt to identify if there are family relationships between an adult and  unaccompanied child. ORR officials said that the lack of family member  information they receive from CBP or ICE, or delays in receiving such  information, can delay the release of a child from a shelter to a qualified  sponsor.", "Our previous work on collaboration has shown that establishing  compatible policies, procedures, and other means to operate across  agency boundaries can enhance and sustain collaborative efforts and  help ensure that fragmented efforts are being managed effectively.  Further, leading practices of high-performing organizations include  fostering collaboration both within and across organizational boundaries  to achieve results. Moreover, federal programs contributing to the same  or similar results should collaborate to ensure that program efforts are  mutually reinforcing, and should clarify roles and responsibilities for their  joint and individual efforts.

Officials  from CBP and ICE confirmed that they collect information about family  members to meet their own operational needs. For example, CBP may  not collect information about spouses apprehended together because  CBP does not need such information for its operational purposes. Further,  Border Patrol and OFO officials we spoke with told us that CBP  components collect all relevant information needed for their operational  purposes but that CBP is not responsible for collecting information that  USCIS needs to identify eligible dependents, including spouses and  children age 18 to 21. Without identifying and communicating department- wide information needs with respect to family members who have been  apprehended together, DHS does not have reasonable assurance that its  components are identifying all individuals who may be eligible for relief  from removal from the United States based on their family relationships or  that ICE can provide ORR with the information it needs to help evaluate  the suitability of potential sponsors for UAC."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CBP Does Not Routinely Collect and Document Sufficient Information on Apprehended Family Members to Assist Other Agencies\u2019 Decision- making", "paragraphs": ["CBP\u2019s Border Patrol and OFO document the circumstances under which  family members are apprehended at or between U.S. ports of entry and,  as a result, are in the best position to collect information about their family  relationships.

The record of  apprehension is a key form in the paper A-file and is the official record of  an apprehension. Among other things, the record of apprehension  captures biographic information about the apprehended individual and  includes a narrative section for agents and officers to document details  about the circumstances of the apprehension.

According to Border  Patrol officials, the information captured on the record of apprehension  varies and there is no requirement that it include information about family  members apprehended together. However, USCIS, ICE, and ORR  officials told us that they rely on the record of apprehension for such  family information.

However, CBP does not routinely collect information about  relationships between all parents, children, and spouses apprehended  together at the time of their apprehension or share that information with  USCIS. Specifically, CBP does not require its agents and officers to  collect information about or to document the relationships between certain  family members apprehended together, such as spouses and children  age 18 to 21. As a result, USCIS\u2019s ability to identify eligible dependents is  limited.", "Asylum officers are to ask all individuals they screen for credible fear if  they arrived in the United States with other family members.

Asylum officers also told us that when CBP agents and officers do not  collect and document information about relationships at the time family  members are apprehended, asylum officers must rely on the information  that the applicant provides in the credible fear screening interview, rather  than using the screening interview to corroborate family information  already collected by CBP at the time of the apprehension. In addition, a  USCIS official told us that it can be beneficial for USCIS to have  information about relationships between all parents, children, and  spouses who are apprehended together for other processes\u2014such as if  one family member placed into expedited removal proceedings is subject  to the reasonable fear process\u2014because information in one family  member\u2019s claim can impact other family members\u2019 ability to meet the  threshold for a positive fear determination.", "Border Patrol, OFO, and ICE officials stated that, due to the volume of  apprehensions at the southwest border, Border Patrol and OFO collect  information to meet CBP\u2019s operational needs, but that the level of detail  documented on the record of apprehension may vary. Specifically,  according to one ICE official responsible for detention at a family  residential center and an ICE headquarters official, information about  family relationships, including that of spouses, is not consistently  documented in the information ICE receives from CBP and shares with  USCIS. Since USCIS does not receive consistent information about  family members from CBP, USCIS officers must rely on the credible fear  screening interview to identify potential eligible dependents.", "When asylum officers identify eligible dependents during the credible fear  screening interview, officers attempt to locate these dependents to link  them to their parent\u2019s or spouse\u2019s case. However, according to USCIS  and ICE officials, it can be difficult to locate such dependents if they are  not detained together. Specifically, because CBP officers and agents do  not routinely collect information about the relationships between spouses  or parents and children age 18 to 21 or document such information on the  record of apprehension at the time they are apprehended, USCIS and  ICE do not have the information about those family relationships that they  need to locate and identify eligible dependents. Additionally, individuals  may not know certain information\u2014such as the alien number of their  spouse or child\u2014that would help USCIS or ICE locate them. ICE officials  told us that they assist USCIS officials in locating spouses and children  age 18 to 21 for the purposes of making them dependents on a spouse or  parent\u2019s credible fear application on a case by case basis, but that  tracking down such dependents can be difficult. Further, ICE and USCIS  officials told us that because they do not have sufficient information about  eligible dependents, it is possible that ICE could remove an eligible  dependent from the United States while their spouse or parents\u2019 credible  fear claim was pending, or after their spouse or parent received a positive  credible fear determination.", "Information to assist ORR in making placement decisions for  children transferred to its custody. CBP does not collect all information  about family members at the time of apprehension that is needed to  assist ORR in making placement decisions for UAC transferred to its  custody, according to ICE and ORR headquarters officials. When CBP  refers a child for placement at an ORR shelter, CBP is to share some  information with ORR, including the name, age, and alien number of the  child, as well as information about any family members with whom the  child was apprehended. ORR officials stated they use this information to  assist in making placement decisions for the child. However, ORR  officials stated that the information CBP provides when the child is  referred may not include information about family members with whom  the child was apprehended. Further, according to ORR officials, they do  not typically receive the child\u2019s Form I-213\u2014which documents the  circumstances of the child\u2019s apprehension\u2014from CBP. ORR officials said  that they sometimes receive UAC referrals from CBP without any  information about other family members and they may subsequently learn  from the child that he or she was apprehended with a family member.", "Additionally, if ORR officials have questions about a child in their custody,  officials from ICE\u2019s Juvenile and Family Residential Management Unit told  us that they are the liaison between DHS and ORR. ICE officials told us  that the level of detail that CBP agents and officers collect for UAC  apprehended with family members varies. According to an ICE official in  ICE\u2019s Juvenile and Family Residential Management Unit, the more  information that CBP agents and officers provide about the circumstances  of a child\u2019s apprehension, the better equipped ICE is to answer ORR\u2019s  questions about familial relationships and potential suitable sponsors for a  particular child, as well as to investigate potentially fraudulent familial  relationships or circumstances in which an adult apprehended with a child  might not be a suitable sponsor. According to ORR officials, they also rely  on ICE to provide information about the suitability of reunifying a parent  and child where ORR determines that a UAC was separated from their  parent or legal guardian with whom they arrived.", "As we reported in February 2020, DHS and HHS have developed  interagency agreements for the transfer and placement of UAC between  the two departments; however, information sharing gaps remain.  Specifically, ORR headquarters officials stated that they have  experienced delays in releasing a child to a sponsor due to missing  information about a parent or the inability to notify a parent in ICE  detention about sponsorship decisions. We recommended that DHS and  HHS should collaborate to address information sharing gaps to ensure  that ORR receives information needed to make decisions for UAC,  including those apprehended with an adult.

Additionally, the information  that CBP agents and officers collect may impact how family members are  subsequently identified or processed by other federal agencies.", "CBP officials said that their components collect limited information about  family members apprehended together because they do not have an  operational need for such information and because collecting it is time  intensive in an environment where agents and officers are managing a  large volume of apprehensions. However, because CBP does not  routinely collect sufficient information about family relationships at the  time of apprehension, or document that information on the record of  apprehension, DHS components do not have information necessary to  identify potentially eligible dependents for credible fear purposes and ICE  does not have sufficient information to assist ORR in making suitable  sponsorship determinations.
