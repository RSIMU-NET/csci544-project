Sustained growth in air traffic and aging equipment have strained the current ATC system, limiting the efficiency of ATC operations. This pattern is likely to continue as the number of passengers traveling on U.S. airlines is expected to grow from about 580 million in 1995 to nearly 800 million by 2003, an increase of 38 percent.", "To address these trends, in 1981 FAA embarked on an ambitious ATC modernization program.

At that time, FAA recognized that it could increase ATC operating efficiency by increasing automation. It also anticipated that meeting the demand safely and efficiently would require improved and expanded services, additional facilities and equipment, improved work force productivity, and the orderly replacement of aging equipment. Accordingly, in December 1981, FAA initiated its plan to modernize, automate, and consolidate the existing ATC system by the year 2000.", "This ambitious modernization program includes the acquisition of new radars and automated data processing, navigation, and communication equipment in addition to new facilities and support equipment.

For example, FAA did not analyze its mission needs, did not adequately specify ATC systems requirements, and performed flawed or limited analyses of alternatives for achieving those needs. This is contrary to our finding that successful public and private organizations tie decisions on information technology investments to explicit and quantifiable mission improvements. Second, some systems did not meet agency specifications. Finally, FAA has provided inadequate oversight of contractor performance.

In fact, the Deputy Director for the Office of System Architecture and Investment Analysis, stated that the NAS \u201c1,000 series\u201d documents are \u201cshelfware\u201d and not useful in guiding future systems development. In commenting on a draft of this report, Systems Architecture and Investment Analysis officials stated that they plan to issue a revision to the NAS \u201c1,000 series\u201d documents in October 1997.", "Each of the three IPTs using their own, cooperatively developed technical architectures are described below.", "ATM IPT: This IPT was the first to develop a technical architecture, which is called the ATM Domain Environment Definition Document. It provides guidelines and standards for, among other things, operating systems, communication protocols, data management, security, coding, and testing. ATM officials stated that they created this document to facilitate system integration and ATM software application migration among the systems they are developing, which include the Traffic Management System (TMS) and the Center TRACON Automation System (CTAS).", "En route IPT: This IPT\u2019s architecture governs development of such systems as the Display System Replacement (DSR) and the Host Interface Device/Local Area Network (HID/LAN). The architecture contains a systems development model and a standards profile, including data interchange, communications, security, and programming language standards. Infrastructure IPT: This IPT\u2019s architecture is for its NAS Infrastructure Management System (NIMS), which is this IPT\u2019s primary system. The NIMS architecture includes both logical and technical components. It includes a standards profile that contains the same general categories of standards as the ATM and en route technical architectures.", "While the three IPTs tried to achieve architectural compatibility, they have not been fully successful. For example, all three architectures specify C and C++ as acceptable programming languages, but the en route architecture also specifies Ada as an acceptable language. Also, although the ATM, en route, and infrastructure architectures all specify compliance to the Structured Query Language (SQL)-92 to access data, the en route architecture acknowledges that the SQL-92 standard will have to be modified at times to meet FAA\u2019s real-time, mission-critical requirements. Currently, FAA has no plan for doing this consistently across all three systems environments. Further, the ATM technical architecture specifies the ethernet protocol and the en route architecture specifies the Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) protocol. These two protocols are not compatible. FAA officials told us that they are aware of inconsistencies and that they plan to resolve them, but have not defined the plan, scheduled its implementation, or allocated resources for the effort."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other ATC Modernization Organizations Have Begun to Develop Parts of Optional Technical Systems Architectures", "paragraphs": ["In addition to these IPT-specific technical architectures, three other ARA offices (i.e., Office of Systems Architecture and Investment Analysis, Office of Information Technology, Acquisition Policy Branch) have initiated efforts that relate to, but neither individually nor collectively constitute a complete technical architecture.

Each is discussed below.", "The Office of Systems Architecture and Investment Analysis is adding a draft section on data management to the logical architecture that describes the current state of data exchange between ATC systems. However, this section does not define specific standards (e.g., standards for data elements and naming conventions), and FAA officials have not established milestones for doing so. This office is also planning to develop guidance addressing how security controls (e.g., hardware and software solutions) will be implemented to satisfy security requirements. However, this effort has not been approved by FAA management, and therefore remains unfunded.

However, these initiatives do not specify software product standards, such as standard programming languages and development tools, or standards for software structure, both of which are critical to modernizing ATC systems cost effectively. Moreover, FAA cannot yet demonstrate specific and measurable process improvements.", "The Acquisition Policy Branch has begun an initiative to develop systems engineering guidance for IPTs\u2019 optional use.

Further, the significance of these incompatibilities will increase as FAA moves to a more networked systems environment. Overcoming these incompatibilities means \u201chigher than need be\u201d system development, integration, and maintenance costs, and reduced overall systems performance. Additionally, because many existing systems are largely proprietary, opportunities for application software reuse among systems is effectively precluded and options for migrating applications to new hardware and software platforms are restricted."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Heterogenous Communications Protocols and Data Formats Require Expensive System Interfaces", "paragraphs": ["A system interface is hardware and software that acts as an interpreter to interconnect different systems and allow for the exchange of data.

Conversely, the more disparate the systems, the more complicated the interface. Communications and data management subarchitectures are essential to standardize communication protocols and data formats, respectively, so that system interfaces are less costly and easier to implement.", "As described in chapter 1, system interoperability in the ATC system of systems is essential for FAA to successfully perform its mission. However, fundamental differences in how the systems communicate have made exchanging data between systems more difficult and expensive because it requires the development and maintenance of costly interfaces to interconnect systems. This can be seen in the en route business area, where a system known as the Peripheral Adapter Module Replacement Item (PAMRI) operates as a collection of systems interfaces. Specifically, PAMRI\u2019s primary function is to convert differing protocols from feeder systems, like aircraft surveillance radars and weather detection systems, so that data from these systems can be used by the Host Computer System (HCS), the centerpiece information processing system in the en route centers. To perform this function, FAA spent over $38 million to develop PAMRI and it spends millions annually to maintain it.", "In addition to protocol conversion, PAMRI also performs data conversion of its disparate feeder systems. This conversion is necessary to remedy the data inconsistencies among ATC systems that feed HCS. These data inconsistencies extend beyond just those systems that interface with HCS. For example, FAA has hired a contractor to write an interface so that the Center TRACON Automation System (CTAS) can talk to the Automated Radar Terminal System (ARTS) IIIE. The cost of this interface is estimated at $1 million. In effect, this interface is a \u201cmini-PAMRI.\u201d", "Although some of the systems incompatibilities arise from the fact that FAA\u2019s current ATC systems span several generations of computer systems, other incompatibilities are the result of FAA\u2019s failure to adopt and enforce a systems architecture.

A software subarchitecture is essential to standardize the languages to be used and to institutionalize process standards or methodologies for designing, coding, testing, and documenting software projects.", "Software applications associated with 54 operational ATC systems have been written in 53 programming languages (these 53 include 19 assembly languages). Since most of the ATC languages are obsolete, there is no readily available cadre of newly trained programmers and current and future maintenance becomes even more difficult and costly. For example, the Automated Radar Terminal Systems (ARTS) are written in Ultra, an obsolete assembly language. Furthermore, no restrictions are currently being placed on application language choices for new systems development. For example, a new system that is currently being developed, the Display System Replacement (DSR), is to be written in three programming languages\u2014Ada, C, and assembly. Ada is not used in any other existing ATC system.", "AUA officials told us that the five AUA IPTs are primarily using C, C++, and Ada to develop new ATC systems.

To illustrate, the software for the Host Computer System (HCS), its backup\u2014the Enhanced Direct Access Radar Channel (EDARC)\u2014and PAMRI cost $63.6 million annually to maintain.

An open environment is one that is based on vendor-independent, publicly available standards. If properly planned and implemented, an open system environment supports portable and interoperable applications through standard services, interfaces, data formats, and protocols. Although the plan to evolve to an open environment is a wise one, important choices have to be made consistently across ATC systems to derive the expected benefits (e.g., portable applications, system interoperability). In particular, the open system standards for the collective system of systems must be carefully and thoroughly analyzed in light of systemwide requirements, and the most appropriate standards must be selected. The rigor associated with developing a systems architecture can ensure such analysis.", "Currently, this systemwide analysis is not occurring. Instead, most of the IPTs that are implementing open systems standards are doing so independently. Such a nonstandard migration approach may result in different open system options being selected, perpetuating architectural incompatibilities that require additional costs to overcome. For example, future FAA systems are to provide information to controllers through networked workstations. Two open systems protocol standards that IPTs could independently choose for passing information\u2014ethernet and token-ring\u2014are incompatible.", "Evolution to an open systems environment would also allow FAA to share software among systems with common functionality. For instance, FAA officials told us that 40 percent of the en route flight data processing (FDP) functionality is identical to the oceanic FDP functionality. This 40 percent equates roughly to about 60,000 lines of code. To their credit, FAA officials told us that the oceanic and en route IPTs have agreed to look at opportunities to share software between the replacement systems that perform FDP functions.

However, other system incompatibilities are the result of FAA\u2019s failure to adopt and effectively enforce a technical architecture. Furthermore, until FAA completes and enforces its systems architecture, similar incompatibilities will recur in new ATC systems.", "The officials also commented that formally prescribed and enforced architectural standards could inhibit product team flexibility and creativity in acquiring ATC systems. They added that while they support the use of standards and are trying to move in that direction, they prefer a less formal approach to standards implementation and enforcement.
