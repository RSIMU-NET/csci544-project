CEDCAP is a complex modernization program intended to deliver a system-of-systems for the Bureau's survey data collection and processing functions. In August 2016, GAO reported that while the two programs had taken steps to coordinate their schedules, risks, and requirements, they lacked effective processes for managing interdependencies. Officials acknowledged weaknesses in managing interdependencies and reported that they were taking steps to address them. Until these interdependencies are managed more effectively, the Bureau will be limited in its ability to meet milestones, mitigate major risks, and ensure that requirements are appropriately identified.", "While the large-scale technological changes for the 2020 Decennial Census introduce great potential for efficiency and effectiveness gains, they also introduce many information security challenges. For example, the introduction of an option for households to respond using the Internet puts respondents more at risk for phishing attacks (requests for information from authentic-looking, but fake, e-mails and websites). The Bureau had begun efforts to address a number of these challenges; as it begins implementing this decennial census' design, continued focus on these considerable security challenges will be critical.", "Looking forward, there is uncertainty as to whether the Census Bureau will be ready for the 2018 end-to-end test, set to begin in August 2017. GAO has ongoing work for this committee that is evaluating the significant challenges the Bureau faces in developing, testing, integrating, and securing systems prior to the 2018 test. For example, of the 50 systems to be included in the end-to-end test, half of them are to be delivered after the start of the test or lack a firm delivery date (see figure). In addition, key dates for the integration of the systems have not yet been defined. Given the short window of time before the test is to begin, it is important that the Bureau continue to focus its attention on implementing and securing the data collection systems that are to collect and store the personal information of millions of American people."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["In its August report, GAO made eight recommendations to the Department of Commerce.

Specifically, the  Bureau is aiming to modernize and automate its outdated and inefficient  methods of conducting decennial censuses. This includes plans to  significantly change the methods and technology it uses to count the  population, such as offering an option for households to respond to the  survey via the Internet; enabling a mobile data collection application for  field-based enumerators to use on mobile devices to collect survey data  from households; and automating the management of field operations.

The CEDCAP program, which began in October 2014, is  intended to provide data collection and processing solutions (including  systems, interfaces, platforms, and environments) to support the Bureau\u2019s  multiple surveys throughout the survey life cycle (including survey design;  instrument development; sample design and implementation; data  collection; and data editing, imputation, and estimation). In October 2015, the Bureau estimated that, with its new approach, it expects to be able to  conduct the 2020 Census for a life-cycle cost of $12.5 billion, which would  be a reduction of about $5.2 billion from its estimate of what it would cost  to repeat the design and methods of the 2010 Census. However, in June  2016, we reported that this $12.5 billion cost estimate was not reliable  and did not adequately account for risks that could affect the 2020  Census costs.", "In November 2015, the Bureau issued a 2020 Census Operational Plan,  which is intended to outline the design decisions that are to drive how the  2020 Decennial Census will be conducted\u2014and which are expected to  dramatically change the Bureau\u2019s approach to conducting the 2020  Decennial Census. The plan identified 350 redesign decisions that the  Bureau had either made or was planning to make through 2018. In  August 2016, we reported that the Bureau had determined that about 51  percent of the design decisions were either IT-related or partially IT- related (84 IT-related and 94 partially IT-related).", "As of October 2016, the Bureau reported that it had made 68 IT-related  and 62 partially IT-related design decisions. For example, the Bureau had  decided that individuals/households are to be able to respond to the  census on the Internet from a computer, mobile device, or other devices  that access the Internet; that it intends to award a contract to provide  mobile phones and the accompanying service to enumerators; and that it  plans to use a hybrid cloud solution where it is feasible. However, the  Bureau acknowledged that it still needed to make 16 IT-related and 32  partially IT-related design decisions, including on (1) the uses of cloud- based solutions, such as whether it plans to use a cloud service provider  to support a tool for assigning, controlling, tracking, and managing  enumerators\u2019 caseloads in the field; (2) the tools and test materials to be  used during integration testing; and (3) the expected scale of the system  workload for those respondents that do not use the Bureau-provided  Census identification.", "To inform these design decisions, the Bureau held several major  operational tests, including  the 2014 Census test, which was conducted in the Maryland and  Washington, D.C., areas to evaluate new methods for conducting self- response and non-response follow-up;  the 2015 Census test in Arizona, which evaluated, among other  things, (1) the use of a field operations management system to  automate data collection operations and provide real-time data, (2)  the ability to reduce the non-response follow-up workload using  information previously provided to the government, and (3) the use of  personally owned mobile devices by the field-based enumerators who  go door to door to collect census data;  the 2015 Optimizing Self-Response test in Savannah, Georgia, and  the surrounding area, which was intended to explore methods of  encouraging households to respond using the Internet, such as by  using advertising and outreach to motivate respondents, and enabling  households to respond without a Bureau-issued identification number;  and  the 2016 Census tests in Harris County, Texas and Los Angeles,  California, which evaluated, among other things, the efficiency of non- response follow-up using contractor-provided mobile devices.", "Looking forward, the Bureau has plans for two additional operational  tests: (1) the 2017 Census test\u2014a nationwide sample of how individuals  respond to Census questions using paper, the Internet, or the phone\u2014 in  order to evaluate key new IT components, such as the Internet self- response system and the use of a cloud-based infrastructure; and (2) the  2018 end-to-end test, scheduled from August 2017 through December  2018, which, as previously mentioned, is to test all key systems and  operations to ensure readiness for the 2020 Census."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Overview: The CEDCAP Program", "paragraphs": ["The 2020 Decennial Census operations are dependent on about 50 IT  systems that are currently being developed or are already in production.  Eleven of these systems are expected to be provided as CEDCAP  enterprise systems, which have the potential to offer numerous benefits to  the Bureau\u2019s multiple survey programs, such as enabling an Internet  response option; automating the assignment, control, and tracking of the  caseloads of the field-based enumerators; and enabling a mobile data  collection tool for field work. More details on each of the CEDCAP  projects can be found in our June 2016 testimony and our August 2016  report.", "Our August 2016 report noted that the projects were at varying stages of  planning and design, and none were in the implementation/deployment  stage. The Bureau had previously developed several pilot systems to  provide and test different capabilities, but in May 2016, decided that it  would acquire six of the capabilities from a vendor, using a commercial- off-the-shelf IT platform, rather than continue to develop the capabilities  in-house. This project is called the Enterprise Censuses and Surveys  Enabling (ECASE) initiative. The capabilities that ECASE is to provide  include key functionality intended to significantly redesign the 2020  Census and achieve efficiency gains, such as enabling an Internet  response-option and an operational control system that automates the  assignment, tracking, and management of enumerators\u2019 case work.", "The Bureau does not have a firm estimate for the cost of the CEDCAP  projects. In 2013, the CEDCAP program office estimated that the program  would cost about $548 million from 2015 to 2020. More recently, in July  2015, an independent cost estimate for CEDCAP projected the projects to  cost about $1.14 billion from 2015 to 2020.

As one example, during the 2010 Census, the Bureau planned  to use handheld mobile devices to support field data collection for the  census, including following up with non-respondents. However, due to  significant problems identified during testing of the devices, as well as  cost overruns and schedule slippages, the Bureau decided not to use the  handheld devices for nonresponse follow-up. Instead, it reverted to paper- based processing, which increased the cost of the 2010 Census by up to  $3 billion and significantly increased the risk of not completing the Census  on time. Due in part to these technology issues the Bureau was facing,  we designated the 2010 Census a high-risk area in March 2008.", "Further, we testified in November 2015 that key IT decisions needed to  be made soon because the Bureau was less than 2 years away from end- to-end testing of all systems and operations to ensure readiness for the  2020 Census, leaving limited time to implement the systems. We  emphasized that the Bureau had deferred key IT-related decisions, and  that it was running out of time to develop, acquire, and implement the  systems it will need to deliver the redesigned operations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Government-wide Challenges Involving IT Acquisition and Operations", "paragraphs": ["The Bureau is not alone in facing challenges in acquiring IT systems\u2014it is  a systemic issue that plagues the federal government. Although the  executive branch has undertaken numerous initiatives to better manage  the more than $80 billion that is annually invested in IT, we have a  significant body of work that has found that federal IT investments too  frequently fail or incur cost overruns and schedule slippages while  contributing little to mission-related outcomes. We have previously  testified that the federal government has spent billions of dollars on failed  IT investments, such as  the Department of Defense\u2019s Expeditionary Combat Support System,  which was canceled in December 2012, after spending more than a  billion dollars and failing to deploy within 5 years of initially obligating  funds;  the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 Financial and Logistics Integrated  Technology Enterprise program, which was intended to be delivered  by 2014 at a total estimated cost of $609 million, but was terminated  in October 2011 due to challenges in managing the program; and  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Department of  Defense, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration\u2019s  National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System,  which was a tri-agency weather satellite program that was terminated  in February 2010 after having spent 16 years and almost $5 billion on  the program, when a presidential task force decided to disband the  system.", "Our work has shown that these and other failed IT projects often suffered  from a lack of disciplined and effective management, such as project  planning, requirements definition, and program oversight and  governance. In many instances, agencies have not consistently applied  best practices that are critical to successfully acquiring IT investments,  such as (1) program staff having the necessary knowledge and skills; (2)  program staff prioritizing requirements; (3) end users participating in the  testing of system functionality prior to end user acceptance testing; (4)  government and contractor staff being stable and consistent; and (5)  program officials maintaining regular communication with the prime  contractor.", "Due to the challenges of acquiring IT across the federal government, we  added improving the management of IT acquisitions and operations as a  key area in our 2015 High-Risk Report. As part of this new area, we  also identified CEDCAP as one of nine programs across the federal  government in need of the most attention."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Bureau Lacks Processes for Effectively Managing Interdependencies between the CEDCAP and 2020 Census Programs", "paragraphs": ["In August 2016, we reported that the CEDCAP and 2020 Census  programs were intended to be on parallel implementation tracks and had  major interdependencies; however, the interdependencies between these  two programs had not always been effectively managed. Importantly,  CEDCAP relies on 2020 Census to be one of the biggest consumers of its  enterprise systems, and 2020 Census relies heavily on CEDCAP to  deliver key systems to support its redesign.", "Nevertheless, while both programs had taken a number of steps to  coordinate, such as holding weekly schedule coordination meetings and  participating in each other\u2019s risk review board meetings, they lacked  processes for effectively integrating their schedule dependencies,  integrating the management of interrelated risks, and managing  requirements. Specifically:", "The CEDCAP and 2020 Census programs did not have an effective  process for integrating schedule dependencies. Best practices  identified in our Schedule Assessment Guide call for dependencies  between two programs to be automatically linked and dynamically  responsive to change, or handled through a defined repeatable  process if manual reconciliation cannot be avoided. We reported  that the CEDCAP and 2020 Census programs had both established  master schedules that contain thousands of milestones and tens of  thousands of activities and had identified major milestones within  each program that were intended to align with each other. However,  the CEDCAP and 2020 Census programs maintained their master  schedules using different software where dependencies between the  two programs were not automatically linked, were not dynamically  responsive to change, and not handled through a defined repeatable  process. Instead, the Bureau\u2019s practice of maintaining separate  dependency schedules, which must be manually reconciled, had  proven to be ineffective and had contributed to the misalignment  between the programs\u2019 schedules. We concluded in our report that,  without an effective process for ensuring alignment between the two  programs, the Bureau faces increased risk that capabilities for  carrying out the 2020 Census will not be delivered as intended. Thus,  we recommended that the Bureau define, document, and implement a  repeatable process to establish complete alignment between the  CEDCAP and 2020 Census programs by, for example, maintaining a  single dependency schedule. The Bureau agreed with this  recommendation and indicated it would be taking actions to address  it.", "CEDCAP and 2020 Census did not have an integrated list of risks  facing both programs. We reported that the two programs had taken  steps to collaborate on identifying and mitigating risks, such as having  processes in place for identifying and mitigating risks that affect their  respective programs. However, we found that these programs did not  have an integrated list of risks (referred to as a risk register) with  agreed-upon roles and responsibilities for tracking them, as called for  by best practices identified by GAO for collaboration and leading  practices in risk management. This decentralized approach introduced  two key challenges: (1) there were inconsistencies in tracking and  managing interdependent risks, and (2) tracking risks in two different  registers could result in redundant efforts and potentially conflicting  mitigation efforts. To address this, we recommended that the Bureau  establish a comprehensive and integrated list of all interdependent  risks facing the CEDCAP and 2020 Census programs, and clearly  identify roles and responsibilities for managing this list. The Bureau  agreed with this recommendation and indicated it would take actions  to address it.", "Among other requirements management challenges, we reported that  although the Bureau had drafted a process for managing  requirements between CEDCAP and 2020 Census programs, the  process had not yet been finalized. As a result, the Bureau had  developed three system releases without having a fully documented  and institutionalized process for collecting those requirements. In July  2016, Bureau officials stated that, due to the recent selection of a  commercial vendor to deliver many of the CEDCAP capabilities, they  did not plan to finalize this process until January 2017.

In  addition, because the Bureau plans to provide its enumerators with  mobile devices to collect information from households that did not self- respond to the survey, it is important that the Bureau ensures that these  devices are adequately protected. More details on each of these  challenges can be found in our recently issued report.", "In early 2016, the Bureau\u2019s acting Chief Information Officer and its Chief  Information Security Officer acknowledged these challenges and  described the Bureau\u2019s plans to address them. For example, the Bureau  has developed a risk management framework, intended to ensure that  proper security controls are in place and provide authorizing officials with  details on residual risks and progress to address those risks. To minimize  the risk of phishing, Bureau officials noted that they plan to contract with a  company to monitor the Internet for fraudulent sites pretending to be  those of the Census Bureau.

The Bureau is relying on contractor support in many key  areas, including the technical integration of all of the key systems and  infrastructure, and the development of many of the data collection  systems. For example, in August 2016, the Bureau awarded a  contract for the technical integration of the 2020 Census systems and  infrastructure, to include an evaluation of the systems and  infrastructure, development of the infrastructure (e.g., cloud or data  center) to meet the Bureau\u2019s scalability and performance needs,  integration of all of the systems, and support for testing activities.  However, key dates for this work have yet not been finalized.", "In addition, the Bureau is relying on other contractors to develop a  number of key systems, such as (1) development of the IT platform  that will be used to collect data from a majority of respondents\u2014 through the use of the Internet, telephone, and non-response follow- up activities; (2) procurement of the mobile devices and cellular  service to be used for non-response follow-up; and (3) development of  the IT infrastructure in the field offices. The 2020 Census will be the  first time that the Bureau uses a technical integrator in this manner;  collects data nationwide via the Internet; and relies on mobile devices  for non-response follow-up. A greater reliance on contractors for these  key components of the 2020 Census requires the Bureau to focus on  sound management and oversight of the key contracts, projects, and  systems.", "Does the Bureau have back-up plans in case key systems are not  ready in time for the 2018 test?
