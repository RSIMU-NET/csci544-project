Rail rates generally declined between 1985 and 2000, then increased slightly from 2001 through 2004. Concerns about competition and captivity remain as traffic is concentrated in fewer railroads. It is difficult to determine the number of \"captive\" shippers as proxy measures can overstate or understate captivity. Nevertheless, GAO's analysis of limited available measures indicates that the extent of captivity appears to be dropping, but the percentage of traffic traveling at rates substantially over the threshold for rate relief has increased. Also, some areas with access to only one major railroad have higher percentages of traffic traveling at rates above the threshold. These findings may reflect reasonable economic practices by the railroads or a possible abuse of market power. GAO's analysis is limited by available data and proxy measures but suggests that shippers in selected markets may be paying excessive rates, meriting further inquiry and analysis. While STB has taken action, further efforts to improve its rate relief processes and assess competition could help address competition and captivity concerns and inform the merits of proposed alternative approaches. STB's rate relief processes are largely inaccessible and rarely used. STB recognizes this and is taking steps to improve its processes. STB has broad statutory authority to inquire into and report on railroad industry practices and, given a reasonable possibility that some shippers may be paying excessive rates, an assessment of competition could determine whether there is sufficient evidence that market power is being abused in specific markets. While competition between railroads may not always be feasible, alternative approaches have costs and benefits that should be carefully considered to ensure the balance envisioned in the Staggers Rail Act--including the railroads' need for adequate revenues. Significant increases in freight traffic are forecast, and the industry's ability to meet them is largely uncertain. Investments in rail projects can produce public benefits, such as reducing highway congestion. As a result, federal and state governments have increasingly participated in freight rail projects. In 2005, for example, Congress provided $100 million for rail improvements in the Chicago area. Congress faces additional decisions about potential federal policy responses in years ahead. Responses should recognize that the freight transportation system includes many modes that are treated differently by the federal government and functions in a competitive marketplace and a constrained federal funding environment. In developing a National Freight Policy, the Department of Transportation (DOT)has made a good start by providing context for those decisions and DOT can help sustain the role of the competitive marketplace through strategies that promote a level playing field for freight transportation decision making and acknowledge the constrained federal fiscal environment by focusing federal involvement where demonstrable, wide-ranging public benefits exist."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Over 25 years ago, Congress transformed federal regulation of the railroad  industry. After almost 100 years of economic regulation, the railroad  industry was in serious economic trouble in the 1970s, with rising costs,  losses, and bankruptcies. In response, Congress passed the Railroad  Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 and the Staggers Rail  Act of 1980. Together, these pieces of legislation substantially deregulated  the railroad industry. In particular, the 1980 act encouraged greater  reliance on competition to set rates and gave railroads increased freedom  to price their services according to market conditions, including the  freedom to use differential pricing\u2014that is, to recover a greater proportion  of their costs from rates charged to shippers with a greater dependency on  rail transportation. At the same time, the 1980 act anticipated that some  shippers might not have competitive alternatives\u2014commonly referred to  as \u201ccaptive shippers\u201d\u2014and gave the Interstate Commerce Commission  (ICC), and later the Surface Transportation Board (STB), the authority to  establish a process so that shippers could obtain relief from unreasonably  high rates. However, only a rate that produces revenue equal to at least  180 percent of the variable cost of transporting the shipment can be  challenged. Since the passage of the Staggers Rail Act in 1980, we have  issued several reports on the freight railroad industry. These reports  described the significant changes that have taken place in the railroad  industry and reported that rates have generally decreased, but shippers  and others have found the rate relief process long, complex, and  expensive.", "Policymakers continue to believe that the federal government should  provide a viable process to protect shippers against unreasonably high  rates, as well as address competition issues, while still balancing the  interests of both railroads and shippers. Over the past 10 years, significant  consolidation has taken place in the freight railroad industry, while  railroads\u2014particularly Class I railroads\u2014 have seen their productivity  and financial health improve. Railroad officials worry that any attempt to  increase economic regulation will reduce carriers\u2019 ability to earn sufficient  revenues and limit future infrastructure investment. At the same time, a  number of academic and government studies are predicting a significant  increase in the demand for freight rail over the next 10 to 15 years. In light  of these concerns, we reviewed  the changes that have occurred in the freight railroad industry since the  enactment of the Staggers Rail Act, including changes in rail rates and  competition in the industry;  the actions STB has taken to address concerns about competition and  captivity and any alternative approaches that could be considered to  address remaining concerns; and the projections for freight traffic demand over the next 15 to 25 years, the  freight railroad industry\u2019s projected ability to meet that demand, and  potential federal policy responses.", "To fulfill our objectives, we examined STB\u2019s Carload Waybill Sample from  1985 through 2004 (the latest data available at the time of our review).  This database includes information on rail rates, tonnage, federal  regulation, and other statistics but disguises some revenues to avoid  disclosing confidential business information to the public. We obtained a  version of the Carload Waybill Sample that did not disguise revenues. We  held an expert panel consisting of 11 individuals with expertise in the  freight railroad industry and the economics of transportation deregulation.  Those individuals are listed in appendix I. We also interviewed, and  reviewed information from, representatives of each Class I railroad in  North America, shipper groups, economists, and experts in the rail  industry. In addition, we reviewed pending legislation, transportation  planning literature, and forecasts of future freight rail demand and  capacity, including syntheses of such forecasts; and interviewed federal  and state transportation officials, financial market analysts, national  association representatives, and transportation experts. We determined  that the data used in this report were sufficiently reliable for the purpose  of our review. We conducted our review from June 2005 to August 2006 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Details of our objectives, scope, and methodology appear in appendix II."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In the past, the ICC regulated almost all of the rates that railroads charged  shippers. The Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976  and the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 greatly increased reliance on competition  to set rates in the railroad industry. Specifically, these acts allowed  railroads and shippers to enter into confidential contracts that set rates  and prohibited ICC from regulating rates where railroads had either  effective competition or rates negotiated between the railroad and the  shipper. Furthermore, the ICC Termination Act of 1995 abolished ICC and  transferred its regulatory functions to STB. Taken together, these acts  anchor the federal government\u2019s role in the freight rail industry by  establishing numerous goals for regulating the industry, including to    allow, to the maximum extent possible, competition and demand for  services to establish reasonable rates for transportation by rail;    minimize the need for federal regulatory control over the rail  transportation system and require fair and expeditious regulatory  decisions when regulation is required;   promote a safe and efficient rail transportation system by allowing rail  carriers to earn adequate revenues, as determined by STB;   ensure the development and continuation of a sound rail transportation  system with effective competition among rail carriers and with other  modes to meet the needs of the public and the national defense; foster sound economic conditions in transportation and ensure effective  competition and coordination between rail carriers and other modes:   maintain reasonable rates where there is an absence of effective  competition and where rail rates provide revenues that exceed the amount  necessary to maintain the rail system and attract capital;    prohibit predatory pricing and practices to avoid undue concentrations of    provide for the expeditious handling and resolution of all proceedings.", "While the Staggers Rail and ICC Termination Acts reduced regulation in  the railroad industry, they maintained STB\u2019s role as the economic  regulator of the industry. The federal courts have upheld STB\u2019s general  powers to monitor the rail industry, including its ability to subpoena  witnesses and records and to depose witnesses. In addition, STB can  revisit its past decisions if it discovers a material error, or new evidence,  or if circumstances have substantially changed.", "Two important components of the current regulatory structure for the  railroad industry are the concepts of revenue adequacy and demand-based  differential pricing. Congress established the concept of revenue adequacy  as an indicator of the financial health of the industry. STB determines the  revenue adequacy of a railroad by comparing the railroad\u2019s return on  investment with the industrywide cost of capital. For instance, if a  railroad\u2019s return on investment is greater than the industrywide cost of  capital, STB determines that railroad to be revenue adequate. Historically,  ICC and STB have rarely found railroads to be revenue adequate\u2014a result  that many observers relate to characteristics of the industry\u2019s cost  structure. Railroads incur large fixed costs to build and operate networks  that jointly serve many different shippers. Some fixed costs can be  attributed to serving particular shippers, and some costs vary with  particular movements, but other costs are not attributable to particular  shippers or movements. Nonetheless, a railroad must recover these costs  if the railroad is to continue to provide service over the long run. To the  extent that railroads have not been revenue adequate, they may not have  been fully recovering these costs.", "The Staggers Rail Act recognized the need for railroads to use demand- based differential pricing to promote a healthy rail industry and enable it  to raise sufficient revenues to operate, maintain and, if necessary, expand  the system in a deregulated environment. Demand-based differential  pricing, in theory, permits a railroad to recover its joint and common  costs\u2014those costs that exist no matter how many shipments are  transported, such as the cost of maintaining track\u2014 across its entire  traffic base by setting higher rates for traffic with fewer transportation  alternatives than for traffic with more alternatives. Differential pricing  recognizes that some customers may use rail if rates are low\u2014and have  other options if rail rates are too high or service is poor. Therefore, rail  rates on these shipments generally cover the directly attributable  (variable) costs, plus a relatively low contribution to fixed costs. In  contrast, customers with little or no practical alternative to rail\u2014\u201dcaptive\u201d  shippers\u2014generally pay a much larger portion of fixed costs. Moreover,  even though a railroad might incur similar incremental costs while  providing service to two different shippers that move similar volumes in  similar car types traveling over similar distances, the railroad might charge  the shippers different rates. Furthermore, if the railroad is able to offer  lower rates to the shipper with more transportation alternatives, that  shipper still pays some of the joint and common costs. By paying even a  small part of total fixed cost, competitive traffic reduces the share of those  costs that captive shippers would have to pay if the competitive traffic  switched to truck or some other alternative. Consequently, while the  shipper with fewer alternatives makes a greater contribution toward the  railroad\u2019s joint and common costs, the contribution is less than if the  shipper with more alternatives did not ship via rail.", "The Staggers Rail Act further requires that the railroads\u2019 need to obtain  adequate revenues to be balanced with the rights of shippers to be free  from, and to seek redress from, unreasonable rates. Railroads incur  variable costs\u2014that is, the costs of moving particular shipments\u2014in  providing service. The Staggers Rail Act stated that any rate that was  found to be below 180 percent of a railroad\u2019s variable cost for a particular  shipment could not be challenged as unreasonable and authorized ICC,  and later STB, to establish a rate relief process for shippers to challenge  the reasonableness of a rate. STB may consider the reasonableness of a  rate only if it finds that the carrier has market dominance over the traffic  at issue\u2014that is, if (1) the railroad\u2019s revenue is equal to or above 180  percent of the railroad\u2019s variable cost (R/VC) and (2) the railroad does not  face effective competition from other rail carriers or other modes of  transportation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Railroad Industry Increasingly Healthy and Rates Generally Down Since Enactment of the Staggers Rail Act, but Concerns about Competition and Captivity Remain", "paragraphs": ["The changes that have occurred in the railroad industry since the  enactment of the Staggers Rail Act are widely viewed as positive.

Because changes in traffic patterns  over time (for example, hauls over longer distances) can result in a  decrease in the average revenue per ton-mile, purely relying on cents per  ton-mile can present misleading industrywide rate trends. Therefore, we  developed a set of rail rate indexes to examine trends in rail rates over  the 1985 through 2004 period.

Ongoing  industry and economic changes have influenced how railroads have set  their rates. Since the Staggers Rail Act was enacted, the railroad industry  and the economic environment in which it operates have changed  considerably. After years of reducing the size of its workforce and  shedding track capacity, the industry is increasingly operating in a  capacity-constrained environment in which the demand for its services  exceeds its capacity in some areas. In addition, the industry has more  recently increased employment and invested in increased capacity in key  traffic corridors. Additionally, changes in broader domestic and world  economic conditions have led to changes in the mix and profitability of  traffic carried by railroads. For example, railroads have developed high- volume traffic by shipping import and export containers, leading them to  price these shipments differently. According to DOT officials, some  shippers\u2014such as those in the automobile and chemical industries\u2014may  pay higher rates in order to secure higher quality service or due to liability  issues. Lastly, the rail industry has continued to consolidate, potentially  increasing the market power of the largest railroads. Our analysis included  rate data through 2004, and according to freight railroad officials,  shippers, and financial analysts, since 2004, rates have continued to  increase as the demand for freight rail service has increased, and rail  capacity has not kept pace with demand."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Costs Have Shifted to Shippers, and Some Charges Are Not Accurately Tracked", "paragraphs": ["While rates have generally decreased since 1985, other costs have been  passed on to shippers, some of which STB has not accurately tracked.  Several shippers with whom we spoke agreed that rates have dropped  over the long-term, but they also said that rates do not reflect the total cost  of shipping by rail. According to some shippers, costs have shifted from  the railroads to shipping companies, including the costs of railcar  ownership. Figure 6 shows that tons carried by railcar ownership has  shifted nearly 20 percent since 1985, indicating less tonnage shipped on  railcars owned by freight railroad companies.", "Besides rates, other costs that shippers reported were infrastructure  upgrade costs, fuel surcharges,  and congestion fees. Conversely, one  Class I railroad told us that some rates in the Carload Waybill Sample do  not account for rebates or incentives that may change the actual rate paid by the shipper. We are unable to report on the full extent of all costs  because STB has not accurately tracked the railroad revenues associated  with some of these charges. For example, freight railroad companies do  not consistently report revenues raised from fuel surcharges for use in the  Carload Waybill Sample. Some railroads report fuel surcharges as part of their general revenues, while others categorize the surcharges separately  under a miscellaneous revenue category, and still other railroads may not report revenue collected from fuel surcharges at all. Shippers have  expressed deep concerns over how fuel surcharges relate to actual fuel  costs. Other railroad revenues, such as those generated at railcar auctions and through congestion fees, may not be included in the waybill  sample either. Understanding what railroads do and do not report as  miscellaneous revenue in the waybill sample may be of increasing  importance because fuel surcharges have become more prevalent, and  railroad revenue reported as miscellaneous revenue has substantially risen  in recent years. From 2000 through 2004, the miscellaneous revenue  reported in the waybill sample has more than quadrupled in value, from  $141 million to $614 million (see fig. 7). Although an increase in value,  $614 million still represents less than 1.5 percent of the approximately $42  billion in freight railroad revenue reported for 2004. Since 2004,  miscellaneous revenue may have further increased as railroad and shipper  groups with whom we spoke said that many fuel surcharge increases took  effect in 2005.

In 1976, there were 30 independent Class I railroad systems,  consisting of 63 Class I railroads operating in the United States. Currently  there are seven railroad systems, consisting of seven Class I railroads.  Nearly half of that reduction was attributable to consolidations. The  railroad industry is dominated by four Class I railroads\u2014two in the East  and two in the West. As figure 8 shows, the market share of these four  Class I railroads has been increasing and accounted for over 89 percent of  the industry\u2019s revenues in 2004.", "There is significant disagreement on the state of competition in the rail  industry and on whether or not federal regulation\u2014resulting from  legislation such as the Staggers Rail Act\u2014has ensured effective  competition among railroads. This disagreement was represented on our  panel of 11 experts, 6 of whom indicated that rail-to-rail competition has  been achieved (either \u201cgreatly\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d) and 4 of whom maintained  that effective competition had not been achieved. One member of our  panel viewed less competition among rail carriers as a negative  development because it can result in less efficient railroad companies and  fewer options for shipping companies. Another member of our panel said  that industry consolidation was essential to achieving an efficient and  complete rail network under fewer, but ultimately stronger, railroad  companies. Other experts also pointed to the hundreds of short-line  railroads that have come into being since the enactment of the Staggers  Rail Act, as well as increases in other competitive options for shippers  from other modes such as trucks and barges.", "A reduction in competitive options can have a significant impact on the  rates railroads charge shippers. There are a variety of contexts that affect  how railroads compete with each other and with other modes, such as  when route origins and destinations can both be reached by more than one  railroad, or by multiple modes of transportation. Comparing two routes  for shipping the same commodity, but using a different number of rail  carriers, can illustrate this effect. Figure 9 shows two long-distance grain  routes that both terminate in the Portland, Oregon, economic area from  different origin points. Both routes carry comparable tonnage, but the  route originating in the economic area in and around Sioux Falls, South  Dakota, is served by two Class I railroads, whereas the route from the  Minot, North Dakota, economic area is served by one Class I railroad. The  rates for the Minot route are roughly double the rates for the Sioux Falls  route.", "The ability to build out to another railroad can also create competition and  improve railroad rates for some shippers. For example, following a build- out, a shipper gained access to a second railroad at an origin point that  had previously been served by one Class I railroad. Figure 10 shows that  within a few years after the introduction of service by the second railroad,  the rates had dropped significantly. Because even a short segment build- out can be quite costly, shippers are unlikely to pursue build-out options  without a substantial traffic base. Some experts with whom we spoke said  that situations like the one depicted in figure 9 reflect the reality of  differential pricing in the freight railroad industry, or they suggest that  other factors such as differences in the length of two different routes may  be the cause of rate discrepancies. Others believe that a significant rate  decrease after the introduction of competition is evidence that railroads  are extracting monopoly rates from captive shippers.", "While competition between rail carriers is particularly important in some  cases, in other cases, competition between rail and other transportation  modes, such as trucks and barges, may be more important. Particularly for  bulk commodities (i.e., grain), when shipper locations can be served by  barge transportation, rail rates will be lower relative to rail costs than on  routes that are not conducive to barge competition. Figure 11 depicts costs  and revenues for two routes, one (from the Champaign, Illinois economic  area to the New Orleans, Louisiana economic area) with rail and barge  options, and the other (from the Champaign, Illinois economic area to the  Atlanta, Georgia economic area) with just a rail option. Although both  routes have the same origin, for shipping the same commodity over a  comparable distance, the route with the barge option has consistently  lower rates than the route with just rail service.", "Besides the number of rail carriers serving a location, the use of contracts  for rail service can affect the competitive landscape. The Staggers Rail Act  allowed railroad and shipping companies to enter into confidential  contracts for rail service and also placed all traffic running under contract  outside the remaining rate regulations. According to railroad and shipper  groups, the duration of contracts has declined, in part because of the  railroads\u2019 desire to quickly react to shifting market demand, which can  result in charging higher rates. Other shippers were concerned that  moving away from confidential contracts to public pricing could represent  price signaling and further reduce competition between railroads.

As  shown in figure 12, these areas include parts of Montana, North Dakota,  New Mexico, Maine, and smaller areas in several states.", "Another way of looking at potential captivity is to calculate how much  route tonnage originating in a given economic area has access to only one  Class I railroad.

In particular, economic areas with more than 75 percent of  tonnage shipped on one railroad appear most prevalent in states such as  Montana, Idaho, North Dakota, and Texas. Tonnage originating in these  economic areas varies widely, from a little over 55,000 tons to over 36  million tons.", "According to our analysis of available measures, the overall extent of  captivity appears to be dropping in the freight railroad industry.

While overall industry tonnage  with access to more than one Class I railroad appears to have increased,  some economic areas have a higher percentage of all industry traffic  tonnage shipping on one Class I railroad. From 1994 through 2004, parts of  states such as Texas, Tennessee, and Montana experienced increases of 25  percent or more in tonnage with access to one Class I railroad while parts  of other states such as Oregon, New York, and Florida saw their  percentages of tonnage with access to one Class I railroad drop by more  than 25 percent (see fig. 14).", "While examining BEA areas provides a proxy measure for captivity, a  number of factors may understate or overstate whether shippers are  actually captive. The first three factors may work to understate the extent  of captivity among shippers. First, routes originating within economic  areas served by multiple Class I railroads may still be captive if only one  Class I railroad serves their destination, and a shipper must use that one  railroad for that particular route. Second, some BEA areas are quite large,  so a shipper within the area may have access to only one railroad, even  though there are two or more railroads within the broader area. Third, an  origin may only be served by one Class I railroad, but one Class I railroad  does not serve the entire route, meaning the route may be partially captive,  although more than one Class I railroad provides service between its  origin and destination. Two additional limitations may work to overstate  the number of locations captive to one railroad. First, this analysis  accounts for Class I railroads only and does not account for competitive  rail options that might be offered by Class II or III railroads such as the  Guilford Rail System, which operates in northern New England. Second,  this analysis considers only competition among rail carriers and does not  examine competitive options offered by rail and other transportation  alternatives such as trucks and barges."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Amount of Potentially Captive Traffic Traveling at Rates at Levels Substantially above the Threshold for Rate Relief Has Increased", "paragraphs": ["To determine potential captivity, we applied another measure\u2014 traffic  traveling at rates equal to or greater than 180 percent R/VC, which is part  of the statutory threshold for bringing a rate relief case before STB. STB  regards traffic at or above this threshold as \u201cpotentially captive.\u201d As with  BEA areas, examining R/VC levels as a proxy measure for captivity can  also understate or overstate captivity. For example, it is possible for the  R/VC ratio to increase while the rate paid by a shipper is declining.  Assume that in Year 1, a shipper is paying a rate of $20 and the railroad\u2019s  variable cost is $12; the R/VC ratio\u2014a division of the rate and the variable  cost\u2014would be 167 percent. If in Year 2, the variable costs decline by $2  from $12 to $10 and the railroad passes this cost savings directly on to the  shipper in the form of a reduced rate, the shipper would pay $18 instead of  $20.

For example, in 1985 virtually no coal  originating in Ohio traveled at rates over 300 percent R/VC. In 2004, nearly  half of coal traffic originating in Ohio traveled at rates over 300 percent  R/VC. Increases in traffic traveling at rates over 300 percent R/VC can also  be seen at the route level.

STB determines the  reasonableness of challenged rates in the absence of competition upon  receiving a complaint from a shipper. The rate relief process is the  principal method by which shippers seek relief from unreasonable rates.  STB developed standard rate case guidelines, under which captive  shippers can challenge a rail rate and appeal to STB for rate relief. Under  the standard rate relief process, STB assesses whether the railroad  dominates the shipper\u2019s transportation market and, if it finds market  dominance, proceeds with further assessments to determine whether the  actual rate the railroad charges the shipper is reasonable. STB requires  that the shipper demonstrate how much an optimally efficient railroad  would need to charge the shipper and construct a hypothetical, perfectly  efficient railroad that would replace the shipper\u2019s current carrier. As part  of the rate relief process, both the railroad and the shipper have the  opportunity to present their facts and views to STB, as well as to present  new evidence. In 1999, we reported that shippers and shippers\u2019  associations indicated that constructing a hypothetical railroad is difficult,  particularly for small shippers, because the time and cost associated with  the model\u2019s development may outweigh the compensation afforded the  shipper should STB determine that the challenged rate was unreasonable.  Since we reported on the process in 1999, STB has taken several actions to  reduce potential barriers for filing a complaint.

For example, in April 1998, at the request of Congress, STB commenced a  review of access and competitive service in the rail industry. In April 1998,  STB decided to consider revising its competitive access rules.

While STB does not  keep records of the cost of a rate case, shippers we interviewed agreed  that the process can cost approximately $3 million per litigant. Shippers  told us that, to initiate a case, the case would need to involve several  million dollars so that it would be worthwhile to spend $3 million on a  case that they could possibly lose. Thus, shippers noted that only large- volume shippers, such as coal shippers, with set origins and destinations  have the money to be able to afford the STB rate relief process. In  addition, shippers said that they do not use the process because it takes so  long for STB to reach a decision. Lastly, shippers continue to state that the  process is both time consuming and difficult because it calls for them to  develop a hypothetical competing railroad to show what the rate should be  and to demonstrate that the existing rate is unreasonable.

While our analysis of available measures  shows that the extent of captivity appears to be dropping in the freight  railroad industry, shippers that may be captive are paying substantially  over the statutory threshold for initiating a rate relief case.

These groups view these approaches as more  effective than the rate relief process in promoting a greater reliance on  competition to protect shippers against unreasonable rates. Some  proposals would require legislative change, or a reopening of past STB  decisions.", "These approaches each have potential costs and benefits. On the one  hand, they could expand competitive options, reduce rail rates, and  decrease the number of captive shippers as well as reduce the need for  both federal regulation and a rate relief process. On the other hand,  reductions in rail rates could affect railroad revenues and limit the  railroads\u2019 ability and potential willingness to invest in their infrastructure.  In addition, some markets may not have the level of demand needed to  support competition among railroads. However, in markets that do, the  targeted approaches frequently proposed by shipper groups and others  include the following:    Reciprocal switching: This approach would allow STB to require railroads  serving shippers that are close to another railroad to transport cars of a  competing railroad for a fee. The shippers would then have access to  railroads that do not reach their facilities. This approach is similar to the  mandatory interswitching in Canada, which enables a shipper to request a  second railroad\u2019s service if that second railroad is within approximately 18  miles. Some Class I railroads already interchange traffic using these  agreements, but they oppose being required to do so. Under this approach,  STB would oversee the pricing of switching agreements. This approach  could also reduce the number of captive shippers by providing a  competitive option to shippers with access to a proximate but previously  inaccessible railroad and thereby reduce traffic eligible for the rate relief  process (see fig. 21).", "Terminal agreements: This approach would require one railroad to grant  access to its terminal facilities or tracks to another railroad, enabling both  railroads to interchange traffic or gain access to traffic coming from  shippers off the other railroad\u2019s lines for a fee. Current regulation requires  a shipper to demonstrate anticompetitive conduct by a railroad before  STB will grant access to a terminal by a nonowning railroad unless there is  an emergency or when a shipper can demonstrate poor service and a  second railroad is willing and able to provide the service requested. This  approach would require revisiting the current requirement that railroads  or shippers demonstrate anticompetitive conduct in making a case to gain  access to a railroad terminal in areas where there is inadequate  competition. The approach would also make it easier for competing  railroads to gain access to the terminal areas of other railroads and could  increase competition between railroads. However, it could also reduce  revenues to all railroads involved and adversely affect the financial  condition of the rail industry. Also, shippers could benefit from increased  competition but might see service decline (see fig. 22).", "Trackage rights: This approach would require one railroad to grant access  to its tracks to another railroad, enabling railroads to interchange traffic  beyond terminal facilities for a fee. In the past, STB has imposed  conditions requiring that a merging railroad must grant another railroad  trackage rights to preserve competition when a merger would reduce a  shipper\u2019s access to railroads from two to one. While this approach could  potentially increase rail competition and decrease rail rates, it could also  discourage owning railroads from maintaining the track or providing high- quality service, since the value of lost use of track may not be  compensated by the user fee and may decrease return on investment (see  fig. 23). \u201cBottleneck\u201d rates: This approach would require a railroad to establish a  rate, and thereby offer to provide service, for any two points on the  railroad\u2019s system where traffic originates, terminates, or can be  interchanged. Some shippers have more than one railroad that serves them  at their origin and/or destination points, but have at least one portion of a  rail movement for which no alternative rail route is available. This portion  is referred to as the \u201cbottleneck segment.\u201d STB\u2019s decision that a railroad is  not required to quote a rate for the bottleneck segment has been upheld in  federal court. STB\u2019s rationale was that statute and case law precluded it  from requiring a railroad to provide service on a portion of its route when  the railroad serves both the origin and destination points and provides a  rate for such movement. STB requires a railroad to provide service for the  bottleneck segment only if the shipper had prior arrangements or a  contract for the remaining portion of the shipment route. On the one hand,  requiring railroads to establish bottleneck rates would force short-distance  routes on railroads when they served an entire route and could result in  loss of business and potentially subject the bottleneck segment to a rate  complaint. On the other hand, this approach would give shippers access to  a second railroad, even if a single railroad was the only railroad that  served the shipper at its origin and/or destination points, and could  potentially reduce rates (see fig. 24).", "Paper barriers: This approach would prevent or, put a time limit on, paper  barriers, which are contractual agreements that can occur when a Class I  railroad either sells or leases long term some of its track to other railroads  (typically a short-line railroad and/or regional railroad). These agreements  stipulate that virtually all traffic that originates on that line must  interchange with the Class I railroad that originally leased the tracks or  pay a penalty. Since the 1980s, approximately 500 short lines have been  created by Class I railroads selling a portion of their lines; however, the  extent to which paper barriers are a standard practice is unknown because  they are part of confidential contracts. When this type of agreement exists,  it can inhibit smaller railroads that connect with or cross two or more  Class I rail systems from providing rail customers access to competitive  service. Eliminating paper barriers could affect the railroad industry\u2019s  overall capacity since Class I railroads may abandon lines instead of  selling them to smaller railroads and thereby increase the cost of entering  a market for a would-be competitor. In addition, an official from a railroad  association told us that it is unclear if a federal agency could invalidate  privately negotiated contracts (see fig. 25).", "It will be important for policymakers, in evaluating these alternative  approaches, to carefully consider the impact of each approach on the  balance set out in the Staggers Rail Act. One significant consideration is  the revenue adequacy of the railroads. The Staggers Rail Act established  revenue adequacy as a goal for the industry and allowed the railroads to  use differential pricing to increase their revenues. While the specific  method for determining revenue adequacy has been controversial, the  overall trend in revenue adequacy may be more important. In its last  report for 2004, STB determined that one railroad is revenue adequate and  that others are approaching revenue adequacy. It is too early to determine  that the industry as a whole is achieving revenue adequacy. Nevertheless,  this improvement in the railroads\u2019 financial condition represents a  significant shift in the rail industry because for decades after the  enactment of the Staggers Rail Act, the railroads were all considered  revenue inadequate. The railroads need sufficient revenue for  infrastructure investment to keep pace with increased demand. However,  each of these changes could decrease the amount of revenue the railroads  receive. Yet, as the railroad\u2019s revenue adequacy improves, the question  arises as to what degree the railroads should continue to rely, for their  investment needs, on obtaining significantly higher prices from those with  greater reliance on rail transportation.", "To prevent problems with unreasonable rates, some shipper groups  propose targeted approaches that would provide them with more  competitive options. A number of different approaches have also been  suggested to make the rate relief process less expensive, more  expeditious, and therefore potentially more accessible. Each of the  proposed approaches has both advantages and drawbacks. These  approaches include the following:  Increase the use of simplified guidelines: The simplified guidelines use  standard industry average figures for revenue data instead of requiring the  shipper to create a hypothetical railroad. This approach would reduce the  time and complexity of the process; however, it may not provide such an  accurate and precise a measure as the standard process. Both shippers  and railroad officials with whom we spoke agree that it is confusing to  determine who is eligible to use the process and how it would work. STB  recently issued a proposed rule making to pursue changes to the simplified  guidelines to provide captive shippers greater access to regulatory  remedies for unreasonable rail rates.", "Increase the use of arbitration: Under arbitration, two parties present  their case before an arbitrator, who determines the rate. This process  replaces the shipper\u2019s requirement to create a hypothetical railroad.  Proponents of arbitration argue that the threat of arbitration can induce  railroads and shippers to resolve their own problems and limit the need  for federal regulation. In addition, the process is quicker and cheaper than  the standard rate relief process. For example, Canada offers an arbitration  process known as Final Offer Arbitration (FOA), under which both parties  submit their best and final offers, and the arbitrator considers the  argument from both sides and picks one rate offer from either the railroad  or the shipper. FOA is quicker\u2014statutorily, once the process begins it has  to be completed within 60 days, or 30 days for disputes involving freight  charges of less than $750,000, unless the parties agree to a different time  frame. In addition, FOA is cheaper\u2014estimates ranged up to $1 million  Canadian dollars, for both parties. On the other hand, the decisions are  good for only 1 year, so the process could in theory be revisited annually.  Critics of this approach suggest that arbitration decisions may not be  based on economic principles, such as the revenue and cost structure of  the railroad, and arbitrators may not be knowledgeable about the railroad  industry. Furthermore, opinions differ significantly about which types of  disputes should be covered and what standards (if any) should apply.", "Develop an alternative cost methodology: STB could develop an  alternative to the cost methodology used under the standard process in  which a shipper must demonstrate how much an optimally efficient  railroad would need to charge a shipper by constructing a hypothetical,  perfectly efficient railroad that would replace its current carrier. For  example, STB could use a long-run incremental cost approach to evaluate  and decide rate cases. This process, which is used by the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission for regulating rates charged by pipeline  companies, bases rates on the actual incremental cost of moving a  particular shipment, plus a reasonable rate of return. This approach allows  for a quick, standard method for setting prices, but does not take into  account the need for differential pricing or the railroad\u2019s need to charge  higher rates in order to become revenue adequate.

The Freight Analysis Framework (FAF) is a  comprehensive database and policy analysis tool maintained by DOT to  help identify needed freight capacity improvements. In 2002, DOT  projected, using this tool, that overall domestic and international freight  demand would increase by more than 65 percent and 84 percent,  respectively, by 2020. In 2003, the American Association of State Highway  and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) released the Freight Rail Bottom  Line Report, prepared by a consulting firm. This report describes the  industry and its benefits to the nation, estimates the industry\u2019s investment  needs and capacity to meet these needs, and quantifies the consequences  of underinvestment, including highway deterioration and congestion. The  AASHTO study projected that, by 2020, overall domestic freight demand by  ton would increase by 57 percent and international demand would  increase by 99 percent. In 2005, the American Trucking Association\u2019s  (ATA) report U.S. Freight Transportation Forecast to 2016 projected  tonnage and revenues for all freight modes. The report predicted that  overall freight volume would increase by about 32 percent between 2004  and 2016.", "Freight rail demand is projected to increase less than overall freight  demand and to grow at a slower rate than demand for other modes\u2014such  as truck and air freight. FAF projects that freight rail tonnage will grow  about 55 percent by 2020, but this growth will not be as dramatic as for  truck and air, and will account for a much smaller share of the market  when measured on the basis of shipment value. AASHTO predicts that  freight rail tonnage will increase 44 percent by 2020. However, it notes that  this forecast actually indicates that rail will lose some market share. This  estimate also assumes that considerable investment will be required\u2014up  to about $4 billion annually\u2014to meet future demand. According to ATA\u2019s  forecast, freight rail tonnage will grow annually by 2.4 percent to 2010 and  by 2.1 percent to 2016.

Freight markets are volatile and unpredictable, and thus freight demand  forecasts may prove to be off the mark. Similarly, much freight traffic is  determined by trade that originates outside the United States. Moreover,  since the data and models used to develop these freight demand forecasts  are largely proprietary, we could not assess the validity or  reasonableness of the assumptions used to develop the predictions.  Nevertheless, forecasts of freight and freight rail demand are useful as one  plausible scenario for the future.

Railroads do not prepare long- term capacity plans because of concern about the potential for significant  economic changes\u2014for example, officials at one Class I railroad stated  that they prepare capacity improvements plans and demand projections  for 3 to 5 years into the future, with frequent revisions. In addition, the  railroads we interviewed were generally unwilling to discuss their future  investment plans with us in any detail because this is business proprietary  information. It is therefore difficult to comment on how railroads are  likely to choose among their competing investment priorities for the future  compared with various demand scenarios.", "Railroads\u2019 ability and willingness to invest in new capacity to meet  demand reflects a number of key considerations. For privately owned rail  companies, a key business consideration is maximizing returns for  shareholders. To do so, realizing the greatest return on investment from  each investment decision is essential and is reinforced by pressure from  shareholders. Rail investment involves private companies taking a  substantial risk which becomes a fixed cost on their balance sheets, one  on which they are accountable to stockholders and for which they must  make capital charges year in and year out for the life of the investment. A  railroad contemplating such an investment must be confident that the  market demand for that infrastructure will hold up for 30 to 50 years. This  is in sharp contrast to other modes such as highway infrastructure, which  is paid for largely by public funds. Maximizing a rail company\u2019s  competitive position in key markets is important in deciding on  investments in the company network\u2019s size and facilities. For example, the  growth of intermodal transport is a major development for freight rail  because it stands to be the largest revenue generator for the Class I  railroads. As a result, there is intense competition for this business,  although intermodal business also means that freight rail both competes  and cooperates with other freight modes. However, intermodal growth  depends on the railroads\u2019 ability to invest in the new capacity needed to  meet this demand.", "Investment considerations are complicated by the current status of rail  infrastructure. Although the rail network has been downsized, the  infrastructure remains extensive but aging. Replacing, maintaining, and  upgrading this infrastructure is extremely costly, as the Transportation  Research Board emphasized in its analysis of critical transportation  issues. Predicting the extent to which future rail investments will keep  pace with projected freight rail demand is complicated by the extent of  current rail needs. For example, an annual assessment of America\u2019s  infrastructure conducted by the American Society of Civil Engineering  gave rail infrastructure a \u201cC-\u201d grade and noted that, for the first time in 90  years, limited capacity has created significant bottlenecks in the national  rail network. However, railroads must invest in new infrastructure, new  equipment, and substantial new capacity to handle additional traffic in  order to remain viable and effective, a rail industry representative told our  expert panel.", "Today, freight railroads are sufficiently profitable to be investing at record  levels. Major freight railroads have reported that they expect to invest  about $8 billion in infrastructure during 2006\u2014a 21 percent increase over  2005\u2014and have told us that they plan to continue making infrastructure  investments. However, not all of this investment is planned for capital or  new capacity. Although we requested additional detail about how the rail  industry\u2019s $8 billion estimated investment was divided between new  capacity and maintenance or renewal of existing capacity, the Association  of American Railroads indicated that this information is not currently  available but will be part of a special study on railroad spending trends."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Rail Capacity Investments Can Produce Private and Public Sector Benefits", "paragraphs": ["While private rail networks obtain benefits and improve their profitability  from investments in their capacity, these investments also can benefit the  public.

For example, shifting truck freight traffic to railroads can reduce  highway congestion for passenger and commercial vehicles, potentially  reducing or avoiding public expenditures that otherwise would be needed  to build additional highway capacity or provide additional maintenance to  accommodate growing truck traffic. Depending on the rail infrastructure  project, the public could realize several types of benefits, as described in  table 3.", "Rail projects can vary widely in the extent to which they may generate  public as well as private benefits; whether benefits are realized by the  private or public sector at the national, state, and local levels; and how the  benefits are quantified for the purpose of fairly apportioning project  financing. Determining what benefits and costs are associated with a rail  infrastructure project and who benefits is important in deciding whether  public funds for public benefits are justified\u2014but this is a difficult  determination. For example, one rail infrastructure project that reduces  system bottlenecks may generate benefits to the national economy by  lowering the costs of producing and distributing goods. Another rail  project that eliminates or improves highway-rail crossings may primarily  produce local benefits by reducing accidents, time lost waiting for trains  to pass, pollution and noise from idling trains, and delays of emergency  vehicles at crossings.

These projects\u2014totaling $134  million\u2014were expected to provide economic benefits and reduce rail  transit time through the city by about 2 hours. The project also used an  innovative institutional arrangement that created a special type of  corporation to facilitate its funding. Colorado\u2019s Department of  Transportation (CDOT), other public entities, and two Class I railroads are  exploring an ambitious partnership to relocate freight train facilities away  from the heavily populated Front Range area of the state, as the two  railroads proposed. CDOT initiated a benefit-cost study that found  sufficient public transportation, economic development, land use, safety,  environmental, and passenger rail facilitation benefits to warrant investing  public dollars in the project\u2014estimated to cost about $1.17 billion.", "The federal government also has been involved in freight rail projects. In  1997, DOT provided a $400 million loan for the $2.4 billion Alameda  Corridor project to leverage funds from ports, railroads, and local  governments. As a result, a 20-mile trench for trains was constructed to  eliminate numerous rail-highway crossings and reduce rail transport time  to and from the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach\u2014a significant  gateway for freight imported from Asia and distributed throughout the  United States. In 2005, Congress provided $100 million to the $1.5 billion  Chicago Region Environmental and Transportation Efficiency (CREATE)  program.

Railroads and state and local governments are  contributing to the program\u2019s financing.

One proposal calls for the creation of a Railroad  Trust Fund that would be similar to the Highway Trust Fund, which is  used to pay for highway construction and improvements.

We have concluded that the impending federal fiscal crisis  will require a fundamental reexamination of all federal programs.

As the AASHTO  study emphasized, investments at the freight system level are needed to  respond to nationally significant corridor choke points, intermodal  connections, and urban rail interchanges.", "With federal fiscal constraints as the backdrop, two major policy  principles will need to be considered as DOT continues to develop this  national policy. These principles are, first, to adopt a mode-neutral  approach\u2014one that takes a consistent policy and funding approach to all  modes and establishes a level playing field for competition in the freight  marketplace\u2014and, second, to maximize public benefits\u2014particularly  benefits to the national transportation system\u2014from public transportation  investments."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Adopting a Mode-Neutral Approach", "paragraphs": ["Under a mode-neutral approach, each mode would pay the full costs for  the infrastructure facilities and services that it used as well as the costs  that its use imposed on others\u2014such as added air pollution, congestion,  and accident risks\u2014through taxes and user fees. No single mode would  be at a competitive disadvantage. A mode-neutral federal freight policy  and investment strategy would be consistent with the competitive  market\u2019s central role in the freight system. Encouraging a market-based  approach and competition that fosters economic efficiency and innovation  is a key consideration in dealing with the privately owned freight rail  industry, as we have reported.", "Currently, as we have pointed out, federal programs treat different freight  modes differently. For example, trucks and barges use infrastructure that  is owned and maintained by the government, while rail companies use  infrastructure that they pay to own and maintain. The trucking and barge  industries pay fees and taxes to use this government-funded infrastructure,  but their payments generally do not cover the costs they impose on  highways and waterways, thereby giving the trucking and barge industries  a competitive price advantage over railroads. The most recent Federal  Highway Administration (FHWA) highway cost allocation study evaluates  highway costs attributable to different vehicle classes and the extent to  which their user fees cover their responsibility for highway costs.  According to the study, combination unit trucks paid 80 percent of their  cost responsibility and the heaviest combinations paid half of their cost  responsibility. The study concluded that only the very lightest combination  trucks pay their share of federal highway cost responsibility. A recent CBO  report also concluded that trucks and barges do not pay their full share of  highway costs and reported that rail may be at a competitive disadvantage,  since other modes are effectively being subsidized. CBO also observed  that if all modes do not pay their full costs, the result is inefficient use of  roads and waterways and greater government spending than otherwise  would be necessary if capacity investments are made in anticipation of  demand that does not occur."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Maximizing Public Benefits from Public Transportation Investments", "paragraphs": ["As DOT develops and applies a national freight policy, our second critical  principle will be an important consideration\u2014public investments should  depend on clearly defined public benefits.

Because this analysis identifies the greatest net benefits by  comparing the monetary value of each project\u2019s benefits and costs, it can  help public and private stakeholders evaluate project alternatives.", "States have had experience in evaluating whether rail projects could yield  sufficient public benefits to warrant investments of public dollars in the  projects, and their experience can inform a national freight policy.

The board\u2019s  project scoring criteria reflect anticipated benefits, such as freight mobility  for the project area; freight mobility for the region, state, and nation;  general mobility; safety; freight and economic value; environment; project  partnership; consistency with regional and state plans; location on a  Strategic Freight Corridor; and cost benefit.", "However, federal decision makers have no such criteria to use in  considering potential freight rail investments. As we have pointed out, the  federal funding structure for surface transportation and federal program  incentives tend to focus decision makers\u2019 attention on highway and transit  projects, rather than on freight or freight rail concerns. And, although state  and local transportation decision makers consider benefit-cost analyses,  these analyses often do not have a decisive impact on investment  decisions. As DOT has noted, a fair, balanced approach to allocating  public and private funding is a prerequisite for public-private  partnerships. We have also raised concerns about federal tax policies.

On the other hand, the act recognized the need for a  remnant regulatory regime that would maintain reasonable rates and  prohibit undue concentrations of market power in areas where no  effective competition existed. The act recognized that it was vital for the  federal government to promote competition and rely on it to set rates.  Without a doubt, rates have decreased for most shippers, and most  shippers are better off in the post-Staggers environment than they were  previously. This outcome suggests that widespread and fundamental  changes to the relationship between the railroads and their customers are  not needed. Nevertheless, the evidence also suggests some basis for  believing that\u2014more than 25 years after the act\u2019s passage\u2014the balance it  envisioned has not been fully achieved.", "The continued existence of pockets of potential captivity, together with  the increase in traffic at higher thresholds, at a time when the railroads  are, for the first time in decades, experiencing increasing economic health,  raises the question whether rail rates in selected markets reflect justified  and reasonable pricing practices, or an abuse of market power by the  railroads. Answering this question requires a rigorous, national analysis of  competitive markets. Our analysis provides an important first step;  however, we are constrained by the inherent limitations of the Carload  Waybill Sample and the available proxy measures for assessing captivity.  In contrast, STB has the statutory authority to inquire into and report on  railroad practices and could conduct a rigorous analysis of competition in  the freight rail industry that would rely on more than sample data and  could determine whether the inappropriate exercise of market power is  occuring in specific markets.

For example, STB could consider initiating a generally  applicable rule making to address competition issues or prescribe specific  remedies in response to a complaint.", "In assessing competition within the freight rail industry, STB needs  accurate data on railroad revenues. The data that STB currently collects\u2014 in particular, the use of the Carload Waybill Sample to report on the  railroads\u2019 finances\u2014are not always captured consistently, making it  difficult to accurately track railroad revenues.

STB generally agreed with our  assessment of the improving financial health of the freight railroad  industry and potential public benefits for freight rail infrastructure  projects. However, STB disagreed with our recommendation to undertake  a rigorous analysis of competitive markets in the rail industry because it  believed the findings underlying the recommendation were inconclusive,  their on-going efforts will address many of our concerns, and a rigorous  analysis would divert resources from other efforts. Specifically, STB stated  that our recommendation was based on two findings\u2014first, that rail rates  have increased for some shippers and, second, that the amount of traffic  with rates reflecting high R/VC ratios has increased in some areas. STB  stated that recent increases in rail rates are not surprising and that R/VC  ratios can increase when rates and costs are falling and that these findings  do not suggest market abuses. STB also noted that it has several rule  makings under way related to the standard rate relief process and the  simplified rate relief process. STB suggested that, given the limitations on  its resources and the aggressive agenda already under way, rather than  undertake this competitive markets analysis, a more practical approach  would be for STB to finish its reforms to ensure that captive shippers have  an effective forum to seek rate relief if a railroad is charging unreasonable  rates. Concerning our recommendation that STB review its method of data  collection to ensure that all freight railroads are consistently and  accurately reporting all revenues collected from shippers, STB stated that  the revenue in question represents a small portion of all revenues and that  revenue data submitted by freight railroads are audited and otherwise  checked to ensure quality. Furthermore, STB has initiated a rule making to  improve the tracking of fuel surcharges.", "While STB\u2019s efforts have been helpful, we continue to believe that STB  should undertake a rigorous analysis of competitive markets to identify  the state of competition nationwide; in specific markets, determine  whether the inappropriate exercise of market power is occuring; and,  where appropriate, consider the range of actions available to address  problems associated with the potential abuse of market power. STB\u2019s  comments do not accurately characterize the underlying support for our  recommendation. We did not base this recommendation on an increase in  rail rates or suggest that rate increases alone suggest increased captivity.  On the contrary, we recognize that rates have declined and that available  measures suggest that the extent of captivity has dropped. Furthermore,  STB\u2019s response suggests that rail rates and the amount of traffic with high  R/VC ratios were the only data we examined\u2014they were not. We  examined several factors, including data on the amount of tonnage  originating in economic areas that have access to only one Class I railroad,  data on the amount of tonnage traveling over 300 percent R/VC, and the  amount of tonnage that originates in areas with access to only one Class I  railroad and travels at rates that exceed the statutory threshold for rate  relief. Our report explicitly acknowledges the limitations in the Carload  Waybill Sample and of the proxy measures available for weighing  captivity, including R/VC levels. At the same time, our analyses, when  combined with comments from participants on our expert panel and  interviews with shipper and railroad groups, suggest a reasonable  possibility that shippers in selective markets may be paying excessive  rates related to a lack of competition. This provides the impetus for STB\u2014 which has the statutory authority to inquire into and report on railroad  practices\u2014to analyze competitive markets in the rail industry and, where  appropriate, consider the range of actions to address problems associated  with the potential abuse of market power. Also, this analysis would rely on  more than sample data and could analyze the exercise of market power in  specific markets.", "Regarding STB\u2019s position that it has several rule makings under way that  address many of our concerns, we commend STB for recognizing and  taking action to address problems with the rate relief process, but we  believe action is needed beyond improvements to the rate relief process.  These rule makings, if implemented, are designed to improve the  processes available to shippers, after shippers have been charged a rate  that they consider to be unreasonable. In contrast, we believe that an  analysis of the state of competition and the possible abuse of market  power, along with the range of options STB has to address competition  issues, could more directly further legislatively defined goals to ensure  effective competition among rail carriers as the preferred means to both  promoting a sound rail transportation system and maintaining reasonable  rates. Regarding STB\u2019s assertion that conducting a rigorous analysis of  competition would divert resources away from its on-going initiatives, we  modified our draft to recommend that STB request additional resources  from Congress if it determines it needs more resources to conduct an  analysis of competition. We also believe that STB should review its  method of data collection to ensure that all freight railroads are  consistently and accurately reporting all revenues. STB commented that it  had already responded to this concern by proposing a standardized report  for fuel surcharges; however, while we commend STB for its efforts to  capture these data, we also note STB has not yet implemented  standardized reporting of fuel surcharges and that other revenues besides  fuel surcharges may not be included in the Waybill.

The Carload Waybill Sample is a sample of  railroad waybills (in general, documents prepared from bills of lading  authorizing railroads to move shipments and collect freight charges)  submitted by railroads annually. We used these data to obtain information  on rail rates across the industry, for certain commodities and for certain  routes by shipment size and length of haul.

A rate index attempts to measure price changes over time by holding  constant the underlying collection of items that are consumed (in the  context of this report, items shipped). This approach differs from  comparing average rates in each year because, over time, higher- or lower- priced items can constitute different shares of the items consumed.  Comparing average rates can confuse changes in prices with changes in  the composition of the goods consumed. In the context of railroad  transportation, rail rates and revenues per ton-mile are influenced, among  other things, by the average length of haul. Therefore, comparisons of  average rates over time can be influenced by changes in the mix of long-  and short-haul traffic. Our rate indexes attempted to control for the  distance factor by defining the underlying traffic as 2004 commodity flows  between pairs of census regions. To examine the rate trends on specific  traffic corridors, we first chose a level of geographic aggregation for  corridor end points. We defined end points as the regional economic areas  defined by the Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Economic Analysis.  An economic area is a collection of counties in and about a metropolitan  area (or other center of economic activity); there are 179 economic areas  in the United States, and each of the nation\u2019s 3,141 counties is included in  an economic area. We placed each corridor in one of three distance- related categories: 0 to 500 miles, 501 to 1,000 miles, and more than 1,000  miles. Although these distance categories are somewhat arbitrary, they  represent reasonable proxies for short-, medium-, and long-distance  shipments by rail.", "To determine the areas with access to one or more Class I railroads, we  obtained railroad systems data from the Department of Transportation,  which accounted for trackage rights, mergers, and other industry  developments affecting access. For issues related to revenue-to-variable  cost ratios, we used data from the Carload Waybill Sample to identify the  specific revenues and variable costs and to compute R/VC ratios for the  commodities and markets we examined. Using this information, we then  identified those commodities and areas whose R/VC ratios were above or  below the 180 percent R/VC level, as well as those areas above the 300  percent R/VC level.", "To identify the actions STB has taken to address competition and captivity  concerns, we interviewed officials and reviewed information from all  seven North American Class I railroads, several shipper groups and  associations and STB officials; and we met with experts in the railroad  industry. We reviewed characteristics of STB\u2019s current rate relief process,  as well as changes STB has made to the process, and conducted a  comprehensive analysis of STB cases since 2000. We also held an expert  panel through the National Academy of Sciences, consisting of 11  individuals with expertise in the freight railroad industry and the  economics of transportation deregulation. Moreover, we conducted a legal  analysis of current statutes related to STB\u2019s authority. To discern potential  alternatives, we reviewed pending legislation, testimonies before  Congress, previous GAO reports, STB decisions, rule makings, and  proposed rule makings, and conducted a summary analysis of interviews.", "To assess future freight demand and the freight railroad industry\u2019s ability  to meet such demand, we reviewed transportation planning literature and  forecasts of future freight rail demand and capacity in the United States.  This review also included state freight plans and major freight rail  projects. We synthesized information on freight and freight rail, as well as  various forecasts to identify similar and dissimilar themes. We also  reviewed involvement by the federal government in freight railroad  projects, including related legislation and funding decisions. We  interviewed several state and federal transportation officials to gather  further information on public-private partnerships, freight railroad  projects, and DOT\u2019s draft National Freight Policy. We also interviewed  freight railroad representatives, financial market analysts, national  association representatives, and transportation experts. For selected  public-private partnerships, we analyzed the genesis of such projects,  motivations for involvement from the public and private sectors, and  benefit-cost analyses that were conducted to support project funding  decisions.", "We determined that the data used in this report were sufficiently reliable  for the purpose of our review. We conducted our review from June 2005 to  August 2006 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Surface Transportation Board", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the Surface Transportation Board\u2019s  letter dated September 15, 2006."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1.  STB commented that we conducted a national study into the state of  competition. We did not conduct such a study. Our study included a  broad focus on changes in the freight railroad industry since the  Staggers Rail Act, the actions STB has taken to address concerns about  competition and captivity, and future freight demand and capacity. The  data we collected and analysis we performed\u2014such as a review of rate  changes over 20 years\u2014were too broad to represent a national study  of the state of competition. It is the limitations in the scope of our  analysis of competition, along with limitations in the data available to  us and a reasonable possibility that shippers in selected markets may  be paying excessive rates, which led us to recommend that STB  conduct a more rigorous analysis of competition.  2.  STB commented that it has already addressed our recommendation to  improve data collection by proposing standardized monthly reports of  fuel surcharges and also described its efforts to ensure the accuracy  and reliability of data in the Waybill. We commend STB for its recent  action on fuel surcharges, which occurred during our review, but we  also note STB has not yet implemented standardized reporting of fuel  surcharges. In addition, other revenues besides fuel surcharges may  not be included in the Waybill. Specifically, revenues generated  through railcar auctions and congestion fees may not be included.  While the reported miscellaneous revenue is a small percentage of all  revenue, it is not known how much miscellaneous revenue is not  reported. Complete data would provide for more accurate tracking of  railroad revenues and would help STB to obtain a clearer picture of  actual fees paid by shippers. While we commend STB for its actions to  audit and review Waybill data, these accuracy checks do not address  our concern that STB is not collecting the full range of revenue data.  3.  STB commented that our recommendation for STB to conduct an  analysis of competition is based on two findings\u2014that rail rates have  increased since 1980 and that the amount of traffic with high R/VC  ratios has increased in some areas. Our recommendation is not based  on these two findings, but on an analysis of multiple sources, such as  data on the amount of tonnage originating in economic areas that have  access to only one Class I railroad, data on the amount of tonnage  traveling over 300 percent R/VC, and the amount of tonnage that  originates in areas with access to only one Class I railroad and travels  at rates that exceed the statutory threshold for rate relief. This analysis  provides an important first step in assessing competitive markets  nationally; but it is imperfect, given the limitations of measures used to  weigh captivity and limitations in the Carload Waybill Sample. The  results of our analysis, when combined with comments from  participants on our expert panel and interviews with shipper and  railroad groups, suggest a reasonable possibility that shippers in  selective markets may be paying excessive rates related to a lack of  competition in these markets. It is precisely the inconclusiveness of  the available data\u2014and STB\u2019s authority and responsibility to monitor  and ensure effective competition in the freight rail industry\u2014that led  us to recommend a rigorous analysis of competition by STB. Also, we  examined rates since 1985, not 1980.  4.  STB commented that an increase in rates does not suggest market  abuses and that the rate changes in our report were not adjusted for  inflation. We agree that a change in a rate does not necessarily suggest  the exercise of market power. While our rates were not adjusted for  inflation, we constructed rate indexes, which account for changes in  traffic patterns over time that could affect revenue statistics. We also  included the price index for the GDP to provide a measure for  inflation. However, our recommendation is not based on recent rate  increases. Our recommendation is based on our analyses of multiple  sources, such as data on the amount of tonnage originating in  economic areas that have access to only one Class I railroad, data on  the amount of tonnage traveling over 300 percent R/VC, and the  amount of tonnage that originates in areas with access to only one  Class I railroad and travels at rates that exceed the statutory threshold  for rate relief.  5.  STB commented that figure 19 shows an increase in grain traffic which  traveled at rates above 300 percent R/VC and figure 9 shows that grain  rates per ton-mile had fallen along that same route, so the change in  R/VC must be due to a drop in costs per ton-mile. We disagree that the  change in R/VC in figure 19 must be due to a drop in costs per ton-mile.  Figure 19 shows only the amount of traffic on the route that traveled at  rates above 300 percent R/VC, while figure 9 shows the cents per ton- mile for all traffic along that route (not just traffic that traveled at rates  above 300 percent R/VC). Therefore, the decrease in cents per ton mile  shown in figure 9 may reflect a decrease in rates for traffic along that  route that traveled at rates below 300 percent R/VC.  6.  STB commented that the measures used in our analysis are not  conclusive. The fact that our analysis is inherently limited by available  data and proxy measures lends more weight to our recommendation.", "Specifically, our analysis provides an important first step in assessing  competitive markets nationally, but it is imperfect given the limitations  of measures used to weigh captivity and limitations in the Carload  Waybill Sample. We do not conclusively state that there are shippers  who are captive to one railroad and paying rates that reflect an abuse  of market power. However, the results of our analysis, when combined  with comments from participants on our expert panel and interviews  with shipper and railroad groups, suggest a reasonable possibility that  shippers in selective markets may be paying excessive rates related to  a lack of competition in these markets. We believe that STB is the  agency that has the authority and responsibility to conduct an inquiry  into the potential abuse of market power and utilize its range of  options to address competition issues.  7.  STB commented that R/VC levels do not provide a reliable measure of  changes in captivity because they can increase when rates are falling.  We agree that an analysis of R/VC levels is not a conclusive measure of  the use of market power. However, the use of R/VC as an indicator of  railroad pricing power is well-documented both by Congress in the  Staggers Rail Act and by STB, which uses R/VC levels in its process for  determining unreasonable rates. While we acknowledge the limitations  of the ratio in our report, and even include an example like the one  cited above, we believe that R/VC ratios can be used as one of several  proxy measure to determine potential captivity. In fact, STB refers to  traffic traveling at or above 180 percent R/VC as \u201cpotentially captive.\u201d  8.  STB commented that they have several important rule makings under  way which bear directly on our concerns, including changes to the  standard and simplified rate relief processes. While we commend STB  for taking action to improve its rate relief processes, we note that  these rule makings are designed to make changes to the standard and  simplified rate relief processes and are not designed to analyze the  state of competition or the possible abuse of market power. In  contrast, we believe that an analysis of the state of competition or the  possible abuse of market power, along with the range of options STB  has to address competition issues, could more directly further  legislatively defined goals to ensure effective competition among rail  carriers as the preferred means to both promoting a sound rail  transportation system and maintaining reasonable rates.  9.  STB commented that it is hesitant to divert resources away from its  pending initiatives to respond to our recommendation. We have  modified our draft to recommend that, if STB determined that it needs  more resources to undertake a rigorous analysis of competitive  markets to identify the state of competition nationwide, it should  request additional resources from Congress.  10. STB commented that, as a small agency, a more practical approach to  addressing concerns about captive shippers would be for STB to  continue reforming its rate complaint procedures, rather than conduct  another analysis. While we commend STB for continuing its efforts to  improve its standard and simplified rate relief processes, these rule  makings will not address our concerns. Specifically, these rule  makings are designed to improve processes available to shippers after  they have been charged a rate they consider to be unreasonable; these  rule makings are not designed to analyze the state of competition or  the possible abuse of market power. In contrast, we believe that an  analysis of the state of competition or the possible abuse of market  power, along with the range of options STB has to address competition  issues, could more directly further legislatively defined goals to ensure  effective competition among rail carriers as the preferred means to  both promoting a sound rail transportation system and maintaining  reasonable rates. We believe that STB is the agency that is uniquely  positioned to inquire into and report on railroad practices and could  conduct an analysis of competition that would rely on more than  sample data and could determine whether the inappropriate exercise  of market power is occuring in specific markets. STB has the authority  to subpoena witnesses and records. Following its inquiry, STB could  also consider initiating a generally applicable rule making to address  competition issues or prescribe specific remedies in response to a  complaint. We recognize that STB has limited resources, and we have  modified our draft to recommend that, if STB determines that it needs  more resources to conduct an analysis of competition, it should  request additional resources from Congress."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to those named above, individuals making key contributions to  this report include Ashley Alley, Steve Brown, Matthew T.
