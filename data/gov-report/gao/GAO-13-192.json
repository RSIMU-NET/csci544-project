This report examines the condition and status of (1) nonmortgage-related TARP programs and (2) TARP-funded mortgage programs and Treasury's efforts to better ensure that servicers are implementing as intended two new requirements designed to improve interactions with borrowers (the MHA single point of contact and resolution of escalated cases requirements).

Treasury allocated $45.6 billion in TARP funds to three programs, including Making Home Affordable (MHA), but more than $40 billion of the funding has not yet been disbursed, and the programs have not reached the expected number of borrowers. The centerpiece of MHA is the Home Affordable Modification Program, which has provided about 1.1 million permanent modifications to borrowers. To help ensure that homeowners receive appropriate assistance from servicers under this and other MHA programs, since September 2011 Treasury has required servicers to identify a \"relationship manager\" to serve as the homeowner's single point of contact throughout a delinquency or imminent default resolution process. GAO found that Treasury's initial reviews of servicers' implementation of this requirement had identified some inconsistencies. However, oversight of a second requirement designed to improve the resolution of borrower inquiries and disputes (escalated cases) showed that the nine largest servicers had met the performance target. Treasury officials said that the MHA program administrator, Fannie Mae, handled oversight of the escalation process and the vendors who supported in keeping with Treasury's guidelines."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA) initially  authorized $700 billion to assist financial institutions and markets,  businesses, homeowners, and consumers through the Troubled Asset  Relief Program (TARP).

The crisis restricted access to credit and made the  financing on which businesses and individuals depended increasingly  difficult to obtain. Further tightening of credit exacerbated a global  economic slowdown. During the crisis, Congress, the President, federal  regulators, and others undertook a number of steps to facilitate financial  intermediation by banks and the securities markets. In addition to  Treasury\u2019s efforts, policy interventions were led by the Board of  Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve) and the  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. While the banking crisis in the  United States no longer presents the same level of systemic concerns as  it did in 2008, the financial system continues to face vulnerabilities,  including lagging investor confidence, financial concerns about European  banks and countries, and generally weak economic growth globally."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "TARP Programs and Implementation", "paragraphs": ["The passage of EESA resulted in a variety of programs supported with  TARP funding.

For example, we previously reported that deciding to unwind  some of its assistance to General Motors (GM) by participating in an initial  public offering (IPO) presented Treasury with a conflict between  maximizing taxpayer returns and exiting as soon as practicable. Holding  its shares longer could have meant realizing greater gains for the  taxpayer but only if the stock appreciated in value. By participating in  GM\u2019s November 2010 IPO, Treasury tried to fulfill both goals, selling  almost half of its shares at an early opportunity. Treasury officials stated  that although they strove to balance these competing goals, they had no  strict formula for doing so. Rather, they ultimately relied on the best  available information in deciding when to start exiting this program.", "Moreover, in some cases Treasury\u2019s ability to exercise control over the  timing of its exit from TARP programs is limited. For example, Treasury  has limited control over its exit from the Public-Private Investment  Program (PPIP), because the program\u2019s exit depends on when each  public-private investment fund (PPIF) decides to sell its investments.  Treasury continues to face this tension in its goals with a number of  TARP programs. Figure 1 provides an overview of key dates for TARP  implementation and the unwinding of some programs.

As we have reported, Treasury  disbursed $204.9 billion to 707 financial institutions nationwide from  October 2008 through December 2009. As of September 30, 2012,  Treasury had received $219.5 billion in repayments and income from its  CPP investments, exceeding the amount originally disbursed by $14.6  billion (see fig. 2). The repayment and income amount included $193.2  billion in repayments of original CPP investments, as well as $11.8 billion  in dividends, interest, and fees; $7.7 billion in warrant income; and $6.9  billion in net proceeds in excess of costs. After accounting for write-offs  and realized losses on sales totaling $3.0 billion, CPP had $8.7 billion in  outstanding investments as of September 30, 2012. Treasury estimates  lifetime income of $14.9 billion for CPP as of September 30, 2012.", "Over half (417) of the 707 institutions that originally participated in CPP  had exited the program as of September 30, 2012. Of the 417  institutions that have exited CPP, about 42 percent, or 175 institutions,  exited by repaying their investments. Another 40 percent, or 165  institutions, exited CPP by exchanging their securities under other federal  programs: 28 through TARP\u2019s Community Development Capital Initiative  (CDCI) and 137 through the non-TARP Small Business Lending Fund  (SBLF) (see fig. 3). Of the remaining 18 percent of CPP recipients that  exited the program, 56 had their securities sold by Treasury, 18 went into  bankruptcy or receivership, and 3 merged with another institution.", "As of September 30, 2012, much of the $8.7 billion in outstanding  investments was concentrated in a relatively small number of institutions.  The largest single outstanding investment was $967.9 million, and the top  three outstanding investments totaled $2.3 billion\u201427 percent of the  amount outstanding. The top 25 remaining CPP investments accounted  for $5.4 billion, or 63 percent of the outstanding amount. In addition, while  290 of the original 707 institutions remained in CPP, their $8.7 billion in  outstanding investments accounted for just 4 percent of what Treasury  originally disbursed.", "However, the number of institutions that have missed payments has been  rising. The cumulative number of financial institutions that had missed at  least one scheduled dividend or interest payment by the end of the month  in which the payments were due rose from 219 as of August 31, 2011, to  242 as of August 31, 2012. These 242 institutions represent over one- third of the 707 institutions that participated in CPP and account for a  cumulative total of 1,631 missed payments. As of August 31, 2012, 208  institutions had missed three or more payments and 142 had missed six  or more. The total amount of missed dividend and interest payments was  $376 million, although some of these payments were later made prior to  the end of the reporting month. On a quarterly basis, the number of  institutions missing dividend or interest payments due on their CPP  investments increased steadily from 8 in February 2009 to 150 in August  2012, or about half of the institutions still in the program (see fig. 4). This  increase occurred despite the reduced program participation, so the  proportion of those missing scheduled payments has risen accordingly.", "The number of institutions missing payments has stabilized in recent  quarters, but most of the institutions with missed payments had missed  them repeatedly. In particular, 133 of the 150 institutions that missed  payments in August 2012 had also missed payments in each of the  previous three quarters. Moreover, these 150 institutions had missed an  average of 7.3 additional previous payments, while 4 had never missed a  previous payment. Institutions can elect whether to pay dividends and  may choose not to pay for a variety of reasons, including decisions that  they or their federal and state regulators make to conserve cash and  maintain (or increase) capital levels. Institutions are required to pay  dividends only if they declare dividends, although unpaid cumulative  dividends generally accrue and the institution must pay them before  making payments to other types of shareholders, such as holders of  common stock.", "In May 2012, Treasury announced a strategy to wind down its remaining  investments. The strategy includes three options that the department  says will protect taxpayer interests, promote financial stability, and  preserve the strength of the nation\u2019s community banks. These options  include allowing banks to repurchase or restructure their investments or  selling Treasury-held stock through public auctions. In considering these  options, Treasury will need to balance the goals of protecting taxpayer- supported investments while expeditiously unwinding the program.  Treasury officials said that they would continue to evaluate the CPP exit  strategy, but added that they expected to continue using these options for  the foreseeable future.", "The first option allows banks, with the approval of their regulators, to  repurchase from Treasury their preferred shares in full. Treasury points  out that this strategy has been used since 2009 and is one it expects  some banks to continue to use through late 2013. Under this option,  Treasury\u2019s ability to exit the program largely depends on the ability of  institutions to repay their investments. Institutions will have to  demonstrate that they are financially strong enough to repay the CPP  investments in order to receive regulatory approval to exit the program.  Dividend rates will increase from 5 percent to 9 percent for remaining  institutions beginning in late 2013, a development that may prompt  institutions to repay their investments. If broader interest rates are low,  especially approaching the dividend reset, banks could have further  incentive to redeem their preferred shares.", "A second option allows banks to restructure their investments, usually in  connection with a merger or a plan to raise new capital. With this option,  Treasury receives cash or other securities that generally can be sold  more easily than preferred stock. Treasury officials said that, as of early  October 2012, approximately 28 restructurings had occurred. The officials  expected a limited number of restructurings to continue, but added that  because Treasury\u2019s investments were sometimes sold at a discount  during restructuring, they would approve the sales only if the terms  represented the best deal for taxpayers.", "Under the third option, Treasury may sell its preferred stock through  public auctions. Treasury conducted the first such auction of CPP  investments in March 2012 and reported that it generated strong investor  interest. As of September 30, 2012, Treasury had conducted six auctions  resulting in the sale of 40 investments with total net proceeds of about  $1.3 billion. Treasury also reported that this option can be beneficial for  community banks that do not have easy access to the capital markets,  because it could attract new, private capital to replace the temporary  TARP support. Treasury expects this option to continue to be part of its  effort to wind down CPP. Thus far, Treasury has sold investments  individually, but noted that it might combine other investments, particularly  smaller ones, into pools. Whether Treasury sells stock individually or in  pools, the outcome of this option will depend largely on investor demand  for these securities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Financial Strength of CDCI Participants Will Affect When Treasury Terminates the Program", "paragraphs": ["Treasury disbursed $570 million to its 84 CDCI participants and  completed funding the program in September 2010 (see fig. 5).

No additional funds are available through  the program, as CDCI\u2019s funding authority expired in September 2010. As  of September 2012, Treasury expects CDCI will cost approximately $200  million over its lifetime, less than half of the $570 million obligated to the  program. Officials stated that CDCI will have a lifetime cost, while CPP is  estimated to result in lifetime income, in part because CDCI provides a  lower dividend rate that increases the net financing cost to Treasury.  Also, unlike CPP, the program does not require warrants from  participating institutions that would have helped offset Treasury\u2019s costs.  As of September 30, 2012, two CDCI participants have repaid Treasury  $2.85 million, and Treasury has received $22 million in dividend  payments from CDCI participants.", "As with CPP, Treasury must continue to monitor the performance of CDCI  participants because their financial strength will affect their ability to repay  Treasury. According to Treasury officials, Treasury will continue to hold its  CDCI investments and has not made any disposition decisions about the  program. However, they said that when Treasury decides to exit the CDCI  program, it will need tools in place similar to those used by CPP  institutions to exit the CPP program. As of September 30, 2012, 5 of the  84 CDCI participants had missed at least one dividend or interest  payment, and 2 of the participants had paid accrued and unpaid  dividends after missing the initial scheduled payment date(s), according  to Treasury. While the continuing weak economy could negatively affect  distressed communities and the CDFIs that serve them, the program\u2019s  low dividend rates may help participants remain current on payments.", "When Treasury will exit CDCI is unknown, but the dividend rate that  program participants pay increases in 2018. However, Treasury officials  noted that the program was intended to be long term and said that they  believed the program was meeting its objective by providing long-term,  low-cost capital. CDCI institutions have an opportunity to keep CDCI  capital in their communities, which are usually moderate and low income,  for a longer time.

In general, GM\u2019s financial  condition has improved since the IPO, but the company continued to  address challenges with its European operations. Specifically, GM\u2019s net  income rose 43 percent\u2014from about $6.5 billion in 2010 to about $9.3  billion in 2011, with the company achieving 11 straight quarters of  profitability since its formation in July 2009.

GM officials reported this decline was largely due to increased losses in  the company\u2019s European Operations, a region where the automotive  industry as a whole struggles. The company continues to post losses in  Europe, with vehicle sales declining 7.4 percent between the first three  quarters of 2011 and the first three quarters of 2012.

In June 2012, in an  effort to de-risk its pension plans and further strengthen its balance sheet,  GM announced that it would provide certain U.S. salaried retirees with a  continued monthly payment administered and paid by The Prudential  Insurance Company of America and others with a voluntary lump-sum  payment option, which it estimated would reduce its salaried pension  obligation by about $29 billion. In November 2012 GM announced plans  for its captive financing subsidiary, GM Financial, to acquire Ally  Financial, Inc.\u2019s International Operations in 14 countries, which the  company expects to drive higher vehicle sales in China, Mexico, Europe  and Latin America.

In May 2011, we reported that GM\u2019s  share price would have to increase dramatically from current levels to an  average of more than $54 for Treasury to fully recoup its investment.  Because the December 2012 sale price of $27.50 per share is  considerably less than the breakeven level, GM\u2019s shares will now have to  increase to roughly $72 per share, or more than double the average 2012  share price, for Treasury to fully recoup its investment (see fig. 7).", "In addition to its outstanding investments in GM, Treasury remains  heavily invested in Ally Financial. According to Treasury officials, the  department continues to explore all potential options for divesting its  interest in Ally Financial, including public and private options such as a  possible IPO or selling its equity in a private transaction. However, since  we last reported on Ally Financial the company has undergone a number  of changes that could affect the timing of Treasury\u2019s exit. For instance,  on May 14, 2012, Ally Financial\u2019s mortgage subsidiary Residential  Capital, LLC, and certain of its subsidiaries, filed for Chapter 11  bankruptcy.

Over the next year (September 2011 to September 2012), it grew  to $754.2 million. If the balance of excess interest in TALF LLC exceeds  the value of any surrendered collateral, Treasury may not need to  disburse any additional funds for the program and could instead realize  lifetime income because it will receive 90 percent of funds remaining in  TALF LLC after all obligations are repaid and the program ends. Further,  the equity that borrowers hold in TALF collateral has grown since TALF  loans were first issued. As of September 30, 2012, Treasury estimated  that TALF would result in a lifetime income of approximately $517 million.  Treasury officials told us in September 2012 that they did not have any  particular concerns about the CMBS market that would have an effect on  current TALF holdings, and that prices remained strong throughout 2012.  Despite these positive trends, the officials told us that FRBNY and  Treasury staff will continue to monitor market conditions and credit rating  agency actions that could affect TALF assets. As we have previously  reported, market value fluctuations could affect future results.", "Treasury expects to exit TALF by 2015, although it does not have  complete control over its exit because its role in TALF is secondary to that  of the Federal Reserve. Treasury models loan repayments using TALF  loan terms and data provided by the Federal Reserve and projects  repayment schedules, collateral cash flows, prepayments, and  performance loss rates. Based on these analyses, Treasury expects that  the last TALF loan will be paid in 2015. No borrowers have surrendered  TALF collateral to date, and all loans are current. However, should TALF  LLC be required to purchase and manage TALF assets, Treasury could  be involved in TALF beyond 2015, as TALF assets may have maturity  dates that extend beyond the loan maturity dates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Investment Periods for PPIP Funds Have Terminated, and All PPIF Funds Have Begun Unwinding", "paragraphs": ["Treasury created PPIP, partnering with private funds, to purchase  troubled mortgage-related assets from financial institutions.

Officials also noted that the program was designed to  discourage firms from keeping their investments outstanding longer than  needed by the PPIF fund managers after the investment period expired,  at which time PPIFs would no longer have access to debt financing from  Treasury, unless permitted by provisions within the loan agreement and  approved by Treasury. Now that the investment periods have terminated,  PPIFs must pay down their Treasury loans and make distributions to their  partners as the PPIFs receive proceeds from RMBS and CMBS  payments and dispositions.

These securities comprised more than 1,000 loans  from 17 different industries, including retail, food services, manufacturing,  scientific and technical services, health care, and educational services.  Since Treasury began its purchases, the SBA 7(a) market has recovered  with new SBA 7(a) loan volumes returning to precrisis levels.", "Treasury sold its eight remaining securities in the portfolio for  approximately $63.2 million in proceeds on January 24, 2012. That sale  marked the wind down of this TARP program. In total, Treasury recovered  $376 million through sales ($334 million) and principal and interest  payments ($42 million) over the life of the SBA 7(a) Securities Purchase  Program. After considering Treasury\u2019s cost of financing, the SBA 7(a)  Securities Purchase Program resulted in an income of approximately $4  million to taxpayers on Treasury\u2019s original investment of $367 million   (see fig. 12)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Treasury\u2019s Office of Financial Stability Staffing and Use of Private Sector Contracting", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Office of Financial Stability Staffing", "paragraphs": ["As we noted in our 2012 annual TARP report, Treasury has addressed  several staffing challenges that we had previously identified, and the  overall staffing numbers, which began to decline in 2011, continued to  decrease through September 30, 2012 (see fig. 13). Treasury\u2019s Office of  Financial Stability (OFS) used employees (including term employees) and  detailees from other Treasury offices and other federal agencies to meet  its workload requirements.", "OFS\u2019s overall staffing numbers declined from 198 in 2011 to 163 in 2012,  but staffing levels within individual OFS offices have fluctuated according  to the resources needed. Many OFS staff were not replaced because  their skill sets were no longer needed; for example, many staff in the  Chief Investment Office were not replaced as the investment programs  wound down.", "According to Treasury officials, Treasury evaluates departing staff on a  case-by-case basis to determine whether a vacancy needs to be filled  and whether present staff can cover the departing staff\u2019s responsibilities,  and only one new staff person was added in 2012. In addition, OFS  officials stated that OFS had detailed some of its staff to other Treasury  programs, as Treasury had exited several programs and no longer had  assets to manage for them and many of the other TARP programs were  winding down. Treasury officials continue to anticipate that staffing levels  in OFS offices will decrease over time, and some staff have moved or  may relocate to other parts of Treasury or other federal agencies.", "Treasury also has addressed several turnover-related staffing issues. We  previously reported that a number of staff from the OFS leadership team  departed in 2010 and 2011, and in 2013 the terms of two other leadership  team members are scheduled to expire. As we previously reported, OFS  addressed this leadership challenge by replacing the Assistant Secretary of  Financial Stability with OFS\u2019s former Chief Counsel in 2011 and replacing  departing OFS leaders with existing OFS staff members (generally to term  positions). We also reported that OFS had been addressing other staffing  issues, including implementation of its staffing plan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Contracts and Other Agreements Supporting TARP Administration and Operations", "paragraphs": ["Since TARP was established, Treasury has relied on the private sector to  assist OFS with TARP administration and operations. Treasury engages  with private sector firms through financial agency agreements, contracts,  and blanket purchase agreements. According to OFS procedures,  financial agency agreements are used for services that cannot be  provided with existing Treasury or contractor resources. Specifically,  Treasury has relied on financial agents for asset management,  transaction structuring, disposition services, custodial services, and  administration and compliance support for the TARP housing assistance  programs. In addition, Treasury uses TARP contracts for a variety of  legal, investment consulting, accounting, and other services and supplies.", "Through September 30, 2012, Treasury had awarded 19 financial agency  agreements, 13 of which remained active, and awarded or used 131  contracts and blanket purchase agreements, of which about 40 percent  remained active. As shown in table 3, the obligated value of the financial  agency agreements and contracts totaled more than $900 million, with  most of the funding going for financial agency agreements. The increase  in obligations since 2010 is largely due to Treasury\u2019s reliance on financial  agents to support the oversight of TARP assets and the continued  implementation of the housing programs over the last couple of years.  Also, 3 of its financial agency agreements for transaction structuring and  disposition services remained active.", "The vast majority of the financial agency agreement obligations shown  above (approximately $525 million) are for Federal National Mortgage  Association (Fannie Mae) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation  (Freddie Mac), which provide administrative and compliance services,  respectively, for the TARP housing programs. The two largest contracts  are $35 million with PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP for internal control  services and $17 million with Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, LLP for  legal services. Treasury also has encouraged small and minority- and  women-owned businesses to pursue opportunities for TARP contracts  and financial agency agreements. The majority of these businesses  participating in TARP are subcontractors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Managing Potential Conflicts of Interest", "paragraphs": ["Treasury has taken a number of actions since 2008, in part in response to  recommendations we made, to establish a structured system to manage  potential conflicts of interest involving its contractors and financial agents.  The system is based on a regulation Treasury issued in interim form in  2009 and final form in 2011 that prohibits retained entities from engaging  in activities that create organizational or personal conflicts of interest  without a waiver or mitigation under a Treasury-approved plan. The  regulation sets forth standards to address actual and potential conflicts  that may arise, establishes responsibilities for contractors and financial  agents in preventing conflicts from occurring, and outlines Treasury\u2019s  process for reviewing and addressing conflicts.", "Treasury has developed and implemented a multifaceted process to  manage and oversee potential conflicts of interest that is managed by  OFS\u2019s Office of the Chief Compliance Officer. The process includes  reviewing proposed contracts and financial agency agreements,  approving contractor and financial agent mitigation plans, responding to  conflict-of-interest inquiries from contractors and financial agents,  verifying that contractors and financial agents are regularly certifying that  they are preventing or properly mitigating actual or potential conflicts of  interest, and preparing feedback reports that provide a snapshot of how  each contractor and financial agent is performing with respect to conflict- of-interest requirements. In addition, because the monitoring of conflicts  of interest is based to some degree on self-reported information that  contractors and financial agents submit, Treasury began conducting  onsite design and compliance reviews in 2011. These reviews are  designed to evaluate the effectiveness of contractors\u2019 and financial  agents\u2019 internal controls and procedures for identifying and addressing  conflicts of interest."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the Department of the Treasury", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contacts named above, Dan Garcia-Diaz; Gary Engel;  and William T.
