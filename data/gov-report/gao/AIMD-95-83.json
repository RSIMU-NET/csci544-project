We found the following:", "The Corporation\u2019s financial statements referred to above were reliable in all material respects. In its 1994 report on internal controls, management fairly stated that internal controls in place on September 30, 1994, were not effective in assuring that transactions were properly recorded, processed, and summarized to permit the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and to maintain accountability for assets among funds. However, through additional audit procedures, we were able to satisfy ourselves that these weaknesses did not have a material effect on the Corporation\u2019s financial statements. In contrast, internal controls in place on September 30, 1994, did provide reasonable assurance that assets were safeguarded from material loss and that transactions were executed in accordance with management authority and significant provisions of selected laws and regulations.", "There was no reportable noncompliance with laws and regulations we tested.", "The following sections outline each of these conclusions in more detail and discuss significant matters considered in performing our audit and forming our opinions.

The Single-Employer Fund also reported a significant gain for the year, largely as a result of the effect of rising interest rates on the program\u2019s benefit liabilities.", "However, the Fund\u2019s unfunded $1.2 billion deficit, which represents a shortfall in assets needed to satisfy the Corporation\u2019s benefit liabilities for terminated plans and for those plans considered likely to terminate, still constitutes a threat to the Fund\u2019s long-term viability. In addition to the losses recorded in the financial statements and reflected in the unfunded deficit as of September 30, 1994, the Corporation disclosed $18 billion in estimated unfunded liabilities in single-employer plans that represent reasonably possible future losses.", "The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), which created the pension insurance program, established funding standards for insured plans but allowed benefits to become guaranteed before being funded by plan sponsors. The resulting timing difference has contributed, in large measure, to the Corporation\u2019s exposure should a financially troubled plan sponsor be unable to meet its pension obligations.", "Moreover, the premium structure of the Single-Employer Fund has limited the Corporation\u2019s ability to manage the exposure posed by underfunded plans because premiums paid by those plans have not fully covered the risks.", "In 1987, the Congress modified the Single-Employer Fund\u2019s basic flat-rate premium structure by adding a supplemental variable rate premium which, for the first time, established a link between premiums and plan underfunding. The variable rate premium was based on the unfunded vested liability as calculated by the plan, after adjusting for a common interest rate, rather than the specific unfunded liability the Fund assumes should a plan actually terminate. However, as previously reported, the Single-Employer Fund often assumes a substantially larger liability upon termination than the last one calculated and reported by a plan.", "Also, the variable rate premium was subject to a maximum dollar amount that, when reached, effectively limited the risk-based linkage between premiums and plan underfunding. In addition, the Single-Employer Fund\u2019s premium structure did not take into account the added risk of termination posed by underfunded plans sponsored by financially troubled companies.", "To address these concerns, the administration supported legislation proposed in the 103rd Congress to strengthen minimum funding standards by requiring sponsors to increase their contributions to underfunded defined benefit pension plans and phasing out the cap on variable rate premiums paid by underfunded plans. A modified version of this proposal, the Retirement Protection Act of 1994, became law on December 8, 1994, as part of legislation implementing the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The Corporation anticipates that this legislation will significantly reduce underfunding in the plans that it insures and improve its financial condition. We have not assessed the long-term effects of this legislation on the Corporation\u2019s deficit. However, the Corporation will need to monitor whether the legislation achieves the desired results."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Weaknesses in Employee Benefit Plan Audits and Reporting", "paragraphs": ["As we previously reported, weaknesses in the scope and quality of audits of employee benefit plans and the lack of plan reporting on internal controls reduce their effectiveness in safeguarding the interests of plan participants and the government. Under ERISA, the Department of Labor is responsible for establishing reporting and disclosure requirements and monitoring ongoing employee benefit plans, which include defined benefit pension plans insured by the Corporation.", "In past reviews of independent public accountants\u2019 audits of employee benefit plans we found severe weaknesses in both the quality and scope of plan audits that made their reliability and usefulness questionable. ERISA allows plan administrators to limit the scope of plan audits by excluding plan assets held by certain regulated institutions from the scope of the auditor\u2019s work. Thus, in cases where the scope is limited, the auditor provides little or no assurance about the existence, ownership, or value of assets that may be material to the financial condition of those plans. In addition, plan auditors are not required to check the accuracy and completeness of pension insurance premium filings applicable to insured plans or related premium payments made to the Corporation. Finally, while plan administrators are responsible for establishing sound internal controls and for complying with applicable laws and regulations, ERISA does not require that either plan administrators or plan auditors report to regulators and participants on the effectiveness of internal controls.", "In our April 1992 report (GAO/AFMD-92-14), we recommended that the Congress eliminate ERISA\u2019s limited scope audit provision and require plan administrators and auditors to report on internal controls. Legislation was introduced late in the 103rd Congress that would have eliminated limited scope audits, required peer review of auditors conducting plan audits, and required plan administrators and auditors to report irregularities. This proposed legislation would not have required plan administrators and auditors to report on internal controls. The legislation was not enacted, and as of February 15, 1995, the 104th Congress had not taken up similar legislation."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Material Internal Control Weaknesses", "paragraphs": ["Our work disclosed that the Corporation has continued to make progress in improving internal controls affecting its financial reporting. However, as of September 30, 1994, material weaknesses continued to exist in the Corporation\u2019s internal control structure in the three areas reported in our previous audits: weaknesses in financial systems and related internal controls, inadequate controls over the assessment of the Multiemployer Fund\u2019s liability for future financial assistance, and inadequate controls over nonfinancial participant data.", "Through substantive audit procedures, we were able to satisfy ourselves that the weaknesses discussed below did not have a material effect on the fiscal year 1994 and 1993 financial statements of the Single-Employer and Multiemployer Funds. However, these weaknesses could result in misstatements in future financial statements and other financial information if not corrected by management. These weaknesses could also have an adverse impact on management decisions based, in whole or in part, on information whose accuracy is affected by the deficiencies. Unaudited financial information, including budget information, reported by the Corporation or used as a basis for management\u2019s operational decisions also may contain inaccuracies resulting from these weaknesses."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Weaknesses in Financial Systems and Related Internal Controls", "paragraphs": ["We reported for fiscal years 1992 and 1993 that weaknesses in financial systems and related internal controls presented an unacceptable risk to the Corporation that material misstatements might occur in the Corporation\u2019s financial information and not be detected promptly by the Corporation.", "During fiscal year 1994, the Corporation continued to take steps to strengthen internal controls and to address weaknesses in financial and management information systems. For example, the Corporation began testing the data supporting multiemployer plan requests for financial assistance to ensure that they were valid and adequately supported prior to providing the assistance, updated certain computer operations procedures, and began detail system design for a new core financial system incorporating the standard general ledger.", "However, as of September 30, 1994, the Corporation had not implemented sufficient financial reporting controls to compensate fully for its lack of financial system integration. Deficiencies in automated management and financial information systems continued to inhibit management\u2019s ability to promptly and accurately accumulate and summarize the information needed for internal and external reports. Overall, the Corporation\u2019s cumbersome and nonintegrated processes for preparing the financial and other management information needed to support operations and financial/budgetary reporting were time-consuming and labor-intensive. These conditions were due, in part, to shortcomings in systems development and operations, including the absence of a proven systems development methodology. Thus, system and control weaknesses exposed the Corporation to a significant risk that the information could be materially misstated. These weaknesses were discussed in greater detail in our previous reports."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Inadequate Controls Over the Assessment of the Multiemployer Fund\u2019s Liability for Future Financial Assistance", "paragraphs": ["During fiscal year 1994, the Corporation placed into operation a new computer system to determine the multiemployer plan universe and identify financially troubled plans as part of its assessment of the Multiemployer Fund\u2019s liability for future financial assistance. However, the new system\u2019s security controls were not designed to effectively restrict access to program source code, executable programs, and data tables. Additionally, during system implementation, the Corporation did not maintain evidence to document that key financial and nonfinancial plan data were accurately and completely transferred into the new multiemployer system.", "In addition, as reported for fiscal year 1993, the Corporation did not review or properly supervise the process for determining which plans should be included in the universe of multiemployer plans, or address the accuracy of certain data utilized in identifying and assessing financially troubled multiemployer plans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Inadequate Controls Over Nonfinancial Participant Data", "paragraphs": ["As previously reported, the Corporation\u2019s controls did not ensure the accuracy of nonfinancial participant data entered into the Pension and Lump Sum (PLUS) system. In processing a terminated pension plan, the Corporation obtains nonfinancial participant data (such as social security numbers and dates of birth and employment) and uses the data, in conjunction with other information, to initially determine participants\u2019 guaranteed benefits. After the nonfinancial data are obtained and initial benefits are determined, the data are entered into the PLUS system automated database, which is used to respond to participant inquiries and administer other benefit services. The Corporation uses these data annually to value its benefit liability for participants whose data have been entered in PLUS. Inaccurate nonfinancial data can reduce the precision of the Corporation\u2019s fiscal year-end liability valuation and delay the final calculation of participant benefits.", "Weaknesses in controls over nonfinancial participant data and related recommendations are discussed in the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation Inspector General Report No. 94-6/23079-1 and as updated in its report No. 95-5/23083-1. In our report (GAO/AIMD-94-109), we concurred with the Inspector General\u2019s recommendations, which are designed primarily to strengthen the verification of participant data and the input and edit controls over participant data maintained in PLUS.", "During fiscal year 1993, the Corporation initiated efforts designed to improve the accuracy of certain aspects of nonfinancial participant data entered into the PLUS system. However, control weaknesses involving these data continued to exist for fiscal year 1994 because the Corporation had not made significant progress in improving procedures for obtaining and documenting participant data in a timely manner. Also, weaknesses existed in the Corporation\u2019s verifying and editing of the nonfinancial participant data entered and maintained in the Corporation\u2019s records and its PLUS database.", "We previously made recommendations for addressing each of the material internal control weaknesses discussed in this report. These recommendations called for strengthening internal controls over systems development/modification and integration, financial reporting, multiemployer financial assistance, and participant data.

Furthermore, the Corporation\u2019s assessment of the Multiemployer Fund\u2019s exposure to liabilities for future financial assistance is subject to material uncertainties, whose eventual effects cannot be reasonably determined at present. Many complex factors must be considered to identify multiemployer plans which are likely to require future assistance and to estimate the amount of such assistance.
