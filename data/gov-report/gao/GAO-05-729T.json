Of $33 billion in excess commodity disposals in fiscal years 2002 through 2004, $4 billion were reported to be in new, unused, and excellent condition. DOD units reutilized only $495 million (12 percent) of these items. The remaining $3.5 billion (88 percent) includes significant waste and inefficiency because new, unused, and excellent condition items were transferred and donated outside of DOD, sold for pennies on the dollar, or destroyed. DOD units continued to buy many of these same items. GAO identified at least $400 million of fiscal year 2002 and 2003 commodity purchases when identical new, unused, and excellent condition items were available for reutilization. GAO also identified hundreds of millions of dollars in reported lost, damaged, or stolen excess property, including sensitive military technology items, which contributed to reutilization program waste and inefficiency. Further, excess property improperly stored outdoors for several months was damaged by wind, rain, and hurricanes. GAO ordered and purchased at little or no cost several new and unused excess commodities that DOD continued to buy and utilize, including tents, boots, power supplies, circuit cards, and medical supplies. GAO paid a total of $2,898, including tax and shipping cost, for these items, which had an original DOD acquisition cost of $79,649. Root causes for reutilization program waste and inefficiency included (1) unreliable excess property inventory data; (2) inadequate oversight and physical inventory control; and (3) outdated, nonintegrated excess inventory and supply management systems. Procurement of inventory in excess of requirements also was a significant contributing factor. Improved management of DOD's excess property could save taxpayers at least hundreds of millions of dollars annually."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to discuss the results of our audit and  investigation of the economy and efficiency of the Department of Defense  (DOD) program for reutilization (reuse) of excess property.  Our related  report, released today and developed at the request of this Subcommittee,  Senator Collins, and Representative Schakowsky, describes significant  breakdowns in management controls that have resulted in substantial  waste and inefficiency in DOD\u2019s excess property reutilization program.   Our previous, limited work identified several examples of waste and  inefficiency in DOD\u2019s excess property reutilization program.  Our  November 2003 report identified several examples that showed that at the  same time DOD excessed biological laboratory equipment items in good or  excellent condition and sold many of them to the public for pennies on the  dollar, it was purchasing the same or similar items.   In June 2002, we  testified that the lack of asset visibility over the Joint Service Lightweight  Integrated Suit Technology (JSLIST) resulted in DOD selling new, unused  JSLIST for $3 per suit (coats and trousers) while at the same time procuring  hundreds of thousands of JSLIST annually at a cost of over $200 per suit.   You were concerned that these limited examples could indicate systemic  problems.", "Our current work focused on whether and to what extent we found waste  and inefficiency in DOD\u2019s excess property reutilization program and the  root causes of any waste and inefficiency.  You also asked us to determine  whether the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) was purchasing new items  when identical items in new, unused, and excellent condition were  available at Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service (DRMS) field  offices (DRMO).   As DOD\u2019s combat support agency, DLA has a mission to  provide best-value logistics support to America\u2019s armed forces.  In carrying  out its mission, DLA manages inventory valued at about $83 billion,  consisting of more than 5 million items of  food, fuel, clothing and other  textiles, medical supplies, industrial use items, and spare and repair parts  supporting over 1,400 weapon systems.  Within DLA, DRMS is responsible  for excess property disposals.  Federal regulations require executive  agencies to ensure that personal property not needed by their activity is  offered for use elsewhere within the agency.  In accordance with federal  regulations, DOD 4160.21-M, Defense Materiel Disposition Manual,  chapter 5, calls for reutilization of excess property to the extent feasible to  fill existing needs and to satisfy additional needs before initiating new  procurement or repair.", "In performing our work, we reviewed applicable laws and regulations; DOD  policies and procedures; and current and planned systems, processes, and  management controls.  To identify potential waste and inefficiencies, we  analyzed the universe of recorded commodity purchase and disposal  transactions and compared DOD commodity purchases to disposals of  identical items in new, unused, and excellent condition (A condition).  To  assure ourselves that DOD data were sufficiently reliable for the purpose of  our work, we performed a number of electronic and statistical tests of DOD  databases and excess inventory and data used in our work.  We conducted  our work, including follow-up work related to this testimony, from  November 2003 through May 2005 in accordance with U.S. generally  accepted government auditing standards and investigative standards  prescribed by the President\u2019s Council on Integrity and Efficiency.

Of the $4 billion, we  determined that $3.5 billion (88 percent) included substantial waste and  inefficiency because new, unused, and excellent condition items were  being transferred or donated outside of DOD, sold on the Internet for  pennies on the dollar, or destroyed rather than being reutilized.  As  discussed in our report, our analysis of $18.6 billion in fiscal year 2002 and  2003 excess commodity disposal activity identified $2.5 billion in excess  items that were reported to be in new, unused, and excellent condition (A  condition).  Although federal regulations and DOD policy require  reutilization of excess property in good condition, to the extent possible,  our analysis showed that DOD units only reutilized $295 million (12  percent) of these items.  The remaining $2.2 billion (88 percent) of the $2.5  billion in disposals of A-condition excess commodities were not reutilized,  but instead were transferred, donated, sold, or destroyed.  Similarly, our  analysis of $14.3 billion in fiscal year 2004 disposal activity identified $1.5  billion in excess commodity items that were reported to be in A condition.   Of the $1.5 billion in A-condition excess items, DOD units reutilized $200  million (13 percent) and transferred, donated, sold, or destroyed the  remaining $1.3 billion (87 percent).   We also found that during fiscal years  2002 and 2003, DOD purchased at least $400 million (over $200 million each  year) of identical items instead of reutilizing available excess items in A  condition.  To illustrate continuing reutilization program waste and  inefficiency, we purchased several new and unused excess DOD  commodity items that were being purchased by DLA, were currently in use  by the military services, or both.  Our analysis of transaction data and our  tests of controls for inventory accuracy indicate that the magnitude of  waste and inefficiency could be much greater due to military units  improperly downgrading condition codes of excess items that are in new,  unused, and excellent condition to unserviceable and the failure to  consistently record national stock numbers (NSN) needed to identify like  items."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Fiscal Year 2002-2004 Excess Commodity Disposal Activity", "paragraphs": ["DRMS is responsible for disposing of unusable items, often referred to as  \u201cjunk,\u201d as well as facilitating the reutilization of usable items.  Although the  majority of DOD\u2019s excess property disposals relate to items in  unserviceable condition, DOD also disposed of billions of dollars of  serviceable items, including excess commodities in A condition from fiscal  years 2002 through 2004.  Our analysis of DRMS data showed that $28.1  billion of the $33 billion in excess DOD commodity disposals from fiscal  year 2002 through fiscal year 2004 consisted of items listed in unserviceable  condition, including items needing repair, items that were obsolete, and  items that were downgraded to scrap.  The remaining $4.9 billion in excess  commodity disposals consisted of items reported to be in serviceable  condition, including $4 billion in excess commodities reported to be in A  condition.  However, of the $4 billion, DOD units reutilized only $495  million (12 percent) of these items during the 3-year period.  The data  reliability issues noted above and our interviews, case studies, and  statistical sample results indicate that the magnitude of waste and  inefficiency associated with disposals of A-condition items could be much  greater.

According to  DRMO officials, reutilization was higher in fiscal year 2002 because excess  items were pulled back to support deployment to Afghanistan and Iraq.  In  fiscal year 2003, procurement to support the war on terrorism began to  keep up with the demand for supplies, and reutilization of excess property  decreased.  DRMS officials attribute the fiscal year 2004 increase in DOD  reutilization to the establishment of the Joint Services Nuclear, Biological,  and Chemical Equipment Assessment Program (JEAP) to inspect excess  military clothing, tents, and other textile items and reissue items in good  condition.  The increase in disposal activity in fiscal years 2003 and 2004  relates to turn-ins of property used in support of Operation Enduring  Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom.

The magnitude  of unnecessary purchases could be much greater because NSNs needed to  identify identical items were not recorded for all purchase and turn-in  transactions.  For example, we determined that DLA buyers and item  managers did not record NSNs for 87 percent (about $4.9 billion) of the  nearly $5.7 billion in medical commodity purchases by military units during  fiscal years 2002 and 2003.  Further, as discussed later, improper  downgrading of condition codes to unserviceable could also result in an  understatement of the magnitude of unnecessary purchases.

We found that DOD continued to transfer, donate,  and sell excess A-condition items instead of reutilizing them.  To illustrate  these problems, we requisitioned several excess new and unused items at  no cost and purchased other new and unused commodities at minimal cost.   We based our case study selections on new, unused items that DOD  continued to purchase.  As discussed in our report, we used the GSA  Federal Disposal System, available to all federal agencies, to requisition  several new and unused excess DOD commodity items during our audit in  fiscal year 2004 and the first half of fiscal year 2005, including a medical  instrument chest, two power supply units, and two circuit cards, at no  charge.  These items had an original DOD acquisition cost of $55,817, and  we paid only $5 shipping cost to obtain all of them.  We also purchased, at  minimal cost, several excess DOD commodity items in new and unused  condition over the Internet at govliquidation.com\u2014the DRMS liquidation  contractor\u2019s Web site.  The items we purchased included tents, boots,  three gasoline burners (stove/heating unit), a medical suction apparatus,  and bandages and other medical supply items with a total reported  acquisition cost of $12,310.

On December 6,  2004, we purchased 8,526 excess DOD badges, medals, and insignias that  are used to indicate rank, the unit or program to which a military member  or civilian employee is assigned, or service awards.  These items had a  reported acquisition cost of $9,518.  We paid a total of $1,102, including  buyer\u2019s premium and tax, for these items\u2014about 12 cents on the dollar.   Units and program areas designated by the badges and insignias include  Army Rangers, Mountain, and Airborne; Air Force Air Traffic Controller;  and DOD Scientific Consultant.  Rank insignias include Air Force Chief  Master Sergeant and Air Force Technical Sergeant; Navy Captain,  Midshipman Lieutenant, and Midshipman Lieutenant Commander; and  Army Command Sergeant Major and Master Sergeant.  The listed condition  code of these items ranged from A4 (serviceable, usable condition) to H7  (unserviceable, condemned condition).  However, our inspection of the  badges and insignias that we purchased showed that none of them had  been used, and many of them were in original manufacturer packages.   Further, DOD is continuing to purchase and use most of these items.

We purchased eight new, unused  Cooper Trendsetter SE 13-inch steel-belted radial tires on February 18,  2005.  According to the Army project officer, these tires are used on over- the-road passenger vehicles, and one customer ordered them for use on a  forklift.  DOD units are continuing to purchase and use these same tires.   The most recent purchase of 50 of these tires was made in April 2005.   The  eight tires had a total reported acquisition value of $404.  We paid $113 for  the tires, including buyer\u2019s premium and tax, and an additional $154  shipping cost.  The tires were listed in A4 condition (usable, with some  wear).  However, we found that the tires still had manufacturer labels on  the tread and blue paint over the whitewalls, indicating that they were new  and unused.  The tires were turned in as excess by the North Island Naval  Air Station\u2019s Aircraft Intermediate Maintenance Detachment.  According to  the Army Tank Automotive and Armaments Command Project Officer, the  NSN listed on the turn-in document was incorrect.  We found that  inaccurate item descriptions, including NSNs, prevent items from being  selected for reutilization.

We purchased several Class A  military uniforms over the Internet on April 7, 2005.  The uniforms were  listed as being in H7 (unserviceable, condemned) condition.  Although the  uniforms that we purchased over the Internet from DOD\u2019s liquidation  contractor had a listed acquisition cost of $1,600, we paid a total of $58,  including buyer\u2019s premium and sales tax, to acquire them\u2014about 4 cents  on the dollar.  After receiving our purchase we determined that we had in  fact purchased 27 new, unused uniform coats; 4 pairs of new, unused  uniform trousers; 54 jackets in excellent condition; 45 pairs of trousers in  excellent condition; and 5 women\u2019s uniform skirts and 1 pair of slacks in  excellent condition.  DOD is continuing to purchase and issue two of the  four types of trousers that we purchased over the Internet.  According to  the DLA clothing and textiles product manager for dress uniforms, the  Army switched from a matte finish gold button to a shiny sta-briteTM gold  button on October 1, 2003.  Although the Army ordered and paid for the  new replacement buttons for existing dress uniforms, it later determined  that hiring a contractor to replace the buttons or sending the coats back to  the manufacturers for button replacement would be very expensive.  The  Army decided to use the coats with the older buttons to fill Reserve and  Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC and JROTC) orders until  current supplies are exhausted.  However, our monitoring of DOD  liquidation sales found that many class A uniforms with the older buttons  are being sold over the Internet for pennies on the dollar instead of being  issued to ROTC and JROTC.  In addition, we observed the new sta-briteTM  buttons being sold over the Internet in May 2005.

However, when we arrived at the Great Lakes sales location near Chicago  to pick up the uniforms, DOD liquidation contractor personnel were unable  to locate them.  Contractor personnel explained that our purchase may  have been mistakenly given to another customer.  To compensate, we were  offered other items available for sale.

In  addition, for many years our audits of DOD inventory management have  reported that continuing unresolved logistics management weaknesses  have resulted in DOD purchasing more inventory than it needed.  DOD  reutilization program waste and inefficiency is symptomatic of the  inventory and supply chain management issues that have been considered  high risk by GAO since 1990.

However, we found that DRMS and DLA  supply depot management have not enforced this requirement.  Further,  Army, Navy, and Air Force officials told us that unreliable data are a  disincentive to reutilization because of the negative impact on their  operations.  DLA item managers told us that because military units have  lost confidence in the reliability of data on excess property reported by  DRMS, for the most part they have requested purchases of new items  instead of reutilizing excess items.

Our condition code  tests determined whether the condition code was accurately recorded as  serviceable or unserviceable.  We estimated that errors related to condition  code accuracy ranged from 6 percent to 26 percent at the 5 DRMOs we  tested.  Overall, we found that DRMO errors were caused by erroneous  turn-in documentation prepared by military units and the failure of DRMO  personnel to verify turn-ins at the time they were received and correct  errors before recording the receipts in excess inventory.  Most DLA supply  depot errors related to untimely recording of transactions for changes in  inventory status and inaccurate quantities.

Further, the Columbus DRMO recorded a transaction to  show that the 72 chemical and biological protective suits identified as  missing during our statistical tests of Columbus DRMO inventory were  transferred to JEAP on November 10, 2004.  However, our follow-up with  JEAP officials found that they have no record of receiving the protective  suits.  The Columbus DRMO\u2019s apparent manipulation of the inventory data  avoided reporting the missing items as losses.", "Our follow-up investigations of other selected DRMO losses found the  following.", "An Air Force turn-in of 75 chemical and biological protective suits was  received, placed in the Shaw RIPL (a receipt in place location under  authority of the Jackson DRMO) warehouse on May 28, 2002, and  subsequently disappeared.  DRMO personnel told DRMS investigators  that the 75 protective suits may have been included in a November 15,  2002, shipment to the Jackson DRMO in South Carolina.  However,  because DRMO personnel recorded box counts instead of turn-in  document numbers and item counts, there is no detailed record of the  items that were shipped between the two excess property warehouses.", "Twenty units of body armor reported lost at the Meade DRMO initially  had been ordered by Israel on November 8, 2000.  Our investigators  confirmed that the body armor was never picked up for shipment to  Israel.  According to the loss report, the items were relocated from the  shipping area to the demilitarization storage area of the DRMO on May  8, 2002.  A loss investigation was initiated by the Area Manager for the  Meade DRMO in March 2004.  However, because the Meade DRMO  contractor had improperly destroyed inventory records after 2 years,  attempts to determine the events surrounding the loss were fruitless.", "Our investigation of 18 reports on a total of 52 units of body armor  missing from the Hood DRMO during fiscal years 2002 and 2003  determined that these items were stored outside in an unsecure area  resulting in the theft of at least 48 units of body armor.  A DRMS  investigative report noted that items requiring demilitarization had been  stored in this area over a 2-year period, even though the security fence  had barbed wire that was cut or missing and the high ground level  outside the fence provided easy access.  According to a DRMO official, a  work order for the fence repair had been submitted but the repairs had  not been made.", "The Naval Operational Logistics Support Center-Ammo, which was  responsible for a turn-in of guided missile warheads, the DRMO that  received these items, and the Demilitarization Center each recorded a  different quantity for the turn-in.  However, quantity discrepancies were  not resolved at any point during the turn-in and disposal process.  As a  result, there is no audit trail to determine whether or where, when, or  how the reported loss or a recordkeeping error occurred.  For example,  the Navy unit reported a turn-in of 24 warheads that had been used in  testing but were certified as inert.  DRMO personnel counted canisters  and loose components and determined there were 32 warheads.  The  Anniston Demilitarization Center reported that a total of 27 warheads  were received for destruction.", "DLA supply depot losses.  Our statistical samples showed missing items  at four of the five DLA supply depots that we tested.  Because depot  officials did not have documentation showing that these items had been  reutilized or sold, there is no assurance that the missing items did not relate  to theft.  Missing items in our DLA depot statistical samples included  several sensitive items, such as classified radio frequency amplifiers and  circuit boards, aircraft parts, and computer equipment that required trade  security or demilitarization controls.", "We obtained DRMS data on DLA supply depot reports of excess property  losses, including missing and damaged property and unverified  adjustments.  We investigated reported losses of selected aircraft parts at  two DLA supply depots\u2014Oklahoma City and Warner Robins\u2014that  reported the largest amount of depot losses.  DLA Directive 5025.30, DLA  One Book, includes a section on Inventory Adjustment Research (dated  October 21, 2004), which sets inventory accuracy goals for DLA supply  depots and requires causative research\u2014an in-depth investigation\u2014of  adjustments for selected items and suspected fraud, waste, and abuse to  determine why they occurred.  A Financial Liability Investigation of  Property Loss is required if the adjustment meets specific criteria,  including (1) gains or losses of classified or sensitive material; (2) an  adjustment in excess of $2,500 for pilferable material; and (3) a loss where  there is a suspicion of fraud, theft, or negligence.  However, we found that  DLA depot personnel did not thoroughly investigate most adjustments  related to reported losses of sensitive items with demilitarization controls  that we selected for investigation.  Supply depot officials told us that they  assumed the losses represented inventory recordkeeping errors, even  though causative research results were inconclusive."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Property Damage", "paragraphs": ["In addition to reported losses, we found significant instances of property  damage at DRMS liquidation contractor sales locations.  Because the terms  and conditions of liquidation sales specify that all property is sold \u201cas is\u201d  and assigns all risk of loss to buyers, the buyers have no recourse when  property is damaged after being sold or is not in the advertised condition.   As a result, customers who have lost money on bids related to damaged  and unusable items might not bid again, or they may scale back on the  amount of their bids in the future, affecting both the volume of excess DOD  items liquidated and sales proceeds.  On October 7, 2004, we purchased  numerous usable items in original manufacturer packaging, including 35  boxes of bandages, 31 boxes of gauze sponges and surgical sponges, 12  boxes of latex gloves, and 2 boxes of tracheostomy care sets.  We paid a  total of $167, including buyer\u2019s premium, tax, and transportation cost, for  these items, which had a reported total acquisition cost of $3,290.   However, these items had become damaged due to rain and a leaky roof at  the Norfolk, Virginia, liquidation sales location.", "The majority of property damage that we observed at liquidation contractor  sales locations is primarily the result of DRMS management decisions to  send excess DLA supply depot property to two national liquidation sales  locations without assuring that its contractor had sufficient human capital  resources and warehouse capacity to process, properly store, and sell the  volume of property received.  For example, excess DOD property sent to  the Huntsville, Alabama, liquidation sales location was stored outside  unprotected from weather, including sun, wind, rain, and hurricanes during  the summer and fall of 2004.  The liquidation contractor\u2019s failure to record  these items in sales inventory at the time they were received, when  combined with lost and illegible property labels due to weather damage,  resulted in a significant loss of accountability for many of these items."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Outdated, Nonintegrated Systems Impair Economy and Efficiency", "paragraphs": ["Inefficient, nonintegrated excess inventory and supply management  systems lack controls necessary to prevent waste and inefficiency in the  reutilization program.  For example, because the DRMS Automated  Inventory System (DAISY) and DLA\u2019s Standard Automated Materiel  Management System (SAMMS) are outdated and nonintegrated, they do not  share information necessary to (1) identify and alert DLA item managers of  excess property that is available to fill supply orders and (2) prevent  purchases of new items when A-condition excess items are available for  reutilization.  We have continued to report that long-standing weaknesses  with DLA\u2019s inventory systems related to outdated, nonintegrated legacy  systems and processes result in DOD and military units not knowing how  many items they have and where these items are located.  DLA has  acknowledged serious deficiencies in its automated inventory management  systems. Although DLA has an effort under way to replace SAMMS with the  Business Systems Modernization (BSM) and DRMS has a Reutilization  Modernization Program (RMP) under way to upgrade DAISY, so far these  have been separate, uncoordinated efforts and they do not adequately  address identified process deficiencies.  While the systems improvement  efforts are intended to integrate supply and excess inventory systems to  support the reutilization program, they are not focused on resolving long- standing problems related to unreliable condition code data and  incomplete data on NSNs.  The accuracy of these two data elements is  critical to the ability to identify like items that are available for reutilization  at the time purchases are made."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Comments", "paragraphs": ["To effectively address problems with reutilization program waste and  inefficiency, DRMS and DLA will need to exercise strong leadership and  accountability to improve the reliability of excess property data; establish  effective oversight and physical inventory control; and develop effective  integrated systems and processes for identifying and reutilizing excess  property.  In addition, the military services will need to provide accurate  information on excess property turn-in documentation, particularly data on  condition codes, and item descriptions, including NSNs that are key to  identifying items for reutilization.  Improved management of DOD\u2019s excess  property and a strong reutilization program would help save taxpayers  hundreds of millions of dollars annually.", "Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee, this concludes my  prepared statement.
