However, GAO found that the military services either were not using PHRAMS as the main basis of their mental health provider staffing needs estimates or were supplementing PHRAMS results with other service-specific methods. The services reported making these adjustments because PHRAMS does not account for factors that are crucial to assess mental health provider staffing needs, such as mental health providers needed for deployments.

Army officials reported that they did not use PHRAMS as the  basis for their fiscal year 2016 budget request and instead determined  their mental health provider staffing needs through their legacy  staffing model and adjusted PHRAMS to ensure it produced similar  results.

This is because PHRAMS\u2019 assumption  that all military services experience the same encounter rates for  mental health conditions included in the model is an  overgeneralization of mental health service demands. This official  believes that this is particularly problematic for the Army because  deployments are more traumatic for Army servicemembers and may  result in some servicemembers requiring more than the average  number of encounters. As a result, the Army only ran PHRAMS after  the military service had already determined its mental health provider  staffing needs through its legacy staffing model.", "Air Force. According to Air Force officials, while the Air Force uses  some aspects of PHRAMS, it did not rely exclusively on PHRAMS to  generate their estimates of mental health staffing needs included in  the fiscal year 2016 budget request.

First, Air Force manpower staff ran PHRAMS and  provided the PHRAMS-generated mental health provider staffing  estimates to Air Force\u2019s mental health consultants for consideration.  Second, the Air Force mental health consultants developed multiple  staffing level proposals by combining the PHRAMS output with their  own expertise and information received during conversations with Air  Force MTF officials. Finally, the Chief of Clinical Operations for the Air  Force Medical Support Agency selected the best staffing proposal  among those submitted for review by the Air Force mental health  consultants. Air Force officials reported that this process was applied  because PHRAMS relies on data that is several years old and does  not take into account all aspects of Air Force mental health provider  staffing, such as mental health providers embedded in operational  units. Air Force officials also explained that they plan to continue  using this process in the future to generate mental health provider  staffing estimates.", "Navy. Navy officials reported that they used PHRAMS, but  supplemented PHRAMS estimates of mental health provider staffing  needs with additional information. According to Navy officials, this was  necessary because PHRAMS does not include estimates of mental  health provider staffing needs on Navy vessels and for deployed  Marine Corps units.

The other two military services\u2014the Air Force and the Navy\u2014enter the  number of mental health providers that were authorized by DOD for that  fiscal year in the requirements field because they do not track mental  health provider staffing needs. Additionally, the NCR Medical Directorate  told us that it populates the requirements field of DHA\u2019s quarterly mental  health staffing reports with information that was created during the  formation of the NCR Medical Directorate several years ago and not with  the current needs of its beneficiary population. We believe that to  adequately assess the need for mental health providers throughout the  MHS, DHA needs to have access to consistent and reliable information  on mental health provider staffing needs in the quarterly mental health  staffing reports. By not supplying consistent information on mental health  provider staffing needs generated through PHRAMS\u2014a common staffing  model all military services and the NCR Medical Directorate have access  to\u2014the military services and the NCR Medical Directorate make it difficult  to properly assess relative mental health provider staffing needs across  the services.
