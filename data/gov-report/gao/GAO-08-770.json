In particular, its approach addresses relevant HAVA requirements and reflects relevant laboratory accreditation guidance, including standards accepted by the international standards community. However, NIST's defined approach does not, for example, cite explicit qualifications for the persons who conduct accreditation technical assessments, as called for in federal accreditation program guidance. Instead, NIST officials said that they rely on individuals who have prior experience in reviewing such laboratories. Further, even though the EAC requires that laboratory accreditation be based on demonstrated capabilities to test against the latest voting system standards, NIST's defined approach has not always cited these current standards. As a result, two of the four laboratories accredited to date were assessed using assessment tools that were not linked to the latest standards. Moreover, available documentation for the four laboratory assessments was not sufficient to determine how the checklists were applied and how decisions were reached. According to NIST officials, the four laboratories were consistently assessed. Moreover, they said that they intend to evolve NIST's accreditation approach to, for example, clearly provide for sufficient documentation of how accreditation reviews are conducted and decisions are reached. However, they had yet to develop specific plans for accomplishing this. EAC recently developed a draft laboratory accreditation program manual, but this draft manual does not adequately define all aspects of an effective approach, and it was not used in the four laboratory accreditations performed to date. Specifically, while this draft manual addresses relevant HAVA requirements, such as the requirement for the commissioners to vote on the accreditation of any laboratory that NIST recommends for accreditation, it does not include a methodology governing how laboratories are to be evaluated or criteria for granting accreditation. Because the manual was not approved at the time EAC accredited four laboratories, these accreditations were governed by a more broadly defined accreditation review process that was described in correspondence sent to each laboratory and a related document receipt checklist. As a result, these accreditations were based on review steps that were not sufficiently defined to permit them to be executed in a repeatable manner. According to EAC officials, including the official who conducted the accreditation reviews for the four laboratories, using the same person to conduct the reviews ensured that the steps performed on the first laboratory were repeated on the other three. However, given that both the steps and the results were not documented, GAO could not verify this. EAC officials stated that they intend to evolve the program manual over time and apply it to future accreditations and reaccreditations. However, they did not have specific plans for accomplishing this. Further, although EAC very recently approved an initial version of its program manual, this did not occur until after EAC provided comments, and GAO had finalized, this report."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In the wake of the 2000 and 2004 general elections, we issued a series of  reports and testified on virtually every aspect of our nation\u2019s overall  election system, including the many challenges and opportunities  associated with various types of voting systems.

Key processes that span these life cycle  phases include managing the people, processes, and technologies within  each phase and across phases, and testing the systems and components  during and at the end of each phase. Additionally, voting system standards  are important through all of the phases because they provide criteria for  developing, testing, and acquiring voting systems, and they specify the  necessary documentation for operating the systems.", "The product development phase includes activities such as establishing  requirements for the system, designing a system architecture, developing  software, and integrating components. Activities in this phase are  performed by the system vendor.", "The acquisition phase includes activities such as publishing a solicitation,  evaluating offers, choosing a voting technology and a vendor, and  awarding and administering contracts. For voting systems, activities in this  phase are primarily the responsibility of state and local governments but  entail some responsibilities that are shared with the system vendor (e.g.,  entering into the contract).", "The operations phase consists of activities such as ballot design and  programming, setup of systems before voting, pre-election testing, vote  capture and counting during elections, recounts and system audits after  elections, and storage of systems between elections.

Voting system vendors conduct product testing during  development of the system and its components. Federal certification  testing of products submitted by system vendors is conducted by national  voting system testing laboratories (VSTL). States may conduct evaluation  testing before acquiring a system to determine how well products meet  their state-specific specifications, or they may conduct certification testing  to ensure that a system performs its functions as specified by state laws  and requirements. Once a voting system is delivered by the system vendor,  states and local jurisdictions may conduct acceptance testing to ensure  that the system satisfies functional requirements. Finally, local  jurisdictions typically conduct logic and accuracy tests related to each  election and sometimes subject portions of the system to parallel testing  during each election to ensure that the system components perform  accurately.", "Management processes ensure that each life cycle phase produces a  desirable outcome.

For example, we verified that NIST received an application  from each of the laboratories as required, and our review of completed  checklists and summary reports shows that preassessment reviews and  on-site assessments were performed for each laboratory, as was required.  According to a lead assessor, this review usually focused on the  laboratories\u2019 quality assurance manuals. Moreover, the completed  checklists identified whether the requirement was met or not for each  listed requirement, and included comments, in some cases, as to how a  laboratory addressed a requirement. Also as required, NIST received  laboratory responses describing how unmet requirements were addressed  within specified time frames, used the responses in making accreditation  decisions, and notified EAC of its decisions via letters of recommendation.  Furthermore, NIST has recently begun reaccreditation reviews at two  laboratories, as required.", "However, documentation does not show that NIST has consistently  followed other aspects of its defined approach. Our analysis of the  checklists that are to be used to both guide and document a given  assessment, including identifying unmet requirements and capturing  assessor comments and observations, shows some differences. For  example:    One type of checklist (the supplemental handbook checklist) was  prepared for only two of the four laboratory assessments. According to the  program manager, this is because even though a draft revision of this  checklist was actually used to assess the other two laboratories, the  assessment results were recorded on a different checklist (the general  handbook checklist). While this is indicated on one of the two checklists,  it is not indicated on the other.", "On the checklist used for one laboratory, an assessor marked several  sections as \u201cTA\u201d with no explanation as to what this means. Also, the  checklist used for another laboratory did not identify whether most of the  requirements were met or not met. Further, the checklist for a third  laboratory had one section marked as \u201cnot applicable\u201d but included no  explanation as to why that section did not apply, while the checklist for a  different laboratory marked the same section as \u201cnot applicable\u201d but  included a reason for doing so.", "Notwithstanding these differences, the program manager told us that each  laboratory was assessed using the same requirements and all assessments  to date were performed in a consistent manner.

For example:    The program handbook states that each laboratory is to identify the  requested scope of accreditation in its application package. However, our  analysis of the four application packages shows that two laboratories did  not specify a requested scope of accreditation. According to the program  manager, the scope of accreditation for all laboratories was the 2002 VSS  and 2005 VVSG because, even though the latter standards were not yet in  effect at the time, they were anticipated to be in effect in the near future.

However, representatives for several laboratories noted  that these calls did not clearly establish expectations, adding that some  expectations were not communicated until the NIST team assessors  arrived to conduct the on-site assessment.", "The program manager stated that these deviations from the defined  approach are attributable to the relative newness of the program, but  despite these discrepancies, each laboratory was assessed consistently.

They include having    published procedures governing how the accreditation program is to be  executed, such as procedures for granting, maintaining, modifying,  suspending, and withdrawing accreditation;    specific instructions, steps, and criteria for those who conduct an  accreditation assessment (assessors) to follow, such as a test methodology  that is acceptable to the accreditation program;   knowledgeable and experienced assessors to execute the instructions and  steps and apply the related criteria; and    complete records on the data collected, results found, and reports  prepared relative to each assessment performed.", "EAC\u2019s draft accreditation program manual addresses one of these factors  but it does not fully address the other three.

EAC officials told  us that testing records are meant to include accreditation records,  although they added that this is not explicit in the manual and needs to be  clarified. Further, the manual is silent on the steps to be followed and  criteria to be applied in reviewing a laboratory\u2019s application and the  qualifications required for accreditation reviewers.

As we reported, the required information is to  include, among other things, the laboratory\u2019s (1) organizational  information, (2) records and record-keeping policy, (3) test methods and  procedures, (4) conflict of interest policy, and (5) financial stability.", "To its credit, EAC\u2019s draft accreditation manual provides for laboratories to  submit information relative to each of these features that are common to  federal accreditation programs. For example, it provides for laboratories  to submit organizational information, such as location(s), ownership, and  organizational chart; a written policy for maintaining accreditation-related  records for 5 years; conflict of interest policies and procedures; test- related polices and procedures, as well as system-specific test plans; and  financial information needed to demonstrate stability. Moreover, for four  of the five features, the manual identifies the specific types of information  needed for accreditation and how the information is to be evaluated,  including the criteria that are to be used in evaluating it.

Because of this, EAC performed each one using a broadly defined process  outlined in a letter to each laboratory and an associated checklist that only  indicated whether certain documents were received. Our analysis of these  letters showed that the correspondence sent to each laboratory was all the  same, identifying three basic review steps to be performed and citing a list  of documents that the laboratories were to provide as part of their  applications. However, the letters did not describe in any manner how  EAC would review the submitted material, including the criteria to be  used.", "According to EAC officials, the review steps were not documented.  Instead, they were derived by a single reviewer using (1) the applications  and accompanying documents submitted by the laboratories, (2)  familiarity with the materials used by the state election directors- sponsored accreditation program, and (3) the judgment of each reviewer.  Further, while the reviews were supported by a checklist that covered  each of the items that was to be included in the laboratory applications  and provided space for the reviewer(s) to make notes relative to each of  these items, the checklists did not include any guidance or methodology,  including criteria, for evaluating the submitted items.

In some cases, additional communications  occurred between the reviewer and the laboratory to obtain additional  documents. However, no documentation was available to demonstrate  what standards or other criteria the laboratories were held to or how their  submissions were otherwise reviewed. For example, each of the checklists  indicated that each laboratory provided \u201ca copy of the laboratory\u2019s conflict  of interest policy.\u201d However, they did not specify, for example, whether  the policy adequately addressed particular requirements. Nevertheless, for  three of the four accredited laboratories, documentation shows that EAC  sought clarification on or modification to the policies provided, thus  suggesting that some form of review was performed against more detailed  requirements. Similarly, while the checklists indicate that the laboratories  disclosed their respective coverage limits for general liability insurance  policies, and in one case EAC communicated to the laboratory that the  limits appeared to be low, no documentation specifies the expected  coverage limits. According to the EAC Director of Voting System Testing  and Certification, this determination was made after comparing limits  among the laboratories and was not based on any predetermined  threshold. Further, while the checklists indicate that each laboratory  provided audited financial statements, there is no documentation  indicating how these statements were reviewed.", "According to the EAC program director, the lack of documentation  demonstrating the basis for EAC\u2019s laboratory accreditations is due to the  need at the time to move quickly in accrediting the laboratories and the  fact that use of the same individual to review the accreditation evaluation  negated the need for greater documentation.

However,  NIST also noted that when the 2005 system guidelines were adopted in  December 2005, it began the process of updating the handbook and  associated assessment checklist, and that the handbook update was  recently finalized for publication and is now being used.", "In response, we stand by our finding that NIST\u2019s defined approach has not  always cited the current voting system standards, which NIST  acknowledges in its comments. However, we also recognize that NIST has  recently addressed this inconsistency by finalizing its new handbook and  the associated assessment checklist.
