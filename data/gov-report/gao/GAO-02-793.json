If FTC determines that a merger may harm competition in the marketplace, the agency may decide to block the merger or select a remedy that addresses the anticompetitive problems it has identified. FTC's preferred remedy is divestiture--the selling of a business or assets by one or both of the merging parties to maintain or restore competition where it might be harmed by the merger. When divestiture is chosen as a remedy, FTC usually drafts a proposed agreement with the merging parties that contains an order requiring the divestiture needed to remedy the anticompetitive problems. If all parties agree, FTC issues a proposed order which is made available to the public for comment for 30 days and, in most cases, authorizes the parties to consummate the merger. According to FTC staff, FTC decisions to use particular divestiture approaches are (1) based on the unique facts of each case and do not readily translate into written guidelines or systematic aggregation and (2) tied to proprietary company information that FTC is statutorily prohibited from disclosing to the public. From fiscal years 1990 through 2000, FTC used clean sweep divestitures, single buyers, or up-front buyers in the 31 divestiture orders announced for public comment in the grocery store, drug store, funeral services, and gas station industries (up-front buyers were not used at all in these industries prior to fiscal year 1996). Although there were too few buyers to analyze the level of smaller business participation in purchasing divested drug store, funeral services, and gas station assets for the period reviewed, GAO's analysis found that, after 1996, the smaller buyers were significantly less likely to purchase divested assets. FTC has not systematically measured the success or failure of the divestitures it has approved since it developed preferences for approaches like clean sweep and up-front buyers. In 1999, FTC reported the results of a study on divestiture orders made final during fiscal years 1990 through 1994 that found (1) FTC's divestiture orders had created viable competitors in the relevant markets and (2) smaller buyers succeeded at least at the same rate as larger buyers. However, without current information on the economic impact of its divestiture practices on the marketplace, especially given the changes it has made since the period covered by its 1999 study, FTC cannot state that divestiture orders have, among other things, restored or maintained competition in the affected markets."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Trade Commission\u2019s (FTC) mission is, in part, to prevent  business practices that are anticompetitive, deceptive, or unfair to  consumers.

If FTC  determines that a merger may result in anticompetitive harm, it may decide  that no remedy short of blocking the merger will fully and effectively  resolve its concerns.  However, if FTC decides that the anticompetitive  harm can be resolved without blocking the entire merger, its challenge is to  select a remedy or remedies that address the anticompetitive problems it  has identified, and, as closely as possible, maintain or restore competition  to premerger levels without unnecessarily limiting the parties\u2019 lawful  objectives, such as achieving efficiencies.  FTC\u2019s preferred remedy is  divestiture\u2014the selling of a business or assets by one or both of the  merging parties to maintain or restore competition where it might be  harmed by the merger.

This report responds  to your request that we obtain information on FTC\u2019s use of (1) \u201cclean  sweep\u201d divestitures, in which one of the merging parties divests all of its  assets in the relevant product market(s), such as the retail sale of food and  grocery products in supermarkets, within a single geographic market;  (2) single buyers, who purchase all divested assets in a geographic market;  and (3) up-front buyers, who are identified by the merging parties and, as  agreed to by FTC, included in the proposed consent order as the buyers of  the divested assets.  As agreed with your offices, we focused on  divestitures required by consent orders that FTC announced for public  comment from fiscal years 1990 through 2000 for four industries\u2014the  grocery store, drug store, funeral services, and gas station industries\u2014that  sell products and/or services directly to consumers.

We also collected and analyzed publicly available  data on the revenue of buyers of divested assets for the four industries and,  when public data were not available, directly from the buyers of divested  assets.  For this report, we focused on proposed consent orders that were  announced for public comment during fiscal years 1990 through 2000,  rather than consent orders made final during this period, because in most  cases at the point that FTC accepts a proposed consent order for public  comment, the parties are allowed to consummate the merger.

It acts to prevent  business practices that restrain competition and attempts to ensure that  the marketplace continues to provide a full range of product and service  options among which consumers can choose.  The Bureau of Competition  is FTC\u2019s antitrust arm.  FTC\u2019s Bureau of Competition and Bureau of  Economics have the responsibility for merger review.  The Bureau of  Economics helps to ensure that FTC considers the economic impact of its  actions.  To achieve this, the Bureau of Economics provides economic  analysis and support to the Bureau of Competition and the Commission in  carrying out FTC\u2019s antitrust responsibilities.", "FTC generally shares responsibility for enforcing the federal antitrust laws  with the Department of Justice\u2019s (DOJ) Antitrust Division. The federal  antitrust statutes are the Sherman Act, as amended (15 U.S.C. 1-7); the  Clayton Act, as amended (15 U.S.C. 12-27), which includes the Robinson- Patman Act; and the FTC Act, as amended (15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.).  The acts\u2019  objectives are to prevent anticompetitive behavior and preserve and  promote competition in the marketplace.  FTC is solely responsible for  enforcing the FTC Act, while DOJ is solely responsible for enforcing the  Sherman Act. Both FTC and the Antitrust Division are responsible for  enforcing Section 7 of the Clayton Act, which prohibits mergers and  acquisitions that may substantially lessen competition or tend to create a  monopoly in any market. FTC and the Antitrust Division have clearance  procedures to determine which agency will investigate a potential antitrust  violation.  The agencies decide which one will conduct a particular  investigation primarily by examining current agency expertise in the  industries at issue.", "The HSR Act, which added Section 7A to the Clayton Act, requires certain  parties to provide premerger notification of proposed acquisitions and  mergers prior to consummation to assist FTC and the Antitrust Division in  investigating whether a proposed acquisition would violate Section 7 of the  Clayton Act, in that the effect of such acquisition may be substantially to  lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly. The premerger  notification provisions of the HSR Act require companies exceeding certain  thresholds of company size and value of the transaction to notify FTC and  the Antitrust Division of the proposed merger transaction, submit  documents and other information to the agencies concerning the  transaction, and refrain from closing the transaction until a specific waiting  period has expired, or their request for early termination of the waiting  period has been granted. FTC and the Antitrust Division then have up to  30 days (15 days for cash tender offers and bankruptcy sales) from the time  of the filing of the proposed merger to review the filing and determine  whether to send the parties a request for additional information (a second  request).  A second request extends the waiting period to enable further  review. If FTC or the Antitrust Division sends a second request to the  parties, the parties have to wait 30 days (10 days for cash tender offers and  bankruptcy sales) from the date the parties substantially complied with the  request before consummating the acquisition to allow the agencies time to  complete the investigation and to determine whether to take law  enforcement action. If the reviewing agency does not send a second  request, or the parties have substantially complied with a second request,  and the waiting period has expired, or if the parties\u2019 request for early  termination of the waiting period has been granted, the parties can  consummate the merger or acquisition.", "For merger investigations conducted by FTC, prior to the expiration of the  waiting period, FTC staff are to seek to complete the analysis of likely  competitive effects of the transaction and prepare recommendations to the  FTC Commissioners on whether enforcement action is warranted.  If FTC  staff determine that a merger is likely to be anticompetitive, FTC has wide  discretion in choosing an effective remedy to provide relief that addresses  the competitive problems it identified and maintains or restores  competition, without unnecessarily limiting the parties\u2019 lawful objectives,  such as achieving efficiencies.  To meet this challenge, the agency can  choose any number of possible actions, including blocking the entire  transaction; requiring full or partial divestiture, either broadly or in specific  geographic markets; requiring contractual arrangements; or requiring some  form of behavioral relief, such as establishing firewalls in vertical  transactions to prevent the sharing of competitive information.", "In cases where FTC staff and the merging parties have negotiated a remedy  and agreed upon a proposed settlement, staff recommend that the  Commission accept the proposed order and place it on the public record to  enable the public to comment.  The public is given the opportunity to  provide comments for the record about the proposed consent order.  FTC  staff are to analyze the public comments received and may recommend  appropriate changes to the final complaint and order issued by FTC.  FTC  also may terminate the HSR waiting period and allow the merging parties to  begin to consummate the transaction, including any divestitures, if the  buyer is identified in the proposed order.  However, for consent orders in  which FTC has required a divestiture(s), and the buyer(s) of the divested  asset(s) is not identified in the proposed order, the merging parties must  subsequently submit an application to FTC requesting approval to divest  the assets to a proposed buyer(s) and await FTC approval before  consummating the divestiture.  These applications also must be placed on  the record for public comment generally for 30 days.  The staff analyze the  comments received and make recommendations to the Commission on  whether it should approve the divestiture application.

Specifically, it appears  that in 1996, based on lessons learned from past divestitures, FTC  developed preferences for how to structure divestitures and began to  modify its divestiture approaches.", "According to an April 1997 speech by the then Senior Deputy Director of  the Bureau of Competition, FTC had not been satisfied with the  effectiveness of past divestiture orders.  He said that FTC began a  retrospective study of nine divestiture orders selected to assess the  effectiveness of particular types of divestiture orders, which showed the  need for changes to the way FTC approached merger remedies.  He further  said that FTC staff had found that the divestiture process was less effective  than they would have hoped and \u201ccame to appreciate better the difficulties  in creating a viable divestiture package of assets that had not previously  been a stand-alone business\u201d\u2014a business that contains all the assets  needed to enable a buyer to be operational the day after purchasing the  assets, selling to all the same customers.", "By 1996, according to an October 1996 speech by the then Director of the  Bureau of Competition, FTC had begun to take steps to shorten the time  that it took to complete a divestiture because of FTC\u2019s desire to fashion  remedies that (1) restored competition more quickly and (2) reduced the  likelihood that assets would deteriorate while awaiting final action on the  proposed merger.  These steps included, among others, the identification  of up-front buyers and the requirement for the divestiture of \"broader asset  packages\" where assets are grouped into one divestiture package to ensure  continued marketability, viability, and competitiveness following the  merger.  In an April 1997 speech, the then Senior Deputy Director of the  Bureau of Competition noted that because of these and other steps, the  average time between the date a divestiture order is provisionally approved  and the ordered divestiture is approved dropped from 15 months in fiscal  year 1995 to 7 months in fiscal year 1996."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FTC Developed Preferences for Clean Sweeps, Single Buyers, and Up-front Buyers in the Mid-1990s", "paragraphs": ["FTC staff acknowledged that they have developed a preference for certain  practices in negotiating some divestiture orders, particularly among retail  industries, like grocery stores and gas stations.  Regarding clean sweeps,  single buyers, and up-front buyers, FTC staff said that all three approaches  tend to provide them greater assurance that the divestitures will help  restore or maintain competition at levels existing before the merger. \u201cAlthough the Division has not adopted this as a policy, we do consider clean sweep as an  option when we look at a divestiture package.  The obvious advantage to requiring a clean  sweep is that the sale of an ongoing business, as opposed to various stand-alone assets  pieced together, may provide greater assurance that the assets will be viable in the hands of  a suitable purchaser.  Such a policy also prevents the parties from choosing the least  attractive assets from each company for divestiture\u2026The potential disadvantage for  requiring a clean sweep is that it prevents the parties from realizing possible efficiencies by  integrating the different assets of both companies.\u201d", "Regarding up-front buyers, which FTC also refers to as buyers up-front,  FTC staff said that they have made greater use of up-front buyers because  the approach reduces the time for the divestiture(s) to take place and gives  them the opportunity to evaluate the marketability of the assets to be  divested with more concrete evidence.  According to FTC staff, the up-front  buyer approach also enables staff to better determine whether, among  other things, there is a viable buyer(s) for the proposed divestiture assets.   Additionally, as pointed out in various speeches by FTC staff, the up-front  buyer approach reduces the amount of time needed for the assets to be  divested because a buyer can be identified before the merger transaction  occurs\u2014a factor in grocery store divestitures and those of other retail  operations, where assets may quickly deteriorate during the search for a  buyer.

Because FTC's divestiture orders and related documents, such as the  analysis to aid public comment, typically do not indicate whether a  divestiture is a clean sweep, we asked FTC to designate which of the 131  markets involved clean sweep divestitures.  FTC provided data on 128  markets that showed that the number of clean sweep divestitures involving  grocery store mergers had become much more prevalent during fiscal years  1996 through 2000, the period in which FTC staff said that they had initiated  reforms.  Whereas about 33 percent (3 of 9) of the markets defined in  divestiture orders announced during fiscal years 1990 through 1995  involved clean sweep divestitures, about 75 percent (89 of 119) of the  markets involved clean sweep divestitures during fiscal years 1996 through  2000.

They said that recent  mergers include mergers of chains that are direct competitors in the same  geographic market, whereas in past years, merging parties purchased  certain stores from one another, not the entire chain.  They added that  because of chain-wide distribution efficiencies of divested stores, a single  buyer can operate divested assets more efficiently and easily.

Table 3 shows the  extent to which up-front buyers were used in grocery store divestiture  orders announced during fiscal years 1990 through 1995, fiscal years 1996  through 2000, and for the entire period.", "FTC staff told us that as FTC became more familiar with grocery store  mergers and the potential effect of long divestiture periods on the viability  of the grocery store assets to be divested, it became apparent that up-front  buyers were a material factor in making divestitures successful.  They said  that, in the early to mid-1990s, merging parties were given up to 12 months,  and sometimes longer, to find a buyer(s) for the divested assets after a  divestiture order became final, regardless of the industry in which the  merger was taking place.  Additionally, in a March 2002 FTC document  titled, \u201cFrequently Asked Questions About Merger Consent Order  Provisions,\u201d FTC staff noted that \u201c...supermarkets and other retail  operations (e.g., retail pharmacies) are particularly vulnerable to having  their assets deteriorate during the search for a post order buyer; this affects  the ability of the assets to be operated in a manner that maintains or  restores competition in the relevant market.\u201d  FTC staff told us that once  FTC determined with respect to grocery store mergers that, among other  things, the longer the merging parties have control of the assets, the more  likely it is that the assets will deteriorate, FTC established a preference for  up-front buyers, particularly in the retail sector.", "In our discussions with FTC staff about their use of clean sweeps, single  buyers, and up-front buyers, they said that grocery store divestitures that  were accepted by FTC 10 years ago had long divestiture periods and no  up-front buyers, but these divestitures would not likely be accepted today.   FTC staff told us that, in recent years, generally FTC\u2019s starting point for  settlement discussions with the merging parties in a grocery store merger is  a clean sweep divestiture with a single, up-front buyer.  According to FTC  staff, such a remedy ensures restoration of the status quo before the  merger. Additionally, FTC staff told us that it would take additional time  and considerable amount of evidence to convince FTC that competition  could be restored through selling a combination of the merging parties\u2019  assets to multiple buyers in a single geographic market.  In such cases, FTC  staff said they would have to analyze information on each individual store  and its role in the merging parties\u2019 overall operations.  FTC staff also noted  that the grocery store mergers in more recent years tended to be much  larger and involve more extensive geographic overlaps than previous  mergers.", "While FTC staff have said that FTC typically prefers up-front buyers in  divestiture orders involving grocery stores and sometimes in other retail  operations, they told us that they are willing to diverge from their  preference for clean sweep divestitures and single buyers when the  proposed divestiture will restore or maintain competition. A key example is  the Albertson\u2019s, Inc., and American Stores Company divestiture order,  which at the time it was announced for public comment in fiscal year 1999  was the largest retail divestiture ever required by FTC.   The order differed  from many recent divestiture orders in the grocery store industry in that  many of the markets involved the divestiture of a combination of selected  assets from both of the merging parties\u2014a practice sometimes referred to  as \u201cmix and match\u201d\u2014versus clean sweeps, and there were several multiple  buyer markets, that is markets in which several buyers were purchasing the  assets FTC ordered to be divested.  According to FTC staff, mix-and-match  divestitures require a more careful analysis of each retail location than  does the divestiture of only one of the merging parties stores because staff  must examine more closely whether the mixed assets can compete  effectively.  FTC must determine, for example, whether the mixed assets  will be capable of producing efficiencies and economies of scale and scope  comparable to those existing in the market before the merger.  FTC staff  estimated that the Albertson\u2019s and American divestiture order took at least  6 additional months to negotiate with the merging parties because of the  need to assess the mix and match approach and the geographic markets  where assets were divested to multiple buyers as well as to the buyers  purchasing assets in multiple geographic markets."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FTC\u2019s Use of Divestiture Practices Varied in Other Retail Industries", "paragraphs": ["There was a wide variation in the use of clean sweeps, single buyers, and/or  up-front buyers in the 15 divestiture orders FTC announced in the drug  store, funeral services, and gas station industries during fiscal years 1990  through 2000."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Drug Store Divestitures", "paragraphs": ["For the five drug store divestiture orders FTC announced during fiscal  years 1990 through 2000, all of the divestitures were to single buyers, but  the use of clean sweep divestitures and up-front buyers varied.

We also adjusted SBA\u2019s size standards to constant 2000 dollars.  (Appendix  II provides information on the adjusted SBA size standards.)  We then  determined the number of buyers in each of the periods that were below  the adjusted SBA size standard.  Additionally, to examine changes in the  size of the buyers, we compared the median of the average annual revenues  of the buyers for the two periods.

Under this practice, some grocery  wholesalers, per the divestiture agreement reached with FTC, have  purchased divested grocery store assets directly from the merging parties  and under the order provision, in turn, sold them to grocery store  operators.  Thus, a direct buyer (the wholesaler) sells the asset(s) to  indirect buyers (the grocery store operators).  According to grocery  wholesalers we interviewed, this practice has occurred in part because  wholesalers were losing market share due to increasing consolidation in  the grocery store industry.", "To determine if reselling the assets had an effect on the extent to which  smaller businesses participated in purchasing divested grocery store  assets, we performed a separate analysis.  Whereas in the analysis of direct  buyers, we considered the wholesalers as the buyers of divested assets, in  our analyses that included indirect buyers, we replaced the revenues of the  wholesalers with those of the buyers to which they resold the assets.   When we accounted for the effect of indirect buyers, there was still a  significant decline in smaller businesses participation in purchasing  divested assets after fiscal year 1996; however, the extent of the decline  was not as great.  Specifically, when the buyers who purchased the divested  assets indirectly from wholesalers were included in our analysis, the  overall median of the average annual revenues of 54 buyers of divested  grocery store assets for the fiscal years 1990 to 2000 time period was about  $208 million\u2014about 88 percent less than the overall median (about $1.8  billion) for direct buyers.

However, FTC  staff told us that FTC\u2019s role is to protect competition and consumers, not  particular competitors or businesses, whether large or small.

Regarding FTC\u2019s divestiture practices, FTC staff told us that FTC\u2019s  preference in retail industries for clean sweep divestitures combined with  its preference for single buyers could impact the ability of smaller  businesses to purchase divested assets, particularly in larger markets  where there may be a greater number of assets to be divested, especially  where economies of scale exist.  FTC staff also said that it is easier and  quicker for the merging parties to convince FTC that a clean sweep  divestiture to a single buyer will be successful than a clean sweep  divestiture to multiple buyers within a geographic market.  They  acknowledged that a larger package of divestiture assets may make it  difficult for smaller buyers to purchase the divested assets because they  might not have the financial strength to purchase all of the assets that have  to be divested in a geographic market.", "FTC staff and antitrust practitioners also told us that negotiating a  divestiture order is generally easier and quicker with a single, well- established chain as the buyer because FTC has to analyze the financial,  managerial, and operational strength of only one buyer, and the merging  parties have to negotiate with only one buyer.  Similarly, antitrust  practitioners said that FTC\u2019s up-front buyer preference may create a bias  against smaller businesses because the merging parties cannot  consummate the merger until a viable buyer(s) has been identified,  reviewed, and provisionally approved by FTC.  Antitrust practitioners told  us that because the merging parties want to consummate the merger  quickly and it may take longer to (1) convince FTC that a smaller business  is a viable buyer and (2) negotiate with a smaller business, the merging  parties generally would prefer larger, well-established buyers.  Additionally,  the practitioners said that for these reasons they are likely to advise their  clients to select a strong, well-established buyer that would clearly be  acceptable to FTC.  They added that the cost of delaying a merger while the  merging parties are waiting for FTC to approve a buyer can be very  expensive to the merging parties because of the delay in achieving the  potential efficiencies they sought through the merger.", "FTC staff and antitrust practitioners also told us that factors other than  clean sweeps, single buyers, and up-front buyers may impact the ability of  smaller buyers to purchase divested assets. For example, antitrust  practitioners said that FTC\u2019s preference for buyers that do not already have  a presence in the geographic market as well as FTC\u2019s definition of the  product and geographic markets may also impact the ability of smaller  businesses to purchase divested assets.  They told us that smaller  businesses interested in purchasing divested assets may be more likely to  be located in the geographic market where the assets are being divested.   According to FTC staff, if any business, large or small, interested in  purchasing the divested assets already has a significant presence in the  geographic market where the assets are being divested, it reduces the  chances of FTC approval because divesting to a market incumbent does not  replace the acquired firm and thus reduces the competitive effectiveness of  the divestiture.  Thus, according to FTC staff, FTC may not approve  proposed buyers that already have a significant presence in the geographic  market because this raises concerns about the anticompetitive effects of  the divestiture transaction, including an increase in concentration and  failure to maintain the number of market participants.  For example, in  fiscal year 1996, FTC did not approve a proposed buyer for a grocery store  in the Stop and Shop and Purity Supreme merger, because the proposed  buyer already had two stores relatively close to the store being divested.   However, FTC staff said that in certain instances smaller businesses  operating within the same geographic and product markets have been  found to be acceptable buyers.  Additionally, FTC staff and antitrust  practitioners told us that the size of the divestiture package and FTC staff\u2019s  definition of the geographic and product markets may affect the  opportunity for smaller businesses to purchase divested assets.  They said  that the larger the geographic market, as defined by FTC, the less  opportunity there may be for smaller businesses to purchase the divested  assets.", "The Food Marketing Institute (FMI) and the National Grocers Association  (NGA)\u2014the two largest associations that represent grocers\u2014have  submitted comments to FTC stating that FTC\u2019s clean sweep, single buyer,  and up-front buyer divestiture practices have hindered the ability of small  businesses to purchase divested assets.  Additionally, they said that FTC\u2019s  strong preference for buyers located outside the geographic market in  which the assets are to be divested have disadvantaged small businesses,  which are struggling to expand and keep pace with large corporations.   Several smaller buyers of divested grocery store assets also told us that  other factors, such as the merging parties\u2019 bidding process, create  additional challenges for smaller businesses in purchasing and maintaining  the viability of divested assets.

They also said that in several public statements,  FTC staff have noted that FTC does not have a preference in favor of large- chain buyers, or a preference against small chains, independents, or  wholesalers that will eventually spin off stores to other buyers.  For  example, in a March 2001 speech before the American Bar Association, the  then Acting Director of FTC\u2019s Bureau of Competition said that FTC neither  favors nor disfavors any particular category of purchaser.  According to the  speech, \u201c...the Commission\u2019s approach to supermarket divestitures has not  precluded smaller or local grocery stores from participating as buyers  because it believes that effective competitors come in all shapes and  sizes.\u201d  Additionally, the then Acting Director said that FTC is sensitive to  the fact that small supermarket chains often offer greater product variety  and choice than other supermarkets.  However, FTC staff told us that the  size of a possible buyer is a factor in determining the acceptability of that  buyer, but only to the extent that size affects the buyer\u2019s financial viability  and ability to operate the divested assets competitively.", "Some antitrust practitioners we interviewed also told us that they do not  perceive FTC as having a role in protecting small businesses.

Widespread  consolidation in the grocery store industry, driven by expected efficiency  gains from economies of size, has had a significant effect on the share of  total grocery stores sales accounted for by the largest food retailers.

In addition, it is not clear from the description of the  Study whether the authors, in evaluating the apparent failure of a remedy, considered  whether this was consistent with the lack of a need for a remedy in the first place.\u201d \"Studies such as this would be more useful contributions to the dialogue between the  agencies and the private bar if their methodology was fully discussed and disclosed prior to  the study, and the study included the participation (with appropriate confidentiality  constraints) of outside academics and practitioners.\u201d", "Given questions that have been raised about FTC\u2019s divestiture study, we  spoke with FTC staff about the benefits and cost of an updated, more  comprehensive study.  They acknowledged that another study might be  beneficial because FTC has not studied the effect of its recent approaches  on the viability of buyers of divested assets or on competition in the  marketplace.  Although they could not pinpoint the actual cost of doing  another study, they said that it could be labor-intensive and burdensome on  businesses.  FTC staff told us that the 1999 study was extremely labor  intensive and another study, especially one attempting to assess market  competition in each market, would require extensive resource allocations.   FTC staff said that they do not currently have resources to commit to such  a study at this time.  For example, in doing the 1999 study, FTC staff had to  first manually review all FTC actions, during the fiscal years 1990 through  1994 time period, to identify consent orders involving mergers and then,  determine which orders required divestitures.  They said that it might be  easier today because recent divestiture orders are more readily available  through FTC\u2019s Web site.  However, our review of divestiture orders  announced for public comment during fiscal years 1990 through 2000  revealed that the Web site does not provide a way to readily identify all of  the divestiture orders FTC announced or made final each year.", "Additionally, FTC staff told us that they would be concerned that such an  effort could be burdensome on businesses.  For example, they said that  they would have to rely on buyers of divested assets to obtain information  post-divestiture, and currently, buyers are not parties to divestiture orders.   Thus, currently buyers are not required to provide information to FTC post- divestiture.  In performing the 1999 study, FTC staff relied on the  cooperation of buyers to collect information for its divestiture study and,  as noted previously, 13 of the 50 buyers (26 percent) did not participate in  the study.  However, FTC is currently examining whether it should take  steps to overcome this problem.  In June 2002, FTC began holding a series  of public workshops to obtain insights into its merger remedy process.  The  workshops are designed to address, among other things, whether FTC  should require the buyers of divested assets to report on their operations of  the divested assets to permit FTC to better determine whether its remedy  provisions have achieved the objective of maintaining or restoring  competition in the relevant market.  The workshops also will consider  what any such reporting requirements should entail, how long they should  be in place, and the impact of any such obligations on potential buyers\u2019  interest in acquiring divestiture assets.", "FTC officials have frequently noted in speeches that if a merger does not  result in restored competition, the remedy is not a success.  For example,  in a March 2001 speech, the then Acting Director of the Bureau of  Competition said that consumers should not bear the risk of an inadequate  or ineffective remedy.  \u201cA merger is forever\u2026 and, therefore, so is the harm  caused by an incomplete remedy.\u201d  These views are consistent with the  then Chairman\u2019s statement in a February 2000 speech: \u201cThe law is clear that  divestiture and other restructuring remedies should not be adopted unless  they are likely to restore fully the competition lost as a result of the  merger.\u201d  He further said, \u201cEnforcement agencies should not be expected  and would not be justified in making the same mistake over again.  If  restructuring in a particular industry and in similar circumstances has been  unsuccessful, enforcement officials have a responsibility to determine  why.\u201d   Moreover, FTC in explaining antitrust laws has said that a merger  that lessens competition can lead to higher prices, reduced availability of  goods or services, lower quality of products, and less innovation.  Despite  this recognition, FTC has not fully evaluated whether the divestitures it has  approved have achieved its goal of maintaining or restoring competition in  the marketplace."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["FTC\u2019s mission is, in part, to prevent business practices that are  anticompetitive, deceptive, or unfair to consumers.  FTC attempts to  achieve its mission through preventing anticompetitive mergers from  taking place.  FTC\u2019s approaches to merger remedies have evolved over  time.  In fiscal year 1996, based on past experiences and preliminary  findings of its divestiture study, FTC developed preferences for how to  structure divestitures and began to modify its divestiture approaches.  FTC  has not studied the effect of its recent approaches on the viability of buyers  of divested assets or on competition in the marketplace.  For example, in  the grocery store industry, clean sweep divestitures, single buyers, and up- front buyers have been used with greater frequency in the late 1990s\u2014a  period not covered in FTC\u2019s 1999 divestiture study.  Because FTC has not  systematically reviewed divestiture orders made final after fiscal year 1994,  FTC does not know how these practices have impacted the viability of the  buyers of divested assets or prices and/or innovation in the marketplace\u2014 key factors FTC uses to measure competition.  Consequently, FTC cannot  state that recent divestiture orders have, among other things, maintained or  restored competition in the affected markets, or that smaller buyers  continue to be as competitive as their larger counterparts in operating the  divested assets.", "Although the cost of doing a study of its recent divestiture orders could be  considerable, such a study would give FTC the opportunity to develop and  design a methodology to (1) overcome some of the limitations encountered  during the earlier study; (2) provide greater insights into the impact of its  divestiture preferences on potential buyers, including smaller businesses;  and (3) better examine the short and long-term effects of various  divestiture preferences on the markets in which divestitures take place.   FTC staff acknowledged the benefit of conducting a more rigorous and  comprehensive study to determine whether recent merger remedies are  achieving their intent\u2014to adequately maintain or restore competition and  protect consumers so that consumers have the benefit of low prices and  good product variety.  Similarly, antitrust practitioners have said that  collecting relevant economic data and including the data within the scope  of future studies would place FTC in a better position to reach firm  conclusions regarding the success or failure of its divestiture practices and  to shape future divestiture orders.", "We recognize the difficulties and costs inherent in conducting an evaluation  that assesses the impact of FTC\u2019s divestiture practices on the marketplace.   However, the more that economic data are brought to bear on the questions  of how FTC\u2019s divestiture practices impact the marketplace, including  smaller businesses, the more confident FTC can be that divestitures are  having the intended effect of maintaining or restoring competition.  We also  recognize that the need for and benefits of conducting the analysis must be  balanced against the costs of collecting the data as well as balanced against  any logistical and legal implications.  FTC could not provide us with an  estimate of the costs to perform a more comprehensive divestiture study,  nor could we estimate the costs.  While we are aware that the costs could  be significant, we believe that the lack of a more rigorous and  comprehensive study places FTC at risk of not being in the position to fully  understand the effects of its divestiture practices, including possible  negative effects, on competition in the marketplace\u2014a risk that FTC  officials have said that FTC cannot afford to take."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation", "paragraphs": ["To ensure that FTC has complete and up-to-date information on the  effectiveness of divestitures in industries in the retail sector, we  recommend that the Chairman of FTC direct the Bureaus of Competition  and Economics to undertake a study of the impact of divestiture orders  made final since fiscal year 1994 that require divestitures in the retail sector  on (1) the viability of buyers of divested assets and (2) competition in the  marketplace.  If the findings show that FTC's intended results have not  been achieved, we further recommend that FTC explore expanding the  study to include divestiture orders for other sectors of the economy that  have been impacted by changes to FTC divestiture practices during the  mid-1990s."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In commenting on our report, FTC said that the report adds important  information about the Commission\u2019s role in enforcing antitrust laws related  to mergers and should lead to further improvement in the Commission\u2019s  merger enforcement efforts.

This information  describes the impetus for Congress\u2019 passage of the HSR Act and reiterated  that FTC is taking certain actions to seek public input on merger remedy  issues, as discussed in our report.

We also obtained information on the nature of comments  FTC received pertinent to these practices in the four industries as well as  comments on how they impacted the ability of small businesses to  purchase divested assets.  As agreed with your staff, we focused on  divestitures required by consent orders that FTC announced for public  comment between fiscal years 1990 through 2000 for four industries\u2014 grocery store, drug store, funeral services, and gas station industries\u2014that  sell products and/or services directly to consumers. We focused on  proposed consent orders that were announced for public comment during  fiscal years 1990 through 2000, rather than consent orders made final  during this period, because in most cases, at the point that FTC accepts a  proposed consent order for public comment, the parties are allowed to  consummate their merger.  Our work was limited to publicly available  information because, according to FTC, under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act  (HSR Act) of 1976, FTC is prohibited from disclosing information provided  by parties to merger transactions.", "To address these objectives, we performed our work at FTC headquarters  in Washington, D.C.  We also contacted officials from various associations  that represent or deal with small and/or independent businesses\u2014the  National Grocers Association (NGA), the Food Marketing Institute (FMI),  the National Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA), the National  Funeral Directors Association (NFDA), the Petroleum Marketers  Association of America (PMAA), the National Federation of Independent  Business (NFIB), the National Business Association (NBA), the National  Small Business United (NSBU), the SCORE Association (SCORE), and the  U.S. Chamber of Commerce.  In addition, we obtained and reviewed  relevant documents prepared by and discussed FTC\u2019s divestiture practices  with antitrust practitioners\u2014attorneys and economists in private practice  who specialize in antitrust issues\u2014academicians and officials with the  Small Business Administration (SBA).", "To address the first objective concerning the history of FTC\u2019s clean sweep  divestiture, single buyer, and up-front buyer practices within the context of  FTC\u2019s overall merger remedies, and the circumstances under which these  practices have been used, we met with staff from FTC\u2019s Bureaus of  Competition and Economics and its Office of General Counsel and  interviewed a former FTC Commissioner and former staff.  We also  reviewed relevant FTC public speeches, articles, and documents prepared  by current and former FTC Commissioners and staff between the years  1995 and 2002 pertaining to FTC\u2019s divestiture practices.  Furthermore, we  obtained and reviewed relevant documents prepared by and talked with  antitrust practitioners, academicians, associations that represent small  and/or independent businesses, and officials from SBA to obtain their  views of FTC\u2019s divestiture practices. In addition, we met with an official of  the Department of Justice\u2019s (DOJ) Antitrust Division to obtain general  information on DOJ\u2019s merger remedies.", "To address the second objective concerning the extent of FTC\u2019s use of the  clean sweep divestiture, single buyer, and up-front buyer practices in the  grocery store, drug store, funeral services, and gas station industries, we  analyzed FTC consent orders that required a divestiture(s), also called  divestiture orders, that were announced for public comment during fiscal  years 1990 through 2000.  Because FTC did not have a publicly available  listing of the divestiture orders announced for public comment during  fiscal years 1990 through 2000, we reviewed several sources of information.   To identify divestiture orders FTC announced for public comment during  fiscal years 1990 through 1995, we reviewed FTC decision books for  calendar years 1989 through 1995 to identify all divestiture orders issued by  FTC during that period.  We then reviewed FTC press statements  announcing each of the proposed divestiture orders to determine the fiscal  year in which FTC announced the order.  To identify divestiture orders FTC  announced for public comment during fiscal years 1996 through 2000, we  reviewed a summary of FTC\u2019s Bureau of Competition activity for fiscal year  1996 through March 31, 2000.  We then reviewed FTC monthly actions  announced for public comment and posted on FTC\u2019s Web site for the period  April 1, 2000, through September 30, 2000, to identify the divestiture orders  FTC announced for public comment during April 2000 through September  2000.  Finally, we reviewed FTC\u2019s HSR Act annual reports to Congress for  fiscal years 1990 through 2000.", "After we identified the 153 divestiture orders that were announced for  public comment during fiscal years 1990 through 2000, we reviewed them  to determine which ones required divestitures in the grocery store, drug  store, funeral services, and gas station industries.  We determined that  during the 11-year period, FTC announced for public comment 33  divestiture orders that required divestitures in the four industries.   However, we eliminated two funeral services divestiture orders from our  review because, according to FTC staff, as of June 30, 2002, the divestitures  had not taken place.", "After we identified the divestiture orders for the four industries, we used a  structured data collection instrument to gather information from each of  the 31 divestiture orders and related documents, such as press releases  announcing a proposed divestiture order, complaints, analyses to aid public  comment, final divestiture orders, modifications to the orders, divestiture  applications, and FTC letters approving divestiture applications.   Specifically, we collected information on, among other things, (1) the date  FTC announced the divestiture order for public comment; (2) the  geographic market in which FTC required a divestiture; (3) the buyer(s) of  the divested assets in each geographic market, both the \u201cdirect\u201d buyers\u2014 buyers that purchased the divested assets directly from the merging  parties\u2014and the indirect buyers\u2014third parties that purchased the assets  from direct buyers of divested assets, generally a wholesaler; (4) whether  the buyers were identified in the divestiture order at the time FTC  announced it for public comment; and (5) whether the divestiture order  required a single buyer and/or an up-front buyer.  Because FTC's divestiture  orders and related documents typically do not indicate whether a  divestiture is a clean sweep, we relied on clean sweep data provided by  FTC.", "Because FTC speeches about its merger remedies indicated that FTC began  to make changes in its divestiture practices during fiscal year 1996, we  focused our analysis of the use of clean sweeps, single buyers, and up-front  buyers on two periods\u2014the period from fiscal years 1990 through 1995,  before FTC started to make these changes, and fiscal years 1996 through  2000, the period during which FTC staff announced that FTC had begun to  make changes.  We determined the extent to which these practices were  used in each of the two periods for the 31 divestiture orders included in our  review.  Additionally, because according to FTC staff each industry  operates differently, we performed separate analyses for each of the four  industries.", "To address the third objective concerning the level of small business  participation in purchasing divested assets in the four industries and the  factors that may explain the level of small business participation, we  obtained revenue data for the buyers of the divested assets, both the direct  and indirect buyers.  Because according to FTC staff, due to confidentiality  restrictions, they could not provide us with the revenue data for the buyers  of the divested assets, we obtained the revenue data from several sources.   For publicly held buyers, we obtained the data from public sources, such as  the Securities and Exchange Commission filings and Valueline Magazine.   For privately held buyers for which we could not locate the data through  publicly available sources, we contacted the buyers directly to obtain the  data.  When possible, we obtained the revenue data for the 3 most recent  completed fiscal years prior to the buyers being identified in the proposed  divestiture orders or in the divestiture applications.  If revenue data were  not available for the 3 most recent completed fiscal years, we obtained the  data for the prior 2 years or year.  For the direct buyer analyses, we were  not able to obtain revenue data for 3 of the buyers of divested grocery store  assets, and for the analyses that included direct and indirect buyers, we  were not able to obtain revenue data for 5 of the buyers.", "Because there were so few buyers of divested assets in the drug store,  funeral services, and gas station industries during the period, we limited  our analysis to the grocery store industry. According to FTC staff, SBA  officials, grocery industry officials, and representatives of relevant small  business associations, there is no generally accepted standard by which  one could measure the relative size of businesses using revenues. They  acknowledged that SBA's definition of a small business, which ranged from  $13.5 million to $20 million in receipts from 1990 through 2000 for the  grocery store industry, might be one indicator.  However, they told us that  SBA's threshold for a small grocery store business is too low given the  relative size of grocery store businesses.", "Because there appeared to be no generally accepted definition of a small  grocery store business, we used two approaches to determine the level of  smaller business participation in purchasing divested grocery store assets  in fiscal years 1990 through 1996 and fiscal years 1997 through 2000.  We  used these two time periods for the size of buyers analyses, instead of the  fiscal years 1990 through 1995 and fiscal years 1996 through 2000 time  periods that we used in our analyses of FTC\u2019s divestiture practices,  primarily because fiscal year 1997 is the first full fiscal year after FTC began  altering its approach to divestitures. Additionally, there were too few  observations in the fiscal years 1990 through 1995 period.  Our analyses of  the size of the buyers is based on the dates of the merging parties\u2019  divestiture applications or, in the case of up-front buyers, the dates of the  proposed divestiture orders\u2014generally the point at which FTC receives the  revenue data for the proposed buyers to include in its review of the viability  of the proposed buyers.  Because FTC did not start to use up-front buyers  in grocery store divestitures until fiscal year 1996, divestitures in the earlier  period took much longer to occur.  Additionally, fiscal year 1997 is the first  full fiscal year after FTC began altering its approach to divestitures.", "In regard to the two approaches we used to determine the level of smaller  business participation in purchasing divested assets, we first analyzed the  median of the average annual revenues of the buyers.  Specifically, we  calculated the average annual revenues of each of the buyers of divested  grocery store assets using the buyers\u2019 3 years revenues, when available,  prior to their purchase of the divested assets in constant 2000 dollars.  We  then computed the median of the average annual revenues for all the  buyers for the two periods and for fiscal years 1990 through 2000.  We used  the overall median of the buyers\u2019 average annual revenues for fiscal years  1990 through 2000 as a benchmark and determined the number of buyers in  each of the periods that were below the overall median.  We considered  buyers below the overall median to be \u201csmaller.\u201d", "Second, we used SBA\u2019s size standard for a small grocery store business at  the time the buyers of divested assets were either identified in the  divestiture order or in the divestiture application to determine the extent to  which buyers in both periods did or did not meet SBA's thresholds.   However, we used the buyers\u2019 average annual revenues in constant 2000  dollars before they purchased the divested assets as a proxy for receipts,  because we were unable to obtain data on the buyers\u2019 receipts.  We also  adjusted SBA\u2019s size standards to constant 2000 dollars.  We then determined  if there was a statistically significant change in the number of buyers that  met the adjusted SBA thresholds for the two periods.", "Additionally, to examine changes in the size of the buyers, we compared  the median of the average annual revenues of the buyers for the two  periods and determined whether differences in the medians were  statistically significant.  (Appendix II provides more detailed information  on our approaches for determining the level of smaller business  participation in purchasing divested assets in the grocery store industry.)", "As part of our work addressing the factors that may explain the level of  small business participation in purchasing divested assets in the four retail  industries included in our review, we interviewed staff from FTC\u2019s Bureaus  of Competition and Economics and its Office of General Counsel.  We also  interviewed antitrust practitioners and academicians to obtain their views  on factors that may explain a decline in the level of small business  participation in purchasing divested assets.  In addition, we reviewed  relevant articles to determine factors that may explain the level of small  business participation.  Unless provided in a public comment, we could not  obtain information on small businesses that may have attempted to  purchase divested assets but were not selected or approved as a buyer.", "To address the fourth objective concerning FTC\u2019s efforts to gauge the  success or failure of its divestiture approaches and the impact of its  approaches on the marketplace, especially small businesses, we reviewed  FTC\u2019s 1999 Divestiture Study and interviewed and reviewed relevant  speeches and documents prepared by current and former FTC  Commissioners and staff and antitrust practitioners.  Specifically, we  reviewed the study to determine whether it was methodologically sound  and contextually sophisticated.  We also interviewed and reviewed  documents prepared by economists who consult merging parties and  academic experts to obtain their views on FTC\u2019s 1999 Divestiture Study and  how FTC should measure the success of its divestiture approaches.", "To obtain information on the nature of comments FTC received pertinent to  its clean sweep divestiture, single buyer, and up-front buyer practices and  how these practices impact the ability of small businesses to purchase  divested assets, we reviewed FTC public case files for the 31 divestiture  orders included in our review to identify the public comments FTC  received concerning the divestiture orders and divestiture applications.   FTC staff told us that in some cases, the commenter requests that their  comments be kept confidential.  FTC keeps the confidential comments in  nonpublic files.  We did not review the nonpublic files nor did we verify that  the public files contained all of the nonconfidential public comments  received by FTC.  We relied on FTC to provide us with the information.  We  reviewed each of the 1,902 public comments contained in the files and,  when available, FTC\u2019s responses to the comments to determine if they  related to the ability of small businesses to purchase divested assets due to  FTC\u2019s divestiture practices.", "In addition, we interviewed FTC staff to obtain information on their  process for obtaining public comments and to determine whether FTC had  received any complaints, outside of the public comment process,  concerning its clean sweep divestiture, single buyer, and up-front buyer  practices and how these practices impact the ability of small businesses to  purchase divested assets. To determine if associations that represent small  and independent businesses had concerns related to the impact of FTC\u2019s  divestiture practices on the ability of small businesses to purchase divested  assets, we also interviewed representatives from 10 associations whose  membership in general, consists of the following:   NGA is the national trade association representing retail and wholesale  grocers that comprise the independent sector of the food distribution  industry.", "FMI conducts programs in research, education, industry relations, and  public affairs on behalf of 2,300 food retailers and wholesalers in the  United States and around the world.

We did not have enough buyers in the drug store, funeral services, and gas  station industries to analyze statistically the differences in the level of small  business participation in purchasing divested assets in these industries  from fiscal years 1990 through 2000. Therefore, we limited our analysis to  the grocery store industry.", "We used two approaches to determine the level of smaller business  participation in purchasing divested grocery store assets in fiscal years  1990 through 1996 and fiscal years 1997 through 2000.  The analysis was  done using these two time periods primarily because fiscal year 1997 was  the first full fiscal year after FTC began altering its approach to divestitures  and began increasingly using clean sweep, single buyer, and up-front buyer  divestiture practices in the grocery store industry\u2014practices that may  impact the level of smaller business participation in purchasing divested  assets.

We then computed the overall median of the average annual  revenues for all the buyers for fiscal years 1990 through 2000. Using the  overall median of the buyers\u2019 average annual revenues for fiscal years 1990  through 2000 as a benchmark, we determined the number of buyers in each  of the two periods\u2014fiscal years 1990 through 1996 and fiscal years 1997  through 2000\u2014that were below the overall median.  We considered buyers  with average annual revenues below the overall median to be \u201csmaller.\u201d", "To determine if the changes in the level of smaller business participation in  purchasing the divested assets in the two time periods were statistically  significant, we used the Fisher Exact test (in MegaStat, by J.B. Orris, Butler  University), which compares the percentage of smaller buyers in each time  period.  The results, presented in table 4, indicate that the percentage of  smaller buyers FTC approved to purchase divested assets in the grocery  industry during fiscal years 1997 through 2000 was significantly less than  the percentage of smaller buyer approved during fiscal years 1990 through  1996, when smaller businesses were both direct buyers and indirect buyers  of divested grocery store assets.", "Second, we used the Small Business Administration\u2019s (SBA) size standard  for a small grocery store business to identify smaller buyers.  We used the  buyers\u2019 average annual revenues in constant 2000 dollars before they  purchased the divested assets as a proxy for receipts, because we were  unable to obtain data on the buyers\u2019 receipts.  We also adjusted SBA\u2019s size  standard to constant 2000 dollars.  Table 5 shows SBA\u2019s size standard in  current and in constant 2000 dollars for each year for the fiscal years 1990  through 2000 time period.  We then determined the number of direct and  indirect buyers of divested grocery store assets in each of the two periods  that were below the adjusted SBA size standard for the grocery store  industry.  The results, presented in table 6, indicate that the percentage of  smaller buyers FTC approved to purchase divested assets in the grocery  industry during fiscal years 1997 through 2000 was significantly less than  the percentage of smaller buyer approved during fiscal years 1990 through  1996 when smaller businesses were both direct and indirect buyers of  divested grocery store assets.", "Additionally, to examine changes in the size of the buyers, for both the  direct and the indirect buyers, we calculated the overall medians of the  average annual revenues for fiscal years 1990 through 1996 and fiscal years  1997 through 2000. We then compared the overall medians of the annual  revenues of the buyers for the two time periods.

The market must be  substantially concentrated after the merger, with the merger substantially  increasing concentration, and it must be difficult for new firms to enter the  market in the near-term to provide effective competition.  The majority of  mergers that raise antitrust concerns are horizontal mergers.  According to  FTC staff and Antitrust Division officials, the joint Horizontal Merger  Guidelines accurately outline how the agencies generally conduct their  analysis of proposed mergers.  The guidelines were originally developed by  DOJ in 1968 and were updated in 1982 when FTC and DOJ issued separate  statements and again in 1984 by the DOJ.  The DOJ and the FTC issued joint  Horizontal Merger Guidelines in 1992.  In 1997, the agencies amended and  expanded the efficiencies section of the guidelines. The unifying theme  of the guidelines is that mergers should not be permitted to create or  enhance market power or facilitate its exercise.  The guidelines define a  seller\u2019s market power as the ability to profitably maintain selling prices  above competitive levels for a significant period of time.  Similarly, a  buyer\u2019s market power is defined as the ability to profitably maintain buying  prices below competitive levels for a significant period of time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FTC\u2019s Analysis of Proposed Mergers in Certain Retail Industries", "paragraphs": ["The Horizontal Merger Guidelines outline the five-step analytical process  the FTC and the Antitrust Division use to determine whether a merger is  likely to substantially lessen competition and, ultimately, whether to  challenge a merger.

FTC staff told us that investigations are extraordinarily fact- specific.  For example, supermarkets constitute a differentiated product  market.  No two supermarkets or chains are the same.  Each store sells  similar or the same products, but each store competes differently on price,  level of service, and has different direct competitors.

As FTC staff are reviewing the  transaction, they are to invite the merging parties to discuss the  competitive problem(s) and potential remedies to address the problem(s).", "FTC may decide that no remedy, short of blocking the transaction, will fully  and effectively resolve the competitive concerns.  FTC may also decide that  to resolve the competitive concerns one of the merging parties must divest  all of its assets in a single geographic market, or that a partial divestiture  would be acceptable.  Additionally, the anticompetitive effects of a merger  may be remedied through contractual arrangements, such as the licensing  of intellectual property or a short-term supply agreement.  Alternatively,  FTC may decide to use some form of behavioral relief, such as establishing  firewalls in vertical mergers, to prevent the sharing of competitive  information.  Finally, the anticompetitive effects of some mergers may be  addressed with a combination of these remedies.  According to FTC staff,  the remedy is based on the particular facts of the case.", "In response to FTC\u2019s concerns, the merging parties might attempt to solve  the competitive problem(s), abandon the transaction, or pursue the case  through litigation.

Specifically, she said that FTC staff generally consider   whether the remedy is likely to protect, promote, or restore competition  in the affected market.  For example, in the case of a remedy involving  divestiture of assets, FTC determines whether the buyer is obtaining  sufficient assets, and the right kind of assets, to be able to create and  operate a successful, competitive business, and whether that buyer has  sufficient expertise, experience, incentives, and resources to  accomplish its goal of maintaining or restoring competition in the  relevant markets;  whether efficiencies justify restructuring, rather than condemning, a   the complexity of a proposed remedy; and  whether its acceptance of a restructuring remedy might have  implications for future matters.  For example, according to the March  2000 speech, when FTC accepts a restructuring remedy, parties to  subsequent proposed mergers tend to insist on a similar resolution to  the competitive problems raised by  their transactions, although FTC  may view the matters as distinguishable on factual or economic  grounds."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Approval Process for Proposed Consent Agreement", "paragraphs": ["FTC staff negotiate a proposed consent agreement with the merging  parties.

For an agreement containing a proposed order to be approved subject to  public comment, a majority of the Commissioners must vote to accept the  agreement.  In general, if the Commission votes to accept the agreement  subject to public comment, the HSR Act waiting period is terminated, and  the parties can consummate the merger.  In consent agreements that  require up-front buyers, the divestitures also may be consummated, but the  divestiture must include a clause requiring its rescission if FTC does not  give final approval to the proposed consent order.  The merging parties  generally can consummate the transaction as soon as they are notified of  FTC action.  This notification occurs before the public announcement,  which generally occurs within a few days of the Commission\u2019s vote to  accept the agreement.", "Although not statutorily required, FTC places the consent agreement along  with an analysis to aid public comment on the public record, generally for a  30-day comment period, in which the public is invited to comment on the  merger and the proposed relief.  At end of the comment period, FTC staff  are to analyze the comments received and forward a second set of  recommendations to the Commission on whether the agency should issue  the final consent order.  According to FTC staff, typically the Commission  accepts the consent agreement and issues a complaint and decision and  order.  They told us that it is highly unusual for FTC to receive new  antitrust-related information during the public comment period that staff  had not already considered as part of their investigation.

During fiscal years 1990 through 2000, FTC announced 192 proposed  consent orders involving mergers for public comment, of which 153  required divestitures.  FTC has the authority to decide the extent of the  divestiture.  A divestiture can range from a partial divestiture to a  divestiture of an on-going business.  Table 10 shows that most (about 80  percent) of the consent orders involving mergers that FTC announced for  public comment during fiscal years 1990 through 2000 required divestiture  of assets.  (Appendix V provides information on the 153 consent orders  requiring divestitures that FTC announced for public comment during fiscal  years 1990 through 2000.)", "According to FTC staff, FTC generally requires divestitures in the  geographic and product markets where the merging parties have  competitive overlaps and FTC has competitive concerns.  However, it is  within FTC\u2019s power to require divestiture of a greater set of assets than  those which participate in the overlap markets in order to effectively  replace competition.  According to FTC staff, sometimes the buyers of the  divested assets will need other ancillary assets in order to effectively  restore competition.  Without these ancillary assets the buyer will not be  able to replicate the economies of scale of the firm that has been acquired.   In other cases, these additional assets will be necessary to give the buyer  both the incentive and ability to fully restore competition.  FTC staff told us  that the merging parties generally are the first to respond to staff\u2019s  concerns by proposing appropriate assets to be divested.", "According to FTC staff, an acceptable divestiture package is one that  maintains or restores competition in the relevant market.  FTC staff have  said that the divestiture of an entire business of either the acquired or  acquiring firm relating to the markets in which there is concern about  anticompetitive effects, is most likely to maintain or restore competition in  the relevant market, and thus will usually be an acceptable divestiture  package.  FTC has issued orders that require divestitures of less than the  entire business operating in, or producing for, the relevant market.  In those  cases, FTC concluded that the assets to be divested were sufficient to allow  the buyer of the assets to begin to compete in the market immediately and  to remedy the likely or actual anticompetitive effects of the challenged  acquisition.  According to FTC staff, the burden is on the merging parties to  provide concrete and convincing evidence that the asset package is  sufficient to allow the proposed buyer, whether large or small, to operate in  a manner that maintains or restores competition in the relevant market.", "FTC also generally requires that a divestiture be absolute.  This means that  the merging parties are to have no continuing ties to the divested business  or assets, no continuing relationship with the buyer, and no financial stake  in the buyer\u2019s success.  According to FTC staff, divestiture proposals in  which the buyer intends to rely on the merging parties to finance the  divestiture, or where the proposal includes performance payments by the  buyer generally have been rejected.", "For consent orders in which FTC has required a divestiture(s), and the  buyer(s) of the divested asset(s) is not identified in the proposed order, the  merging parties must submit an application to FTC requesting approval to  divest the asset(s) to a proposed buyer(s) and await FTC approval before  consummating the divestiture.  According to FTC staff, the more  information the divestiture application contains about the transaction and  the proposed buyer, the more likely the approval can be obtained quickly.   The application must show how the proposed divestiture will remedy the  competitive problem identified in FTC\u2019s complaint and restore competition.   Additionally, there must be a final signed contract for a divestiture  application to be sufficient.  The contract should conform to the  requirements of the consent order or, if it does not, explain how the  respondent will satisfy the order\u2019s requirements.  The divestiture proposal  should demonstrate that the proposed buyer will be an effective competitor  after the divestiture.  The proposed buyers of the divested assets are to  provide directly to the FTC information on their (1) financial capability,  including the financing in place both to pay for the acquisition and to fund  working capital and other needs associated with an on-going business;  (2) technical and management skills; and (3) business plans and other  evidence of the proposed buyer\u2019s intention and ability to compete.", "In evaluating whether a proposed buyer has the financial resources to  remain a vigorous competitor in the market, FTC staff are to examine the  proposed buyer\u2019s commitment to remain in the market by analyzing its past  operations and business plans as well as its future business plans for the  divested assets.  The staff also will likely talk with industry members  familiar with the proposed buyer, such as competitors, suppliers, and  customers.  The staff also are to evaluate the proposed buyer\u2019s experience  and expertise to operate effectively in the market.  They also may examine  information on the proposed buyer\u2019s debt structure to determine whether  the transaction is very risky for the company.  However, information on  debt structure is not collected for each buyer.  FTC staff told us that the  information provided by each buyer varies on a case-by-case basis.  FTC  does not use a standard form or checklist to collect information from  buyers because the facts of each case and, thus, the requirements for  information from the buyers differ.", "FTC frequently requires that the merging parties find an acceptable  buyer(s) for the assets to be divested and that it execute an acceptable  purchase agreement and all the necessary ancillary agreements with the  buyer(s) before the FTC accepts the proposed consent order for public  comment.  FTC staff refers to such a buyer as an up-front buyer or buyer  up-front.  According to FTC staff, an up-front buyer may be the best way to  ensure a successful divestiture in the supermarket industry because the  approach enables staff to evaluate the marketability of the divestiture  assets with more concrete evidence and better determine whether, among  other things, there is a viable buyer(s) for the proposed divestiture assets.   Additionally, FTC staff told us that an up-front buyer  reduces the amount of time needed for the assets to be divested because  a buyer can be identified before the merger transaction occurs\u2014a factor  in supermarket mergers and those of other retail operations, where  assets may quickly deteriorate during the search for a buyer; and  generally increases the likelihood that a buyer will restore the  competition that otherwise would be lost through the merger.", "To preserve FTC\u2019s ability to reject an up-front buyer following the public  comment period, consent orders accepted subject to public comment  require the merging parties to include a rescission provision in any  divestiture contracts in which closing on the divestiture will occur before  final FTC approval of the consent order.  According to FTC staff, as of June  30, 2002, FTC had not ordered rescission of an up-front divestiture.   FTC  staff told us that there have been instances in which the buyers will  purchase the assets only after the final order has been approved.   Additionally, they said that one FTC order, not in the retail industry,  specified that the assets could not be divested until the order was final.", "Amount of Time to Divest Assets Divestiture orders specify the timeframe in which the assets must be  divested.  The merging parties must find a buyer(s), negotiate a contract(s),  submit the contract(s) to the FTC for its approval, and complete the  divestiture(s) within that time.  If there is an up-front buyer, the divestiture  is required almost immediately upon consummation of the subject merger  and FTC approves the up-front buyer when it issues the final consent order.   In other cases, however, the merging parties must submit their divestiture  application(s) to FTC early enough to allow for the 30-day public comment  period required by FTC rules. According to FTC staff, to satisfy its  obligation to divest by the date required in the order, the merging parties  have to actually consummate the sale by that date.  Executing an  agreement or filing an application for the FTC\u2019s approval by that date does  not satisfy the obligation to divest by that date.", "FTC may appoint trustees or independent auditors in three situations.   First, most orders authorize FTC to appoint a trustee to divest the assets if  the merging parties fail to divest them within the time frame required by the  consent order. In addition, where there is a hold separate order, FTC  appoints an independent auditor to ensure the independence of the assets  to be divested when they must be operated separately from the other assets  of the merging parties until they are sold.  Finally, where there is to be a  short-term continuing relationship after the divestiture, FTC may appoint a  trustee to ensure that the merging parties fully perform their  responsibilities by the order.", "Some orders authorize a divestiture trustee to divest a different or larger  package of assets, referred to as a crown jewel, if the assets are not  divested on time.  According to FTC staff, a crown jewel is used where  there is risk that, if the respondent fails to divest the original divestiture  package on time or if the original divestiture does not take place for any  reason, a divestiture trustee may be needed to divest an expanded or  alternative package of assets to accomplish the divestiture remedy.  FTC  staff have said that a crown jewel provision may be particularly valuable  when there are some uncertainties about the marketability or viability of  the initial divestiture package.  FTC staff also have said that a crown jewel  provision increases the incentive for the merging parties to accomplish the  divestiture within the time required by FTC\u2019s divestiture order, and it  provides a bigger, and presumably more attractive, package for the trustee  in the event the merging parties are unsuccessful in divesting the assets.", "Asset Maintenance and Hold Separate Agreements A consent order may include an asset maintenance agreement that requires  the merging parties to maintain the viability, marketability, and  competitiveness of the assets.  FTC also has included hold-separate  agreements to protect all the assets to be divested to prevent interim  competitive harm and to preserve the viability and competitiveness of the  assets pending divestiture.  According to FTC staff, a hold separate  agreement is designed to keep the divestiture assets from being  intermingled with the divesting party\u2019s other assets pending divestiture by  requiring the divestiture assets to be operated separately from and  independently of the remaining business.  Additionally, a \u201chold separate\u201d  agreement prevents the transfer of competitively sensitive information and,  by taking the assets out of the hands of the divesting party, better protects  the assets from intentional or unintentional physical or intangible  deterioration that would affect their ability to be operated in a manner that  maintains or restores competition.  According to FTC staff, hold-separate  agreements are generally required if there is no up front-buyer.", "A provision that required the merging parties to obtain FTC\u2019s prior approval  for future transactions in the same product and geographic market(s),  usually for a period of 10 years was among the commonly included  provisions.  However, on June 21, 1995, FTC issued a new policy regarding  the use of prior approval requirements in FTC orders.   Previously,  whenever FTC found reason to believe that the respondent had attempted  (or completed) a merger transaction that was anticompetitive, a prior  approval provision was included in the order.  In some cases, according to  FTC staff, FTC also required prior notice of transactions that would not be  reportable under the HSR Act.  According to FTC staff, under the new  policy that is no longer the case.  The general rule now is that FTC will not  use prior approval or prior notice requirements except in special cases.", "In cases in which the merging parties have a post-order divestiture  obligation, the merging parties generally are required to keep FTC informed  of their divestiture efforts every 30 or 60 days by submitting verified written  compliance reports.  To the extent there are obligations in the order  beyond the divestiture obligation, the merging parties are usually required  to submit verified written annual reports to FTC on their continued  compliance with those obligations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Public Comments on Divestiture Orders", "paragraphs": ["In the case of a post-order divestiture requirement, when the merging  parties file an application seeking approval of a particular divestiture, that  application is also placed on the public record for a 30-day comment  period.  Again, staff must analyze the comments received and make  recommendations to FTC.  In some cases, buyers are identified before FTC  accepts the consent agreement for public comment.  If the buyer is  identified early in the consent process and is identified in the proposed  consent order, there is no separate comment period because the public is  commenting on both the proposed order and divestiture at the same time.  Consequently, according to FTC staff, the public comment serves the twin  purposes of giving the public a chance to comment on the substance of  relief obtained as well as the opportunity to comment on the suitability of  the proposed buyers.  According to FTC staff, FTC has negotiated with  merging parties for divestitures of additional assets based on comments  received during the public comment period.

Second, an upfront buyer requirement can lead to strategic  behavior by the potential purchasers who are given greater leverage in the negotiations.   This may skew the bidding process in a way that is inconsistent with the agencies\u2019 [FTC and  DOJ] goal of preserving competition in the marketplace.\u201d", "The American Bar Association (ABA) also has questioned FTC\u2019s up-front  buyer approach.  In 2001, ABA\u2019s Task Force on Federal Antitrust Agencies  of the Section of Antitrust Law issued a report on the state of federal  enforcement of the antitrust laws.  According to the report, there is some  uncertainty in the legal and business communities concerning the  circumstances under which FTC policy requires an up-front buyer.  The  report also stated that  \u201cThe policy needs to be clarified.

In the 2001  ABA Task Force report, ABA stated that \u201c\u2026press releases issued by FTC  explaining its enforcement actions merely highlight the remedies achieved  and provide conclusionary reviews of the competitive concerns, but  generally do not meaningfully explain the market context, specific  competitive concerns, and the mode of analyzing competitive effects.\u201d  Similarly, in a recent article entitled Toward Guidelines for Merger  Remedies, the President of American Antitrust Institute (AAI) said that  FTC's analysis to aid public comment documents do not offer insight into  trade-offs accepted during negotiations or reasons for accepting  settlements that may differ in important respects from settlements in other  apparently similar cases.", "FTC staff acknowledged that FTC does not always provide a detailed  rationale for its divestiture approaches.  They told us that because FTC\u2019s  decisions are largely tied to companies\u2019 trade secret information, which  FTC is statutorily prevented from disclosing to the public, FTC can provide  to the public only limited information on the basis for its decisions.  ABA  and AAI have concurred that FTC\u2019s lack of explanation of the basis for the  remedies included in a divestiture order is due in part to the proprietary  nature of the information.  Nonetheless, in the AAI article on merger  remedies, the President of AAI said that FTC has overused confidentiality  as an excuse for not providing more transparency in the merger remedy  process.", "In fact, both ABA and AAI have said that there needs to be a more  transparent approach to the remedy phase of the merger review process.   Specifically, ABA has urged FTC to make greater efforts to more  meaningfully explain the factors that give rise to competitive concerns, the  type of evidence viewed as relevant, the econometric analysis used (if any),  and other key considerations that led to the decision to bring a complaint  or enter into a consent order.  AAI also has recommended that FTC  (1) study its enforcement patterns, (2) derive best practices, (3) formalize  rules, (4) provide transparency so that the public can understand and  evaluate decisions being made, and (5) conduct regular post hoc  evaluations to determine how well a program is working.", "FTC staff told us that FTC does in fact value transparency and has taken  steps to provide the business community with information on FTC\u2019s merger  review and merger remedy processes.  In a June 10, 2002, speech  commemorating the twentieth anniversary of the merger guidelines,  which apply to the merger investigation phase of the merger review  process, FTC\u2019s Chairman said that \u201c\u2026 the Guidelines demonstrated the value of transparency\u2014having public  antitrust authorities clearly state their enforcement attentions , even at  the risk of relinquishing the capacity to employ enforcement approaches  that well-specified guidelines might disavow or disfavor.

Other practitioners have called for  \u201cpractice guides\u201d that could be used to educate antitrust practitioners and  FTC staff about when and why to use certain divestiture practices, but  would allow for greater flexibility in structuring a remedy.  Regardless of  whether they believed that guidelines are needed, they all agreed that there  is a need for greater transparency in the merger-remedy process.", "Conversely, FTC staff told us that merger-remedy guidelines are not needed  for the following reasons:   Because each case is unique and fact-based they draw on their past  experiences and advice from experienced senior staff, rather than  developing written policies and procedures to guide staff in fashioning  merger remedies.", "The merging parties have very sophisticated antitrust counsel who are  aware of how to structure remedies in order to obtain FTC approval.", "FTC speeches, workshops, consent orders, and public documents  provide antitrust practitioners and the business community with  information on FTC\u2019s merger remedy preferences.", "According to FTC staff, in an effort to continue to build on its relationship  with antitrust practitioners and other interest groups (such as consumer  groups and corporate personnel) and to increase the transparency of its  merger review and remedy processes, FTC planned two sets of public  workshops, one focusing on merger investigations and the other focusing  on remedies.

Additionally, several smaller buyers of divested  grocery store assets told us that other factors, such as the merging parties\u2019  bidding process, create additional challenges for smaller businesses in  purchasing and maintaining the viability of divested assets.  However, our  review of public comments and discussions with associations that  represent small and independent drug stores, funeral services, or gas  station businesses (all the businesses we studied except groceries),  revealed that few concerns have been raised concerning the impact of  FTC\u2019s clean sweep, single buyer, and up-front buyer divestiture practices on  the ability of small buyers in these industries to purchase divested assets."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Associations Representing Small Grocery Store Businesses Raised Concerns about FTC\u2019s Clean Sweep, Single Buyer, and Up-Front Buyer Divestiture Practices", "paragraphs": ["The National Grocers Association (NGA) and the Food Marketing Institute  (FMI) submitted comments to FTC saying that FTC\u2019s clean sweep, single  buyer, and up-front buyer divestiture practices have hindered the ability of  small and independent grocery store businesses to purchase divested  assets.  Both associations told FTC that these practices, described by  FTC as preferences, have been interpreted in the business community as  inflexible rules or policies. \u201cThese policies ignore the dynamics of the industry and the ever changing affects  that  these policies can have on the competitive environment.  The FTC\u2019s criteria of having a  single buyer replace things as they are is inherently flawed and plays directly into the hands  of power buyers.  The FTC criteria do not recognize the inherent difference between the top  five multi-billion dollar chains and privately owned regional and community retailers.\u201d", "FMI submitted a paper to FTC on June 18, 2002, as part of FTC\u2019s workshops  on merger investigations and remedies.  According to FMI, since  approximately 1996, FTC has applied increasingly rigorous policies to  supermarket divestitures.  FMI noted that while FTC staff describe these  policies as preferences, they often have been interpreted as inflexible rules.   Similar to NGA\u2019s comments, FMI said that the most significant policies that  make it difficult for small and independent businesses to purchase divested  assets are clean sweeps, single buyers, up-front buyers, and no change in  market concentration policies.  Specifically, FMI said that:  FTC\u2019s preference for clean sweep divestitures may prevent small  retailers from assembling divestiture packages that best suit their needs.   According to FMI, to the extent that FTC\u2019s clean sweep policy is based  on concerns about upsetting existing store networks or customer  relationships, the concerns are overstated because (1) supermarket  chains with a number of stores in a geographic market will inevitably  contain some strong stores and some weaker stores and (2) there is no  basis for assuming that a package of assets comprised of assets from  both merging parties will contain a greater proportion of weaker stores.   Additionally, FMI said that FTC\u2019s claim that the risk that divestiture of a  mixed package of assets will cause a loss of distribution efficiencies  also is exaggerated because there is no basis for FTC\u2019s assumption that  an unmixed group of stores can always be supplied more efficiently than  a mixed group of stores.  FMI noted that \u201cwhatever logistical advantage  lies in having all of the stores come from one prior owner rather than  two generally is modest.\u201d  Like NGA, FMI indicated that FTC\u2019s use of  clean sweeps reflects the staffs\u2019 desire to avoid the burden of having to  evaluate individual stores to examine the viability of each store and  determine whether the merging parties may be attempting to divest their  least profitable assets.", "FTC\u2019s preference for a single buyer limits opportunities for  independents and small chains to purchase divested assets.  FMI said  that FTC staff rarely, if ever, allow stores to be sold to more than one  buyer per market.  Independents and small chains often are interested in  buying, or may only have the ability to buy, a portion of the stores that  are being divested in a market, but a single-buyer policy prevents this.   According to FMI, a firm does not need to have complete market  coverage or engage in marketwide advertising in order to be an effective  competitor because no particular scale or degree of market coverage is  necessary to compete effectively in grocery retailing.  Additionally, FMI  said that if more than one buyer is allowed to purchase the divested  assets, the buyers of divested assets could seed a market with several  growing chains."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Concerns Raised by Grocery Associations", "paragraphs": ["NGA and FMI also raised several other concerns about the impact of FTC\u2019s  divestiture practices on the ability of small businesses to purchase divested  assets.", "Both NGA and FMI said that FTC\u2019s strong preference for out-of-market  buyers (buyers that at the time of the proposed divestiture, are not  already operating within the same product and geographic markets as  the assets to be divested) has disadvantaged small businesses by  preventing them from expanding to provide increased competition for  the merged firm.  According to FMI, as long as there is any possibility of  a buyer that does not currently operate in the geographic market, FTC  staffs\u2019 typical approach has been to warn counsel that securing approval  for a buyer within the geographic market would be difficult and time- consuming.  FMI said that in response to FTC\u2019s warnings, most counsel  have found out-of-market buyers.", "NGA indicated that FTC\u2019s definition of the relevant geographic market  also impacts the ability of small businesses to purchase divested assets  because FTC does not allow buyers already operating in the relevant  geographic market to purchase the assets to be divested if their market  share would increase above that permitted by the Hortizontal Merger  Guidelines.  According to NGA\u2019s public comment on the Food Lion and  Hannaford merger, FTC should have defined one of the relevant  geographic markets\u2014Richmond, Virginia\u2014in which to analyze the  competitive concerns differently because there was strong evidence  that inner city Richmond was a separate geographic market.  NGA  claimed that if FTC had defined inner city Richmond as a separate  market, the market share of an independent Richmond grocer interested  in purchasing the divested assets would have increased only to a level  acceptable under the Horizontal Merger Guidelines.", "NGA noted that the merging parties\u2019 bidding process for the assets to be  divested may disadvantage small businesses.  NGA suggested that FTC  ensure a fair and open divestiture process by requiring the merging  parties to provide FTC with information on the bidding process, such as  copies of all expressions of interest in purchasing the assets to be  divested and the merging parties\u2019 evaluations of each bid.  According to  NGA, in numerous meetings with FTC staff and Commissioners, NGA  has consistently been told that FTC leaves the divestiture process in the  hands of the merging parties, and its role is merely to approve or  disapprove the proposed buyer(s).  NGA said that FTC should play a  greater role in the bidding process for the assets to be divested.", "According to FMI, independents and small firms believe they face closer  scrutiny of their financial viability, experience, supply arrangements,  and business plans than large chains.  FMI reported that the additional  scrutiny of independents and small firms takes time and brings added  uncertainty to the process, usually at a late stage in the investigation,  when the parties are becoming increasingly worried that the merger  may fall apart.  Additionally, FMI noted that given the perception that  independents and small chains are subjected to more scrutiny than large  chains to be approved as buyers of divested assets, merging parties are  likely to seek a buyer that is a \u201csure thing\u201d\u2014a well-established, out-of- market chain, rather than proposing divestiture to one or more  independents.", "FMI concluded that in supermarket mergers, as perhaps no other industry,  FTC in recent years has imposed a series of increasingly inflexible  divestiture policies that place small chains and independent businesses at a  disadvantage in the divestiture process, to their detriment and the  detriment of consumers.  Additionally, FMI said that FTC could go a long  way toward dispelling the perception of bias against small chains and  independent businesses in part by not insisting on clean sweeps and single  buyers and by being open to in-market buyers.  These changes, according  to FMI, would give small chains and independent businesses realistic  opportunities to become stronger and larger competitors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Smaller Buyers of Divested Grocery Store Assets Raised Concerns about the Challenges They Face in Purchasing Divested Assets and Maintaining Their Viability", "paragraphs": ["While obtaining revenue data from buyers of divested assets,  representatives of 11 grocery store businesses with average annual  revenues of $200 million or less provided anecdotal comments about the  challenges that smaller businesses face in purchasing divested assets and  maintaining their viability. Regarding their ability to purchase divested  grocery store assets, the buyers provided the following comments.", "One representative noted that currently there is limited opportunity for  smaller grocery store businesses to purchase divested assets because  the merging parties sell the assets as a package to a single buyer.   Smaller businesses may have the necessary financing to purchase one or  two of the assets, but usually do not have the financial strength to  purchase all of the assets.", "Four representatives told us that the merging parties usually offer  smaller businesses the stores that the larger chains have declined to  purchase.  They said that they generally have access to some of the least  desirable grocery stores being divested in terms of the condition of the  stores, and have had to spend a considerable amount of money to  refurbish them.", "Two representatives indicated that smaller businesses usually do not  have an opportunity to express an interest in purchasing divested assets  because, in practice, the bidding process is often closed to small  businesses.  They indicated that typically the merging parties have  already identified buyers for the divested assets by the time that small  businesses become aware that the merging parties must divest assets.   One of the representatives said that FTC may need to play a greater role  in the bidding process.", "The anecdotal accounts suggested that the current environment,  particularly the practices of merger parties, makes it difficult to maintain  the viability of divested grocery store assets:  Two representatives told us that they received inaccurate or incomplete  information from the merging parties or wholesaler.  They said that after  purchasing the stores, they discovered that the stores generated  considerably less sales than reported to them by the merging parties.   For example, a buyer of one divested grocery store said that he had to  close the store 5 months after purchasing the store because it generated  only a fraction of the sales quoted by the merging parties.", "Two representatives said that buyers of divested assets, particularly  smaller buyers, have faced challenges remaining in business when the  merging parties build state of the art supermarkets in the same  geographic markets in which they were required to divest assets.  They  said their sales declined and several supermarkets went out of business  because they were unable to compete with the larger, state of the art  supermarket.", "Two representatives told us that the biggest problem smaller grocers  face in maintaining the viability of the divested stores they purchase is  competing with grocery chains that have supercenters.  They told us  that it is becoming extremely difficult for small businesses to compete  with supercenters because the supercenters offer one-stop shopping\u2014 the convenience of being able to purchase groceries at the same time as  other household items, such as clothes, appliances, and other household  products.  They also noted that while supercenters and large grocery  chains are able to purchase and/or sell some products below costs,  small businesses cannot afford to sell products below cost and remain  profitable."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Public Comments Raised Few Concerns Regarding the Impact of FTC\u2019s Divestiture Practices on Small Businesses in the Drug Store, Funeral Services, and Gas Station Industries", "paragraphs": ["Only one of the 1,902 public comments contained in FTC\u2019s public files for  the 31 divestiture orders included in our review raised a specific concern  about how FTC\u2019s clean sweep, single buyer, and/or up-front buyer  divestiture practices have impacted the ability of small businesses to  purchase divested assets.  However, we were unable to fully examine the  public comments for the 31 divestiture orders included in our review  because some of them were confidential and others appeared to be missing  from the files.  Of the 1,902 public comments, 1,441 related to grocery  store divestiture orders, 455 related to gas stations, four to drug stores, and  two to funeral services. Our review of the public comments for each of the  industries showed that:  About 80 percent (1,146 of 1,441) of the comments relating to the  grocery store industry were petitions or form letters from individuals  expressing objections to the divestiture of a supermarket to a proposed  buyer for the Ahold and Stop and Shop divestiture order announced for  public comment in fiscal year 1996.  Specifically, the customers of an  existing local grocery store were concerned that the proposed buyer of  the divested supermarket would harm the market share of the existing  local grocery store business.  Most of the remaining comments  concerning grocery store divestitures were from customers who did not  want the store where they shopped to close or change ownership.  Other  comments were from employees of stores being divested that did not  want to work for a proposed buyer(s) when the buyer(s) did not have a  good history of managing its employees or they feared they would lose  their jobs if the stores were divested.", "Two of the four drug store industry comments opposed the merger, one  requested that a particular drug store be included in the divestiture  order and one requested that a specific drug store be sold to an  independent drug buyer rather than another drug store chain.", "One of the two comments concerning the mergers in the funeral  services industry expressed objection to the merging parties\u2019 selection  of the funeral homes to be divested.  The other comment questioned  whether an investigation was made to determine if the required  divestiture would restore competition.", "About 60 percent (275 of 455) of the comments relating to the gas  station industry were petitions from retirees of one of the merging  parties who were concerned about their medical coverage after the  merger or citizens who wanted to continue the gasoline brands of the 2  merging parties. Most of the remaining comments were from  independent gas station dealers or their representatives expressing  concerns that the divestiture orders would remove dealers from their  business place with no right of first refusal on the purchase of their gas  stations.", "FTC received only one public comment relating to small businesses that  concerned the impact of FTC\u2019s clean sweep divestiture, single buyer, and  up-front buyer practices on the ability of small businesses to purchase  divested assets.  Specifically, in response to the Food Lion and Hannaford  divestiture order announced for public comment in fiscal year 2000, NGA,  as discussed previously, commented that FTC\u2019s preference for clean  sweeps, single buyers, and buyers that do not currently have a presence in  the geographic market in which the assets are being divested have  tremendously disadvantaged small businesses.  Other public comments  that related to small business ranged from whether a smaller business  could effectively compete in a market dominated by larger companies to  how a divestiture will impact supply contacts that small businesses had in  place with one of the merging parties prior to the merger.", "FTC staff told us that the formal public comment period is not the only  opportunity for concerned parties to express their views on an FTC matter.   According to FTC staff, it is customary for affected third parties, including  smaller businesses, to communicate with Commissioners and staff  throughout the merger investigation.  As a result, they said that the formal  public record of comments on a proposed divestiture order and FTC\u2019s  responses do not represent the totality of FTC\u2019s responsiveness to small  businesses who have concerns about a pending merger.  They cited two  instances in which FTC has received comments outside of the public  comment process regarding small and independent businesses being  unable to purchase divested assets.  First, they told us that some time ago,  an attorney representing a grocery wholesaler presented arguments for  why FTC should accept wholesaler-suppliers as acquirers of supermarkets.   They said that FTC has considered those arguments in all matters, as  appropriate.  Additionally, in regard to the divestitures of gasoline retailing  assets in the Exxon and Mobil matter, FTC received communications from  a small regional \u201cjobber\u201d who complained that the requirement that all  assets be divested to a single acquirer foreclosed the jobber from bidding  on the divested assets.  In that matter, FTC determined that an effective  remedy precluded dividing the assets into smaller packages.", "We also talked with associations that represent small and independent  businesses as well as SBA officials who generally told us that they were  unaware of concerns directly related to the impact of FTC\u2019s clean sweep,  single buyer, and up-front buyer divestiture practices on the ability of small  businesses to purchase divested assets.  Specifically,  The Petroleum Marketers Association of America expressed some  concern about FTC\u2019s divestiture practices in general.  The official we  spoke with noted that FTC has the ability to influence the merging  parties\u2019 choice of a buyer of divested assets even though FTC does not  ultimately choose the buyer.", "A National Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA) official told us  that NCPA did not have any concerns directly related to FTC\u2019s  divestiture practices.  However, the official said that he was not aware  that in certain situations FTC explicitly required merging parties to  divest drug store assets to a single buyer.  The official also said that it  was his view that this requirement would definitely make it difficult for  small businesses to purchase divested drug store assets.", "Officials of 4 of the 10 associations we contacted\u2014the National Funeral  Directors Association, the National Business Association, the National  Small Business United, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u2014said that  to their knowledge their members did not have any concerns directly  related to the impact of FTC\u2019s divestiture practices on the ability of  small businesses to purchase divested assets.", "Officials of the National Federation of Independent Business and the  SCORE Association told us that their associations do not have an  official position on the issue.", "We also contacted staff in the Small Business Administration\u2019s (SBA) Office  of Advocacy to determine whether any small businesses or associations  representing small businesses had raised this issue with SBA.  According to  SBA staff, SBA had not been made aware of concerns about the impact of  FTC\u2019s divestiture practices on the ability of small businesses to purchase  divested assets.  They noted that the issue that has been raised concerning  mergers in the retail sector is whether small businesses will have access to  products or services after the merger takes place.  For example, they told  us that in response to the Exxon and Mobil as well as the British Petroleum  and Amoco Atlantic Richfield Company mergers, small businesses raised  concerns regarding whether the merged companies would continue to  provide them with access to crude oil."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Federal Trade Commission", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the persons named above, the following persons made key  contributions to this report: Brodi L.
