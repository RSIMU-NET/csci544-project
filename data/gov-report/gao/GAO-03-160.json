These practices have raised concerns about anticompetitive behavior and may be adversely affecting small businesses. GAO was asked (1) if the Defense Commissary Agency is using these practices in managing military commissaries; (2) what proportion of products sold by commissaries are produced by small businesses; and (3) if small businesses face barriers in selling products through commissaries and how opportunities for small business could be improved."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Defense Commissary Agency does not charge slotting fees, and agency staff, not product manufacturers, decide which products to sell and where they will be placed on commissary shelves. GAO estimates that slightly more than half of the companies producing products that the agency sold are small businesses. According to GAO estimates, these businesses produced about 24 percent, or about 10,900 of 45,200 products sold by commissaries from August 2000 through May 2001, generating about 7 percent of commissary sales during the period. Federal law requires that a name brand product must have been sold on a regional basis through grocery stores or other retail operations before the agency may purchase it for resale without competition. This requirement apparently poses a legal hurdle to small businesses whose name brand product distribution may be limited because the agency cannot accept their products for resale. GAO identified two ways in which opportunities for small businesses might be increased. First, the legal hurdle to purchasing name brand products that have limited distribution could be removed. Agency officials are capable of deciding which products to sell without this requirement. Second, the agency could sell private label products, such as the Kroger Company's \"Big K\" brand or Safeway Stores' \"Safeway Select\" brand and obtain these products from both large and small businesses. In 2001, private label products constituted over 20 percent of industry unit sales and 16 percent of dollar sales. Private label products are sold at lower prices than brand name products and could potentially increase savings for commissary customers. Agency officials recognize there could be some potential benefits if the agency were to offer private label products. However, the officials said it would be difficult to initiate and operate a private label program. Further, they are concerned that if the agency attempted to sell private label products, its current suppliers would increase their prices and withdraw some of the support they now provide commissaries, perhaps reducing the overall benefits of commissary shopping. GAO noted that the agency has not done a thorough study of the potential for private label products to serve commissary customers. The agency's Director agreed with GAO that a study of the benefits and costs of developing private label products would be reasonable to undertake to determine if such a program could enhance the commissary benefit. The Department of Defense concurred with GAO's recommendations and plans to implement them."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["For well over a decade, the U.S. retail grocery industry has increasingly required grocery store suppliers to pay a variety of fees to place their products in stores. These fees, called \u201cslotting fees\u201d or \u201cslotting allowances,\u201d help determine which products supermarkets will sell and where they will place those products on their shelves. Proponents of slotting fees maintain that the fees help pay the costs of introducing new products to the marketplace, such as the costs of reallocating shelf space and reprogramming scanner equipment and that the fees help allocate the risk of product failure between suppliers and retailers. Some retailers view slotting fees as a way to reduce their risk in trying a new product and say that a manufacturer\u2019s willingness to pay slotting fees indicates the manufacturer\u2019s confidence in a product\u2019s success. Opponents of the practice, including some product suppliers and small business groups, maintain that it can prevent smaller manufacturers from competing if they cannot afford the fees.", "Many large grocery retailers have also adopted a business technique called \u201ccategory management\u201d for assessing the sales potential of products within a particular category, such as ice cream or other frozen foods, selecting the products with the best potential and allocating shelf space to these products. Retailers may manage product categories themselves, with recommendations from suppliers; select various \u201ccategory captains\u201d (usually the leading manufacturers for each product category) to help them manage the categories; or turn over management of the categories to the category captains. While proponents of category management view it as having potentially significant benefits for suppliers, retailers, and consumers, others are concerned that when a retailer relies heavily on a category captain, anticompetitive behavior may arise.", "The Department of Defense operates supermarket-type stores called commissaries for the use of active and retired military personnel and their families. Managed by the Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA), these commissaries number about 280 worldwide, with sales totaling about $5 billion per year. DeCA\u2019s overall goal is to provide quality products at the lowest possible cost. Like commercial supermarkets, commissaries sell name brand products and nonbranded products such as produce, fresh fish, and ground beef. DeCA encourages small businesses to sell products through commissaries. Even so, to assure that DeCA can supply the name brand products its customers desire, federal law allows DeCA (as well as other federal agencies) to purchase name brand products without competition and without setting aside a portion of this business for small businesses. The Small Business Administration generally considers businesses with 500 or fewer employees to be small businesses.", "You asked us how DeCA is managing its product purchases. Specifically, you asked us to determine the extent to which (1) DeCA requires grocery suppliers to pay for shelf space in commissaries, (2) DeCA\u2019s large suppliers select the products that are sold by commissaries, (3) products sold by commissaries are produced by small businesses and foreign businesses, and (4) small businesses face barriers to selling their products in commissaries as well as whether opportunities for small businesses could be improved."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["DeCA commissaries are in business to provide a significant non-pay compensation benefit to military families; they sell food and household items tax free at cost plus a 5 percent surcharge.

DeCA is striving to achieve an overall savings of 30 percent for its patrons compared to retail supermarket prices. DeCA\u2019s operating expenses are paid primarily through an annual appropriation of about $1 billion. DeCA was formed in 1991, and its headquarters are at Fort Lee, Virginia.", "Under federal law, DeCA may purchase name brand products without competition and thereby supply its customers with products they prefer.Also, when purchasing products without seeking competition, requirements regarding purchases from small businesses become inapplicable. For the remainder of the products which commissaries sell for which there is not demonstrated customer preference for a specific brand, DeCA follows federal procurement requirements, seeking competition and striving to purchase a portion of its products from small businesses.", "The Federal Trade Commission has been reviewing slotting and category management practices as part of its responsibility for preventing business practices that may have a harmful effect on competition. Within the commission, the Bureau of Competition is responsible for investigating such illegal practices, and for taking enforcement action if it finds illegal activity. The Bureau of Competition views slotting allowances as covering a very broad range of business conduct, some of which\u2014such as commercial bribery\u2014are unlawful. Other slotting practices are legal in competitive markets, according to the Federal Trade Commission, such as ordinary price discounts that are passed through to consumers. The Deputy Director of the Bureau of Competition has testified that slotting allowances are unlikely to harm competition when there are payments of reasonable amounts to compensate a retailer for stocking a new unproven product. On the other hand, the Deputy Director also advised that slotting practices may be of competitive concern if they involve the exclusion of rivals. The following fees illustrate those in use in the industry according to the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s workshop report on slotting practices and industry studies:   Slotting allowances\u2014lump-sum, up-front payments from a manufacturer or producer to a retailer to have a new product carried by the retailer and placed on its shelves.", "Pay to stay fees\u2014fees paid by a manufacturer to keep existing products on retailers\u2019 shelves.", "Display fees\u2014fees paid by a manufacturer for shelf space and for placing products in particular locations within a store, such as on eye-level shelves or on displays at the end of shelves.

DeCA used these agreements to increase the funds available for commissary construction. The agreements were based on suppliers\u2019 proposals and negotiations with DeCA, and the agreements authorized suppliers to place products on special merchandizing racks, on end-of-aisle displays, and on in-aisle display cases. The agreements were negotiated separately from decisions to stock products, according to DeCA officials. DeCA entered relatively few performance-based agreements, and they provided modest income as table 1 indicates.", "In addition, our review showed the following:   Only one company had performance-based agreements in both years.

Appendix II contains examples illustrating the performance terms and the basis for payments that DeCA received through its performance-based agreements.", "While there have been relatively few performance-based agreements, the concept has raised some concerns. In a 1998 report on DeCA contracting activities, the Department of Defense expressed concern that (1) DeCA\u2019s agreements were a form of selling space in commissaries, which is not authorized, and (2) that the agreements were a cost to the suppliers who may pass on those costs to military customers through increased product prices. While DeCA officials disagreed with these perspectives, DeCA decided not to enter additional performance-based agreements for 2002. DeCA officials stated that they took this action to assure there was not any possibility that the agreements were limiting their suppliers\u2019 capability to reduce product prices, and because revenue needed for commissary construction had been secured through congressional action."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DeCA Officials Are Responsible for Product Selection Decisions", "paragraphs": ["DeCA officials select the products that commissaries sell\u2014the agency does not use its large suppliers to select products for commissaries. DeCA officials do use category management techniques when selecting products, and DeCA officials have sole responsibility for category management decisions.

DeCA\u2019s category managers and buyers who are assigned to DeCA\u2019s Marketing Business Unit, located primarily at Fort Lee, Virginia, implement these techniques. DeCA has divided its grocery business into about 170 categories of like products, and it completed 164 reviews of individual product categories from January 2001 through August 2002.

This information allows DeCA\u2019s category managers and buyers to have an overview of the performance of each product over several time periods. In addition, DeCA category managers and buyers meet individually with their suppliers during a category review and are provided with product presentations and sales data developed by the supplier or purchased by the supplier, along with the suppliers\u2019 product selection and display recommendations. Suppliers who make presentations to DeCA during a category review typically include both leading manufacturers such as Kraft Foods, Inc.; General Mills, Inc.; and PepsiCo, Inc.; and distributors, brokers, and other companies selling and distributing products in a category that decide to participate in the review. According to DeCA officials, they do not discuss or share the content of meetings with individual companies with the representatives of other companies that participate in a category review.

We estimate that the sale of these products totaled about $214 million, or about 7 percent of commissary sales, and we are 95 percent confident that the total lies between $76 million and $352 million. In addition, we estimate that about 13 percent of the businesses producing products that DeCA sold are foreign businesses and estimate that these businesses produced about 14 percent or about 6,500 of the products sold by commissaries during the period.

While scanner data on industry sales are available, this information does not identify the size of the companies that supply the products, according to industry officials. Also, the U.S. Census Bureau, which conducts economic surveys of manufacturing, does not collect data on the extent that the products of small businesses are sold through individual commercial grocery retailers. Census Bureau data shows that grocery manufacturing is diversified, with over 22,000 companies participating in the sector, and that over 21,000 of these companies had 500 or fewer employees. Yet, the industry is more concentrated at the top\u2014the 50 largest companies in the sector accounted for about 51 percent of the $422 billion in shipments attributed to this sector of the economy in 1997 (the latest data available)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Barriers Small Businesses May Face in Doing Business with DeCA", "paragraphs": ["Businesses face a legal hurdle in selling brand name products through commissaries\u2014a provision of law requires a minimum level of sales before DeCA can consider a brand name product for purchase. In addition, the commissary system has certain physical characteristics that limit the number of products that commissaries sell and increase the costs of distributing products to commissaries. These characteristics affect the opportunities of businesses, including small businesses, to present and sell products through commissaries.", "In general, federal policy concerning small businesses is to (1) foster their development and (2) to eliminate barriers to their growth. As indicated by the Small Business Act and the U.S. Small Business Administration, the United States is committed to preserving full and free competition that leads to free entry into business to keep capitalism efficient and foster innovation. Also, according to the administration, the growth of small businesses is vital to preserve competition, and its Office of Advocacy was created to help discourage barriers to small business development and growth. Furthermore, according to the administration, policymakers should find ways to level the playing field for all businesses without compromising statutory or agency specific goals.", "In considering products for sale in commissaries, DeCA is bound by a provision of federal law that requires a name brand product to have been sold on a regional or national basis through grocery stores or other retail operations consisting of multiple outlets before DeCA may purchase these products on a non-competitive basis for resale. This limitation was enacted in 1997, and a congressional committee considering this legislation specifically stated in referring to this provision that discount brands that are not sold by major commercial grocery or retail store chains would not qualify as brand name products.", "DeCA officials said that the provision has, in part, had the effect of limiting their consideration of products that have not yet achieved a regional distribution, including products produced by small businesses. DeCA officials do not know precisely how often companies may be affected because companies do not inform DeCA when they are discouraged from proposing products for acceptance by DeCA for this reason. DeCA seeks products with positive sales records and companies with the financial capability to sustain operations and the production capacity to meet demand for their products if accepted for sale. DeCA does not accept a product with an indifferent sales record or a product that may not be as attractive to customers as those that are already in DeCA\u2019s assortment. Nevertheless, DeCA officials said that they occasionally accept products that appear to be popular in regional and local areas even with relatively limited distribution\u2014they are looking for and eager to add products from small businesses that are innovative or distinctive. In addition, DeCA officials said each product accepted for sale must earn its place on the shelf and continue to sell well to maintain its place in a commissary store and the commissary system. When a product is added to DeCA\u2019s assortment, a competing product may need to be removed to make shelf space available.", "In addition, other factors affect whether or not a small business sells products through commissaries. The commissary system differs, in part, from some large grocery supermarket companies in the following respects: the assortment of products, the distances between stores, and the costs of distributing products to stores. According to DeCA information, DeCA\u2019s assortment of products is limited by the physical size of commissaries\u2014 commissary stores are about one fourth smaller on average than typical commercial grocery supermarkets. Also, commissaries are shopped intensively twice per month on days after military paydays, and DeCA plans its stock assortment to assure that commissaries have sufficient quantities of the items in highest demand to meet these bimonthly shopping peaks. Due to these characteristics, an average commissary stocks about 11,500 items\u2014as much as 40 percent fewer grocery items than large grocery supermarkets, according to DeCA information. In addition, the wide spacing of commissaries limits their sales in regional and local markets compared to other large supermarkets chains in metropolitan areas that have high concentrations of supermarket stores. Nearly half of all DeCA sales occur at about 55 of the largest commissary stores distributed across the continental U.S. at major military bases. Moreover, DeCA does not have centralized warehouses or a product distribution system within the United States, as do other large supermarket chains. Therefore, DeCA requires that its suppliers deliver or arrange to deliver products for sale, and these deliveries must be frequent enough to assure that at least a minimum quantity of each product is on the shelf each day. To meet these requirements, many of DeCA\u2019s suppliers pay a distributor to warehouse and deliver products to commissaries. These increased distribution costs may affect the decision of a small business to sell products through commissaries."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Private Label Products Might Reduce Commissary Prices and Provide Small Business Opportunity", "paragraphs": ["Private label products are successful in the supermarket industry, providing quality products at low cost, but DeCA does not now offer private label products. DeCA officials recognize the strength of the industry trends in selling private label products, and that commissary customers would likely purchase significant quantities of private label products. The sale of private label products would also provide some opportunity for small businesses. According to officials of the Private Label Manufacturers Association, as many as half of the association\u2019s membership of 3,200 companies may have 500 or fewer employees.However, DeCA officials identified operational issues that they believe may undercut the benefits of having commissaries sell private label products. DeCA\u2019s Director\u2019s said that a study may clarify whether a private label program would be in the best interests of commissary customers.", "Private label products have become a major form of retail trade in the grocery industry. Private label products, such as those sold by the major grocery retailers Kroger Co.; Albertson\u2019s, Inc.; Safeway Stores; Wal-Mart; and Ahold USA have captured 20.7 percent of supermarket unit sales, and 16.2 percent of dollar sales according to industry data. These and other grocery retailers now use their own private labels to sell thousands of products. Examples of private label brands include the Kroger Company\u2019s \u201cBig K\u201d brand, Wal-Mart\u2019s \u201cSam\u2019s American Choice\u201d brand, or Safeway Stores\u2019 \u201cSafeway\u201d and \u201cLucerne\u201d brands. In addition, reports on the supermarket industry indicate that private-label products   may capture 24 percent of grocery industry sales by 2006;   make business sense because they offer a 20 to 40 percent price advantage over national brands and, in addition, provide retailers a 35 to 40 percent margin compared to the 27 percent margin of national brands; and   are perceived within the industry as promoting customer loyalty to a retailer.", "Sales of private label products vary significantly by product category, and in some categories exceed 30 percent of the sales of a category. The top 20 categories of private label product sales are listed in appendix IV.", "DeCA officials have been considering the industry trend toward private label sales. In 1997, a limited evaluation of the private label concept by DeCA staff suggested, at that time, that (1) DeCA customers appeared to be demographically ideal purchasers of low cost private label products, (2) a private label program would be impractical for DeCA because it may not reduce overall prices and would require significant operations changes; and, (3) it may be necessary for DeCA to respond to industry trends by selectively carrying low cost alternative products. In July 2000, DeCA started its \u201cBest Value Items\u201d program, which offers name brand products at the lowest prices DeCA can obtain. The Best Value Items program responds, in part, to a commissary customer\u2019s request to DeCA\u2019s director for private label products, and the recognition by DeCA that commissaries were at a competitive disadvantage compared to private label programs in serving some customers, such as its younger service members who desire the lowest priced products. As of September 2002, DeCA\u2019s Best Value Item program contained about 400 items and accounted for about 2.3 percent of DeCA annual dollar sales, according to DeCA information.", "In discussing the potential for private label products, DeCA officials raised concerns about the effects of a private label program that require serious consideration. DeCA officials said that the private label concept may not increase customer traffic from current levels, nor succeed in reducing product costs overall. More specifically, DeCA officials noted that the private label concept could be difficult for DeCA to initiate, and the DeCA\u2019s major suppliers may respond by raising prices on products now sold through commissaries and withdraw the labor support that they now provide to commissaries. According to DeCA officials, there would also be implementation issues such as (1) the pricing of products, which may require a change in DeCA\u2019s legal authority if variable pricing would be helpful; (2) the expense of advertising DeCA private label products; and (3) controls over product quality. Due to these concerns, DeCA officials have not performed a thorough study of the potential for selling private label products.", "On the other hand, the Department of Defense has stated that it is important for the future of the commissary system to focus on the emerging trends in the supermarket industry and for commissaries to be positioned to retain their appeal. In addition, the department has in the past expressed concern that discount retailing could lead to strong competition for military members\u2019 business in common markets. In discussing the potential offered by private label products, as well as the issues that would be involved, DeCA\u2019s Director concluded that although there may be difficulties associated with the application of the private label concept to commissaries, it would be reasonable to perform a study to determine whether the sale of private label products could enhance the commissary benefit overall."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The legal requirement that name brand products must first be introduced through multiple retail operations on at least a regional basis may preclude DeCA from purchasing some small business brand name products that it may desire to purchase.

We recognize that even if this provision is removed from the law or some other adjustment is made to the requirement to open the door to the consideration of all small business products offered to DeCA, it is uncertain whether there will be a positive effect on the sales of small business products in commissaries because commissary shelf space is limited and open to competition.

Also, at our request, DeCA officials classified each product as being supplied by either a large or a small business based on its knowledge of its suppliers and the industry. We drew a random sample of 700 products from DeCA\u2019s population of products. To assist in verifying the identity of each company that produced or distributed each product in our sample, we obtained information from the Uniform Code Council, Inc., that enabled us to identify the company that obtained a product\u2019s Universal Product Code. We then matched DeCA\u2019s product information with the corresponding information from the Uniform Code Council database. In some cases, the matching procedure was unsuccessful, and we used the product brand name to identify the company that produced or distributed the product. For the products in our sample, we verified the parent companies, the size of each company, and identified foreign companies. Our verification of the number of employees of each company was based on data obtained from business sources available on the Internet and phone calls we made to company representatives. We were able to determine the size of the company and its parent company, if any, and whether it was foreign or domestic for 669 of the 700 products we sampled. The proportions of small and foreign companies were estimated by determining the number of products in the sample associated with each firm and then using the collection of relative frequencies of each company to estimate the percent of small and foreign companies in the population.

DeCA announces a category review including the goals of the review, and invites companies supplying products to supply information and analyses of product sales and trends within the category. 2.  DeCA conducts individual meetings with interested companies, including manufacturers, brokers, and broker-distributors, at Fort Lee, Virginia. DeCA receives information developed by participating companies and listens to company presentations and recommendations for the category. 3.  DeCA\u2019s category buyer obtains market information from Information Resources, Inc., on the performance of products within the category. This information is gathered from cash register scanner data, and it shows for each product such data as number of items sold, dollar value of sales, and changes from prior periods. The data provides a basis for comparative analyses of sales patterns. 4.  DeCA\u2019s buyer analyzes data provided by Information Resources, Inc., along with data and recommendations submitted by participating companies. Based on the buyer\u2019s analysis, the buyer prepares a schedule of its category decisions indicating which products will be added, which will be retained with or without distribution changes, and which will be deleted from inventory. 5.  DeCA officials develop and sign-off on shelving plans called \u201cplan-o-grams\u201d illustrating how nationally distributed products are to be arranged and that provide shelf space for products that have been specifically selected to meet regional and local demand. These plans are used as guides for resetting products on the shelves of individual commissary stores. Under DeCA\u2019s supervision and with the participation of product distributors, brokers, and manufacturers representatives, products on the shelves of individual commissary stores are periodically reset based on DeCA\u2019s display plans. 6.  DeCA releases its category review decisions and solicits comments from companies participating in the category. 7.  DeCA responds in writing to each company that objects to DeCA\u2019s decisions (an objection to a DeCA decision is termed a \u201creclama\u201d), and usually provides a brief explanation for its decision. 8.
