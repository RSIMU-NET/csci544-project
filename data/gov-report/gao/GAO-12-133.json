Reset is intended to mitigate the effects of combat stress on equipment by repairing, rebuilding, upgrading, or procuring replacement equipment. Reset equipment is used to supply non-deployed units and units preparing for deployment while meeting ongoing operational requirements. In 2007, GAO reported that the Army\u0092s reset strategy did not target equipment shortages for units deploying to theater. For this report, GAO (1) examined steps the Army has taken to improve its equipment reset strategy since 2007, and (2) determined the extent to which the Army\u0092s reset reports to Congress provide visibility over reset costs and execution. To conduct this review, GAO reviewed and analyzed DOD and Army documentation on equipment reset strategies and monthly Army reports to Congress, and interviewed DOD and Army officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Since GAO\u0092s 2007 review, the Army has taken steps to improve its use of reset in targeting equipment shortages. In 2007, GAO noted that the Army\u0092s reset implementation strategy did not specifically target shortages of equipment on hand among units preparing for deployment to Iraq and Afghanistan in order to mitigate operational risk. GAO recommended that the Army act to ensure that its reset priorities address equipment shortages in the near term to ensure that the needs of deploying units could be met. The Department of Defense (DOD) did not concur, and stated that there was no need to reassess its approaches to equipment reset. However, in 2008, the Army issued its Depot Maintenance Enterprise Strategic Plan, noted that filling materiel shortages within warfighting units is a key challenge facing the depot maintenance enterprise, and called for changes in programs and policies to address materiel shortages within warfighting units. Further, recognizing that retrograde operations\u0097the return of equipment from theater to the United States\u0097are essential to facilitating depot level reset and redistribution of equipment, the Army in 2010 developed the retrograde, reset, and redistribution (R3) initiative to synchronize retrograde, national depot-level reset efforts, and redistribution efforts. In March 2011, the Army issued an R3 equipment priority list, and revised and reissued an updated list at the end of fiscal year 2011 with full endorsement from all Army commands. The R3 initiative has only begun to be fully implemented this year, and thus it is too early to tell whether it will provide a consistent and transparent process for addressing the Army\u0092s current or future equipping needs.", "GAO found that the Army\u0092s monthly reports to Congress do not include expected future reset costs or distinguish between planned and unplanned reset of equipment. GAO has reported that agencies and decision makers need visibility into the accuracy of program execution in order to ensure basic accountability and to anticipate future costs. However, the Army does not include its future reset liability in its reports to Congress, which DOD most recently estimated in 2010 to be $24 billion. Also, the Army reports to Congress include the number of items that it has repaired in a given month using broad categories, such as Tactical Wheeled Vehicles, which may obscure progress on equipment planned for reset. For example, GAO\u0092s analysis of Army data showed that 4,144 tactical wheeled vehicles were planned for reset in fiscal year 2010, while 3,563 vehicles were executed. According to the Army\u0092s current reporting method, this would result in a reported completion rate of 86 percent, but GAO\u0092s analysis showed that only approximately 40 percent of the equipment that was reset had been planned and programmed. This reporting method may also restrict visibility over the Army\u0092s multiyear reset liability. For example, both the M1200 Knight and the M1151 HMMWV are categorized as Tactical Wheeled Vehicles, but anticipated reset costs for the M1200 are significantly higher. In 2010 more M1200s were repaired than planned, thus accounting for a larger share of the budgeted reset funds. With fewer funds remaining, some equipment planned and budgeted for repair was not reset, pushing that workload to future fiscal years. These differences are not captured in the Army\u0092s monthly reports, and thus Congress may not have a complete picture of the Army\u0092s short- and long-term progress in addressing reset."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Army revise its monthly congressional reset reports to include its future reset liability and status information on equipment reset according to the initial reset plan by vehicle type.

Reset  occurs at the Army depots and consists of a set of actions taken to  restore equipment to a desired level of combat capability commensurate  with a unit\u2019s future mission. Reset mitigates the effects of combat stress  on equipment and restores destroyed, damaged, stressed, or worn out  equipment by repairing, rebuilding, or upgrading it, or procuring  replacement equipment. Reset equipment is used to supply non-deployed  units and units preparing for deployment while meeting ongoing  operational requirements.

Equipment is redistributed in accordance with theater  priorities to meet mission requirements within areas of responsibility and  the DOD requirements worldwide. For example, in response to the  February 27, 2009, drawdown order for Iraq and surge of forces in  Afghanistan in August 2010, the Army began retrograding some  equipment out of Iraq to the U.S. for reset and transferring other  equipment to support units deploying to Afghanistan.", "The initial phase of the retrograde process begins when units coordinate,  through their normal chain-of-command in theater of operations, to obtain  disposition instructions for all theater-provided equipment that is no longer  needed by the current unit or follow-on units. For example, in Iraq, units  coordinated with Multi-National Forces in Iraq, Coalition Forces Land  Component Command, and U.S. Army Central Command. The U.S. Army  Central Command managers then conducted a vetting process to  determine if the equipment can fill other theater requirements such as  prepositioned stocks or unit requirements in Afghanistan. If the equipment  did not meet these requirements, U.S. Army Central Command sent the  equipment to Kuwait for processing as theater-excess equipment  expected to return to the U.S. for reset. Also, some equipment is included  on the Army\u2019s Automatic Reset Induction (ARI) list, which is comprised of  unit equipment that automatically returns to the U.S. for depot-level reset.  U.S. Army Forces Command and Army Materiel Command place  equipment on the ARI list because of expected extensive wear and tear  experienced in theater that requires refurbishment or rebuilding, and not  to address equipping requirements. Army officials said that the Reset  Task Force inspects non-ARI equipment to determine the level of reset it  will require. Once the inspection is complete, the equipment is shipped  back to the U.S. with disposition instructions for reset or for automatic  reset induction.

Therefore, we concluded the Army could not be assured that its reset  programs would provide sufficient equipment to train and equip deploying  units for ongoing and future requirements. We recommended that the  Secretary of Defense direct the Secretary of the Army to assess the  Army\u2019s approaches to equipment reset to ensure that its priorities address  equipment shortages in the near term to minimize operational risk and  ensure that the needs of deploying units could be met.

The plan also noted the challenge of linking the  equipment needs of the Army through the Army Force Generation model  using current depot maintenance production capabilities. Specifically, it  called for updates to policies and regulations governing depot  maintenance priorities, including revisions to Army regulation AR 750-1,  the Army Materiel Maintenance Policy, and the establishment of  processes resulting in depot production to support high priority unit  equipment needs.

In March 2011, an initial R3  equipment priority list was issued, based primarily on shortages identified  by U.S Army Forces Command. According to Army officials, this initial list  was revised and reissued at the end of fiscal year 2011 to include critical  equipment shortages identified and fully endorsed by all Army  commands. According to officials, the Army is now using the R3 list to  prioritize the retrograde and reset of about 19,000 items of rolling stock  from Kuwait as of February 2012. Officials indicated that the Army plans  to return about half of these items to the U.S. by the end of March 2012 to  begin the reset process.", "Officials with the Army\u2019s Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff, Programs,  Directorate of Force Development said that the R3 equipment list is a  consensus among Army organizations on rank order priority needs and  provides Army leadership with timely and accurate information to make  strategic resourcing decisions to equip units for future missions. They  believe the R3 equipment list will benefit the Army in making key  decisions to address equipping and resourcing issues for units deploying  and training as part of the Army\u2019s reset planning process. The Army plans  to monitor the effectiveness of the R3 initiative to better link reset funding  and execution to the Army\u2019s equipping priorities. Because it had not  begun to fully implement the initiative until this year, the Army does not  expect to have sufficient data to gauge the effectiveness of the R3  initiative until the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012.", "As the Army continues to encounter equipment shortages and faces the  prospect of future fiscal constraints and limited budgets, as well as  uncertainties concerning the amount of equipment expected to return  from theater in the near term, the need to manage and prioritize reset  depot workload consistent with unit equipment needs remains critical. The  Army has previously noted that the challenge with reset is linking depot  maintenance capabilities with its retrograde and redistribution efforts to  meet the needs of the operational Army as it goes through the Army  Force Generation process. We believe full implementation of the R3  initiative would be a step in the right direction.

Specifically, the monthly reports  identify the Army\u2019s cumulative progress in terms of the number of items  reset in the current fiscal year to date, the number of brigades that have  undergone reset, and the number of new items procured as replacement  for battle-loss or damaged items. However, none of these measures  indicate the status of the Army\u2019s future reset liability, which is the total  repair cost being incurred through ongoing and expected deployments.  Nor do the reports capture differences between the equipment the Army  resets during the year and the equipment it had initially planned to reset.  As a result, Congress does not have visibility over the Army\u2019s progress in  addressing reset and expected total reset costs.

The Office of the  Secretary of Defense, Cost Analysis and Program Evaluation has  developed and tracks for each of the services a cost factor\u2014the multiyear  reset liability\u2014that estimates the military services\u2019 future reset costs.  The multiyear reset liability is the amount of money that a service would  need to restore all equipment used in theater to its original, pre-conflict  state over several fiscal years. This includes the cost to reset all  equipment currently in theater, as well as all equipment that has returned  from theater and not yet been reset. In 2010, the Cost Analysis and  Program Evaluation analysis estimated the Army\u2019s multiyear reset liability  at that time was $24 billion, and it plans to revise this figure in the  summer of 2012. As the Army successfully completes certain reset  actions, its overall reset liability can decrease. Further, some actions,  such as additional deployments, buildups of equipment in theater, or an  increased pace of operations can increase the multiyear reset liability. We  believe the multiyear reset liability is a useful estimate because it provides  a cost benchmark against which progress can be measured. However,  the Army\u2019s monthly reset execution reports currently do not provide future  reset liability cost estimates to Congress.

The monthly reports also  include the number of items completed, and the percent complete\u2014 number completed compared to total requirement. Table 1 provides an  example of what the Army reports to Congress each month, based on a  report provided in fiscal year 2012.", "As table 1 shows, the Army reports aggregate information on reset  activity in broad categories, such as Tactical Wheeled Vehicles or  Aviation Support Equipment. However, for two reasons, the data do not  show the true picture of the Army\u2019s progress in executing its reset plan.  First, the data do not distinguish between the planned items for reset\u2014 the funding for which items was programmed by the Army and included in  the Army\u2019s budget justification materials to Congress\u2014and the unplanned  items repaired through reset.  Rather, the figures shown as \u201ccompleted\u201d  include both planned and unplanned items.", "To illustrate this point, our analysis of Army data from fiscal year 2010  shows that 4,144 tactical wheeled vehicles were planned for reset in fiscal  year 2010 and a total of 3,563 vehicles were executed (see table 2).  According to the Army\u2019s current reporting method, this would result in a  reported total completion rate of 86 percent. However, our analysis  showed that, of the total number of items executed, 1,647 items or  approximately 40 percent of the equipment reset was actually equipment  that had been planned and programmed. More than half of the tactical  wheeled vehicles reset\u20141,916\u2014were items that had not been planned  for reset.", "According to Army documents, the reset of unplanned items is due  primarily to changes in, among other things, the mix and condition of  equipment returning to home stations and unforeseen changes to troop  commitments in theater. For example, DOD documents show that in fiscal  year 2010, reset requirements were affected by the expansion of forces in  Afghanistan. This force expansion also required additional equipment,  which the Army supplied in part by shipping equipment that had been  planned for retrograde from Iraq\u2014and eventual reset in the United  States\u2014to Afghanistan instead. While we acknowledge such challenges,  the Army\u2019s current reporting of reset execution does not permit Congress  to see when deviations between planning and execution occur.", "Second, by reporting in broad aggregate equipment categories, the  Army\u2019s reports do not give Congress visibility over reset activity for  individual types of equipment. In some cases, our analysis shows that,  while the overall completion percentage may be high, the picture can be  significantly different when looking at individual items. For example, as  discussed above, the total number of items executed during fiscal year  2010 was 86 percent of the total planned reset for the aggregate category  of tactical wheeled vehicles. However, this number alone can obscure  important information on the pace of reset for individual types of vehicles  within the aggregate category. Table 3 offers a breakdown of the items  reset in the Tactical Wheeled Vehicle category for fiscal year 2010.", "As table 3 shows, the actual reset activity for items labeled as \u201cother  automotive\u201d was significantly more than planned\u20141,641 compared to  667, whereas the reset activity for high mobility multipurpose wheeled  vehicles was significantly less than planned\u2014895 compared to 1,966.  Therefore, reporting the overall completion percentage for the category  without information on the status of vehicle types does not provide  transparency into the Army\u2019s progress on its total reset efforts. This  information is important because it has cost implications. Specifically,  while items may fall into the same category, the cost to reset can vary  broadly depending on the vehicle type. For example, both the M1200  Knight (an armored security vehicle) and the M1151 HMMWV are  categorized as Tactical Wheeled Vehicles in the Army\u2019s monthly reports  to Congress. For planning purposes, in 2010 the Army requested over  $500,000 for the repair of each M1200, while requesting about $154,000  for the repair of each M1151. However, in 2010 more M1200s were  repaired than planned, thus accounting for a larger share of the budgeted  reset funds. At the same time, with fewer funds remaining, some  equipment planned and budgeted for repair was not reset, pushing that  workload to future fiscal years. Conversely, if fewer M1200s had been  reset than were planned, the $500,000 estimated reset liability for each  M1200 would be incurred in a future fiscal year, as they would still require  reset eventually. In either case, the Army would record the actions taken  within the numbers shown for the reset of Tactical Wheeled Vehicles, but  the cost impact of these two scenarios will be different given the  difference in estimated costs for the two items. Therefore, understanding  how many items of each vehicle type have been reset is important to  understanding the implications of changes in reset execution for the  Army\u2019s multiyear reset liability. Without information on the multiyear reset  liability and additional details within current reports, Congress may not  have a complete picture of both the Army\u2019s progress in meeting its reset  plan as well as the long-term cost implications of reset."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The Army needs to balance multiple factors that make reset planning and  execution a complicated and challenging process.

DOD also  provided technical comments that we incorporated as appropriate.", "In disagreeing with our first recommendation for the Army to include its  multi-year reset liability in the monthly congressional reset reports, DOD  stated that the Army\u2019s monthly reset report was intended to show the  status of equipment reset activities in the year of execution. According to  DOD, the Army does not plan to include the estimate of future reset  liability projections in every monthly report because developing those  estimates includes the projection of future deployed force levels as well  as major force redeployment timelines, which are factors that do not  significantly change on a month-to-month basis. However, DOD stated  that the Army plans to include the Army\u2019s estimate of future equipment  reset liability in its summary report to Congress for the fiscal year. We  believe the Army\u2019s plan to report future equipment reset liabilities in its  summary report for each fiscal year would meet the intent of our  recommendation.", "DOD also disagreed with our second recommendation that the Army  include in its monthly congressional reset reports status information on  the percentage of equipment reset by vehicle type. DOD stated that the  Army intends to provide more detailed information on reset program  adjustments in those reports, but noted that the Army does not  recommend doing so by vehicle type. Specifically, DOD stated that actual  monthly equipment reset production rates are extremely dynamic and  adjustments in the depots are made daily based on a number of factors.  Further, DOD stated that adjustments are common across all of the  nearly 800 systems that proceed through the depots for reset each year  and are best summarized by the most major changes among large  categories. The department further stated that current vehicle categories  in the monthly reports are adequate for this purpose, but indicated that  additional explanation of major variances between planned, newly  planned and executed equipment reset would be included in future  reports. However, as we reported, the broad categories do not fully  capture deviations between planned and executed reset by vehicle type,  and the Army did not explain what information it will include in these  additional explanations. Therefore, we remain concerned that the  changes in reset reporting suggested by the Army would not provide  adequate visibility to Congress over planned and executed equipment  reset. Consequently, we have added a matter for congressional  consideration suggesting that Congress consider directing the Army to  include status information on the percentage of equipment reset  according to the initial reset plan by vehicle type in its monthly reports to  Congress.", "We are sending copies of this report to interested congressional  committees, the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Army.

We also  reviewed Army guidance explaining the definition of reset and how it is  employed to restore equipment for units to pre-deployment levels. We  reviewed the Army Force Generation regulation to determine the criteria  to establish Army policy to institutionalize the Army Force Generation  model, which supports strategic planning, equipment prioritization, and  other resources to generate trained and ready forces, and the role of  reset in supporting the model to repair equipment for units to meet future  missions. We obtained and reviewed the Army Reset Execution Order,  which provides guidance to the Army on reset operations. We obtained  written responses on our inquiries from Army officials and conducted  interviews to discuss the execution order and their interpretation of the  roles, responsibilities, and activities required to execute the reset of  equipment returning from overseas to the United States. We reviewed  and analyzed reset documents associated with the execution order, which  contained information on the Army\u2019s annual sustainment-level reset  workload requirements estimates. We obtained written responses on our  inquiry from Army officials and conducted interviews to discuss and  understand the methodology used to develop those estimates and the  equipment mix and quantities expected to return from Southwest Asia to  the United States for reset for the current fiscal year. We reviewed and  analyzed the Army\u2019s equipment retrograde priority lists identifying  equipment needed to be returned to the United States for reset and  reviewed guidance on the retrograde of equipment to understand the  methodology used to develop the list. We analyzed the relationship  between the sustainment-level reset workload requirements estimates  worksheet and retrograde priority list to determine the similarities and  differences in the type and mix of equipment identified for depot-level  reset. We discussed these similarities and differences to understand how  they affect the Army\u2019s ability to identify and reset the right equipment to  support both deploying and training units. We held several discussions  with Army officials to learn about the retrograde, reset, and redistribution  (R3) initiative and how they expect this initiative might improve  equipment-reset processes to better align reset efforts with unit  equipment needs. We interviewed officials in the Office of the Secretary  of Defense for Logistics and Materiel Readiness to obtain information  about DOD\u2019s guidance on reset.", "To determine the extent to which the Army\u2019s monthly reset reports to  Congress provide visibility over reset costs and execution, we obtained  data published in the Reset Execution Order on the Army\u2019s annual  sustainment-level reset workload requirements estimates from fiscal  years 2007 through 2012 to determine the quantities of equipment  planned for reset. We obtained reset execution data generated by the  Army Materiel Command and Army Logistics Management Program  System from fiscal years 2007 through 2010 to determine the actual  amount of equipment reset in support of contingency operations. We  provided questions, received written responses, and interviewed Army  officials to understand the reset planning and execution process, and  reporting requirements to Congress on both planned and actual reset  data and budgets. We focused our analysis on the reset of Army rolling  stock, which was heavily rotated in and out of Southwest Asia to support  Operation Iraqi Freedom because it accounts for the majority of the  Army\u2019s depot reset funding. We compared the reset workload  requirements estimates to the reset execution data, using the National  Stock Number, to determine whether the data were accurate,  comparable, and consistent for our review purposes. In addition, we  collected and reviewed documents and data on historical and current  budget execution for reset to determine the consistency between annual  reset requirements and budget requests. We performed a data reliability  assessment of the information systems containing the execution data and  determined that the date were sufficiently reliable for the purpose of this  engagement. We provided questions, received written responses, and  interviewed Army officials to clarify how budget data were used and to  ensure that we had a good understanding of how to interpret the data for  our purposes. We also discussed with Army officials the process for  tracking and reconciling reset expenditures with quantities of equipment  based on planned equipment requirements. Further, we obtained and  reviewed historical and current monthly Supplemental Cost of War  Execution Reports on Army reset expenditures and funding requests  submitted to Congress, and the Army\u2019s monthly congressional reports on  the quantity of equipment repaired through reset to determine the type of  information reported on reset costs and the equipment quantities repaired  at the depots. We have previously reported on problems relating to the  reliability of data generated from the Army\u2019s Logistics Management  Program, but have not specifically reviewed the reliability of the reset  depot execution data.", "To address each of our objectives, we also spoke with officials, and  obtained documentation when applicable, at the following locations:", "Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology,  and Logistics, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Logistics and  Materiel Readiness, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for  Maintenance, Policy, and Programs", "Office of the Secretary of Defense for Cost Assessment and Program", "Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)", "Headquarters Department of the Army; Office of the Deputy Chief of  Staff, G-4 Logistics; Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff, G-8,  (Programs), Directorate of Force Development; Office of the Deputy  Chief of Staff, G-3/5/7 Strategy, Plans, and Policy; and Army Budget  Office", "U.S. Army Central Command", "U.S. Army Materiel Command", "U.S. Army Forces Command", "U.S. Army Sustainment Command", "TACOM Life Cycle Management Command  We conducted this performance audit between January 2010 and May  2012 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
