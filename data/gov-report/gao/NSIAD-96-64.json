DOD did not consider the board resolution appropriate for this case, partially because of the board membership of the foreign owners and their veto rights over certain basic corporate decisions. The company board of directors consists of six representatives appointed by the U.S. owners and one representative for each of the four foreign minority interests. Any single foreign director can block any of 16 specified actions of the board of directors. These actions include the adoption of a company strategic plan or annual budget as well as the development of a new product that varies from the lines of business set forth in the strategic plan. In addition, any two foreign directors can block an additional 11 specified actions. These veto rights could give the foreign interests significantly more control and influence over the U.S. defense contractor in certain instances than would be permitted in an SSA.

None of these security arrangements is intended to deny U.S. defense contractors the opportunity to do business with their foreign owners. However, the frequent contact engendered by legitimate unclassified business transactions can heighten the risk of unauthorized access to classified information.

At six of the firms we reviewed, monitoring the security implementation and the business operations of the company by the trustees ranged from limited to almost nonexistent. In only two of the firms did the trustees appear to be actively involved in company management and security oversight.", "The need for trustee oversight of the business management of foreign-owned companies was highlighted at one SSA firm we examined. At this company, the foreign owners exercised their SSA powers to replace two successive director/presidents of the U.S. company. The first claimed he was terminated because he attempted to enforce the SSA. The second president contested his dismissal because the outside directors were not given prior notice of the owners\u2019 intent to replace him. The owners stated that in both cases, poor business performance was the cause for termination and, in these cases, the outside directors agreed.

At the companies we reviewed, a variety of personnel served as FSO, including a general counsel, secretaries, and professional security officers. In any case, the FSO often performed the administrative functions of security and lacked the knowledge to determine the proper parameters for the substance of classified discussions, given a cleared foreign representative\u2019s need to know. This limitation and the FSO\u2019s potential vulnerability as an employee of the foreign-owned company pose a risk without active trustee involvement.", "Another potential problem associated with trustees relinquishing implementation and monitoring responsibilities to the FSO was illustrated at an SSA firm we reviewed. At the SSA firm, the FSO wanted to establish a new security procedure, but was overruled by the president of the foreign-owned U.S. defense company. In this instance, the FSO had enough confidence in the outside directors to go to them and complain. The outside directors agreed with the need for the new control and required its implementation. In this case, the outside directors led the officials of the foreign-owned firm to believe that the new security measure was an outside director initiative. If the circumstances and individuals had been different, the FSO might have lacked the confidence to seek the assistance of the outside directors.", "At the foreign-owned companies we reviewed, trustees were paid between $1,500 and $75,000 a year.

This additional duty involves occasionally receiving, reviewing, and transmitting approval requests by facsimile machine.", "The ISR requires that a trustee approve visitation requests. However, in most of the firms we reviewed, trustees only directly approved visits between senior management of the U.S. firm and the foreign parent firm. The FSO approved visits below this senior management level, including visits with the technical and engineering staff; the trustees only reviewed documentation of these visits during their quarterly trustee meetings, if at all. In addition, when required, most post-visit contact reports lacked the detail needed for the trustees or DIS to determine what was discussed between the foreign-owned company and the owners\u2019 representatives. Trustee inattention to contact at the technical level is of particular concern, since that is where most of the U.S. defense contractor\u2019s technology is located, not in the board room where senior management officials are found.", "Trustees rarely visited or toured the foreign-owned company\u2019s facility to observe the accessibility of classified or export-controlled information, except during prearranged tours at the time of their quarterly meetings. The trustees also rarely interviewed managerial and technical staff to verify the level and nature of their contact with employees of the foreign parent firm.

Visitation request approvals: The trustees should strictly adhere to the ISR visitation agreement provision that requires them to approve requests for visits between the U.S. defense contractor and representatives of its foreign owners. This duty should not be delegated to officers or employees of the foreign-owned firm. 2. Trustee monitoring: The trustees should be required to ensure that personnel of the foreign-owned firm document and report the substance of the discussions they hold with personnel of the foreign parent firm. The trustees should review these reports and ensure that the information provided is sufficient to determine what information passed between the parties during the contact. The trustees should also select at least a sample of contacts and interview the participants of the foreign-owned firm to ensure that the post-contact reports accurately reflect what transpired. 3. Trustee inspections: To more directly involve trustees in information security monitoring, the trustees should annually supervise an information security inspection of each of the cleared facilities. The results of these inspections should be included in the annual report to DIS. 4. FSO supervision: To insulate the FSO from influence by the foreign-owned firm and its foreign owners, the trustees should be empowered and required to review and approve or disapprove the selection of the FSO and all decisions regarding the FSO\u2019s pay and continued employment. The trustees should also supervise the FSO to ensure an acceptable level of job performance, since trustees are charged with monitoring information security at the U.S. defense contractor. 5. Financial independence: To monitor the financial independence of the foreign-owned firm, the annual report to DIS should include a statement on any financial support, loans, loan guarantees, or debt relief from or through the foreign owners or the government of the foreign owners that have occurred during the year. 6. Trustee independence: To help avoid conflicts of interest for the trustees, require them to certify at the time of their selection, and then annually, that they have no prior or current involvement with the foreign-owned firm or its foreign owners other than their trustee position. This certification should include a statement that they are not holding and will not hold positions within the foreign-owned company other than their trustee position. It should be expressly stated that these independence standards apply equally to voting trustees, proxy holders, and outside directors of firms under SSAs. 7. Trustee duties: The selected trustees should be required to sign agreements acknowledging their responsibilities and the specific duties they are required to carry out those responsibilities, including those in numbers 1 through 4.
