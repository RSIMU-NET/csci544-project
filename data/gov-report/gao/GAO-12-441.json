Congress recommended that the Department of Defense (DOD) and Department of State (State) establish policies, procedures, and indicators to measure results and required that they submit annual reports.

Officials stated that their outreach efforts contributed to increased support for PSI since GAO\u0092s 2008 report, such as the increase from 93 to 98 countries endorsing PSI. In addition, they have extended access to PSI activities to more countries that are not part of the group of 21 PSI Operational Experts Group countries, for example by holding regional planning meetings. Despite recommendations of Congress and GAO that agencies develop PSI performance indicators, DOD, State, CBP, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation have not developed indicators that can be used to systematically measure progress toward the stated PSI objective. Further, the agencies have not systematically evaluated PSI activity results. Although some officials indicated plans to develop PSI performance indicators, officials from DOD and State also cited several challenges to developing indicators to measure PSI activities\u0092 results including difficulty quantifying how PSI activities improved capacity. However, GAO has previously reported that, despite such challenges, developing measures that help link activities to results is possible.

The current administration  has continued to support PSI, and agencies with PSI responsibilities have  reaffirmed that objective.

The  9/11 Act also required DOD and State to submit annual PSI reports and  mandated GAO to assess and report periodically on PSI\u2019s effectiveness,  including progress made in implementing the law\u2019s provisions.

PSI encourages partnership  among states to work together to develop a broad range of legal,  diplomatic, economic, military, law enforcement, and other capabilities to  prevent WMD-related air, land, or sea transfers to states and nonstate  actors of proliferation concern. International participation is voluntary, and  there are no binding treaties on those who choose to participate.  Countries supporting PSI are expected to endorse PSI principles,  embodied in four broad goals in the Statement of Interdiction Principles of  September 2003, by a voluntary, nonbinding \u201cpolitical\u201d commitment to  those principles. See appendix II for the full text of the Statement of  Interdiction Principles. They also voluntarily participate in PSI activities  according to their own capabilities.

The  policy office in the Office of the Secretary of Defense heads the U.S.  delegation to these multilateral meetings.", "According to State, at multilateral PSI planning meetings,  PSI exercises vary in size and complexity, and some involve military  personnel and assets from participating PSI countries. Other exercises  examine the use of law enforcement or customs authorities to stop WMD  proliferation. There are also \u201ctabletop\u201d exercises or simulations, which  explore scenarios and determine solutions for hypothetical land, air, or  sea interdictions. Among the most visible PSI exercises are those that  combine a tabletop and a live interdiction exercise using military assets  from multiple PSI countries, such as practicing the tracking and boarding  of a target ship.", "Other activities include both outreach to countries that have not endorsed  PSI principles and cooperation and collaboration with countries that have  endorsed PSI and are seeking assistance to increase their capacity to act  in accordance with the Statement of Interdiction Principles. These efforts  include workshops, training, conferences, and bilateral discussions with  foreign government officials.

Since then, an interagency group, including  representatives from all agencies participating in PSI, produced two  companion guidance documents, Guidance for U.S. Government  Activities in Support of the Proliferation Security Initiative and Insuring the  Durability of PSI: An Action Plan, that the interagency group adopted in  2010 and 2011, respectively. According to National Security Staff  officials, these documents are a primary source of policies and  procedures for all relevant agencies\u2014defining PSI activities, providing  guidance on interagency communication, and addressing objectives and  responsibilities.

As we reported in our 2008 review of PSI,  DOD had PSI-specific policies and procedures in place, specifically those  encouraging combatant command participation in PSI exercises. DOD  Joint Staff provided guidance directing combatant commands to leverage  the staff, assets, and resources of the existing DOD exercise program in  support of PSI exercises. This Joint Staff guidance provided procedures,  including roles and responsibilities, for the planning and execution of U.S.  military support to PSI. Among other things, the guidance encouraged  combatant commands to change existing DOD exercises by adding a PSI  component. Our 2008 review also reported that CBP, a component of  DHS, produced a PSI-specific directive that provides roles and  responsibilities, policies and procedures, and PSI-relevant definitions.

The lead agency solicits input from all U.S. agencies  participating in PSI and consolidates the information provided to produce  the final report for submission to Congress. State and DOD have  submitted annual PSI reports in 2009, 2010, and 2011 including  descriptions of PSI activities, but these reports do not include all required  estimated expenditures for PSI activities over the next 3 fiscal years and  the amount expended in the prior year.", "DOD is the only agency performing PSI activities that has provided all  required planned and prior year expenditure information for these reports.  For example, the 2011 report includes information from DOD stating that  it plans to conduct a regional PSI exercise called Leading Edge in Central  Asia in fiscal year 2012 and in the Middle East in fiscal year 2014 and that  each exercise is estimated to cost $600,000 for staff travel to support  planning events and exercise execution. Table 1 shows annual planned  expenditures from that report for PSI-related exercises in fiscal years  2012 to 2014 for DOD combatant commands and Joint Staff only,  including many of the major PSI-related activities expected in that period.  The report indicates that these expenditures include travel expenses,  conference hosting fees, contracting support, training expenses, and  other uniquely PSI-attributable expenses and lists all agencies consulted  in the preparation of the report.", "In addition, DOD has fully reported its prior year expenditures and, in  many cases, includes expenditure amounts by activity.

For example, for fiscal years 2008 and 2009, DOE reported total  PSI expenditures of $69,000 and $55,000 respectively. Also, FBI reported  that it spent a total of about $750,000 to organize and sponsor PSI events  in Hungary and Australia in fiscal year 2009. However, no expenditure  data were provided for activities in which DOE participated for fiscal year  2010 and for FBI\u2019s activities in fiscal years 2008 and 2010. From DHS,  CBP officials could document submitting PSI-specific expenditures of  about $35,000 for the 2010 report; however, the report did not include this  information, stating that the only costs DHS incurred were associated with  travel to PSI events. According to State officials, State does not identify  and track its PSI-related expenditures because it made the decision that  such a breakout is unnecessary. However, officials said they could  calculate State\u2019s total PSI-related expenditures because these are almost  entirely for travel to OEG meetings or bilateral negotiations. FBI officials  also reported that they do not separately track PSI expenditures.", "Of the four agencies we spoke with, only DOD makes a specific budget  request for PSI-related activities. U.S. Strategic Command has a fiscal  year 2011 budget of $800,000 to provide financial assistance for  combatant commanders to plan, participate in, and execute WMD  interdiction exercises. This fund is used routinely but not exclusively to  support PSI activities such as hosting a PSI exercise, embedding PSI  scenarios into broader military exercises, ensuring that appropriate  subject matter experts can participate in PSI exercises, or purchasing  interdiction-related training aids. According to State officials, they prefer  funding PSI expenditures from their general operating accounts because  this practice allows them greater flexibility and the ability to fund PSI- related travel when the need arises. FBI and CBP officials also reported  that they provide PSI funding when necessary through more general  operating accounts.", "Agencies that do not track and report their expenditures are not providing  Congress sufficient information for Congress to assess U.S. participation  in PSI. If agencies are unable to provide requested assistance, but are  not tracking or reporting on expenditures, it is difficult for the agencies to  determine and demonstrate to Congress whether they are effectively  prioritizing their use of limited resources.

The most recent endorsees are Antigua  and Barbuda, Colombia, the Republic of Korea (South Korea), St. Vincent  and the Grenadines, and Vanuatu. Further, the number of signed bilateral  shipboarding agreements between the United States and individual PSI  countries increased between November 2008 and February 2012 from 9  to 11.

According to the officials, the  initiative\u2019s activities are focused on building capacity to perform  interdiction, but actual interdictions are not performed as part of PSI.  They emphasized that they cannot credit successful interdictions to  PSI activities, in part because there are many efforts in addition to PSI  that are focused on counterproliferation. Also, a change in the number  of interdictions over the previous year could be attributed to a range of  positive and negative factors, including better capacity to interdict,  increased transfers of illicit material, or failure to deter transfers.", "Tracking measures of U.S. efforts, such as the number of activities  hosted by the United States, ignores the fact that PSI is a  multinational effort.", "Further, State officials said some of the results of PSI activities are  difficult to quantify. For example, although the officials said tools and  expertise provided to participants at activities are used by participants to  enhance their ability to interdict illicit cargo, the extent of the improvement  is often difficult to measure and track.", "Despite the challenges U.S. agencies face in developing performance  indicators, it is possible for agencies to measure performance. One  possible approach agencies could consider is to develop a framework  that links PSI activities to the initiative\u2019s objective. GAO has previously  identified such frameworks, called logic models, that agencies could  adopt even if they face performance measurement challenges similar to  some of the ones identified by PSI implementing agencies.GAO reported that using a logic model could allow the agencies to  consider indirect outcomes and unquantifiable benefits when linking  activities and outputs to the overall objective. By specifying the program\u2019s  theory of what is expected, a logic model can help evaluators define  measures of the program\u2019s progress toward its ultimate goals. In  particular, GAO found that logic models were used or could be used to  measure results in programs with challenges similar to some of PSI\u2019s,  including, for example, difficulty in observing changes in behavior  occurring after activity completion and difficulty in attributing outcomes to  activities because of external factors\u2019 influence on the outcomes.

While  all agencies we spoke with except DOD stated that they fund their PSI  activities from their general funds, rather than request an annual PSI  budget, it does not eliminate the requirement that they provide  expenditure information for their PSI activities under the 9/11 Act. Without  reports that include the required information for all agencies\u2019 PSI  activities, Congress will not know how much the U.S. government is  spending on PSI and how such funds are being allocated. Also, while  U.S. agencies have provided years of documentation of a range of  activities they have performed or plan to perform under PSI, they have  been unable to demonstrate if or how these activities are linked to the PSI  objective. Without performance indicators that can be used to  systematically measure progress toward the stated PSI objective and a  framework for measuring the results of PSI activities, Congress and the  public do not have a sufficient basis to judge whether PSI activities are  successful."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To ensure that Congress has information to assess U.S. participation in  PSI, we recommend that the Secretaries of Defense and State take the  following two actions:  1.  Include in the annual PSI report to Congress the required expenditure  information for all U.S. agencies participating in PSI activities; and 2.  Develop a framework for measuring PSI activities\u2019 results, including  performance measures where possible that help link the results to  PSI\u2019s objective."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DOD, State, FBI, and DHS.

FBI and DHS, along with DOD and State provided technical  comments that we have incorporated into this report, as appropriate.", "In commenting on the draft report, DOD partially concurred with both of  our recommendations. Consistent with our recommendation, DOD agreed  that the annual PSI report should include expenditure information for all  U.S. agencies. DOD stated that the reports have included information on  expenditures by DOD and other agencies that are unique to PSI, while  excluding items that are accounted for in agency general operating  budgets. However, we found that some expenditure amounts not reported  in the annual reports were unique to PSI and, therefore, should have  been included. In a 2009 e-mail to CBP, a DOD official stated that travel  expenses could be included in its submission to the annual report, as long  as they were specifically for a PSI event. However, after CBP submitted  such expenditures to DOD, they were excluded from the 2010 annual  report even though they were for PSI-specific travel. DOD also partially  concurred with our recommendation to develop a results framework. The  department cited challenges in establishing objective and quantifiable  measures of success but committed to make an effort to implement the  recommendation by using the Critical Capabilities and Practices (CCP)  concept as a results framework and to identify meaningful performance  measures, where appropriate.", "State partially concurred with the recommendation to provide expenditure  information for all U.S. agencies participating in PSI activities. The  department explained that it is difficult to define some expenditures as  unique to PSI, for example, because travel in support of PSI events often  coincides with travel in support of other department operational activities.  However, the department said it would closely examine travel-related and  other expenses unique to PSI in order to include them in future reports to  Congress. State did not concur with our recommendation that it should  develop a results framework. State said it had some indicators, such as  the numbers of PSI-endorsing countries, for use in measuring PSI  progress, but cautioned that PSI does not lend itself to collective data that  would provide reasonable approximation of results. Nonetheless, State  cited the CCP effort as one tool it intends to use, in coordination with  other participating U.S. agencies, \u201cwhich could contribute to an effective  future analysis of the outcomes of coordinated PSI activity,\u201d which is  consistent with our recommendation. Although we made a written request  for documentation of State\u2019s PSI performance indicators in July 2011,  State did not provide documentation of its PSI indicator and targets until  March 2012, after it provided its response to our draft report. We have  revised our report findings to include this documentation and our  assessment. Upon reviewing the documentation provided, we found that  the metrics State identified were not consistently listed as annual metrics  in the strategic plan to which they refer. For example, neither the number  of endorsing states nor the conclusion of shipboarding agreements were  listed as metrics for fiscal years 2010 or 2011. In addition, State set no  numeric targets for its participation in PSI activities for fiscal years 2010  or 2011. Without an overall results framework including, where possible,  consistent indicators and targets that can be tracked over time, State  cannot systematically evaluate its PSI activities.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, the  Secretary of Homeland Security, the Attorney General, and other  interested parties.

We requested and reviewed documentation of  policies and procedures developed since 2008. Because the National  Security Staff is the custodian of the interagency policy documents, we  discussed the contents of those documents with National Security Staff  officials and reviewed the documents to confirm that they contained PSI  policies and procedures.
