Since about two-thirds of nonelderly Americans obtain their health  insurance coverage through an employer, individuals who become  unemployed face not only a loss of income, but also potentially the loss of  employer-subsidized health insurance. Although the number of people  without health insurance increases as the unemployment rate increases,  the rates of increase are not the same because a sizable number of  workers (25 percent) do not have health insurance through their  employers. Workers less likely to receive insurance include those who  work in industries where employment is cyclical in nature, such as  agriculture or construction; when they lose their jobs, their health  insurance status is unaffected.", "Federal laws provide some protections to help newly unemployed  individuals maintain health insurance coverage by allowing them to  purchase coverage under their former employer\u2019s group health plan or to  obtain coverage through the individual insurance market.

Nearly all large firms  and almost half of smaller firms offer health insurance coverage for their  employees. Federal tax laws provide incentives for employers to pay  some or all of the premiums because their contributions are tax deductible  as a business expense; the employer-paid portion of the premiums is also  not considered taxable income for employees. Although the share of the  premiums paid by employers varies with the size of the firm and the type  of health plan, firms pay an average of more than 80 percent of the  premiums for single coverage and more than 75 percent for family  coverage.

Medicaid eligibility is based in part on family income and assets. States set  their own eligibility criteria within broad federal guidelines. For example,  states vary in the kind and amount of income they exclude from  consideration when determining eligibility. Similarly, while some states set  a ceiling on the value of assets\u2014such as cars, savings accounts, or  retirement income\u2014that individuals may have available to them in order  to be deemed eligible for Medicaid, other states have no asset test for  eligibility. To the extent that asset tests are present in a state\u2019s Medicaid  program, individuals would need to \u201cspend down\u201d or dispose of their  assets to become eligible for Medicaid.", "More than half of the individuals enrolled in Medicaid are children.  Federal law requires states to provide Medicaid coverage to children age 5  and under if their family income is at or below 133 percent of the federal  poverty level and to children age 6 to 19 in families with incomes at or  below the federal poverty. Most states have received federal approval to  set income eligibility thresholds that expand their Medicaid programs  beyond the minimum federal statutory levels for children.", "Medicaid eligibility for nondisabled adults is more limited. Federal law  requires states to provide Medicaid coverage to pregnant women up to 133  percent of the federal poverty level, and mandatory eligibility for parents  is linked to the Medicaid family coverage category established in the 1996  federal welfare reform law. At a minimum, federal law requires states to  offer Medicaid coverage to parents in families that meet the income and  other eligibility rules that the state had in place on July 16, 1996, for  determining eligibility for welfare assistance. Nationwide, considerable  variation in Medicaid eligibility thresholds for parents exists. For example,  Alabama covers parents whose family income is up to 13 percent of the  federal poverty level. At the other end of the spectrum, Minnesota covers  parents with family incomes up to 275 percent of the federal poverty level.  The Medicaid statute does not generally provide for mandatory or optional  coverage of nondisabled childless adults. However, some states have  received federal approval to expand their Medicaid programs to include  coverage for some of them.", "In 1997, the Congress created SCHIP to provide health coverage to  children living in families whose incomes exceed the eligibility limits for  Medicaid. While SCHIP is generally targeted to children in families with  incomes at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty level, each state  may set its own income eligibility limits, within certain guidelines. As of  January 2002, states\u2019 upper income eligibility threshold for SCHIP ranged  from 133 to 350 percent of the federal poverty level. Unlike Medicaid,  which entitles all those eligible to coverage, SCHIP has a statutory funding  limit of $40 billion over 10 years (fiscal years 1998 through 2007). Under  SCHIP, states can cover the entire family\u2014including parents or custodians  of eligible children\u2014if it is cost-effective to do so, meaning that the  expense of covering both adults and children in a family does not exceed  the cost of covering just the children.

Individuals working part time, for small firms, or in certain  industries, such as agriculture or construction, were more likely to be  uninsured (see table 1). Young adults, minorities, and low-income persons  were also more likely to be uninsured. The percentage of uninsured is  generally higher in the South and West and lower in the Midwest and  Northeast (see fig. 2).

While program requirements  vary by state, individuals eligible for unemployment insurance generally  (1) have worked for a specified period in a job covered by the program,   (2) left the job involuntarily, and (3) are available, able to work, and  actively seeking employment. Most states provide a maximum of 26 weeks  of benefits, although benefits in some states have been extended for an  additional 13 weeks in times of high unemployment. Benefits are  generally based on a percentage of an individual\u2019s earnings over the prior  year, up to a maximum amount. The national average weekly  unemployment benefit was $254 in the first quarter of 2002, with benefits  lasting an average of nearly 15 weeks.

To qualify for COBRA benefits, former  employees must have been covered by the employer\u2019s plan the day before  they stopped working at the firm. Former employees are eligible only for  the health plan coverage that they received while employed. COBRA  coverage is not available if the former employer discontinues health  benefits to all employees, as in a company closure.", "While employers must allow COBRA-eligible former employees to  continue receiving coverage under the employer\u2019s group health plan, the  employer does not have to pay for it. The former employee can be required  to pay the full cost of the group health premium plus 2 percent, which is  designed to cover the employer\u2019s administrative cost of keeping the former  employee in the plan. Based on data from a 2002 survey of employers, the  average cost of COBRA coverage is approximately $260 a month for an  individual and $676 a month for a family. Based on a survey of a national  sample of 1,001 nonelderly adults, a recent study estimated that because of  the cost of COBRA continuation coverage, \u201conly 23 percent of employed,  insured adults would be very likely to participate in the COBRA program if  they lost their jobs.\u201d", "Unlike COBRA, which provided the opportunity for individuals losing their  jobs to continue their private group health insurance, HIPAA provisions  guarantee certain individuals losing group coverage the right to purchase  coverage in the individual market. HIPAA provides guaranteed access to  health coverage for individuals who, among other criteria, had at least 18  months of coverage without a break of more than 63 days and with the  most recent coverage being under a group health plan. HIPAA stipulates  that states must either require health insurers to make certain of their  policies available to qualifying individuals or use an \u201calternative  mechanism\u201d to offer them coverage. An example of an alternative  mechanism is a state-sponsored high-risk pool, which offers  comprehensive insurance coverage to individuals with preexisting health  conditions who are otherwise unable to obtain coverage in the individual  market or who may be able to obtain coverage only at a prohibitive cost.  (Appendix I describes how the six states that we reviewed guarantee  access to coverage under HIPAA.) As with COBRA, individuals bear the  full cost of individual coverage received under HIPAA. Since HIPAA  provides for coverage in the individual insurance market, in which  premiums are generally based on the characteristics of the individual  applicant, this coverage is likely to be more costly for many applicants for  a similar level of coverage than premiums for groups, where risk is spread  over all members of the group.

The high-risk pools in these three states began operation in  the early 1990s and also served individuals eligible for coverage under  HIPAA (see table 8). High-risk pools are subsidized. Because enrollees  often have major health problems, medical claims costs are high and  would exceed unsubsidized premiums collected from their enrollees.  Oregon\u2019s risk pool was subsidized by a fee assessed on insurers based on  the number of people they cover. Utah subsidized the operation of its high- risk pool with state funds. Colorado used a combination of these  approaches.", "High-risk pool premiums are higher than standard premiums for individual  insurance paid by healthy applicants although not necessarily higher than  a high-risk individual would be charged in the individual market if  coverage were available. State high-risk pool laws generally capped  premiums at 125 to 200 percent of comparable standard commercial  coverage rates. Premiums varied based on factors such as age, geographic  location, type of health plan, and deductible. One state, Colorado,  provided a 20 percent premium discount to certain low-income  individuals.

But it is not clear how much of the  increased participation came from the ranks of the unemployed. For  example, a Colorado official said a large portion of the increased  enrollment in the state\u2019s high-risk pool was likely due to insurers leaving  the individual and small group health insurance market in the state.

However, we  reported earlier that some waivers are inconsistent with the goals of the  Medicaid and SCHIP programs and may compromise their fiscal integrity.  For example, in approving Utah\u2019s expansion, we concluded that HHS did  not adequately ensure that the waiver would be budget neutral as required  for approval. We estimated that Utah\u2019s waiver, if fully implemented, could  cost the state and federal governments $59 million more than without the  waiver.

Although we did not review Colorado and  Oregon\u2019s waiver applications in our earlier report, we raised a broader  legal issue about states\u2019 use of SCHIP funds to cover adults without  children, which Oregon\u2019s recently approved expansion will do. In our  earlier report, we found that HHS had approved an Arizona waiver  proposal that would, among other things, use unspent SCHIP funding to  cover adults without children, despite SCHIP\u2019s statutory objective to  expand health care coverage to low-income children. In our view, HHS\u2019s  approval of the waiver to cover childless adults is not consistent with this  objective, and is not authorized. Consequently, we recommended that the  Secretary of Health and Human Services not approve any more waivers  that would use SCHIP funds for childless adults. In addition, we  suggested that the Congress amend the Social Security Act to specify that  SCHIP funds are not available to provide health insurance for childless  adults."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["Health insurance for the majority of Americans who rely on employer- based coverage could be threatened upon job loss.

While those who cannot  afford health insurance may look to Medicaid or SCHIP for assistance,  coverage for adults is hampered by limited income eligibility and other  requirements, such as asset tests, that are likely to reduce the number of  adults that can qualify for coverage. Some states have made recent efforts  to use the flexibility available to them under Medicaid and SCHIP to  expand their programs to help cover increased numbers of uninsured  adults. Tighter budgets, however, are beginning to constrain some states\u2019  ability to sustain insurance coverage expansions initiated during stronger  economic times. Thus, despite program expansions, coverage under  Medicaid and SCHIP may not be available to unemployed adults, while  other state coverage options may be too costly for these individuals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report for technical review to representatives  of insurance departments, high-risk pools, and Medicaid programs in the  six states we reviewed.

The state  contends that its waiver is budget neutral and is consistent with long- standing HHS budget neutrality practices. Since 1995, we have expressed  concern that HHS\u2019s methods for assessing budget neutrality allow the  inclusion of certain costs that inappropriately inflate cost estimates and  result in the federal government being at risk to spend more than it would  have had the waivers not been approved. We believe that continued use  of these methods is inconsistent with the long-standing requirement for  section 1115 waivers to be budget neutral and inappropriately places the  federal government at risk of increased cost for the Medicaid and SCHIP  programs.", "We did not obtain comments from HHS on this report because we did not  evaluate HHS\u2019 role or performance with respect to protections or  programs that may benefit unemployed individuals.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce its contents  earlier, we will plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days after  its date.
