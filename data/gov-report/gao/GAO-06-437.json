Egypt has received about $1.3 billion annually in U.S. foreign military financing (FMF) assistance and has purchased a variety of U.S.-manufactured military goods and services such as Apache helicopters, F-16 aircraft, and M1A1 tanks, as well as the training and maintenance to support these systems. The United States has provided Egypt with FMF assistance through a statutory cash flow financing arrangement that permits flexibility in how Egypt acquires defense goods and services from the United States. In the past, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) accumulated large undisbursed balances in this program. Because the flexibilities of cash flow financing permit Egypt to pay for its purchases over time, Egypt currently has agreements for U.S. defense articles and services worth over $2 billion--some of which are not due for full payment until 2011. The Departments of State (State) and Defense (DOD) have not conducted an assessment to identify the risks and impacts of a potential shift in FMF funding. Officials and many experts assert that the FMF program to Egypt supports U.S. foreign policy and security goals; however, State and DOD do not assess how the program specifically contributes to these goals. U.S. and Egyptian officials cited examples of Egypt's support for U.S. interests, such as maintaining Egyptian-Israeli peace and providing access to the Suez Canal and Egyptian airspace. DOD has not determined how it will measure progress in achieving key goals such as interoperability and modernizing Egypt's military. For example, the U.S. Central Command, the responsible military authority, defines modernization as the ratio of U.S.-to-Soviet equipment in Egypt's inventory and does not include other potentially relevant factors, such as readiness or military capabilities. Achieving interoperability in Egypt is complicated by the lack of a common definition of interoperability and limitations on some types of sensitive equipment transfers. Given the longevity and magnitude of FMF assistance to Egypt, evaluating the degree to which the program meets its goals would be important information for congressional oversight, particularly as Congress assesses the balance between economic and military assistance to Egypt as well as the impact on U.S. foreign policy interests."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["After signing the Camp David Peace Accords, Egypt emerged as the second  largest recipient of U.S. military aid in the world.

To fund this program, approximately $1.3 billion has been  appropriated annually and disbursed through a cash flow financing  arrangement that allows Egypt to spread the payments over several years.  Specifically, the United States uses FMF funds set aside for Egypt to  purchase military equipment, services, and training from U.S. contractors  on Egypt\u2019s behalf. These defense articles and services are to modernize  Egypt\u2019s armed forces and enhance Egypt\u2019s military interoperability with the  United States.

We traveled to Cairo, Egypt, to meet with Egyptian officials at the  Ministry of Defense and U.S. officials at the U.S. Embassy and at the Office  of Military Cooperation (OMC). We also interviewed officials at U.S.  Central Command (CENTCOM) in Tampa, Florida, to discuss their roles  and responsibilities in the FMF program for Egypt. In addition, we  interviewed senior Egyptian officials in Washington, D.C., and several  political and military experts from academic and policy institutions in  Washington, D.C.

These interests include building friendly  nations\u2019 capabilities for self-defense and coalition operations,  strengthening military support for containing transnational threats,  protecting democratically elected governments, and fostering closer  military ties between U.S. and recipient nations.According to State, the  objectives of the FMF program worldwide include:  assisting friendly foreign militaries in procuring U.S. defense articles  and services for their countries\u2019 self defense and other security needs;  promoting coalition efforts in regional conflicts and the global war on   improving capabilities of friendly foreign militaries to assist in  international crisis response operations;   contributing to the professionalism of military forces;  enhancing rationalization, standardization, and interoperability of  friendly foreign military forces;  maintaining support for democratically elected governments; and  supporting the U.S. industrial base by promoting the export of U.S.  defense-related goods and services.", "Generally, FMF provides financial assistance in the form of credits or  guarantees to U.S. allies to purchase military equipment, services, and  training from the United States. Recipient countries can use the assistance  to purchase items from the U.S. military departments through the Foreign  Military Sales (FMS) process or directly from private U.S. companies  through direct commercial sales. State is responsible for the continuous  supervision and general direction of security assistance programs,  including FMF, in coordination with DOD. DSCA leads the day-to-day  program implementation for each FMF recipient country in coordination  with other DOD entities at the unified combatant commands and in the  recipient countries. CENTCOM\u2019s responsibilities include developing and  implementing security cooperation plans for Egypt and other countries in  the Middle East, as well as coordinating with other government entities on  major Egyptian equipment requests.

In 1998, the United States and  Egypt agreed to a 10-year assistance phase-down in conjunction with a  similar package for Israel. The package for Egypt reduced economic  assistance by $40 million each year but did not increase FMF assistance to  Egypt. U.S. economic assistance to Israel was reduced by $120 million each  year, and the amount of U.S. military assistance was increased by $60  million per year. In 2004 and 2005, amendments to the Consolidated  Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2005 and the Foreign Relations  Authorization billfor fiscal years 2006 and 2007 proposed converting  some military assistance to economic assistance to Egypt. The 2004  amendment was not adopted and did not become law. Furthermore, as of  March 2006, the 2005 amendment has not been enacted. Additionally, a  conference report attached to the fiscal year 2006 Foreign Operations  Appropriations bill requires State to report to Congress on the balance  between economic and military assistance provided to Egypt, including  whether maintaining the current level of military assistance in relation to  economic assistance is appropriate in light of the political and economic  conditions in Egypt and in the region. Although this requirement was not  stipulated in law, it conveys congressional intent to have this information  provided to the Congress.", "Over the past decade, Congress and the executive branch laid out a  statutory and managerial framework that provides the foundation for  strengthening government performance and accountability, with GPRA as  its centerpiece. GPRA is designed to inform congressional and executive  decision making by providing objective information on the relative  effectiveness and efficiency of federal programs and spending. A key  purpose of the act is to create closer and clearer links between the process  of allocating resources and the results expected to be achieved with those  resources. Program evaluations are objective studies that answer questions  about program performance and results, and explore ways to improve  them. In 2002, OMB implemented the Performance Assessment Rating Tool  (PART) method of assessing federal programs. PART assesses federal  programs in four areas: purpose and design, strategic planning,  management, and results and accountability. Another assessment tool,  which we have discussed in previous reports, is a logic model. This tool  can be used to describe a program\u2019s components and desired results, while  explaining the strategy by which the program is expected to achieve its  goals. A logic model is a representation of the relationship between the  various components of a program, typically including at a minimum, inputs,  activities, outputs and outcomes. By specifying the program\u2019s theory of  what is expected at each step, a logic model can help evaluators define  measures of the program\u2019s progress toward its ultimate goals.

They noted,  however, that the Egyptian military\u2019s definition of interoperability is  limited to participation in joint exercises, such as Operation Bright Star.  Additionally, Egypt and the U.S. use interim short-term solutions to  minimize limitations with respect to interoperability. For example, U.S.  officials stated they have established temporary communications  installations on certain equipment and have flown alongside Egyptian   C-130s to facilitate Egypt\u2019s participation in a joint exercise.

Therefore, the recommendations are appropriately addressed to both  departments.", "State did not indicate whether it concurred with our recommendations.   With regard to our first recommendation, State emphasized that steps to  mitigate risks are already in place, such as maintaining reserves to pay  costs associated with terminating FMF contracts.  However, contract  termination reserves are last-resort measures that do not represent a  comprehensive assessment for reducing risk associated with possible  fluctuations in the resources of the FMF program for Egypt.  As we specify  in the report, a risk assessment should include other measures such as  reducing the scope of existing contracts, stopping new orders, or selling  undelivered defense goods.  An assessment that identifies the risks,  including a plan to mitigate and anticipate these risks, would be  appropriate and consistent with federal government internal control  standards.", "On our second recommendation, State noted that it will work with DOD to  better define measures for assessing Egypt\u2019s modernization goals but  stated that defining a level of interoperability would be speculative.  Improving Egypt\u2019s ability to operate with the U.S. and coalition partners  has been a critical, yet unmeasured goal of the program. At a minimum,  DOD and State can begin to measure Egyptian forces\u2019 capabilities to  operate with allied countries in military exercises or peacekeeping  operations. Evaluating the degree to which the program meets its goals  would be important information for congressional oversight, particularly as  Congress assesses the balance between economic and military assistance  to Egypt, as well as the impact on U.S. foreign policy interests.", "State commented that our report found that cash flow financing caused the  accumulation of undisbursed balances in the FMF program for Egypt. DOD  made the same comment in their technical comments. We modified the  language in our report to clarify that the flexibilities of cash flow financing  as managed by DSCA in the past allowed for the accumulation of large  undisbursed balances.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date. At that time, we will send copies of this report to the  appropriate congressional committees, and to the Secretaries of Defense  and State and other interested parties.

Specifically, we interviewed U.S. Department of Defense (DOD),  and Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) officials. We examined  DSCA data from the Defense Security Assistance Management System  (DSAMS) database for the period 1999 to 2005. We sorted and categorized  this data by type of procurement, year, military service, and cost to  determine the composition of purchases made by funds provided under the  Egypt FMF program. The broad categories of equipment and services were  then examined for specific content and type of equipment, training,  support, or service. In addition, we conducted multiple interviews with  database administrators and information technology specialists to assess  the reliability of the data in this system. We determined that the DSAMS  database is reliable for the purposes of this report. We also interviewed  officials and reviewed documentation from the U.S. Office of Military  Cooperation in Cairo (OMC), along with U.S. Embassy officials, to better  understand the nature of the program and the types of equipment and  services procured through this program. In addition, we interviewed  Egyptian military officials in Cairo and Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials  at the Egyptian embassy in Washington, D.C.", "To assess the financing arrangements used to provide FMF assistance to  Egypt, and determine how undisbursed balances accumulated in the Egypt  FMF program accounts, we examined data from DSCA\u2019s Credit System  Database and interviewed officials from the DSCA Middle East and South  Asia Division and Comptroller\u2019s Office, as well as the Defense Finance and  Accounting Service. To identify the amounts of accumulated undisbursed  balances, we examined fiscal data by annual appropriation, total amount of  accumulated undisbursed balances, and amount of funds that had been  disbursed by fiscal year. We analyzed this data by fiscal year and  interviewed the database administrator and information technology  specialists responsible for this database. We determined that the Credit  System Database is reliable for the purposes of this report. To assess the  manner in which the undisbursed balances were being eliminated, we also  examined three DSCA databases used to manage the financing  arrangement for the Egypt FMF program: (1) a cash-flow tracking database  that monitors letters of offer and acceptance (LOA) and the amount of  funds needed in each fiscal year, (2) a fiscal year data base that monitors  the time needed to execute a procurement request, and (3) Egypt\u2019s Five  Year Defense Plan. We interviewed the custodians of these databases in  DSCA\u2019s Middle East and South Asia Division to develop an understanding of  how they are used to manage the cash flow financing arrangement and the  program more generally. We also met with the Office of Management and  Budget (OMB) to gain an understanding of the plan to eliminate the  accumulated undisbursed balances. We did not examine or assess U.S.  economic assistance to Egypt.", "To evaluate how the United States assesses FMF assistance to Egypt and its  contribution to the advancement of U.S. foreign policy and security goals,  we examined multiple U.S. and Egyptian government documents, and  interviewed U.S. and Egyptian government officials and foreign policy  specialists. Specifically, we obtained and analyzed the State Department\u2019s  mission and bureau performance plans to understand U.S. foreign policy  and security goals and priorities, and how the executive branch evaluates  those goals. Similarly, we obtained DOD theater and country security  cooperation plans and compared their goals and priorities to understand  how DOD would measure results against them. We then examined U.S.  Central Command\u2019s (CENTCOM) evaluation tools to understand what  metrics it used to evaluate program results. In addition to U.S. and  Egyptian government officials, we spoke with foreign policy experts from  the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Georgetown University,  the Council on Foreign Relations, the Heritage Foundation, the U.S.  Institute for Peace, the Middle East Institute, the National Defense  University, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the  Brookings Institute. To assess DOD\u2019s evaluations of security assistance  goals, we reviewed various assessments and identified key components  that are inherent in all of these assessments. We also researched other  potential models that may assist in program evaluation. We interviewed  officials from State and DOD in Washington, D.C., who are responsible for  administering and implementing the FMF program to Egypt. We also met  with Egyptian government officials in Washington, D.C. We traveled to  Cairo and met with State and DOD officials at the U.S. Embassy and the  OMC. In addition, we interviewed CENTCOM officials responsible for the  FMF program to Egypt as well as Egyptian Ministry of Defense officials in  Cairo.", "We performed our work from May 2005 through March 2006 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Letter of Request and Letter of Offer and Acceptance Process", "paragraphs": ["The review and approval process for FMF-funded purchases begins with  the Egyptian military requesting the purchase of certain defense articles or  services, and ends with a signed letter of offer and acceptance for those  goods or services.
