In fiscal year 1995, the average monthly number of AFDC recipients was about 13.6 million\u20144.4 million adults and 9.2 million children\u2014and payments to recipients totalled nearly $22 billion. AFDC is an entitlement program funded with federal and state dollars, with the federal share determined by a matching formula related to each state\u2019s per capita income. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has federal oversight responsibility for the program. Each state administers and determines many aspects of its AFDC program within federal guidelines, including payment amounts, eligibility requirements, and treatment of income and resources.", "In recent years, policymakers and analysts have expressed growing discontent with the welfare system, many claiming that the system fosters dependency. There have been no limits on the length of time families may receive benefits, except for recent experiments in some states that have received federal approval to test time limits. One study estimates that about 35 percent of those who ever receive AFDC will eventually receive benefits for a total of 5 years or more, when all moves on and off welfare are considered. In addition, some policymakers and analysts believe that the welfare system should no longer provide cash benefits for additional children born to AFDC mothers.", "With the Family Support Act of 1988, the Congress created the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training (JOBS) program to transform AFDC into a transitional program geared toward helping parents become employed and avoid long-term welfare dependence. Under JOBS, states are to (1) provide a broad range of education, training, and employment-related activities; (2) increase the number of AFDC clients participating in these activities; (3) target resources to the hard-to-serve; and (4) provide support services, including child care and transportation. The Family Support Act created minimum requirements for the percentages of AFDC clients participating in JOBS that states must meet to receive their full share of federal funding. The minimum participation requirements rose from 7 percent of nonexempt AFDC clients in fiscal year 1991 to 20 percent in fiscal year 1995. While most states have met the minimum participation requirements, the number of AFDC clients participating in JOBS remains limited. In fiscal year 1994, about 13 percent of the 4.6 million adults receiving AFDC were active in JOBS activities each month.", "Our previous work has shown that most JOBS programs nationwide do not have a strong employment focus. About one-half of the county JOBS administrators nationwide that we surveyed stated that they do not work enough with employers to find jobs for participants. In addition, although most of the program officials reported that less than one-half of their job-ready participants had become employed, the officials reported little use of subsidized employment or work-experience programs, options available under JOBS. Various factors were identified that contribute to the lack of a strong employment focus in some JOBS programs. For example, the performance measurement system for JOBS holds states responsible for the number and type of AFDC clients participating in JOBS activities but not for the number who get jobs or earn their way off AFDC. In addition, county JOBS administrators cited insufficient staff as a major obstacle to implementing or expanding the use of tools such as subsidized employment and work-experience programs.

Instead, each state would have received a block grant to provide temporary assistance for needy families. These block grants would have provided states fixed annual federal allocations and increased their flexibility in operating their programs. H.R. 4 would have limited families\u2019 lifetime receipt of benefits to 60 months (whether or not consecutive), but allowed states to provide hardship exceptions in limited cases. In addition, the legislation would have required parents to engage in work after 24 months of receiving assistance (whether or not consecutive) or earlier, if a state determined that the parent was ready to engage in work.

In Florida, the timing of work requirements depends on the terms of the employability plan developed for each client. The states also differ about which activities will satisfy their work requirements.

Families receive the first $50 of child support collected each month and the state retains a portion of the remainder, which is based on its share of AFDC benefit payments.

Local job placement contractors voiced concerns that they were not receiving a sufficient number of client referrals, according to the county program director. The county identified two sources of this problem. First, many clients who were referred did not show up for their scheduled orientations with the contractors, who would work only with those clients who did appear. To address this problem, the state changed the wording of its contracts with job placement contractors to specify that they were expected to work with all referred clients, including those who failed to attend their orientations. In addition, the county had clerical staff call clients to remind them of their scheduled orientations. Second, staff encountered difficulties in developing an initial pool of clients to refer to job placement contractors. Typically, a 20- to 40-day period elapsed before staff could assign clients assessed to be job-ready to any program activities, including job placement. This delay arose because clients assessed to be job-ready are subject to time-limited benefits and are provided an opportunity to appeal their assessment.

The self-sufficiency plan, however, tended to cause some staff to focus too much on clients\u2019 barriers and why clients were unable to engage in work activities, according to Florida\u2019s welfare reform administrator. When clients met with staff to complete their employability plan, about 10 to 14 days after development of the self-sufficiency plan, staff and clients tended to focus on the barriers to employment identified in the self-sufficiency plan. Staff were attempting to first address all the barriers clients faced and then help them find employment, instead of initially focusing on how to move them quickly into employment.

Indiana modified its provision to provide that clients\u2019 benefits would be calculated at the time of their entry into employment and would remain at that level even if their earnings increased, subject to certain limits. To help clients make a more stable transition to the workforce, Florida, Virginia, and Wisconsin extended the length of time that their income disregards would be available. This change responds to concerns that families may experience a significant decline in their standard of living when benefits are reduced or discontinued after existing federal income disregards expire.", "As shown in table 3.1, Florida, Indiana, and Virginia modified their asset limits or vehicle asset limits. Higher asset limits enable clients to save money that can be used to deal with situations that might otherwise undermine their transition off welfare, such as a vehicle breakdown.

The state disregards all earned income for up to 24 months as long as earnings plus AFDC benefits are equal to or less than federal poverty guidelines. Moreover, families receiving AFDC can establish savings accounts of up to $5,000 and own motor vehicles with a fair market value of up to $7,500. In the view of state officials, increasing financial incentives to clients who get jobs is a critical change that will help ensure the long-term success of the state\u2019s welfare reform initiative. Virginia officials believe that disincentives to work were intrinsic in previous programs because AFDC benefits were immediately reduced or the case closed when clients became employed.

This change responds to a frequently voiced criticism of traditional AFDC sanctions\u2014namely, that they have little effect on some clients because their food stamp benefits, which are partly based on the clients\u2019 household income, are increased to compensate for much of the reduction in their AFDC cash benefits.", "Virginia increased the size of the benefit reduction and made it easier to apply sanctions more quickly in its welfare reform program.

A family\u2019s entire benefit is terminated a minimum of 2 months for the second sanction and a minimum of 3 months for the third and subsequent sanctions. In addition, clients can be sanctioned more quickly because Virginia eliminated its conciliation process. This process had provided noncompliant clients an opportunity to avoid receiving a sanction by demonstrating compliance or indicating that they intended to comply. The state eliminated the conciliation process because it found the process administratively burdensome and considered the sanction to be too far removed from the act of noncompliance to affect clients\u2019 behavior.", "Indiana increased the length of sanction periods and imposes sanctions more frequently in its welfare reform program. The first sanction now applies for a minimum of 2 months, the second for at least 12 months, and the third for a minimum of 36 months, regardless of when the clients rectify the noncompliance. In addition, Indiana does not allow individuals to apply for AFDC for 90 days after voluntarily quitting employment. The number of AFDC clients sanctioned in the first 5 months of program implementation was about 150 percent higher than the number sanctioned the previous year for the same months.

For example, obtaining a sufficient number of jobs for clients or developing new sources of child care could prove to be more challenging for welfare reforms implemented on a larger scale.", "It is too early to determine what effect the welfare reforms in the states we reviewed might have on moving people into employment and off welfare. State and local officials point to preliminary data that suggest that their program changes may be making a difference in the size of their caseloads. For example, over a 14-month period, the two Wisconsin pilot counties\u2019 combined caseloads decreased by over 40 percent since beginning the Work Not Welfare program. Between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 1995, Indiana experienced a 22-percent decrease in its statewide AFDC caseload, which state officials attribute to the implementation of Indiana\u2019s Work First philosophy. However, it is unclear whether these declines are directly attributable to the programs or to other factors, such as a strong economy, low unemployment rates, or in the case of Wisconsin, other welfare changes within the state. Because the programs in the states we reviewed are relatively new, no formal evaluations examining the effect of the reforms have been completed to date. At the time of our review, none of the programs had been operating long enough for recipients to reach the time limits."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Comments From HHS and States", "paragraphs": ["We obtained comments on a draft of this report from HHS and the five states whose welfare reform programs are reviewed in the report.
