JPL is NASA\u2019s field installation for solar system exploration and is a major operating division of Caltech. Together, these overlapping roles contribute to unique JPL management and oversight challenges.", "FFRDCs are operated under agreements funded by sponsoring federal agencies to provide for research or development needs that cannot readily be met by the agencies or contractors. JPL work is primarily funded by NASA; however, other sponsors can fund JPL efforts under reimbursable arrangements with NASA. JPL\u2019s total 1994 business base was just over $1 billion.", "JPL receives work projects directly from NASA program offices. It can also submit proposals to, or respond to non-competitive requests from, other work sponsors using up to 25 percent of the JPL direct workforce. Both the NASA-directed work and the non-NASA work must be determined to be appropriate for JPL to perform based on the scope of the sponsoring contract. Caltech has operated JPL for NASA since NASA became an agency in 1958 and conducted work at the same site for other federal entities as early as the 1930s. The current contract is in effect from  September 20, 1993, to September 30, 1998. It provides a framework of procedures, regulations, and other guidance for funding specific tasks. Rather than signing separate contracts for individual work projects, funding for JPL is provided under \u201ctask orders\u201d for specific work. Cost allowability is governed by the contract and by the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB) Circular A-21, \u201cCost Principles for Educational Institutions.\u201d", "In our first report to the Committee, we discussed JPL\u2019s fixed fee, selected cost controls, scope of work, food and beverage charges, and tuition payments for dependents. Our second report discussed the management of NASA equipment by JPL, particularly loaning it to employees and controlling it at Caltech\u2019s campus."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Contract Concerns Addressed", "paragraphs": ["Changes have been made to address the concerns raised in our July 1993 report. First, the fixed fee under NASA\u2019s previous contract with Caltech was replaced with a fee structure that bases two-thirds of the fee award on NASA\u2019s assessment of JPL\u2019s performance. Also, new reporting and review procedures could provide control over selected costs comparable to that at commercial contractors. Similarly, although the scope of work was not substantively modified for NASA tasks, it was narrowed and oversight was increased for non-NASA work performed by JPL. Finally, the total number of deviations from the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) in the contract was reduced.", "In addition, our concern regarding the tuition asistance benefit will be addressed as part of NASA\u2019s recent request to DCAA for a review of JPL\u2019s compensation package."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Award Fee Linked to Performance", "paragraphs": ["The previous contract provided Caltech with a fee range of between $11.4 million and $15.4 million, based solely on the volume of work conducted at JPL. This arrangement was contrary to NASA\u2019s goal of considering performance in awarding fee to contractors and counter to the agency\u2019s policy of not paying fee or profit on contracts with universities. We recommended that NASA authorize a deviation from its policy against paying fee to educational institutions only if its purpose and amount was adequately justified and, if a fee was authorized, to base the amount on performance.", "For the new contract, NASA approved a policy deviation allowing fee payment to a university and created a new fee structure. Under the contract\u2019s \u201cManagement Performance Incentive Plan,\u201d Caltech is paid $6 million plus an additional performance-based amount of up to $12 million. The incentive criteria for the performance-based fee is specified in the contract, with assigned weights of 65 for technical performance, 25 for institutional management, and 10 for outreach programs. Two evaluation boards and an award official will determine the fee amount, based on ratings by individuals familiar with JPL\u2019s work for NASA and non-NASA sponsors. NASA\u2019s award decision is not subject to the contract\u2019s dispute clause and no incentive fee is paid if performance is less than satisfactory. NASA awarded a total fee of $16.5 million for 1994.", "NASA may also indicate emphasis areas prior to each rating period. For 1994, no areas were emphasized due to extended contract negotiations. Eight areas have been identified for 1995\u2014including cost containment, improved compliance with JPL policies, increased cultural and gender diversity in senior management, and effective social and educational outreach programs consistent with overall NASA and federal government initiatives in these areas. According to NASA officials, efforts pursued under any emphasis area must still fall within the contract\u2019s scope of work.", "We noted in our July 1993 report that Caltech received a higher fee than any of the other large FFRDCs administered by educational institutions that receive fees. Based on past ratings, Caltech is unlikely to receive less fee under the new fee structure. For example, Caltech could be scored one point above a poor/unsatisfactory rating\u201461 out of 100\u2014and still receive an incentive payment of $7.3 million on top of the $6 million fixed fee. This is more than the $13.1 million fee paid for the last year of the previous contract.", "Justifying and paying fee is an issue for all FFRDCs, not just JPL. NASA officials believe that JPL is the only FFRDC receiving a fee linked to performance and intend the $12 million performance-based fee as a strong incentive. If the incentive award fee concept is successful at JPL, performance-based fees could be considered for other FFRDCs that receive fees. Its success will depend largely on NASA applying a rigorous scoring system to help ensure a fair evaluation clearly reflecting performance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Greater Cost Visibility", "paragraphs": ["In our July 1993 report we noted that selected costs, called \u201cburden\u201d costs at JPL, were not being thoroughly reviewed by NASA. The current contract identifies DCAA as the responsible organization for reviewing JPL\u2019s annual submission of such costs and includes new reporting requirements for them as proposed by Caltech. According to NASA, these new reporting requirements improve the visibility of such costs. DCAA also believes the current contract language and the new reporting requirements could improve NASA\u2019s control of these costs. The key is the \u201cauditability\u201d of JPL\u2019s cost submission and the supporting documentation. DCAA has asked for specific cost data similar to that it requests from commercial contractors. JPL officials intend to provide the requested data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Broad Scope Remains, but Monitoring Improved for Non-NASA Work", "paragraphs": ["\u201cConducting (i) a program of supporting research and (ii) a program of advanced technical development, designed to make contributions to space science, space transportation, practical applications, technology and exploration.\u201d", "The basic broad content and lack of specificity in the prior contract remains in the current contract for NASA work. However, there was a change in the scope of non-NASA work. The contract previously specified that tasks undertaken for non-NASA agencies at JPL would \u201cfocus on\u201d efforts applying JPL developed technologies. The new contract replaces the words \u201cfocus on\u201d with \u201cbe confined to.\u201d", "However, the contract guidelines for non-NASA work remain broad. Therefore, the NASA Management Office at JPL\u2014which reviews and approves non-NASA task orders\u2014becomes the key control for ensuring the unique contribution of JPL to the work. Beginning last year, that office increased its oversight of the appropriateness of non-NASA task orders, particularly for those involving computer purchases. The Management Office has delayed approving tasks until further justifications have been provided and has asked JPL to notify potential non-NASA task sponsors early in the process of the need to document why JPL should do the work."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Fewer Deviations From Standard Contract Requirements", "paragraphs": ["NASA has reduced the number of contract deviations from standard clauses established in the FAR and NASA\u2019s FAR supplements. The number of FAR and NASA FAR deviations that were in the old research and development contract were decreased from 22 to 15, and the total number of standard clauses incorporated in the contract have increased from 74 to 98. For example, the standard \u201cPayment of Overtime Premiums\u201d clause was restored. As a result, a request for overtime premiums must document factors associated with the request, the effects of denial, and why other options would not be appropriate.", "NASA\u2019s current contract with Caltech contains two new deviations from prescribed cost allowability provisions. The FAR defers to OMB\u2019s Circular A-21, \u201cCost Principles for Educational Institutions,\u201d to prescribe which costs incurred by educational institutions may be recovered under government contracts and which may not. Under the Circular, costs incurred under an employee lawsuit under Section 2 of the Major Fraud Act of 1988, including amounts paid to the employee, are unallowable. The Circular also provides that, in general, fines and penalties resulting from violations of the law are unallowable costs. NASA\u2019s contract with Caltech, however, provides that if Caltech litigates a third party suit and is found to have violated federal law, Caltech\u2019s legal and judgment costs will be allowed if Caltech can demonstrate that it had a reasonable expectation of prevailing on the merits.", "A-21 also limits payment for advertising and public relations costs. The contract provides that this A-21 restriction does not apply to JPL disseminating public information on NASA programs or activities. For example, costs associated with JPL public events marking NASA accomplishments or the printing of program-related materials are expressly allowable. Similarly, the contract specifically allows costs for promoting technology transfer to the private sector\u2014a NASA mandate\u2014stating these costs are not a \u201ccost of selling and marketing,\u201d which A-21 does not allow."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Dependent Tuition Benefit to Be Reviewed", "paragraphs": ["Dependents of JPL employees accepted at Caltech attend the university tuition free, with the annual per student tuition\u2014$15,900 in fiscal year 1994\u2014charged to NASA. In addition, approximately 150 senior JPL employees are eligible for tuition assistance of up to half Caltech\u2019s tuition when their dependents attend other universities. JPL considers this Caltech employee benefit a key element for recruiting exceptional employees. In 1994, 39 dependents of 30 senior employees received assistance for attending other schools.", "As our July 1993 report stated, dependent tuition is an allowable cost under Circular A-21, if the benefit is granted according to university policy. NASA\u2019s 1980 approval of tuition reimbursement for JPL dependents attending other than Caltech was conditioned on Caltech limiting cost increases. However, as figure 1 shows, JPL\u2019s employee dependent tuition costs have continued to increase significantly in recent years.", "We recommended that NASA decide whether and to what extent it should continue paying dependent tuition support. The NASA Administrator responded that the tuition benefit is part of Caltech\u2019s general compensation and benefit plan and that it would be reviewed as part of a comprehensive JPL compensation review that NASA would conduct during fiscal year 1994. No review was conducted that year but, in September 1994, NASA requested DCAA perform a comprehensive review of JPL\u2019s compensation system. The request noted that various parts of the system had been reviewed by DCAA over the last 2 years and asked that those results be incorporated into the comprehensive review, together with additional areas of compensation that had not been audited. JPL\u2019s dependent tuition assistance program was specifically targeted for review."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Some Internal Controls Strengthened", "paragraphs": ["NASA and JPL responded quickly to our concerns and recommendations to rectify internal control weaknesses in the management of NASA equipment. Policies and procedures for employee equipment loans and the tracking of equipment at Caltech have been improved.

We recommended that NASA look at its employee loan policy to limit the type of equipment and conditions for borrowing and that JPL\u2019s policy be made consistent with NASA\u2019s policy.", "Both NASA and JPL have revised their policies. JPL issued new guidance on June 9, 1994, that severely restricts off-site use of property. They also initiated a recall of equipment not meeting the new conditions. Under the new criteria, equipment loans, including overnight use of a portable computer, is not allowed without meeting a critical need test and obtaining the approval of a division manager. The number of equipment items on loan dropped 88 percent from 4035 (valued at $7.6 million) in September 1993 to 451 items (valued at $760,000) by October 1994. NASA\u2019s property manager at JPL believes there will be a reduction in the future procurement of new computer equipment, in part as a result of the returned equipment being available for use at JPL.", "NASA\u2019s loan policy, issued July 18, 1994, allows for mission-essential home loans of 30 days, or up to 180 days after signing a loan agreement in which the employee assumes responsibility for the equipment. Both loans can be renewed once and require approval by the property custodian, immediate supervisor, and the division director/chief. Loan renewal requests beyond 360 days need approval by the Center Director or Director of Operations for NASA headquarters.", "We also recommended that NASA require JPL to review and improve its property control system, and evaluate and revise its procedures for keeping track of inventory, including equipment located at Caltech. In response, JPL formed advisory groups to study and address property control issues, and established a deadline of December 31, 1994, for the groups\u2019 recommendations to be implemented.", "NASA requested JPL conduct a wall-to-wall property inventory, which is now underway. All equipment has been scanned, both at JPL and Caltech, and NASA identification tags have been placed on all JPL equipment at Caltech. NASA\u2019s Property Manager noted losses are much lower at this point in the inventory than they were when property was last inventoried in 1992. Then, 12,000 items were not located after initial scanning, compared to 3,593 this time. The reasons for the differences will not be known until the 1994 inventory is complete.", "Our final recommendation\u2014that JPL identify and dispose of obsolete or excess equipment\u2014will be addressed by one of the JPL advisory groups in coordination with the NASA Management Office.

We specifically questioned the allowability of \u201cworking meals\u201d and recommended that they be identified in the new contract as unallowable costs. NASA agreed that the costs were unallowable but decided against specific contract language due to new JPL policies severely limiting food and beverage costs.", "According to the new JPL policies, working meals are not allowable contract charges. Restrictions were also placed on charges for cafeteria services, which totaled almost $145,000 for fiscal years 1991 and 1992. The new policy limits cafeteria charges to beverages, and only for meetings over 3 hours that include non-JPL employees. The new policies strictly limit chargeable meals and refreshments at JPL functions, and prohibit these charges for government employees. Food and beverage costs for the first 6 months under the new policies were $35,000. Almost three times that amount was charged to NASA for the 6 months prior to the policy change.", "NASA requested a DCAA audit of all JPL food and beverage costs for fiscal years 1991 and 1992. The resulting report questions almost $329,000 of the $406,650 in estimated costs for that period. In response, Caltech withdrew the questioned amount from NASA contract charges, stating that it did this so that the government would not be at a disadvantage while JPL evaluates the questioned costs. As of September 1994, none of the costs have been resubmitted to NASA. Subsequently, NASA requested an audit of food and beverage costs for fiscal years 1989, 1990, and 1993.

Two of these maintain offices at JPL\u2014the NASA Office of the Inspector General and DCAA. Under authority of the Inspector General Act, NASA\u2019s Inspector General is responsible for providing an effective audit program to review NASA activities.
