GAO has generally defined a bridge contract as an extension to an existing contract or a new noncompetitive contract awarded to the current contractor to avoid a lapse in service. GAO found that ETA operated most of these Job Corps centers (49 of 68) under bridge contracts for at least a year, with over a third operating under bridges for 2 years or potentially longer. ETA cited workforce challenges such as staff vacancies and the need to address issues raised in protests as contributing to its use of bridge contracts.", "ETA officials said they used various strategies to decrease their use of noncompetitive bridge contracts, including prioritizing efforts to award more contracts competitively. By the end of program year 2017, most of the centers operating under bridge contracts during program year 2016 (48 of 68) had transitioned to competitive contracts. Despite these efforts, ETA continues to face workforce challenges. Contracting officials expressed concern about having sufficient staff to award a large group of contracts that will begin to expire in program years 2021 and 2022 (see figure). ETA officials said it takes about 8 to 12 months from solicitation to contract award for new 5-year competitive procurements. Therefore, acquisition planning for a center contract set to expire in January 2021 would usually need to begin early 2020. However, ETA does not have a comprehensive workforce strategy to address its workforce challenges or support these new contract awards. As a result, ETA risks relying on noncompetitive bridge contracts again in the future.", "Note: Centers are operated on a program year basis, which runs from July 1 of a given year to June 30 of the following year.", "ETA used various strategies to monitor and incentivize contractor performance at the 10 centers GAO reviewed, including conducting onsite visits to Job Corps centers and paying incentive fees to contractors.

In fiscal  year 2018, Job Corps was appropriated approximately $1.7 billion in  funding. As of February 2019, the program enrolled over 30,000 students  at 119 centers in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico,  according to ETA officials.

Particular interest has been  expressed in Job Corps centers that operate under noncompetitive  contracts that act as bridge contracts. Federal agencies are generally  required to award contracts competitively but are permitted to award  contracts noncompetitively under certain circumstances, such as when a  particular contractor is the only source that can meet the need. Currently,  no government-wide definition for bridge contracts exists. However, GAO  has defined them as an extension to an existing contract beyond the  period of performance (including base and option years), or a new  noncompetitive short-term contract awarded to an incumbent contractor  to avoid a lapse in service.

However, in October 2015 and again in December 2018, we reported  some bridge contracts used by other federal agencies spanned multiple  years, potentially without the knowledge of approving officials. When  noncompetitive bridge contracts are used frequently or for prolonged  periods, the government is at risk of paying more than it should for  products and services.

We did not review data for centers operated by USDA because they are  operated through an interagency agreement between DOL and USDA  and are therefore not relevant for the purpose of this review. We also  used FPDS-NG data to identify centers that appeared to have operated  under bridge contracts in program year 2016, and verified our contract  selections with ETA officials to ensure these contracts were in effect  during this time frame. To calculate the length of time ETA used bridge  contracts to operate Job Corp centers, we included those centers that  had a bridge contract in place at some point during program year 2016.  We report the length of time that ETA used bridge contracts to operate  Job Corps centers as the minimum amount of time these contracts were  in use. We did not review bridge contracts that were completed prior to  program year 2016 because it was outside the scope of our review.  Therefore, our analysis may underestimate the length of time that ETA  operated some centers under such contracts. Based on our electronic  testing, review of contract documentation, and discussions with ETA  officials, we determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of our reporting objectives.", "To identify why ETA used bridge contracts, we conducted a  nongeneralizable review of 10 Job Corps centers that operated under  bridge or noncompetitive contracts during program year 2016.

As  discussed earlier, ETA has one contracting officer position for each of its  six regions. ETA officials said they faced significant attrition in the Office  of Contracts Management around 2013 when all but one of the six  regional contracting officers left or retired, leaving them with limited  regional resources to award center contracts. San Francisco was the only  Job Corps region that did not lose its contracting officer. Officials said that  this may help to explain why the region operated under fewer bridge  contracts as compared to the other five regions. In addition, ETA officials  said the agency decided to centralize contracting positions in the national  office in 2013 due to concerns about oversight of regional contracting  staff. In 2015, ETA decided to reestablish its regional contracting  structure, with one contracting officer in each region.", "To address the large number of staff departures, ETA hired new  contracting officers and all of the contracting officers we spoke with told  us that they joined ETA\u2019s Office of Contracts Management in 2015 or  2016.

Program officials said that the additional time needed to explain program  requirements to new contracting staff slowed down the contracting  process. Also, national officials said that contracting officers were unable  to competitively award center contracts because of the time needed to  carry out acquisition planning tasks, which as we have previously  reported, are important to establishing a strong foundation for the  contracting process. Such activities include market research, which is  used to collect and analyze information about capabilities within the  market available to satisfy agency needs.

ETA officials also said that such  contracts could be used when a center contract is expiring and no  follow-on contract has been awarded. According to the solicitation  for the IDIQ contracts, selected contractors should be able to quickly  take over center operations with limited disruption, provide the upkeep  of the facility, and ensure safe living and learning environments for  students, among other duties. Twelve contractors were awarded IDIQ  contracts and may compete for task orders to operate specific  centers. Regional contracting officials said the process for awarding a  task order is generally faster than their typical competitive center  contracts. They also noted that IDIQ contracts have been a helpful  tool in continuing operations at centers during protests. Regional  officials told us that incumbent contractors would previously file  protests when they were unsuccessful in winning new center  contracts because their existing contract was extended while the  protest was resolved. In the future, ETA officials said they can quickly  award a task order from an IDIQ contract to replace an incumbent  contractor during a protest. Also, under the terms of the solicitation for  the IDIQ contracts, contractors who received one of the 12 IDIQ  contracts would be prohibited from competing for task orders for  centers where they are the incumbent contractor.

Each region is assigned  one contracting officer who is responsible for awarding contracts for  center operations, among other support contracts. Most of these  contracting officers oversee 15 or more centers operated by contractors.  When one of the six regional contracting officer positions has a vacancy,  the contracting workload for that region is redistributed to other regions  and the national office, which can have significant implications. For  example, at the time of our review, national contracting officials told us  that they were assisting the two regions where contracting officers had  recently left. They said this increased their workload, as they had to  attend to the contracting needs of these two regions while fulfilling their  national contracting oversight duties. Similarly, contracting officials we  spoke with in five regions noted vacancies in other positions that support  the contracting process, such as those for contract specialists who  provide support during the contracting process and program officials who  provide technical expertise during proposal evaluations.

We selected this program year because it reflected  the most recent year with complete available data at the time we began  our review. We did not review data for centers operated by the U.S.  Department of Agriculture (USDA) because they are operated through an  interagency agreement between DOL and USDA and are therefore not  relevant for the purpose of this review. We also used FPDS-NG data to  identify centers that appeared to have operated under bridge contracts at  some point during program year 2016. Since there is no government-wide  definition for bridge contracts and ETA does not have a documented  definition, we used GAO\u2019s definition that has defined them as an  extension to an existing contract beyond the period of performance  (including base and option years), or a short-term stand-alone contract  awarded to an incumbent contractor to avoid a lapse in service. We  acknowledge that in the absence of a government-wide definition,  agencies may have differing views of what constitutes a bridge contract.

While ETA does not  consider contracts that exercise the \u201cOption to Extend Services\u201d under  Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.217-8 to be bridge contracts, we  include these contracts because our definition is focused on the intent of  the contracts or extensions\u2014that is, whether they serve as a mechanism  to \u201cbridge services\u201d until the next follow-on contract can be competitively  awarded.

We did not review bridge  contracts that were completed prior to program year 2016 because it was  outside the scope of our review. Therefore, our analysis may  underestimate the length of time ETA operated some centers under  bridge contracts.

Competitively awarded Job Corps center contracts  generally have periods of performance that total a maximum of 5 years,  which includes a 2-year base and three 1-year options. GAO\u2019s analysis  accounts for this complete period of performance; however, if all three  option years are not exercised, the center would need a new contract  sooner.", "To identify the strategies that ETA used to decrease its use of  noncompetitive bridge contracts, we reviewed FPDS-NG data to identify  the number of the bridge contracts ETA used in program year 2016 that  transitioned to competitive follow-on contracts by the end of program year  2017. We also reviewed agency guidance and contracting  documentation, and followed up with ETA contracting and program  officials at the national and regional levels to verify our contract  selections."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Review of Selected Job Corps Centers", "paragraphs": ["We conducted a nongeneralizable in-depth review of 10 Job Corps  centers that operated under bridge or noncompetitive contracts during  program year 2016 to provide illustrative examples. The 10 centers we  selected were Alaska, Carville, Cassadaga, Keystone, Milwaukee,  Northlands, Paul Simon, Pinellas, Turner, and Woodland. We selected  these 10 centers because (1) they were operated by contractors with  varying levels of success in achieving ETA\u2019s student performance  indicators, according to ETA\u2019s performance data, and (2) to ensure we  included at least one center from each of Job Corps\u2019 six regions.  Specifically, we selected 6 of the 10 Job Corps centers because they  were generally the lowest performing contract center in their region based  on ETA\u2019s performance data from program year 2015. We reviewed  performance data for this program year because it allowed us to identify  the actions, if any, ETA took to help improve low performing centers in  program years 2016 and 2017. The other four Job Corps centers were  randomly selected from the remaining Job Corps centers, which reflected  a mix of center performance levels. We excluded from our selection  centers that were not operational or were closed in program years 2016  or 2017, operated under a task order, or that had an open protest as of  June 30, 2018. In addition, we excluded centers with a competitive, non-  bridge contract, and centers operated by the U.S. Department of  Agriculture.", "After selecting the 10 centers, we reviewed the contract file for all bridge  contracts, the contract preceding the bridge contracts, and, if awarded by  the time of our review, the competitive follow-on contract. We also  interviewed contracting and program officials to understand the reasons  why ETA used bridge contracts and any challenges related to their use. In  addition, we obtained and reviewed ETA\u2019s evaluations of contractor  performance from the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting  System (CPARS) for these centers to understand how ETA monitored  contractor performance. We also examined other information related to  incentive fees paid to contractors for the 10 centers in our in-depth  review.

For the remaining three regions\u2014Chicago, Philadelphia,  and San Francisco\u2014we conducted phone interviews. For each regional  visit or call, we interviewed program officials in the Office of Job Corps,  including the regional director and program managers (who may serve as  contracting officer representatives). In addition, we interviewed regional  contracting officials in the Office of Contracts Management, including the  regional contracting officer and contract specialists who support the  contracting officer in carrying out their responsibilities. Additionally, we  interviewed national officials in ETA\u2019s Office of Job Corps and Office of  Contracts Management to better understand ETA\u2019s process for awarding  and monitoring Job Corps center contracts at the national level.
