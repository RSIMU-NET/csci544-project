Reported EHS research funding also rose as a percentage of total nanotechnology funding over the same period, ending at about 5 percent in 2010. However, GAO identified several reporting problems that raise concerns about the quality of EHS funding data reported. For example, for 18 percent of the 2010 projects GAO reviewed that were reported as EHS research, it was not clear that the projects were primarily directed at EHS risks. In addition, NNI member agencies did not always report funding using comparable data. The absence of detailed guidance on how agencies should report funding for their nanotechnology research has contributed to these problems, as GAO also reported in 2008 and made a related recommendation.", "In 2010, EHS research at the NNI member agencies GAO reviewed most frequently focused on carbon nanotubes, nanosilver, and nanoscale titanium dioxide. NNI has not prioritized nanomaterials for EHS research, but NNI\u0092s 2011 EHS research strategy outlines criteria for NNI member agencies to use in doing so. It is too soon to tell how these criteria will influence NNI member agencies\u0092 decisions about which nanomaterials to prioritize, and it is unclear if information needed to use the NNI criteria is available.", "The NNI member agencies have collaborated extensively on EHS research and strategies. They have collaborated through the NSTC to develop joint EHS research strategies and have initiated numerous formal collaborative EHS research projects. Nonfederal stakeholders who responded to GAO\u0092s web-based questionnaire on nanotechnology EHS research told GAO that they benefited from collaboration with the NNI member agencies but identified some challenges, including a lack of funding and limited awareness of collaboration opportunities, among others. Most respondents rated the 2011 NNI EHS research strategy as somewhat or very effective at addressing nanotechnology EHS research needs.", "NNI strategy documents for EHS research issued by the NSTC address two and partially address the other four of the six desirable characteristics of national strategies identified by GAO that offer a management tool to help ensure accountability and more effective results. For example, the NNI strategy documents provide a clear statement of purpose, define key terms, and discuss the quality of currently available data, among others. However, they do not include performance information\u0097such as performance measures, targets, and time frames for meeting those measures\u0097that would allow stakeholders to evaluate progress towards the goals and research needs of the NNI. In addition, the documents do not include, or sufficiently describe, estimates of the costs and resources needed for the strategy.

Unusual properties can emerge  in materials manufactured at the nanoscale\u2014including electrical,  magnetic, mechanical, optical, and thermal properties\u2014that differ in  important ways from the properties of conventionally scaled materials.  Materials at this scale that have been manufactured are sometimes  referred to as engineered nanomaterials. Nanotechnology has enabled  or facilitated novel research in areas such as computing, medicine,  energy conversion and storage, water purification, agriculture and food  systems, synthetic biology, aerospace, and geoengineering. Consumer  products that incorporate nanotechnology are as diverse as clothing,  cosmetics, household appliances, and sporting goods. For example,  nanoscale particles of titanium dioxide used in sunscreens act as physical  filters that absorb UV light without affecting the opacity of the product. A  2010 study estimated that values for products enabled by nanotechnology  were worth about $91 billion in the United States and $254 billion  worldwide in 2009.

We consulted with agency and OMB officials to determine  the type of budget information reported in these documents for the  agencies\u2019 investments. For fiscal year 2010, the most recent year for  which agencies\u2019 nanotechnology investment data were available, we also  collected quantitative and qualitative project-level data on all research  projects that the seven selected agencies had categorized as EHS  research (program component area 7). The agencies do not report  project-level data to OMB annually but report their total EHS research  funding to OMB annually for inclusion in the NNI budget supplements  published by NSTC. Therefore, we reviewed data on the individual  projects included in the agencies\u2019 total EHS research funding in 2010. To  assess the reliability of the agencies\u2019 data, we obtained information  regarding the data and the information systems used to produce and  store them.

Observed effects include early onset and  persistence of pulmonary fibrosis and interference with cell division. The  risk posed by a material is a combination of the hazard or negative effect  that material may have on an organism and the extent of the organism\u2019s  exposure to that material. Therefore, a highly poisonous material\u2014that is,  one with high hazard\u2014may nonetheless pose little risk if susceptible  groups have little or no contact with the material.

As we reported in May 2010, predicting and assessing the  potential hazards, exposures, and resulting risks from nanomaterials is  difficult, and current understanding of nanomaterial toxicity and exposure  is limited. For example, the findings from completed toxicity studies of a  nanomaterial constructed in one manner may not be applicable to  understanding the risks posed by the same nanomaterial constructed in a  different manner and, therefore, studies of similar nanomaterials may not  be comparable. Also, according to the NRC\u2019s 2012 draft strategy for  nanotechnology EHS research, there is incomplete information on the  effects of the array of nanomaterials used in products and a lack of  information on effects of chronic exposures.

As previously noted  in this report, FDA, CPSC, and EPA may not receive complete  information on what nanomaterials are already in use in the case of  certain products. CPSC officials told us that one way the agency collects  information on the use of nanomaterials in products to better understand  potential exposures is by purchasing information from commercial  vendors. However, we found that obtaining such information from  commercial vendors such as market research companies can be costly,  and it is difficult to assess the reliability of such research because it can  involve data and methods, including modeling based on various  assumptions, that may be proprietary.", "Another source of information on nanomaterials in commerce is the  Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars\u2019 Project on Emerging  Nanotechnologies, which maintains an inventory of nanotechnology- based products. As of the March 2011 update to the list, the inventory  contained approximately 1,300 nanotechnology-based products.

This is consistent with what we heard  from representatives of a nanotechnology trade association and an NGO,  who stated that there is limited funding for corporate EHS research and  development efforts because they do not generate revenues. Some  respondents who provided comments in response to optional open-ended  questions stated that the private sector needs government funding for  EHS research. A number of respondents also commented that  government funding for EHS research was inadequate or an \u201cafter- thought\u201d to other purposes.

For example, a number of respondents who provided comments in  response to optional open-ended questions pointed to regulatory  uncertainty as limiting the ability of companies to determine their EHS  responsibilities. Some respondents also commented on difficulties in  collaborating with NNI member agencies resulting from differences in  expertise and regulatory approaches across different government  agencies or even within the same agency. With regard to lack of  standardization as a challenge to collaboration on nanotechnology EHS  research, some respondents provided examples related to the lack of  scientific consensus on the definition of nanomaterials, the testing  methods for toxicology research, and common terminology across  research and regulatory agencies.", "When asked to rate the effectiveness of mechanisms we identified that  NNI member agencies can use for obtaining input from nonfederal  stakeholders on the development of the NNI EHS research strategies,  respondents most frequently identified the following three mechanisms as  being used somewhat effectively or effectively: (1) workshops,  conferences, and other public speaking engagements; (2) advisory  councils; and (3) the NNI web portal.", "When asked to rate the 2011 NNI EHS research strategy, most of those  responding rated this strategy as somewhat or very effective at  addressing nanotechnology EHS research needs.

These characteristics describe the scope of the strategy, describe how  and why it was produced, define the problems the strategy intends to  address, discuss causes and the operating environment, and provide a  risk assessment or broad description of potential risks. Elements of these  characteristics that are included in the documents are providing a clear  statement of purpose, defining key terms, delineating what major  functions or mission areas are covered, discussing problems with the  current understanding of EHS implications of nanotechnology, and the  quality of currently available data, among others.", "Goals, Subordinate Objectives,  Activities, and Performance  Measures (Desirable  Characteristic 3)", "The NNI strategy documents partially address the third characteristic  regarding goals, subordinate objectives, activities, and performance  measures. This characteristic describes the overall desired results,  hierarchy of strategic goals and subordinate objectives, priorities,  milestones, outcome-related performance measures, and process for  monitoring and reporting on progress, among others. The NNI strategy  documents include a number of elements such as desired results,  strategic goals, and subordinate objectives, but do not include, or do not  fully develop, other elements such as priorities, milestones, or outcome- related performance measures. Performance information\u2014such as  outcome-related performance measures and milestones comprised of  targets and time frames for meeting those measures\u2014allows managers  to identify performance problems and develop approaches that improve  results. For the purposes of this report, we define performance  information to mean data collected to measure progress toward achieving  an established goal. A wide range of information can be relevant to  program performance. Performance information can focus on various  dimensions of performance such as outcomes, outputs, quality,  timeliness, customer satisfaction, or efficiency. It can inform key  management decisions such as setting program priorities, allocating  resources, identifying program problems, and taking corrective action to  solve those problems; or it can help determine progress in meeting the  goals of programs or operations. The NNI strategy documents contain  detailed research needs for nanotechnology EHS and report the annual  funding of EHS research and the number of projects supported for  selected years, but the documents do not prioritize among these needs or  include outcome-related performance measures, targets, or time frames  that allow for monitoring and reporting on progress toward meeting the  research needs.", "Independent reviews of the prior NNI strategy documents also noted an  absence of performance information. In 2010, the National  Nanotechnology Advisory Panel recommended that the NNCO monitor  metrics that assess, among other things, the NNI\u2019s progress on  developing methodologies to assess plausible risks of nanotechnology.  The advisory panel also recommended that the NEHI working group  develop and implement a strategy that links EHS research activities with  knowledge gaps and decision-making needs. The 2009 NRC review  concluded that the 2008 NNI Strategy for Nanotechnology-Related EHS  Research could be an effective tool, but did not include a number of  elements, including measures of research progress. We previously  reported that, ideally, a national strategy would set clear desired results  and priorities, outcome-related performance measures, and specific  milestones while giving implementing parties flexibility to pursue and  achieve those results within a reasonable time frame.", "The NNI strategy documents give agencies wide latitude to develop  research programs to meet the goals and research needs of the NNI, but  we found that NNI member agencies vary in their identification and  reporting of agency-specific performance information for nanotechnology  EHS research that could align with the NNI research needs. The 2011  NNI EHS research strategy states that prioritization, timing, and staging of  the research needs identified by the strategy are components of an  implementation plan and should be developed within agency missions  and appropriations. Similarly, the 2011 NNI strategic plan states that the  document serves as a guide for individual agency implementation. Six of  the seven NNI agencies we reviewed have documented performance  measures, targets, or time frames for their EHS research.

NIOSH has previously published research summaries in its  nanotechnology research progress reports. NIOSH officials told us that a  forthcoming progress report will also document the results of performance  measures identified in their nanotechnology EHS strategy. NSF reports  planned EHS research activities as part of its annual budget request, but  does not identify performance targets or measures for its nanotechnology  EHS research beyond funding requested.

However, we found that the  documents do not include, or do not fully develop, other elements such as  the costs and types of resources\u2014for example human capital or research  and development costs\u2014associated with implementing the strategy. An  NNCO official told us that the NNI does not analyze the costs of  resources to meet the EHS research needs because it does not control  the funding for member agencies, and that each agency allocates funding  and prioritizes its activities based on its mission area and available  budget. According to this official, the 2011 NNI EHS research strategy  identifies research goals, but it is up to the agencies to determine how  their funding should be spent. Similarly, a NIST official told us that the  NNI cannot dictate to agencies how or what research to fund. With  respect to the fifth characteristic pertaining to organizational roles,  responsibilities, and coordination, we found that the documents include  elements such as lead, support, and partner roles for agencies and  processes for coordination and collaboration, but do not include, or do not  fully develop, other elements such as an accountability and oversight  framework. The strategy documents include detailed descriptions of the  NNI structure, describe coordination mechanisms such as the NEHI  working group, and provide examples of collaborative activities related to  EHS research. As we reported above, we found that NNI member  agencies have engaged in numerous collaborative projects with federal  and nonfederal partners and nonfederal partners generally rated these  collaborations as generally or very useful. However, the strategy  documents do not provide details on oversight of agency roles or how  agencies will be held accountable to the goals and research needs of the  NNI strategy documents.", "Integration and Implementation  (Desirable Characteristic 6)", "The NNI strategy documents also partially address the sixth characteristic  describing integration and implementation. This characteristic describes  how the national strategy documents relate to subordinate levels of  government and their plans to implement the strategy. As we have  previously reported, to achieve a common outcome, collaborating  agencies need to establish strategies that work in concert with those of  their partners or are joint in nature. We found that the NNI strategy  documents include limited information regarding the elements of this  characteristic. For example, the 2011 NNI EHS research strategy  describes a framework for implementation, but does not provide detailed  implementation guidance. In addition, we found that the NNI strategy  documents generally do not include information on the NNI member  agencies\u2019 nanotechnology EHS strategies or plans or their integration  with the national strategy.", "Five of the seven NNI member agencies we reviewed have developed  such agency-level nanotechnology EHS research strategies.

The NNI strategy documents  address or partially address the desirable characteristics of effective  national strategies, including overarching strategic goals and objectives  such as the EHS research needs. However, the documents do not include  some elements of the characteristics, which could make it more difficult for  federal agencies and other stakeholders to implement the strategy and  achieve the identified results. For example, progress toward achieving the  strategy documents\u2019 goals and research needs cannot be tracked because  the NNI does not report specific performance information, such as  performance measures, targets, or time frames. In addition, the NNI  strategy documents do not include estimates of the costs and types of  resources associated with these goals and research needs.", "Developing and coordinating performance information and cost estimates  for the NNI\u2019s nanotechnology EHS research may be challenging because  of the varied missions and priorities of the NNI member agencies.  However, not having performance information that is aligned with the  strategic goals and research needs of the NNI makes it difficult for  agencies, policymakers, and stakeholders to determine the collective  progress of the national nanotechnology program. Furthermore,  developing performance information and including it in NNI strategy  documents could help to strengthen two other desirable characteristics  that the documents partially address. Specifically, this information could  also support an accountability and oversight framework\u2014that is currently  not well-developed\u2014by linking agency activities to specific measures of  performance and creating consistent benchmarks to judge the overall  progress of the NNI member agencies. In addition, developing this  information could facilitate better integration between the NNI strategy  documents and the NNI member agencies\u2019 nanotechnology EHS  research strategies and goals. Providing cost estimates related to the NNI  EHS research needs would allow the NNI member agencies,  policymakers, and stakeholders to assess if investments are  commensurate with costs of the identified needs. The NSTC, which is  administered by the OSTP, does not direct funding to meet the NNI  research needs; however, rough estimates of their costs could serve as  guidance to the NNI member agencies as they individually determine their  own budgets and priorities. In addition, the NSTC is well-positioned to  develop these estimates due to its coordinating role across the member  agencies of the NNI and corresponding access to expertise at these  agencies. Developing performance information and cost estimates could  also support the analysis of the progress made toward achieving the  goals and priorities established for the program, as required by the 21st  Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act.", "In addition, we are reiterating our 2008 recommendation that the Director  of OSTP, in consultation with the Directors of the NNCO and OMB,  provide better guidance to agencies on how to report their  nanotechnology EHS research.

Therefore, agencies, policymakers,  and stakeholders do not have access to accurate, consistent, and  complete data on the federal government\u2019s investment in nanotechnology  EHS research.

For the  dollar amounts that we adjusted for inflation, we used the Biomedical  Research and Development Price Index to report funding in constant  2010 dollars. We consulted with the Office of Management and Budget  (OMB) and officials at the seven selected agencies to determine the type  of budget information reported as actual agency investments in these  documents. For fiscal year 2010, the most recent year for which actual  agency investment data were available, we also collected quantitative  and qualitative project-level data (such as project funding amounts and  project abstracts or progress reports) on all research projects that the  seven selected agencies had categorized as Program Component Area  (PCA) 7 (EHS research). The agencies do not report project-level data to  OMB annually but report their total EHS research funding to OMB  annually for inclusion in the NNI budget supplements published by NSTC.  Therefore, we reviewed data on the individual projects included in the  agencies\u2019 total EHS research funding in 2010. We provided the agencies  with a spreadsheet template to use in listing their projects, which we  based on the spreadsheet OMB had used in its data calls to collect  project-level data from agencies on their 2006 and 2009 EHS research  projects. Consistent with the approach used in OMB\u2019s data calls, we did  not ask the agencies to use a standardized definition of what constitutes a  \u201cproject;\u201d instead, we deferred to each agency to identify their projects  and consulted with agency officials as needed.", "For some projects at NIH, NIOSH, and NIST, we grouped together some  of the agencies\u2019 data entries and counted them together for the purposes  of our analyses. Consequently, the numbers of projects we are reporting  may not match the number reported by these agencies elsewhere.  Specifically, for NIH, we grouped the 14 supplement grants together with  their main grants and counted each of those groups as a single project.  We also grouped together the individual subprojects of each of NIH\u2019s  multiproject \u201cparent\u201d grants reported as EHS and counted each of those  groups as a single project, for a total of seven groups of multiproject  grants. In addition, we grouped together two grants made by different NIH  institutes for the same project. For NIOSH, we identified two project  entries with identical project descriptions. After consulting with NIOSH  officials, we grouped those two entries together and counted them as a  single project. For NIST, the agency reported a separate entry for each of  its Project Tracking Numbers and explained that a single technical project  is often associated with more than one Project Tracking Number. NIST  officials instructed us to group together the entries with identical titles and  count each of those groups as a single project.", "To assess the reliability of the agencies\u2019 fiscal year 2010 data, we sent  each of the seven selected agencies a set of questions regarding the data  and the information systems used to produce and store them. We also  reviewed related supporting documentation, such as user manuals and  data dictionaries for information systems, and, for some projects, copies  of the associated interagency agreements. We examined the data for  obvious errors, compared each agency\u2019s total fiscal year 2010 PCA 7  funding reported to us to the totals reported in the NNI Supplement to the  President\u2019s 2012 Budget, and consulted with agency officials to  understand the reasons for any differences. We determined that the data  were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our analyses. However, we  did not attempt to verify the funding amounts reported for each project\u2014 for example, by reviewing documentation of agencies\u2019 actual  expenditures for each project.", "We reviewed the qualitative project data, including abstracts and project  reports, to assess whether the agencies had appropriately categorized  the research projects they reported as EHS research\u2014that is, whether  the projects met the definition of program component area (PCA) 7. As  described in this report, the definition of PCA 7\u2014research primarily  directed at understanding the EHS impacts of nanotechnology  development and corresponding risk assessment, risk management, and  methods for risk mitigation\u2014is the only written guidance available to  agencies on how to report their nanotechnology research in this program  component area. Determining whether research meets this definition is an  inherently subjective process. Therefore, rather than definitively conclude  that any projects did not meet the definition, we assigned projects a  designation of \u201cnot clearly PCA 7\u201d if we were ultimately unable to identify  any EHS research, or it was not clear that EHS was the primary focus of  the research. For example, some projects studied various  nanotechnology-enabled drugs, but it was not clear to what extent the  research was directed at the safety of the drugs versus their efficacy.  Some other projects appeared to be closely related to program  component areas other than PCA 7, such as PCA 4 (instrumentation  research, metrology, and standards for nanotechnology) or PCA 8  (education and societal dimensions), and it was not clear that PCA 7 was  the most appropriate category. To minimize bias and to ensure the  consistency of our evaluation, two analysts independently analyzed the  project data and used their professional judgment to assess whether each  project met the PCA 7 definition. The two analysts discussed those  projects where they did not agree on whether the research was primarily  directed at EHS and reached agreement. For categorization of projects  that appeared questionable to us, we generally asked agencies to explain  why they had reported those projects as EHS research. We reviewed  agencies\u2019 responses and modified our determinations for projects as  appropriate given the additional support provided by the agencies. For  two projects funded by NIST and 18 by NSF, the agencies had reported  only a portion of the total project funding under PCA 7. In those instances,  we assessed whether at least some of the project was primarily directed  at EHS. However, we did not verify that the funding amounts reported as  EHS research were correct because that information is, according to  these agencies\u2019 officials, based on the discretion of the knowledgeable  agency program staff. We also reviewed our 2008 report in this area,  which found that 22 of 119 fiscal year 2006 projects reported as EHS  research were miscategorized, and recommended that the Director of the  Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), in consultation with the  Directors of the National Nanotechnology Coordinating Office and OMB,  provide better guidance to agencies on how to report nanotechnology  EHS research.", "GAO, Nanotechnology: Better Guidance Is Needed to Ensure Accurate Reporting of  Federal Research Focused on Environmental, Health, and Safety Risks, GAO-08-402  (Washington, D.C.: Mar. 31, 2008). experience in nanotechnology helped identify the categories we used and  verified that the materials were placed in the appropriate categories for  each project. After reviewing the fiscal year 2010 EHS research by the  selected agencies, we selected the five categories of nanomaterials we  used, based on the primary composition of the materials, to encompass  the range of materials identified in the projects. To inform our selection of  the categories we used for grouping nanomaterials, we reviewed  literature related to nanotechnology EHS issues from federal agencies  (NIH and EPA), nonprofit organizations (the Woodrow Wilson  International Center for Scholars\u2019 Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies  and the World Technology Evaluation Center, Inc.), and a market  research firm that tracks nanotechnology (Lux Research). We found that  various classes or categories were used to present information on  nanomaterials. For materials identified as composites, we assigned them  to categories based on the primary nanomaterials from which they were  formed\u2014for example, we assigned carbon nanotube nanocomposites to  the carbon-based nanomaterials category.", "To determine the extent to which the NNI member agencies collaborate  with stakeholders on nanotechnology EHS research and related  strategies, we (1) discussed with agency officials how their agencies  collaborate on nanotechnology EHS research and NNI\u2019s role in facilitating  that collaboration, and (2) we obtained documentation on these  collaborative efforts. We conducted a review of formal collaborative  efforts (i.e., those that are documented in written agreements) that  focused on nanotechnology EHS research initiated from February 2008 to  October 2011 while the 2008 NNI Strategy for Nanotechnology-Related  EHS Research was in effect. We chose this time frame because this  strategy\u2014the first NNI strategy to focus on EHS research\u2014established  collaboration as necessary for its implementation efforts. The strategy  was in effect for a number of years, which allowed us to get a more  complete picture of the number of collaborative projects completed during  its implementation. We only included collaborative efforts that were  formalized by written agreements because those provided a clearer  description of the agencies\u2019 contributions of resources. We obtained an  initial list of such efforts from published NNI sources as well as an OMB  data call used to compile EHS-related nanotechnology projects for the  2011 NNI EHS research strategy. We sent our initial list to the selected  NNI agencies for their review and revision, and analyzed supporting  documents provided by the agencies. We provide relevant information  from the supporting documents for each of the projects within our scope  in appendix II.", "We administered a web-based questionnaire to a nonprobability sample  of nonfederal stakeholders, including those affiliated with academia,  companies, nongovernmental organizations (NGO), and state and local  governments, to obtain their views on collaboration with the NNI member  agencies on EHS research and the EHS research strategies. Because  the population of nonfederal stakeholders is diverse, wide-ranging, and  difficult to reliably define, we chose to use a nonprobability sample of  individuals who (1) had expertise in the field of nanotechnology, and (2)  had interacted with the NNI in the past few years, or who were  representatives of organizations and companies suggested to us through  our scoping interviews. We identified relevant potential respondents from  several sources, including the list of participants in NNI workshops that  were used to solicit input for the 2011 NNI EHS research strategy and  participants in a review of the NNI by the President\u2019s Council of Advisors  on Science and Technology. We also included members of  nanotechnology-related trade associations and other organizations  through interviews with nanotechnology experts using an iterative  process, often referred to as \u201csnowball sampling.\u201d We excluded federal  employees and contractors, individuals or organizations that are not  located in the United States, and those for whom we could not obtain  contact information. In addition, individuals who were not considered to  have expertise in the nanotechnology field based on their job titles were  excluded.chosen as potential respondents. Of these 228 individuals, five  subsequently were excluded from our sample because they had invalid e- mail addresses, were duplicates, or were not available for an extended  period, giving us a final sample of 223 potential respondents. We  categorized the population surveyed by affiliation type, usually based on  information provided on each entity\u2019s website, as follows: (1) \u201cacademic,\u201d  which includes universities or university-affiliated programs or centers; (2)  \u201ccompany,\u201d which includes companies, corporations, or other for-profit  entities whose primary purpose is to sell products, services, or  information; (3) \u201corganization,\u201d which includes NGOs or other entities  whose primary purpose is public interest or mutual benefit; and (4) \u201cstate  and local government.\u201d", "These sources provided us with a list of 228 stakeholders  The questions included in the questionnaire were developed using issues  raised in our scoping interviews and background literature search. Most of  our questions provided respondents with answer options identified  through our interviews and background literature searches. In certain  cases, we also provided respondents with an \u201cother\u201d category which  allowed them to write in additional responses we did not identify.  However, because few respondents chose this option, we presented only  some of these responses as illustrative examples. The questionnaire  went through internal reviews, including independent GAO survey  experts, as well as four pretests with two stakeholders who work for  companies, one academic, and one stakeholder from an NGO. We chose  the pretesters to reflect the diversity of affiliations of the nanotechnology  experts included among our respondents. We revised and clarified the  questions and introductory material to the questionnaire based on  comments obtained in the internal reviews and from the pretesters.", "We administered the questionnaire through a secure server. When we  completed the final survey questions and format, we sent an e-mail  announcement of the questionnaire to the nonfederal stakeholders in our  sample on September 23, 2011. Stakeholders were notified that the  questionnaire was available online and were given unique passwords and  user names on October 11, 2011. We sent follow-up e-mail messages on  October 18, 2011, October 25, 2011, and November 2, 2011 to those who  had not yet responded. Then we contacted all nonrespondents by  telephone, starting on October 21, 2011. The questionnaire was available  online until December 6, 2011.", "Because this was not a sample survey, it has no sampling errors.  However, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey may introduce  errors, commonly referred to as nonsampling errors. For example,  difficulties in interpreting a particular question, sources of information  available to respondents, or entering data into a database or analyzing  them can introduce unwanted variability into the survey results. We took  steps in developing the questionnaire, collecting the data, and analyzing  them to minimize such nonsampling errors. For example, we worked with  social science survey specialists to design the questionnaire. We  pretested the draft questionnaire with four nonfederal stakeholders to  ensure that the questions were relevant, clearly stated, and easy to  understand. When we analyzed the data, an independent analyst  checked all computer programs. Since this was a web-based  questionnaire, respondents entered their answers directly into the  electronic questionnaire, eliminating the need to key data into a database,  minimizing error.", "Of the 223 potential respondents, 138 completed the questionnaire during  our time frame, for an overall response rate of about 62 percent. The  numbers responding by affiliation type as categorized by us were   (1) \u201cacademic\u201d\u201442 out of 62; (2) \u201ccompany\u201d\u201465 out of 114;   (3) \u201corganization\u201d\u201424 out of 39; and (4) \u201cstate and local government\u201d\u2014  7 out of 8.", "To determine the extent the NNI strategy documents address desirable  characteristics of national strategies, we compared three key NNI  strategic documents against criteria for desirable characteristics of national strategies. Prior GAO reports have identified six desirable  characteristics for national strategy documents that would help shape the  policies, programs, priorities, resource allocations, and standards that  would enable federal agencies and other stakeholders to implement the  strategies and achieve the identified results. National strategies that  address these characteristics offer policymakers and implementing  agencies a management tool that can help ensure accountability and  more effective results. Table 5 provides the desirable characteristics  and the elements we looked for.", "To assess whether the documents addressed these desirable  characteristics, two analysts independently reviewed the three NNI  strategy documents for the elements of each characteristic. We examined  the documents for inclusion of each element and for sufficient specificity  and detail. The two analysts compared their assessments, discussed any  discrepancies, and agreed upon a determination for each element. Each  characteristic was then given a rating of \u201caddress,\u201d \u201cpartially address,\u201d or  \u201cdoes not address.\u201d According to our methodology, the strategy  documents \u201caddress\u201d a characteristic when it explicitly includes all, or  nearly all, elements of the characteristic and has sufficient specificity and  detail. The documents \u201cpartially address\u201d a characteristic when it includes  some or most of the elements with sufficient specificity and detail. The  \u201cpartially address\u201d category includes a range that varies from explicitly  including most of the elements to including as few as one of the elements  of a characteristic. A strategy \u201cdoes not address\u201d a characteristic when it  does not include any elements of a characteristic or references are too  vague or general to be useful.", "Because the three NNI documents have different purposes and  audiences, an individual document need not address each element of  each desirable national strategy characteristic. Therefore, we reviewed  the three NNI strategy documents as a whole. In the case of the 2011  NNI strategic plan and Supplement to the President\u2019s 2012 Budget, we  focused on sections related to EHS research, where applicable.", "We identified agency documents related to nanotechnology EHS  research strategies and performance. Documents were identified based  on interviews with agency officials, review of agency websites, and a data  collection instrument sent to agencies requesting any documentation  related to the planning or performance of their nanotechnology EHS  research programs. In order to assess the extent of linkage between  agencies\u2019 nanotechnology EHS research and national priorities of the  NNI, we evaluated agency management documents for explicit referrals  to NNI activities or guidance, including strategic documents such as the  NNI strategic plan or EHS research strategy, or activities of the NNI\u2019s  planning and coordinating bodies.
