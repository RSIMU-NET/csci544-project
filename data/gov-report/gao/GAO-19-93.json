In February 2018, we found that early estimates for  Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria placed them among the costliest  hurricanes in terms of federal contract obligations since 2005, when  tracking this information by hurricane began. We also found that DHS  and DOD accounted for about 97 percent of those obligations. In  September 2015, we found issues related to the use of advance  contracts, specifically that FEMA\u2019s contracting officers had limited  awareness about advance contract requirements and how to coordinate  advance contracting efforts with state and local governments. We made  several recommendations, including that FEMA provide guidance to  contracting officers to make them aware of current information on the  availability and use of advance contracts and the need to conduct  outreach to state and local governments to support their use of advance  contracts.

Data on obligations for the California wildfires are  limited to contracts that FEMA and USACE identified as being used to  respond to the events because some of this information was not able to  be identified in FPDS-NG. To determine which obligations were made  through the use of advance contracts, we reviewed documentation  provided by FEMA and USACE identifying the advance contracts they  have in place and that were used in support of the 2017 disasters. We  assessed the reliability of FPDS-NG data by reviewing existing  information about the FPDS-NG system and the data it collects\u2014 specifically, the data dictionary and data validation rules\u2014and performing  electronic testing. We determined the FPDS-NG data were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of this report. We also reviewed FEMA  contracting policies and guidance, to identify available guidance on the  use and intent of advance contracts, and federal internal control  standards. We identified examples of goods that FEMA had advance  contracts in place for but experienced challenges using in response to the  2017 disasters, reviewed advance and post-disaster contract  documentation and FPDS-NG data related to these examples, and  interviewed contracting officials involved in the award and use of the  contracts in 2017.", "To assess the extent to which the planning, management, and reporting  of advance contracts used in response to the three hurricanes and  California wildfires in 2017 met selected applicable contracting  requirements, we reviewed relevant documentation, including PKEMRA,  the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), DHS, FEMA, and USACE  contracting policies. We identified a non-generalizable sample of advance  contracts to serve as case studies based on obligation data from FPDS- NG as of March 31, 2018.

For additional details on the contracts we selected, see  appendix I. Findings based on information collected from the 14 contracts  cannot be generalized to all advance contracts. To review our selected  FEMA and USACE advance contracts, we developed a data collection  instrument to gather selected contract information, such as period of  performance, contract type, estimated contract value, and the presence of  key contract documents, among others. To assess planning we reviewed  our selected advance contracts, and determined that six of FEMA\u2019s  contracts met GAO\u2019s definition of a bridge contract. We interviewed  FEMA officials associated with these contracts on acquisition planning  efforts and factors that affected their ability to award new contracts. To  assess FEMA and USACE\u2019s management of selected advance contracts,  we reviewed information gathered from our data collection instrument to  confirm the contract files contained required acquisition documents, such  as acquisition strategies and contract modifications, which typically  provide the history of a contract file, and interviewed officials at FEMA  and USACE headquarters on their record keeping policies, practices, and  challenges. To assess the reporting of selected advance contracts, we  compared advance contract action data identified in FPDS-NG in the  fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 and first quarter of fiscal year 2018 to  data reported for the same time period in FEMA\u2019s mandated reports to  congressional committees on disaster contracting to identify any  unreported actions.

We reviewed  PKEMRA advance contract requirements, including requirements that  FEMA coordinate with state and local governments on the use of advance  contracts, FEMA and USACE documentation on the use of advance  contracts, after-action reports from 2017 and prior years, and federal  internal control standards for information and communications. To identify  challenges related to coordination with state and local officials on the use  of advance contracts, we reviewed after action reports from 2017, and  interviewed FEMA and USACE regional staff and state and local  government officials on advance contracting efforts.

PKEMRA also required the FEMA  Administrator to develop a contracting strategy that maximizes the use of  advance contracts to the extent practical and cost-effective. Following the  enactment of PKEMRA, in 2007 FEMA issued the Advance Contracting of  Goods and Services Report to Congress, in part to address the  requirement for an advance contracting strategy. In addition to the  strategy, FEMA provides information on advance contracts in its Disaster  Contracting Officer Desk Guide.", "The 2007 strategy notes that advance contracts will help to preclude the  need to procure goods and services for disaster response under the  unusual and compelling urgency exception to full and open competition,  and allow FEMA to rapidly mobilize resources in immediate response to  disasters. Several contracting officials we spoke with said that it is a  requirement to use advance contracts before awarding new contracts.  Moreover, a senior FEMA contracting official told us that advance  contracts are intended to be used before awarding post-disaster  contracts, even if the advance contract is not capable of fulfilling all of the  requirements for a needed good or service. However, our review of the  strategy found that it does not provide any specific direction on how  contracting officers should award or use advance contracts to meet  PKEMRA\u2019s objectives, or how they should be prioritized in relation to  post-disaster contracts. Further, there is no mention in FEMA\u2019s 2017  Disaster Contracting Officer Desk Guide that advance contracts should  be considered prior to the award of post-disaster contracts.", "In September 2015, we found shortfalls with the information available to  contracting officers about advance contracts and recommended that  FEMA provide new or updated guidance with information on how advance  contracts should be used. FEMA agreed with this recommendation and  stated that in 2015 it included information on advance contracts and their  use in training documentation. However, our review of semi-annual  training documentation provided in May 2018 found that it only lists some  of the advance contracts that are available, and not guidance on their  use.", "A report by the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and  Governmental Affairs identified concerns about FEMA\u2019s use of advance  contracts for self-help tarps in response to the 2017 hurricanes.  Specifically, the report found that while FEMA ordered some tarps  through one of its existing advance contracts, that order was placed after  a post-disaster contract for tarps was signed, raising questions about  whether FEMA\u2019s actions were informed by an overall strategy for using its  advance contracts, in this case, for tarps. Our current review identified  similar concerns, and found that the lack of an updated strategy and  guidance on the use of advance contracts contributed to challenges in  using these contracts to respond to the 2017 disasters.", "In our review of advance contracts for meals and tarps, we found the  following:", "Meals: Prior to the 2017 disasters, FEMA had advance contracts in  place to provide meals with specific nutritional requirements.

Based on our  review of contract documentation, two of the existing advance  contract vendors were awarded these new post-disaster contracts, but  at different prices than those negotiated through their advance  contracts. FEMA officials told us that contracting officers will negotiate  to ensure the price of the contract is fair and reasonable and may  utilize historical information or current contract prices to inform this  determination. Normally, adequate price competition establishes a fair  and reasonable price. According to a contracting officer involved with  the award, FEMA relied on competition and historical prices, but not  the existing advance contract prices, to determine that the new post- disaster contract meal prices were fair and reasonable. Guidance on  the extent to which advance contract prices should be considered  when comparing proposed prices to historical prices paid could help  to further inform contracting officers\u2019 decision-making during a  disaster.", "Tarps: Our review of FEMA\u2019s use of contracts for tarps is another  example of how FEMA lacked an updated advance contracting  strategy and guidance to provide goods and services to facilitate a  faster response to the 2017 disasters. For example, in September  2014, FEMA awarded multiple award indefinite delivery, indefinite  quantity advance contracts to three small businesses for self-help  tarps, which are used to cover small areas of roof damage. In  November 2014, these contracts were modified by the contracting  officer to include delivery requirements for providing tarps to replenish  FEMA\u2019s stock during steady state operations or during emergency  response operations, such as a natural disaster. The contract  modification added that during an emergency response, vendors  would be expected to deliver up to 150,000 tarps within 96 hours of  being issued a task order. However, these small businesses were not  required to meet the emergency response delivery time frames and  amounts since they would not be expected to store tarps on FEMA\u2019s  behalf, limiting the use of FEMA\u2019s advance tarp contracts for  immediate disaster response needs. According to a contracting officer  involved with these contracts, the tarp advance contracts are typically  used only to replenish tarp stockpiles in FEMA\u2019s distribution centers.  However, the contracting officer also noted that not being able to fully  use the existing advance contracts for tarps to respond to the three  2017 hurricanes was a challenge and required FEMA to award post- disaster contracts to meet tarp requirements.", "Furthermore, we found that FEMA awarded post-disaster contracts for  tarps before utilizing its advance contracts with the small businesses.  Contract file documentation for the post-disaster contracts stated that  FEMA\u2019s advance contract holders for tarps had reached their  capacity, and that market research had confirmed that it would be  difficult for small businesses to meet the urgent delivery timeframes  for tarps. Yet, after the award of the post-disaster tarp contracts,  FEMA awarded task orders to one of the advance contractors to  provide tarps in response to Hurricane Maria. Another small business  advance contractor, which according to FEMA\u2019s post-disaster contract  documentation had reached its capacity, also submitted a proposal as  part of the post-disaster contract solicitation. According to FEMA,  neither of the post-disaster contract holders ultimately provided the  required tarps. The timing and use of the existing tarp advance  contracts raises questions about their ability to provide tarps  immediately following a disaster, and whether an updated advance  contracting strategy would have enabled FEMA to more quickly  provide the needed tarps to survivors, considering the additional time  and staff resources needed to award new post-disaster contracts.", "FEMA established advance contracts to provide critical goods, like meals  and tarps, following a disaster; however FEMA\u2019s 2007 contracting  strategy does not provide direction on the objectives of advance contracts  or how to maximize their use to the extent practical and cost-effective, as  required by PKEMRA. According to FEMA officials, they had not  considered updating the 2007 advance contracting strategy because they  believed the use of advance contracts following PKEMRA had been  incorporated into their disaster contracting practices. FEMA has also not  communicated specific guidance to program and contracting officials on  whether and how advance contracts should be prioritized before issuing  new post-disaster solicitations and awarding contracts for the same or  similar requirements, or how to maximize their use to the extent practical  and cost-effective following a disaster, as required by PKEMRA. FEMA  officials also acknowledged that additional guidance regarding advance  contracts, including their availability and use during a disaster, could be  useful. Without an updated strategy\u2014and clear guidance that is  incorporated into training\u2014on the use of advance contracts and how they  should be prioritized and used in relation to new post-disaster contract  awards, FEMA lacks reasonable assurance that it is maximizing the use  of advance contracts  to quickly and cost-effectively provide goods and  services following a disaster.

Bridge contracts can be a useful tool in certain  circumstances to avoid a gap in providing products and services. We  have previously reported that when non-competitive bridge contracts are  used frequently or for prolonged periods, the government is at risk of  paying more than it should for products and services.", "Based on our analysis, 63 of FEMA\u2019s 72 advance contracts used in  response to the 2017 disasters were initially competed. All 15 of USACE\u2019s  advance contracts used in responding to the three hurricanes and  California wildfires in 2017 were initially competed. We found that at least  10 of FEMA\u2019s advance contracts used in 2017 were bridge contracts.  Within the 10 FEMA advance contracts we identified as bridge contracts,  6 were part of our selected case studies. The six advance contracts with  subsequent bridges in our review obligated roughly $778 million in  response to the three hurricanes and California wildfires in 2017. These  bridge contracts included five that are associated with two of FEMA\u2019s  largest programs used in 2017\u2014the Individual Assistance Program and  Public Assistance Program\u2014and one that is associated with a  telecommunications program.", "Three of the six bridge advance contracts we reviewed were awarded to  support FEMA\u2019s Individual Assistance Program, which provides mass  care services such as food and water as well as financial and direct  assistance, among other services, to survivors whose property has been  damaged or destroyed and whose losses are not covered by insurance.  In 2017, this assistance was supported through the Individual Assistance- Technical Assistance Contract (IA-TAC), known as IA-TAC III. The IA- TAC III predecessor contracts had an original period of performance from  a base year starting in May 2009 with four 1-year options that ended in  May 2014. However, FEMA program and contracting officials were unable  to implement changes to the requirements\u2014recommended by FEMA  senior leadership in 2010\u2014prior to expiration. According to FEMA  officials, staffing shortfalls, operational tempo, and unrealistic contract  requirements led to acquisition planning delays. These challenges, in  turn, led to a series of extensions from May 2014 to November 2016 and  a new non-competitive bridge contract (base with options) from  November 2016 to May 2018. At that point new, competitive follow-on  indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contracts\u2014the Individual Assistance  Support Contract (IASC) and Logistics Housing Operations Unit  Installation, Maintenance, and Deactivation (LOGHOUSE)\u2014were  awarded. See figure 5.", "Two of our six selected advance contracts that were bridge contracts  were awarded to support FEMA\u2019s Public Assistance Program, which  provides supplemental federal assistance to state, tribal, territorial, and  local governments for debris removal, life-saving emergency protective  measures, and the repair, replacement, or restoration of damaged  facilities. The predecessor Public Assistance-Technical Assistance  Contract (PA-TAC) used in 2017, known as PA-TAC III, was awarded  with an original period of performance from a base year in February 2012  with four 1-year options that ended in February 2017. FEMA officials  noted that changes to the PA-TAC III contract requirements and  acquisition strategy were identified in 2015. Yet due to the time needed to  incorporate these changes, FEMA was unable to complete required  acquisition planning activities, such as finalizing the acquisition plan, prior  to the expiration of PA-TAC III. Following 11 months of extensions to  complete these activities, FEMA competitively awarded new contracts in  December 2017. These awards were protested to the GAO and the  protests were denied and are currently under review at the Court of  Federal Claims. According to FEMA officials, these events required PA- TAC III to be extended until January 2019, as shown in figure 6.", "The remaining bridge contract in our sample is associated with the  Wireline Services Program, a telecommunication program that provides  FEMA employees deployed to respond to a disaster with local and long- distance telephone, high-speed data, and cable television services. The 5  year wireline predecessor contract was awarded in 2003 and again in  2008, but FEMA was unable to award a competed contract when the  2008 contract expired in December 2013 due to the time it took to update  program requirements. FEMA contracting officials extended the contract  for 6 months before letting it expire altogether. Due to high staff turnover  and inconsistent record keeping, at the time of our review FEMA officials  were unable to determine the cause for this lapse of service, which  occurred after the contract\u2019s expiration in June 2014. Starting in January  2015, FEMA contracting officials used a series of bridge contracts over  more than three years to address changing contract requirements and  delays in completing acquisition planning documentation, as shown in  figure 7. FEMA contracting officials anticipated awarding a competitive  contract by the end of fiscal year 2018, but the award has been delayed  and the existing contract extended through January 2019.", "In one of the bridge contracts included in our review, FEMA improperly  used FAR clause 52.217-8. According to that clause, an agency may  extend a contract\u2019s period of performance for up to 6 months and is  generally used in the event of circumstances outside of the contracting  officer\u2019s control that prevent the new contract award, such as a bid  protest. This clause may be used multiple times to extend the contract so  long as the total extension of performance does not exceed 6 months.  Our analysis found that FEMA used the clause for a total of 14 months to  justify two 6-month extensions and one 2-month extension to the second  bridge contract. The FEMA contracting official associated with the  advance contract reported uncertainty over the proper use of this clause  and what other authorities should have been used instead to extend the  contract. FEMA\u2019s Office of Chief Counsel and contracting officials  acknowledged this error.", "While not all bridge contracts that we identified during our review were  non-competitive, FEMA officials acknowledged that the use of non- competitive bridge contracts is not an ideal practice as they cannot  ensure the government is paying what it should for products and services.  In October 2015 we identified delays in the completion of acquisition  planning documentation as one of the leading causes of awarding bridge  contracts. In an effort to decrease the need for non-competitive bridge  contracts and provide ample time for acquisition planning, FEMA began  implementing a 5-Year Master Acquisition Planning Schedule (MAPS) in  2016. MAPS is a tracking tool that monitors the status of and provides  acquisition planning timeframes for certain FEMA acquisitions over $5  million, as well as for all advance contracts and any acquisition deemed  by the agency to be mission critical, regardless of dollar value.", "As we previously noted, acquisition planning includes both the pre- solicitation and solicitation phases. Based on our review of MAPS  documentation, the tool generates a timeline of discretionary acquisition  milestones across these two phases, based on certain considerations like  the type of acquisition and whether it will be competed. Using this  timeline, MAPS sends email alerts to program and contracting staff when  certain acquisition milestones should occur.", "Specific to the solicitation phase, FEMA\u2019s Office of the Chief Procurement  Officer has developed annual lead time guidance for how long contracting  officers should be given to award new contracts following the completion  of the acquisition package, which is then conveyed through MAPS. For  example, for acquisitions $150,000 and under, FEMA\u2019s 2018 lead time  guidance states contracting officers should be given 60 days to award the  contract following completion of the acquisition package. FEMA officials  we spoke with acknowledged that these discretionary timeframes are  frequently shortened when program office officials are delayed in  completing acquisition packages. While FEMA has lead time guidance to  establish timeframes for completing the solicitation phase, FEMA  currently has no guidance establishing timeframes for the pre-solicitation  phase, when program offices complete the acquisition packages. Figure 8  provides an example timeline of the major milestones tracked in MAPS.", "In its analysis of 12 fiscal year 2017 contracts tracked in MAPS that were  awarded late, FEMA found that half were late because contracting  officials were not given enough lead time to award a new contract  following the program office\u2019s completion of the acquisition package. Not  adhering to suggested timeframes can place a burden on contracting  officers and increase the likelihood of not awarding the contract on  schedule, requiring FEMA to non-competitively extend the existing  contract. According to FEMA\u2019s lead time guidance, based on the contract  values for the bridge contracts in our review contracting officers should  have been given between 240 and 300 days to award a new contract  once the acquisition package was completed. However, as we mention  earlier, due to delays from changing program requirements and  acquisition strategies we found that the acquisition plans for the follow-on  contracts related to these bridge contracts were not completed until after  the predecessor contract had already expired, as shown in figure 9 below.", "Timely completion of the acquisition package was a key challenge  identified in the contracts we reviewed. However, according to officials  from the Office of the Chief Procurement Officer, they do not have the  authority to establish guidance for FEMA program officials on completing  pre-solicitation phase activities. In August 2011, we identified challenges  with acquisition planning across DHS. Specifically, we found that DHS  and other agencies did not measure or incorporate into guidance the  amount of time it takes to develop and obtain approvals of the acquisition  planning documents required during the pre-solicitation phase. We  recommended that DHS procurement offices collect information about the  timeframes needed for the acquisition planning process to establish  timeframes for when program officials should begin acquisition planning.  DHS did not concur with this recommendation, stating that its acquisition  manual already encourages early planning, and has not implemented the  recommendation. At the time, we maintained that program officials  needed more guidance to have a better understanding of how much time  to allow for completing acquisition planning steps, and that the  component procurement offices are best positioned to provide guidance  on how long these planning processes may take. Given the current  challenges we identified with FEMA\u2019s ability to complete acquisition  planning activities in a timely manner and the resulting delays in awarding  new contracts for critical advance contract goods and services, additional  information and guidance on acquisition planning timeframes remains  important.", "Additionally, while MAPS has been in place since 2016 and FEMA  officials have instituted training to communicate the system\u2019s intent,  program and contracting officials we spoke with varied in their familiarity  with it. For example, officials responsible for MAPS stated that by March  2016, 90 percent of FEMA\u2019s contracting staff had attended an hour long  training session and additional training sessions were held for all program  office staff at various points in 2016 and 2017. However, most of the  program office and contracting officials responsible for the bridge  contracts in our review reported limited familiarity with MAPS.", "While FEMA has taken some positive steps to institute training and has  guidance on timeframes for part of the acquisition planning process,  program and contracting staff we spoke with were still uncertain how best  to utilize MAPS to identify the time needed to effectively complete  acquisition planning activities. According to federal internal control  standards, agency management should internally communicate the  necessary quality information to achieve their objectives. Given FEMA\u2019s  emphasis on planning before a disaster and using advance contracts to  help reduce the need to award non-competitive contracts during a  disaster, establishing clear guidance on the factors that can affect  acquisition planning activities, and requiring officials to follow the  timeframes needed to complete them to meet the goal of awarding  competitive contracts, is essential. Until FEMA provides detailed guidance  about timeframes and considerations that affect the entire acquisition  planning process\u2014both the pre-solicitation and solicitation phases\u2014to all  officials responsible for acquisition planning, and clearly communicates  the intent of MAPS, it cannot ensure that MAPS will be effective at  reducing the number of non-competitively awarded bridge contracts, as is  FEMA\u2019s intent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Current Record-Keeping Practices Limit Visibility into Advance Contract Management", "paragraphs": ["While FEMA has procedures regarding the documentation required for its  contract files, current practices limited visibility into the advance contracts  in our review.

Acquisition plans provide the program and contract history as well as  other information on which acquisition decisions, such as the type of  contract required, are based.", "FEMA contracting officials were unable to locate acquisition plans for 4 of  our 10 FEMA selected advance contracts despite FAR and DHS  acquisition guidance requiring plans for these particular contracts to be  completed and stored in the contract file. Three of these acquisition  plans are associated with the IA-TAC bridge contract which, as previously  noted, was associated with one of FEMA\u2019s largest programs used in  2017. FEMA contracting officials were also unable to locate the  acquisition plans completed for the prior iteration of IA-TAC because they  were not in the hard copy contract file or contract writing system, meaning  that no acquisition plan guiding the IA-TACs since before its 2009 award  could be found. In 2011, the DHS Office of the Inspector General  conducted a review of FEMA\u2019s IA-TAC and identified, among other things,  incomplete contract files as a problem. Not being able to locate  acquisition plans can result in the loss of contract knowledge and lessons  learned from prior awards.", "Additionally, we found instances of contract documentation for advance  contracts related to our case studies that contract officials could not  locate. For instance, FEMA was unable to confirm whether or not an  option year for the last competed Wireline contract included in the  contract was exercised due to a lack of documentation. In order to obtain  this answer, FEMA officials had to reach out to the vendor for their  records. Moreover, the modification exercising the first option year for one  of the IA-TAC III predecessor contracts was missing, as were the  determination and findings documents exercising the first option year for  all three of the predecessor IA-TAC III contracts that were associated with  the advance contracts in our review. After we made FEMA officials aware  of the missing documentation, they subsequently added clarifying memos  to the contract files.", "FEMA standard operating procedures state that the acquisition  documents in the official contract file will be sufficient to constitute a  complete history of the entire transaction for the purpose of providing a  complete background, and as a basis for informed decisions at each step  in the acquisition process. Additionally, these procedures require  headquarters staff to place modifications to contracts and orders and  associated supporting documentation in the contract file within 5 business  days of awarding a contract or issuing an order. FEMA officials stated  they are required to follow these procedures until DHS has fully  transitioned to an electronic filing system. According to DHS officials, that  system is currently in the testing phase and a timeframe for  implementation has not yet been finalized. Furthermore, according to  these officials, DHS has not yet decided which, if any, existing contracts  will be required to be retroactively entered into the system. Until this  decision has been made and implementation occurs, FEMA\u2019s official file  of record for its advance contracts consists of a hardcopy file, which  contracting officers at FEMA headquarters are required to add completed  contract documentation to, per the standard operating procedures. A  FEMA official told us that some documentation, including some of the  missing documentation we identified, has been lost due to staff turnover  and an office move in 2016.", "FEMA officials anticipate some of the challenges associated with  managing the hard copy advance contract files will be alleviated after  implementation of the Electronic Contract File System. However, DHS  officials have not decided whether components will be required to  retroactively enter contract information for any contract awarded prior to  the implementation date. This would require FEMA and other DHS  components to continue to maintain hardcopy files for some contracts\u2014 including large strategic sourcing vehicles and advance contracts\u2014for the  foreseeable future. For example, FEMA\u2019s $2.7 billion LOGHOUSE, and  $14 million IASC advance contracts were awarded in 2018 and have a  period of performance lasting until 2023.

These quarterly reports also include details on  contracts awarded by non-competitive means, as required by PKEMRA.  However, our analysis shows that some reports from fiscal year 2017 and  2018 have been incomplete. In September 2015, we found that FEMA\u2019s  quarterly reports to congressional committees in fiscal years 2013 and  2014 did not capture all of FEMA\u2019s noncompetitive orders. At that time,  FEMA attributed this to an error in data compilation prior to mid-2013 and  explained that it had updated its process for collecting these data and  strengthened the review process, resulting in accurate reports starting in  the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013. Despite this change in the data collection process, our current analysis found that 29 contract actions  associated with the 10 selected advance contracts in our review were not  reported across FEMA\u2019s fourth quarter fiscal year 2017 and first quarter  fiscal year 2018 reports. For example, FEMA\u2019s fourth quarter fiscal year  2017 report did not include 13 contract actions equaling about $83 million,  or 15 percent, of the $558 million in total obligations associated with the  10 selected advance contracts in our review.

Once the data are pulled from these two sources,  officials said they compare the data to ensure all reported actions are  captured. However, according to officials, the data may not include all  contract actions. Specifically, during disaster response efforts like those in  2017, FEMA policy allows contracting officers to execute what it refers to  as \u201cnotice to proceed\u201d, which is a notice to a construction contractor to  begin work under certain circumstances. FEMA officials responsible for  the quarterly reports stated that if notice to proceed documentation is  used, information on some contract actions that were issued during the  fiscal quarter, but not entered into the systems until after the quarter  ended, may be missed during the data compilation process.", "FEMA policy requires that contracting officers who execute the notice to  proceed documentation complete the contract award documentation in  the contract writing system within three days of when the contracting  officer receivers the contractor\u2019s acceptance of the notice. However, a  FEMA policy official acknowledged that during disaster response, this  does not always occur. Further, FEMA officials responsible for compiling  the reports stated that it is not part of their methodology to review data  from prior fiscal quarters to see whether any contract actions have been  entered that were not previously reported. By not adhering to FEMA  policy that establishes timeframes for entering data in a disaster response  scenario, FEMA risks reporting incomplete information.

PKEMRA required that FEMA  encourage state and local governments to establish their own advance  contracts with vendors for goods and services in advance of natural  disasters. In September 2015, we found that FEMA\u2019s outreach with  state and local governments to encourage the establishment of advance  contracts can result in more efficient contracting after a disaster.  PKEMRA also required that FEMA establish a process to ensure that  federal advance contracts are coordinated with state and local  governments, as appropriate. In our September 2015 report, we also  found that these efforts can ensure that states are aware of and can  access certain federal advance contracts, such as General Services  Administration schedule contracts.", "However, in the same report, we found that inconsistencies in whether  and how the regions perform state and local outreach limited FEMA\u2019s  ability to support advance contracting efforts. We recommended that  FEMA provide new or updated guidance to ensure that all contracting  officers are aware of requirements concerning the need to conduct  outreach to state and local governments to support their use of advance  contracts. DHS concurred with this recommendation and in 2017 FEMA  updated its Disaster Contracting Desk Guide to state that contracting  officers should inform their state and local counterparts of the availability  and use of federal advance contracts established by FEMA. Our review  of the guide found that it does remind contracting officers to coordinate  with states and localities over the use of federal advance contracts, but  does not provide any details on how often or what types of advance  contract information should be shared with states and localities, or  provide any instructions to contracting officers on PKEMRA\u2019s requirement  to encourage states and localities to establish their own advance  contracts for the types of goods and services needed during a disaster.", "Our current review also found inconsistencies with FEMA\u2019s efforts to  encourage states and localities to establish their own advance contracts  with vendors and ensure coordination with them on their use of federal  advance contracts. For example, some regional FEMA officials explained  that they regularly perform outreach, which can assist states and localities  with establishing advance contracts for goods and services commonly  needed during a disaster, like security, transportation, and office supplies.  Regional officials we spoke with said more frequent coordination allows  them to avoid overlap across state and federal contracting efforts, and  know what resources the states have in place and how long states are  capable of providing these resources following a disaster. However, other  regional officials reported having less frequent coordination with state and  local governments. For example, a FEMA official stated that one of the  regions has less frequent meetings with state and local governments  because the region is geographically dispersed and has fewer disasters.  According to another regional official, coordination between some  regional offices and state and local officials over advance contracting was  minimal prior to Hurricane Harvey, and in some cases only occurred  when FEMA and state and local officials were co-located during a  disaster.", "Officials from some state and local governments and USACE reported  examples where increased coordination between FEMA, states, and  localities could have improved the use of advance contracts in 2017. For  example, in September 2018 we found that some localities were relying  on the same contractors to perform debris removal activities following  Hurricanes Harvey in Texas and Irma in Florida. As a result, we reported that some contractors that were removing debris in Texas did  not honor existing contracts in Florida, leading to delays in debris  removal. Additional communication and coordination between FEMA and  contracting officials in these states and localities about which contractors  they had established advance contracts with could have helped to  prevent this overlap and subsequent delay in removing debris. During our  current review, USACE and California officials also reported  miscommunications about state and local expectations for USACE\u2019s  debris removal contracts following the wildfires. Specifically, USACE and  state and local officials reported differing expectations about the work to  be performed under USACE\u2019s debris removal contracts, such as what  structures would be removed from private property and acceptable soil  contamination levels. According to USACE officials, they relied on FEMA,  as the lead for coordinating federal disaster response, to manage  communication with states and localities and to identify and manage  expectations about the scope of work to be performed using their  advance debris removal contracts. While state and local officials we met  with in California reported working closely with some FEMA officials not  responsible for regional contracting during the response to the wildfires,  FEMA regional contracting officials said that they had no direct  coordination with California officials.", "We also identified inconsistencies in the information available to FEMA\u2019s  contracting officials on existing advance contracts, which can be used to  facilitate coordination with states and localities on the establishment and  use of advance contracts. Our review of FEMA\u2019s advance contract list  found that it does not include all of the advance contracts that FEMA has  in place, and contracting officers we spoke with cited other resources they  also use to identify advance contracts, like biannual training  documentation provided to contracting staff. For example, while FEMA  officials told us the advance contract list is updated on a monthly basis,  our analysis found that 58 advance contracts identified on the June 2018  advance contract list were not included in the May 2018 biannual training  documentation, including contracts for telecommunications services,  generators, and manufactured housing units. Further, 26 of the contracts  included in the May training documentation were not included on the June  advance contract list, including contracts for foreign language  interpretation services, hygiene items, and short-shelf life meals. Some  contracting officers we spoke with said they referred to the advance  contract list as the primary resource for identifying advance contracts,  while others referenced the biannual training as their primary resource.", "FEMA has recognized some shortcomings in how it coordinated and  communicated with state and local governments over the use of advance  contracts following the 2017 disasters, and identified some action to  address these issues moving forward. In the 2017 Hurricane Season  FEMA After-Action Report, FEMA identified the need to expand its  capabilities to support state, local, tribal, and territorial governments in  improving their capabilities for advance contracting, among other  issues. The report recommends that FEMA should continue efforts to  develop a toolkit that will provide state and local governments with  recommendations for advance contracts, emergency acquisition  guidance, and solicitation templates.", "According to FEMA contracting officials, the development of the toolkit  has been prioritized by FEMA\u2019s Administrator to help better prepare the  states and localities and decrease their reliance on FEMA for assistance  following a disaster. However, as of August 2018 the specific contents of  the toolkit were still being decided. For example, officials familiar with the  development of the toolkit originally said they intended for it to include  FEMA\u2019s advance contract list, to provide states with recommendations on  the types of advance contracts that may be useful. But in subsequent  discussions these officials told us they did not plan to provide states and  localities with a full list of advance contracts to avoid being overly  prescriptive, and because not all of the contracts on the list are relevant  for the types of disasters some states experience. Officials further stated  that since it is the responsibility of the federal coordinator in each region  to communicate available federal advance contracts to states and  localities, providing a full list of advance contracts is unnecessary.", "Federal internal control standards state that agency management should  use quality information to achieve their objectives. Agency management  should also internally and externally communicate that information to  achieve their objective. However, FEMA\u2019s guidance does not clearly  communicate its objectives and requirements for contracting officers to  encourage states and localities to enter into their own advance contracts,  nor is there a consolidated resource listing available advance contracts  that states and localities can use to inform their advance contracting  efforts. According to FEMA officials, information on advance contracts is  fluid, as new contracts are established or old contracts expire. Officials also told us that the advance contract list is updated monthly, yet as  mentioned earlier, contracts identified in the May training documentation  were not reflected in the list that was updated as of June. Ensuring that  advance contract information is complete and updated regularly is  important, because differences across FEMA\u2019s resources listing advance  contracts could result in FEMA\u2019s contracting officers not being aware of  the availability of certain contracts during a disaster, and states not  receiving recommendations on what advance contracts may be helpful for  them to establish. Without clear guidance on FEMA\u2019s expectations for  coordination with states and localities on advance contracting efforts, and  a centralized resource listing up to date information on FEMA\u2019s advance  contracts, FEMA contracting officers and their state and local  counterparts lack reasonable assurance they will have the tools needed  to effectively communicate about advance contracts, and use them to  respond to future disasters. Moreover, given FEMA\u2019s recent emphasis on  the importance of states and localities having the capability to provide  their own life-saving goods and services in the immediate aftermath of a  disaster, clearly communicating consistent and up to date information on  the availability and limitations of federal advance contracts through the  toolkit, or other means, is critical to informing state and local disaster  response efforts."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Contracting during a disaster can pose a unique set of challenges as  officials face a significant amount of pressure to provide life-sustaining  goods and services to survivors as quickly as possible.

Given the circumstances surrounding the  2017 disasters and the importance of preparedness for future disasters, it  is critical to ensure that the federal government is positioned to maximize  its advance contracts to the extent practical and cost-effective to provide  immediate disaster response.", "Although FEMA has identified advance contracts for use during a  disaster, without an updated strategy\u2014and guidance that is incorporated  into training\u2014on how to maximize their use during a disaster, as well as  the development of clear guidance on acquisition planning timeframes,  FEMA is at risk of these contracts not being effectively planned and  used. Furthermore, FEMA officials have not always maintained complete  information on the advance contracts available for them to quickly  respond to disasters, or completely reported competitively and non- competitively awarded advance contract information to better help  congressional committees evaluate spending over time. Finally, without  continued efforts to improve outreach with states and localities and  centralize information on available advance contracts, FEMA\u2019s  contracting officers and their state and local counterparts may not have  the information needed to efficiently respond to a disaster."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making nine recommendations to FEMA.", "FEMA\u2019s Administrator should update the strategy identified in its 2007  Advance Contracting of Goods and Services Report to Congress to  clearly define the objectives of advance contracts, how they contribute to  FEMA\u2019s disaster response operations, and whether and how they should  be prioritized in relation to new post-disaster contract awards.  (Recommendation 1)", "FEMA\u2019s Administrator should ensure the Head of the Contracting Activity  updates the Disaster Contracting Desk Guide to include guidance for  whether and under what circumstances contracting officers should  consider using existing advance contracts prior to making new post- disaster contract awards, and include this guidance in existing semi- annual training given to contracting officers. (Recommendation 2)", "FEMA\u2019s Administrator should update and implement existing guidance for  program office and contracting officer personnel to identify acquisition  planning timeframes and considerations across the entire acquisition  planning process, and clearly communicate the purpose and use of  MAPS. (Recommendation 3)", "FEMA\u2019s Administrator should ensure the Head of the Contracting Activity  adheres to current hard copy contract file management requirements to  ensure advance contract files are complete and up to date, whether they  will be transferred into the new Electronic Contract Filing System or  remain in hard copy format. (Recommendation 4)", "FEMA\u2019s Administrator should ensure the Head of the Contracting Activity  reminds contracting officers of the three day timeframe for entering  completed award documentation into the contract writing system when  executing notice to proceed documentation. (Recommendation 5)", "FEMA\u2019s Administrator should ensure the Head of the Contracting Activity  revises its reporting methodology to ensure that all disaster contracts are  included in its quarterly reports to congressional committees on disaster  contract actions. (Recommendation 6)", "FEMA\u2019s Administrator should ensure the Head of the Contracting Activity  revises the Disaster Contracting Officer Desk guide to provide specific  guidance for contracting officers to perform outreach to state and local  governments on the use and establishment of advance contracts.  (Recommendation 7)", "FEMA\u2019s Administrator should ensure the Head of the Contracting Activity  identifies a single centralized resource listing its advance contracts and  ensure that source is updated regularly to include all available advance  contracts.

DHS and FEMA also provided technical  comments, which we incorporated as appropriate.", "In its written comments, FEMA agreed to take actions to address our  recommendations, such as updating guidance on advance contract use  and management, adding an addendum to its quarterly report that  captures the contract actions that were previously unreported, and better  communicating information on advance contracts to states and localities.  In its concurrence with two of our recommendations, FEMA requested  that we consider these recommendations resolved and close as  implemented based on our actions it had previously taken.", "For example, in its response to our third recommendation, FEMA agreed  to update and implement existing guidance to identify acquisition  timeframes and the purpose and use of its 5-Year MAPS program. In its  response, FEMA reiterated that it has conducted training sessions for its  contracting and program staff on the 5-Year MAPS program and provides  notice to program managers when acquisition planning is set to begin,  which the agency believes satisfies this recommendation. We  acknowledge FEMA\u2019s training in this report; however, we noted that not  all program and contracting staff we spoke with were familiar with 5-Year  MAPS, and there is no formal guidance on timeframes for the entire  acquisition planning process. We continue to believe this  recommendation remains open and encourage FEMA to formalize  guidance on the timeframes and considerations for planning various types  of acquisitions across the entire acquisition planning process, and to  document the purpose and use of the 5-Year MAPS program to ensure a  uniform understanding of the program.", "Further, in its concurrence with our eighth recommendation, FEMA stated  that it believes its current advance contract list satisfies our  recommendation for internally communicating available advance  contracts. We acknowledge in this report that the advance contract list is  updated monthly; however, we found inconsistencies in the advance  contract list and other documentation identifying advance contracts, which  could result in FEMA\u2019s contracting officers not having full visibility into  available advance contracts. We continue to believe the recommendation  remains open and encourage FEMA to identify a centralized resource  with all available advance contracts and ensure that it is regularly updated  for contracting staff.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Secretary of Defense, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers  Director of Contracting, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the  Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the  Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s Chief Procurement Officer.

This report specifically addresses the  use of advance contracts, assessing the extent to which (1) the Federal  Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers (USACE) used advance contracts, (2) the planning,  management, and reporting of selected FEMA and USACE advance  contracts met certain contracting requirements, and (3) FEMA and  USACE identified any lessons learned and challenges with their use of  these contracts. We also have an ongoing review on post-disaster  contracting that is expected to be completed in early 2019.", "To identify the extent to which FEMA and USACE used advance  contracts, we reviewed data on contract obligations for the 2017 disasters  from the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG)  through May 31, 2018. We identified hurricane obligations using the  national interest code, as well as the contract description. Data on  obligations for the California wildfires is limited to those contracts that  FEMA and USACE identified as being used to respond to those events  because no national interest code was established in FPDS-NG. To  determine which obligations were made through the use of advance  contracts, we reviewed documentation provided by FEMA and USACE  identifying the advance contracts they have in place and that were used  in support of the 2017 disasters. We analyzed the FPDS-NG data to  identify FEMA and USACE advance contract obligations compared to  overall contract obligations by disaster, competition procedures used, and the types of goods and services procured. We assessed the reliability of  FPDS-NG data by reviewing existing information about the FPDS-NG  system and the data it collects\u2014specifically, the data dictionary and data  validation rules\u2014and performing electronic testing. We determined the  FPDS-NG data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report.", "To assess the extent to which FEMA used its advance contracts, we  reviewed FEMA contracting policies and guidance, such as FEMA\u2019s 2017  Disaster Contracting Desk Guide and FEMA\u2019s Advance Contracting of  Goods and Services Report to Congress to identify available guidance on  the use and intent of advance contracts. Based on our review of  documentation, we identified examples of goods\u2014tarps and meals\u2014that  FEMA had advance contracts in place for, but experienced challenges  using in response the 2017 disasters. We reviewed FPDS-NG data to  determine whether these goods were procured through post-disaster  contracts rather than advance contracts, and selected advance and post- disaster contracts for further review. To identify limitations that affected  the use of tarp and meal advance contracts, we gathered and reviewed  advance and post-disaster contract documentation and interviewed  contracting officials involved in the award and use of the contracts in  2017.", "To assess the extent to which the planning, management, and reporting  of advance contracts used in response to the three hurricanes and  California wildfires in 2017 met selected applicable contracting  requirements, we reviewed relevant documentation, including the Post- Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act (PKEMRA), the Federal  Acquisition Regulation (FAR), and Department of Homeland Security  (DHS, FEMA, and USACE contracting policies. We identified a non- generalizable sample of advance contracts based on advance contract  obligation data from FPDS-NG as of March 31, 2018. We analyzed the  data to identify 10 competed and four h non-competed contracts. To  obtain a range of competed contracts, we identified contracts used for  goods and services with obligations above $50 million. All of the non- competed contracts used were for FEMA services; to obtain a range of  non-competed contracts we identified contracts with obligations above  $10 million. Our selected advance contracts included 10 from FEMA and  four from USACE. Findings based on information collected from the 14  contracts cannot be generalized to all advance contracts. Additional  details on our selected contracts can be found in table 2.", "To review our selected FEMA and USACE advance contracts, we  developed a data collection instrument to gather selected contract  information, such as period of performance, contract type, estimated  contract value, and the presence of key contract documents, among  others. To assess FEMA and USACE\u2019s planning of selected advance  contracts, we reviewed information from our data collection instrument on  advance contract award date and period of performance, and determined  that six of FEMA\u2019s contracts met GAO\u2019s definition of a bridge contract. To  identify any planning challenges that contributed to these extensions, we  reviewed FEMA acquisition planning policies, timeframes and relevant  contract file documentation, such as written acquisition strategies and  justification and approval documents, to determine whether acquisition  planning activities for the selected advance contracts were completed  according to guidance. We interviewed FEMA officials associated with  these contracts on acquisition planning efforts, and factors that affected  their ability to award new contracts. We also reviewed documentation and  interviewed officials on FEMA\u2019s acquisition planning system\u2014the 5 Year  Master Acquisition Planning Schedule (MAPS).", "To assess FEMA and USACE\u2019s management of selected advance  contracts, we reviewed information gathered from our data collection  instrument on the presence of selected acquisition documents, such as  acquisition strategies and contract modifications in the contract file, that  typically provide the history of a contract. We reviewed relevant  procurement regulations, the DHS Acquisition Manual, and other FEMA  and USACE policies, to identify acquisition documentation requirements  and record keeping processes. For contracts where documentation was  not found in the contract file or system of record, we requested the  missing documentation from FEMA and USACE officials to determine  whether it had been completed. We also interviewed FEMA and USACE  headquarters officials to supplement our understanding of FEMA and  USACE\u2019s record keeping policies, practices, and challenges.", "To assess the reporting of selected advance contracts, we compared  advance contract action data identified in FPDS-NG to data reported in  FEMA\u2019s Disaster Contracts Quarterly Report Fourth Quarter, Fiscal Year  2017 and Disaster Contracts Quarterly Report First Quarter, Fiscal Year  2018 to congressional committees on disaster contracting to identify any  unreported actions. We interviewed FEMA officials to discuss the  methodology and data sources for the congressional committee reports,  and any limitations to the accuracy of the data reported.", "To assess what challenges and lessons learned FEMA and USACE  identified with the use of advance contracts in 2017, we reviewed  PKEMRA advance contract requirements, FEMA and USACE  documentation on the use of advance contracts, and after-action reports  from 2017 and prior years, including the Hurricane Sandy FEMA After- Action Report, and the 2017 Hurricane Season FEMA After-Action  Report, and federal internal control standards for information and  communications. As part of our review, we identified FEMA and USACE\u2019s  processes for documenting lessons learned following a disaster, lessons  learned specific to advance contracts, and any recommendations or  actions planned by the agencies to address them. We interviewed FEMA  and USACE headquarters officials on reported lessons learned, any other  challenges related to the use of advance contracts, and ongoing or  completed actions to address them. To describe challenges related to  coordination with state and local officials on the use of advance contracts,  we interviewed FEMA and USACE regional staff. To obtain perspectives  and examples from state and local government officials involved in  disaster response efforts we interviewed officials in California on advance  contracting efforts. The information gathered from these officials is not  generalizable to all officials. We also analyzed information on available  advance contracts from FEMA\u2019s June 2018 advance contract list and  FEMA\u2019s May 2018 training documentation identifying advance contracts  to identify any differences in the information available to FEMA regional  contracting officers, and their state and local contracting counterparts.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2018 to December  2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
