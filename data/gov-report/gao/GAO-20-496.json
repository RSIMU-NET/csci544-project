An overcount occurs when an individual is  counted more than once or in the wrong place. While recent censuses  appear to have been increasingly accurate, measurement errors are not  evenly distributed across the population. In the 2010 Census, Black and  American Indian races were statistically undercounted, as were  respondents of Hispanic origin.

This report  examines the Bureau\u2019s progress in addressing selected prior census  challenges with the Bureau\u2019s partnership and outreach. To select  challenges for follow-up with the Bureau, we reviewed our relevant prior  reports, prior Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General  reports, Bureau evaluations and assessments from the 2010 Census, and  recommendations made by third-party groups such as the Bureau\u2019s  National Advisory Committee on Race, Ethnic and Other Populations,  which serves as a stakeholder to monitor and consult with the Bureau on  its decennial operations.", "To determine the Bureau\u2019s progress in addressing the selected  challenges, we reviewed Bureau planning documentation to identify how  the Bureau was planning to implement its partnership and outreach  activities and what planned actions, if any, were designed to try to  address those prior challenges. We received and reviewed regular  Bureau reports, such as weekly updates on the level of Partnership  Program activity, to determine where the Bureau\u2019s reported progress was  in relation to its operational goals. We also interviewed Bureau officials to  get their perspectives on the goals of the partnership and outreach efforts  and obtain their views of the progress toward those goals.", "In addition, we distributed a survey to the population of 248 area census  office managers at the local level from February 25 through March 2,  2020, to get their perspectives on the effectiveness of the Partnership  Program and how well related efforts had been coordinated with census  field operations. We received responses from 175 area census office  mangers for a response rate of 71 percent.

NPP and CPEP are intended to  complement and leverage their respective expertise to help maximize  participation by partners. According to Bureau officials, the Bureau\u2019s  Census Open Innovation Labs is another important component that aims  to integrate these partnership activities and provide guidance at the  national and local levels on various strategies for messaging with  partners.", "The roughly 1,500 Partnership specialists hired for 2020 are temporary  Bureau employees who implement CPEP and are responsible for, among  others things, establishing local partnerships and engaging those partners  to host activities and events (known as \u201ccommitments\u201d) within the  communities they serve. These commitments could include activities and  events such as conducting knowledge-sharing seminars, issuing press  releases, providing questionnaire assistance, producing pamphlets, and  hosting field recruiting events, among others. For the 2020 Census, the  Bureau had a goal of establishing 300,000 community partners  nationwide. In 2010, the Bureau secured approximately 256,000 local  partners.", "The Partnership program also supports inter-governmental census  outreach activities through state complete count commissions (SCCCs) at  the state level and complete count committees (CCCs) at the tribal and  local levels. These groups foster a collaborative partnership between  political, business, and community leaders to deliver messages on the  importance of participation in the census. The Bureau had a goal of  encouraging every state to create an SCCC, formed at the highest level  of state government, such as the governor\u2019s office. SCCCs seek to  leverage the state\u2019s vested interest in a timely and complete population  count.", "According to Bureau planning documentation, CCCs are usually formed  by the highest elected official in that jurisdiction, such as a tribal leader, a  mayor, county commissioner, or regional chairman. The Bureau notes  that partnership specialists are the primary contact between the Bureau  and the CCC. Partnership specialists may conduct workshops, train CCC  members, and provide or direct CCCs to census promotional materials.  Bureau officials noted that initial partnership specialists were hired earlier  in the decennial cycle for 2020 in part to help form CCCs. Partnership  specialists are also to play a role in assisting CCCs with identifying hard- to-count populations within their respective communities and assist in  developing strategies to reach those communities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Paid Advertising", "paragraphs": ["Similar to previous censuses, for 2020, the Bureau plans to use multiple  paid media outlets such as radio, television, newspapers, magazine, and  billboards as one of its means to promote awareness and encourage  participation in the census. Along with the traditional advertising, the  Bureau also plans to use digital advertising such as web banner ads,  video ads, digital extensions of traditional outlets, and social media  channels. According to Bureau officials, they plan to be able to use paid  advertising modes to target specific audiences including hard-to-count  populations that may be more apt to trust such communication.", "For example, the Bureau\u2019s 2020 communication plan cites research that  states that the majority of Asian-Americans use traditional media\u2014 whether in print, online, or from a mobile device\u2014as their primary source  of local news. The Bureau plans to implement its 2020 paid media  campaign in four phases (see table 2).", "As of early May 2020, the Bureau has not yet indicated the revised  timeframes for the phases of paid advertising to reflect the COVID-19  disruptions. Bureau officials told us that they are planning to spend an  additional $160 million on advertising as part of its public education and  outreach campaign, originally estimated to cost over $500 million.

Media-focused materials such as  press kits and press releases will be available in the media section of  2020Census.gov.", "As part of its media relations effort, the Bureau has also developed a  crisis communications plan for handling major events and potential  messaging disturbances. According to the Bureau, its crisis  communication plan is intended to allow it to respond quickly and  effectively to any events or actions that jeopardize the public\u2019s  confidentiality or reduce its willingness to respond to the 2020 Census.  For example, the Bureau stated that in response to the COVID-19  outbreak, it adapted part of its advertisement messaging to re-emphasize  the importance of responding to the census online, avoiding the need for  in-person follow-up interviews."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Social Media Outreach", "paragraphs": ["The Bureau\u2019s social media strategy for 2020 reflects the increased  number of social media platforms that were not available during the last  census, such as Snapchat, Instagram Live Stories, and Facebook  Messenger.

The Bureau strives to conduct an accurate count of  the nation\u2019s population. However, some degree of inaccuracy is  inevitable. While the Bureau reported that the 2010 Census did not have  a significant net undercount or net overcount nationally, the Bureau also  reported that errors in coverage were unevenly distributed through the  population, as figure 2 shows. In addition to the undercounted groups  shown below, prior censuses, such as the 1990 Census, also showed  statistically significant undercounts of Non-Hispanic Asians, American  Indians off (as well as on) Reservations, and Native Hawaiian or Pacific  Islanders.", "These errors are problematic because certain groups such as minorities,  young children, and renters are more likely to be missed in the census,  while other groups such as those who may own a second, seasonal home  are more likely to be counted more than once. The Bureau has noted  these historical trends and has classified these and other subpopulations  as hard to count. According to the Bureau, hard-to-count groups can  share some or all of the following characteristics:", "Hard to Locate: Some groups are hard to locate because where they  live is unknown, or they move frequently.", "Hard to Persuade: Other groups are hard to persuade to participate in  the census.", "Hard to Interview: Some groups may have communication barriers,  such as limited English proficiency.", "Hard to Contact: Other groups may live in places with access barriers,  such as residents of gated communities or renters with doormen and  locked buildings.", "Adding to the challenge in 2020 is the possibility that, as the Bureau  adapts its timing and procedures for outreach and promotion, as well as  data collection, there is a possibility of uneven effects resulting on the  participation rates of different groups. For example, messaging and  operations that emphasize the importance of filling out the census online,  in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, may not be applicable to  communities or groups with limited internet access. If social distancing  measures result in fewer successful interviews during Non-Response  Follow-Up, for instance, then these groups with less internet access will  be at relatively greater risk of being missed by the census. Adapting field  enumeration procedures to implement social distancing might also be  less effective in addressing respondent concerns about interacting with  strangers in apartment buildings or other densely populated areas if a  census worker cannot practically distance themselves from the door.", "Actions Taken. As part of its integrated communications plan, the  Bureau\u2019s lead communications contractor segmented the market and  developed a series of strategic frameworks targeting advertising and  messaging to hard-to-count subpopulations through demographic profiles.  These groups include: persons experiencing homelessness; households with young children;  lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning persons; persons with disabilities;  the young and mobile.", "In addition to demographic profiles for each of these groups, the  contractor compiled lists of relevant community partners and consulted  with stakeholders to construct a \u201cday-in-the-life\u201d analysis and develop  advertising strategies to align tailored census advertising with the  experiences of each group. According to Bureau documentation, these  strategic frameworks provide the NPP data to decide how to best target  related outreach resources.", "The Bureau also developed for 2020 a publicly-available tool that displays  the areas of the country that are considered hard to count, according to  an index of demographic indicators known as the Low Response Score.  Using this index, the Bureau is able to monitor incoming census data for  those areas, such as response rates and hiring and recruitment numbers,  to see if efforts to reach hard-to-count areas are succeeding amid  challenging current events, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, which could  affect willingness of workers to participate in work taking them door-to- door to nonrespondents.", "Using funds appropriated under the Further Continuing Appropriations  Act, 2020, the Bureau also developed a mobile questionnaire assistance  (MQA) initiative to deploy census workers to specific locations, such as  grocery stores, houses of worship, and community centers, or at specific  events, such as festivals, to assist residents of low-response areas in  filling out the census. For the beginning of the self-response period,  partnership specialists identified the initial locations and times for the  initiative within hardest-to-count census tracts. The Bureau plans to then  monitor actual self-response data later in the operation to target those  areas reporting the lowest response rates. In April 2020, the Bureau  announced an indefinite delay of this latter stage of MQA in response to  the outbreak of COVID-19.", "Basis for Continued Monitoring. Participation in the census and  availability of nonrespondents for follow-up will help indicate whether the  Bureau is successfully reaching hard-to-count groups. With self-response  and follow-up for nonrespondents still ongoing, it is too early to know the  effectiveness of the Bureau\u2019s outreach efforts. However, multiple streams  of data will provide indications of Bureau success in enumerating areas  and demographic groups considered hard to count:", "As during the 2018 Census Test, the Bureau is monitoring active data  on self-response rates at the local level, which it can compare across  areas it deems hard to count.", "The Non-Response Follow-Up operation will yield data on interview  rates\u2014namely, the rate at which census workers are able to complete  interviews with residents who had not yet responded to the census.  These rates can also be compared across areas deemed hard to  count.", "Demographic evaluation data and the Bureau\u2019s post-enumeration  survey will further provide insight into whether racial, ethnic, and other  demographic groups were counted accurately."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Challenge 2: Mobilizing Partnership and Outreach Resources", "paragraphs": ["Nature of Challenge. For its partnership and outreach strategies to be  effective, the Bureau must have the necessary people and resources in  the right places to execute those strategies. In prior censuses, we have  reported on issues related to staffing and promotional materials faced by  the Partnership Program. Specifically, during the 2000 Census we noted  that partnership resources were stretched thin and in some cases took  effect too late in the decennial cycle. We recommended that the Bureau  review its staffing levels to ensure adequate support to partners, a  recommendation the Bureau subsequently implemented.", "During the 2010 Census, partnership specialists expressed concern  about the timely availability of promotional materials, and the impact on  their ability to build relationships with potential partners. We  recommended in December 2010 that the Bureau ensure that  promotional materials are provided to partnership staff when they are  hired, a recommendation that the Bureau agreed with but that remained  open at the beginning of our audit work in December 2019.", "Similarly, in a 2012 Bureau evaluation of the 2010 NPP, the Bureau found  that some national partners felt that promotional materials needed to be  better tailored to target their audiences\u2019 needs and that these partners  had difficulty accessing relevant census data for their audiences. The  Bureau also observed that improvements were needed in the distribution  of promotional materials by region.", "Actions Taken. The Bureau increased its partnership specialist hiring  from roughly 800 in 2010 to a little more than 1,500 in 2020. As figure 3  shows, collectively these partnership specialists were able to secure more  than 307,000 community partners by the end of February 2020\u2014higher  than the Bureau\u2019s goal of 300,000 and the roughly 256,000 local partners  the Bureau had by the end of the 2010 Census. Partnership staff were  also able to encourage the creation of state complete count commissions (SCCCs) in every state and territory except Nebraska and South Dakota.  These SCCCs are complemented across the country by more than  10,000 complete count committees (CCCs) at the local level.", "The Bureau also set a priority of getting partners in the right places. In  addition to the Bureau\u2019s overall goal for community partners, the Bureau  also set out to get at least one community partner in 100 percent of  census tracts that, according to their predicted indicator of low response,  are hardest to count. As of late March 2020, the Bureau had made  progress towards this goal, establishing partnerships in 85 percent of  such areas.", "The Bureau also provided partnership specialists a centralized website  where they can access promotional materials for distribution to partners.  These materials included fact sheets, brochures, and marketing  messages translated into 13 languages. Bureau officials indicated that  these materials were developed and published on the website prior to the  completion of partnership specialist training. According to officials, the website was made available to partnership specialists when they started  work. In addition to national and community partners, tribal, state, and  local CCCs also have access to these materials. The Bureau also  provided guidance on how to order hard copies of such materials through  the U.S. Government Publishing Office. We found during the course of  our audit work that these actions implemented our December 2010  recommendation.", "Basis for Continued Monitoring. The Bureau encountered some issues  in onboarding partnership specialists and tracking the establishment of  partnerships in hard-to-count areas. We will continue to monitor any  effects of these issues as part of our ongoing work:", "The Bureau experienced delays in onboarding partnership specialists,  which resulted in less time to form partnerships and meant less time  for community engagement and education activities leading up to the  census. While the Bureau was able to increase the number of  partnership specialists from 2010, the Bureau did not get all of its  more than 1,500 partnership specialists on board until November  2019, more than 4 months later than its initial goal.", "The Bureau successfully surpassed its nationwide goal for registering  more than 300,000 community partners. However, we reported in  February 2020 that the Bureau missed interim goals for getting at  least 200,000 partners in place by January 1, 2020, and at least  250,000 partners in place by February 1, 2020. We reported during  the 2000 Census on the benefits of having Partnership Program  resources on the ground earlier in the decennial cycle.", "The Bureau varied by region in terms of getting community partners  located in hard-to-count areas. As noted, the Bureau had a goal of  getting at least one partner in each of the hardest-to-count census  tracts by March 2020. Nationwide, the Bureau was able to achieve  this in 85 percent of such areas as of late March 2020. According to  Bureau data, five of the six regional offices reached at least 82  percent of this goal, with the Los Angeles region the farthest along at  90 percent as of late March 2020. On the other hand, only 70 percent  of the hardest-to-count tracts in the Philadelphia region, which covers  the Mid-Atlantic States, had at least one community partner.", "Bureau officials noted that partners in adjacent tracts can provide  relevant services to the hardest-to-count tracts. Officials indicated that  they would continue monitoring progress using this measure.", "Given the effect of the COVID-19 outbreak on partner activities, having  partnership specialists on boarded and partnerships formed later than  anticipated meant several months less time for in-person community  engagement and education activities leading up to the census in some  areas. In April 2020, Bureau officials told us that partnership specialists  had been instructed to continue interactions with partners via conference  calls, text, email, and other virtual means. Officials also cited the ability of  partnership specialists to support virtual partner commitments such as  radio interviews and virtual town halls, and officials noted that the  Government Publishing Office could continue to directly supply hard  copies of promotional materials to partners. Going forward, response  rates the Bureau achieves in areas where the Bureau lagged in  registering partners may shed light on whether or not having full  partnership coverage in certain hard-to-count areas is associated with  lower response rates.", "Additionally, the Bureau is conducting a survey of public awareness of  and sentiment toward the 2020 Census, with a goal of evaluating the  effectiveness of public communication efforts. This survey will also  provide data that could help answer the question of whether having less  time on the ground than anticipated for the full complement of partnership  specialists and community partners affected community awareness of the  census."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Challenge 3: Coordinating Outreach across the Bureau\u2019s Organization and Operations", "paragraphs": ["Nature of Challenge. Partnership and outreach activities, along with  local enumeration activities, span numerous decennial operations and  phases of data collection, and the Bureau has at times struggled to fully  integrate these efforts. For instance, we reported in July 2018 that, during  the planning stages for the 2020 Census, the Bureau\u2019s management of  initiatives aimed at enumerating hard-to-count groups was decentralized  and not fully integrated across operations. We recommended that the  Bureau take steps to ensure greater integration of efforts going forward.", "Coordination across regions of the country can also be a challenge.  Bureau officials overseeing CPEP told us that during the initial staffing of  partnership specialists, they observed variations in how job expectations  were communicated across regional offices through training. The COVID-19 outbreak further complicates coordination across the country where  state, tribal, and local public health rules, guidance, and enforcement may  affect how partners in different locations need to interact with the census,  and messaging to Bureau partnership staff and partners may not be  amenable to a one-size-fits-all approach nationwide.", "The challenge of coordination can also have effects on how local  managers of census activities perceive the efficiency of census efforts.  Partnership specialists are expected in 2020 to work on initiatives, such  as MQA, to which area census office staff also contribute. However,  partnership specialists do not report to managers within the area census  office, but directly report to the Bureau\u2019s regional offices. As part of our  December 2010 report on hard-to-count populations, we found that about  half of all local census office managers we surveyed were dissatisfied  with the level of coordination between local census office staff and  partnership staff, noting duplication of effort in some cases. We  recommended that the Bureau develop mechanisms to increase  coordination between partnership and local census office staff, a  recommendation that remains open.", "Actions Taken. In January 2020, in response to our July 2018  recommendation cited above, the Bureau provided us evidence of  ongoing, multi-team discussions focused on integrating perspectives on  decisions and planning for hard-to-count enumeration activities. In closing  the July 2018 recommendation, we noted that the Bureau\u2019s use of such  an integrated approach will help ensure that the Bureau\u2019s otherwise  decentralized efforts to address hard-to-count challenges will be more  effective.", "For field operations, the Bureau is holding a series of weekly  teleconferences, to which area census office managers and all  partnership specialists are invited to hear about updates from Bureau  management on field operations and partnership and outreach activities.  Bureau officials told us that having these calls, along with providing  emailed summaries of the calls, helps to standardize any updates to  guidance on field procedures or messaging across the area census office  and partnership staff. For example, the Bureau sent an email in mid- March 2020 to partnership staff that included guidance on emphasizing  the importance of internet self-response when responding to inquiries on  the COVID-19 outbreak.", "The Bureau indicated taking steps to standardize partnership staff training  and integrate partnership staff into field enumeration operations.  Specifically, officials told us they convened a nationwide, standardized  training curriculum after the Bureau had hired all of its partnership  specialists. This curriculum replaced what had been a regional office- specific approach.", "The Bureau developed guidance for partnership specialists on how to  provide direct feedback to area census offices when they become aware  of a potential facility or location that should be added to the Bureau\u2019s  database for enumeration. Specifically, if partnership staff become aware  of soup kitchens, homeless shelters, and other locations potentially being  missed, they are instructed to submit information including the address,  type of living quarters, and any applicable contact information to the  relevant area census office. Moreover, the Bureau indicated it had  assigned at least one partnership specialist to every area census office to  improve coordination between the Partnership Program and local census  operations.", "In addition, the Bureau created a rumor control page on its website to  quickly disseminate factual content in response to misinformation.  Examples of misinformation that the Bureau has detected include the  false suggestion of a citizenship question being on the census and the  posting of a potentially fraudulent census job website. The Bureau\u2019s  rumor control page includes the email address rumors@census.gov for  the public to report possible misinformation and disinformation. The web  page also has a set of frequently asked questions on topics such as data  confidentiality and ways to participate in the census, thus helping to  ensure that partnership staff, partners, and the public alike with access to  the internet have access to accurate online information.", "Basis for Continued Monitoring.", "As the Bureau experiences inevitable turnover in partnership  specialists and needs to update its messaging and outreach to reflect  changing conditions on the ground, such as the COVID-19 outbreak,  ensuring consistent training and guidance across its partnership staff  and keeping all staff abreast of changes will be important.", "As noted above, our December 2010 recommendation for the Bureau  to increase coordination between the Partnership Program and its  area census offices remains open. While partnership specialists  were assigned to area census offices, the Bureau has not put in place  formal expectations for how partnership staff should support area  census office staff and their activities. To fully implement this  recommendation, the Bureau would need to document how  partnership specialists and area census office staff are expected to  work together.", "We will also continue to monitor how area census office managers  express their perspectives on the effectiveness of the Partnership  Program in supporting implementation of census field operations. For  example, we surveyed area census office managers in March 2020  and found that nationally a plurality (42 percent) who responded said  they were dissatisfied with the level of communication and  coordination between the Partnership Program and their offices, while  41 percent said they were satisfied. A plurality of respondents (44  percent) were also dissatisfied with the level of clarity of roles and  responsibilities between the Partnership Program and their offices,  while 38 percent of respondents were satisfied.", "Open-ended comments we received from survey respondents  contained ideas for improving the level of communication between  partnership staff and area census office staff, such as having  partnership staff be more integrated within the area census office  structure.

Namely,  during the 2018 Census Test we reported that the Bureau\u2019s primary  measure of operational progress during Non-Response Follow-Up  overstated the amount of completed workload because it emphasized the  number of follow-up attempts made instead of the number of cases in  which the Bureau got the data it needed\u2014the preferred outcome of the  operation.", "Similarly, our 2017 review of in-office address canvassing\u2014when the  Bureau attempted to use aerial imagery to identify areas of the country  called blocks that did not require fieldwork to validate the address list\u2014 found that the Bureau\u2019s performance measures looked at how many of  the addresses in the address list were reviewed in-office, rather than how  many addresses did not require additional fieldwork.", "Separately measuring the contributions of partnership and outreach  activities on the desired outcome of maximizing the number of residents  who respond to the census is inherently difficult. In one of its evaluations  of the 2010 Census, though, the Bureau noted that the Partnership  Program needed to do a better job of measuring and rewarding the  intensity of partner effort throughout census operations, rather than  simply looking at the number of contacts made or the number of partners.  As Bureau officials noted to us, the quality of partners ultimately matters  more than the quantity.", "Actions Taken. In its performance measures of the Partnership Program,  the Bureau has taken steps beyond measuring the number of partners  nationwide. For example, as noted previously, the Bureau prioritizes and  tracks the extent to which it secures partnerships in hard-to-count areas,  acknowledging that partnerships are needed everywhere but are  particularly critical in areas that may otherwise be less likely to have high  response rates. Additionally, the Bureau tracks the number of events  partners complete and the number of commitments partners signed up for  but did not fulfill by their planned dates (known as overdue commitments).  As of early March 2020, community partners had fulfilled more than  270,000 committed events nationwide, while nearly 14,000 commitments  were overdue.", "Basis for Continued Monitoring. Going forward, Bureau evaluations of  the 2020 Census will demonstrate what, if any, lessons learned the  Bureau is able to draw regarding the quality of its 2020 partnership and  outreach efforts. The Bureau has multiple sources of data that it is, and  will be, collecting to better understand how success can be defined:", "While the Bureau monitors and reports the number of overdue  partnership commitments (cited above), it is not clear what the current  level of nearly 14,000 overdue commitments means in the context of  the universe of more than 270,000 total committed events. When we  asked about this issue, Bureau officials indicated that they monitor the  status of overdue commitments mostly to see if partners are staying  active in their communities. Officials also said they use the metric to  verify that partnership specialists are recording any follow-up they do  with partners that have not fulfilled their commitments.", "Similarly, the Bureau\u2019s plan for the MQA initiative cites the number of  census questionnaire responses received through MQA as an  indicator of how successful the Bureau is in connecting partners and  other census questionnaire assistance resources to areas that need  them. Yet, it is unclear from Bureau documentation what levels of  MQA uptake, if any, would constitute success. While low MQA uptake,  for instance, could mean that partnership specialists and census  response representatives were not successful in identifying the right  times and locations for MQA, it could also mean that residents were  successfully able to respond to the census via other means, or that  they did not attend MQA events due to the COVID-19 outbreak.", "When we followed up with Bureau officials, they indicated that they  have planned a series of required debriefings and exit interviews with  partnership specialists, which will include MQA effectiveness as a  topic. Such debriefings and exit interviews will likely be particularly  important, given the MQA change necessitated by the COVID-19  outbreak.", "Lastly, the COVID-19 outbreak could further complicate the Bureau\u2019s  ability to determine the ultimate effectiveness of its partnership and  outreach\u2014how well the Bureau achieves the goal of counting  everybody once, only once, and in the right place. The Bureau plans  to estimate census quality by relying in part on interviews conducted  door-to-door in a nationwide sample of households, scheduled for the  summer and fall of 2020. The COVID-19 outbreak could prompt the  Bureau to delay the related field operation to collect the data or affect  household responsiveness to in-person visits.", "As the timing of this report coincides with ongoing implementation of the  self-response period and field enumeration operations, planned Bureau  evaluations and assessments will be best positioned to identify any  lessons learned and determine whether, in light of the challenges cited  above, the Bureau\u2019s partnership and outreach efforts were successful in  maximizing participation in the census."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Department of Commerce.
