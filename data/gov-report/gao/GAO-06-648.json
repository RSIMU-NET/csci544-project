GAO also determined (3) whether VA has internal controls to help ensure the accuracy of information used to renew clinical privileges. GAO reviewed VA's policies, interviewed VA officials, and randomly sampled 17 physician files at each of seven VA medical facilities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO found that the files reviewed at seven VA medical facilities complied with four of VA's credentialing requirements selected for review, and all but one of five privileging requirements. Credentialing is the process of verifying that a physician's professional credentials, such as state medical licenses, are valid and meet VA's requirements for employment. Privileging is the process for determining which health care services a physician is allowed to provide to veterans. For the files GAO reviewed, compliance with the fifth privileging requirement was problematic at six facilities because officials used performance information when renewing clinical privileges but collected all or most of this information through their facility's quality assurance program. This is prohibited under VA policy. In general, VA quality assurance information is confidential, according to federal law and VA policy. According to VA officials, if quality assurance information is used outside of a facility's quality assurance program, it could be used for other purposes, including litigation. The information is protected to encourage physicians to participate in quality assurance programs by reporting and discussing adverse events to help prevent such events from occurring in the future. VA has not provided guidance to help medical facilities find ways to efficiently collect performance information outside of a facility's quality assurance program. At the seventh medical facility, officials did not use performance information to renew clinical privileges, as required. Three of the seven medical facilities did not meet VA's requirement to submit, within 60 days after being notified that the claim was paid, any information on paid VA medical malpractice claims involving facility practitioners, including physicians, to VA's Office of Medical-Legal Affairs. This office reviews the information and determines whether practitioners involved in the claims delivered substandard care, displayed professional incompetence, or engaged in professional misconduct. The office informs facilities of its determinations. When facilities do not submit all relevant VA malpractice information in a timely manner, VA medical facility officials lack complete information that would allow them to make informed decisions about the clinical privileges that their physicians should be granted. VA has not required its medical facilities to establish internal controls to help ensure that privileging information managed by medical staff specialists--who are responsible for obtaining and verifying the information used in the credentialing and privileging processes--is accurate. One facility GAO visited did not identify 106 physicians whose privileging process had not been completed by facility officials for at least 2 years because of inaccurate information provided by the facility's medical staff specialist. As a result, these physicians were practicing at the facility without current clinical privileges. Without accurate information on the privileges that have been granted to physicians and the dates for renewing those privileges, VA medical facility officials will not know if they have failed to renew clinical privileges for any of their physicians in accordance with VA policy."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has over 36,000 physicians  working at more than 1,300 facilities in its health care system. To help  ensure the quality of the health care these physicians deliver and the safety  of veterans, VA is responsible for determining that its physicians have the  appropriate professional credentials and clinical experience to provide  health care to VA\u2019s patients. To do this, VA credentials and privileges  physicians providing care at VA medical facilities. Credentialing is the  process of verifying that a physician\u2019s professional credentials, such as  licensure, education, and training, are valid and meet VA\u2019s requirements  for employment. Privileging is the process for determining\u2014based in part  on a physician\u2019s credentials\u2014which health care services a physician  should be allowed to provide to VA patients without supervision. These  health care services are known as a physician\u2019s clinical privileges.  Physicians are granted initial clinical privileges when they begin their  employment at a VA medical facility. Physicians\u2019 professional credentials  and clinical privileges must be reviewed and renewed at least every   2 years. VA\u2019s credentialing and privileging policy describes the  information that VA medical facility officials are required to review and  verify in order to credential and grant clinical privileges to VA physicians.  In addition to the requirements outlined in VA\u2019s credentialing and  privileging policy, medical facility officials are required to submit  information to VA headquarters on any VA physicians who are involved in  paid VA medical malpractice claims. This malpractice information is used  by VA headquarters to make decisions about the appropriateness of the  care delivered to veterans and should be used by medical facility officials  when making decisions about the clinical privileges to grant physicians.", "You expressed interest in the credentialing and privileging of VA  physicians and how this helps VA ensure the delivery of safe care to  veterans. In response to your request, we (1) determined the extent to  which selected VA medical facilities complied with four of VA\u2019s  credentialing requirements and five of VA\u2019s privileging requirements in  relation to individual physicians, and (2) determined the extent to which  selected VA medical facilities complied with the requirement to submit  information to VA headquarters on paid VA medical malpractice claims  involving VA physicians. Also, during the course of our work, we learned  about a medical facility where inaccuracies in privileging information  resulted in 106 physicians providing care to veterans in the facility without  the required clinical privileges. According to VA officials, the individual  responsible for privileging data inappropriately changed the privileging  dates for some of these physicians to a later date in order to delay work  needed to complete the credentialing and privileging requirements on  these physicians. This led us to add to our review a reporting objective  related to internal controls. Specifically, in this report we also   (3) determined whether VA has internal controls to help ensure the  accuracy of information medical facilities use to renew physicians\u2019 clinical  privileges.", "To determine the extent to which selected VA medical facilities complied  with four of VA\u2019s credentialing requirements and five of VA\u2019s privileging  requirements in relation to individual physicians, we reviewed VA\u2019s  policies to identify the requirements that VA medical facility officials must  follow when credentialing and granting clinical privileges to physicians.  We selected four of VA\u2019s credentialing requirements for review because  they are requirements that\u2014unlike others\u2014address information about  physicians that can change or be updated with new information  periodically. As a result, VA requires that this information be verified by  medical facility officials when a physician initially applies for employment  at VA and at least every 2 years thereafter. Other VA credentialing  requirements are not subject to change or updating and are required by VA  to be verified when the physician initially applies for employment. Under  the four requirements we reviewed, VA medical facility officials must  1.  verify that all state medical licenses held by physicians are valid;  2.  query the Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB) database to  determine whether physicians had disciplinary action taken against  any of their licenses, including expired licenses;  3.  verify information provided by physicians on their involvement in  medical malpractice claims at a VA or non-VA facility; and  4.  query the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) to determine  whether a physician was reported to this data bank because of  involvement in VA or non-VA paid medical malpractice claims, display  of professional incompetence, or engagement in professional  misconduct.", "Of the privileging requirements in VA\u2019s credentialing and privileging  policy, we selected four requirements that VA identifies as general  privileging requirements. In addition, we selected another privileging  requirement about the use of individual performance information because  of its importance in the renewal of clinical privileges. The five VA  privileging requirements we selected are  1.  verify that all state medical licenses held by physicians are valid;  2.  verify physicians\u2019 training and experience;  3.  assess physicians\u2019 clinical competence and health status;  4.  consider any information provided by a physician related to medical  malpractice allegations or paid claims, loss of medical staff  membership, loss or reduction of clinical privileges at a VA or non-VA  facility, or any challenges to a physician\u2019s state medical license; and  5.  use information on a physician\u2019s performance when making decisions  about whether to renew the physician\u2019s clinical privileges.", "Two of the five privileging requirements\u2014verify all state medical licenses  and consider medical malpractice information\u2014are also VA credentialing  requirements we reviewed.", "To determine the extent to which selected VA medical facilities complied  with four of VA\u2019s credentialing requirements and five of VA\u2019s privileging  requirements, we conducted site visits to seven VA medical facilities that  were chosen based on the diversity of their size and geographic location.  The medical facilities are located in Boise, Idaho; Kansas City, Missouri;  Las Vegas, Nevada; Lexington, Kentucky; Martinsburg, West Virginia;  Miami, Florida; and San Antonio, Texas. For each of the seven medical  facilities, VA officials provided a list of medical facility physicians grouped  by their clinical specialty. Using this list, at each medical facility we  randomly selected 17 physicians and obtained files with their credentialing  and privileging information. Our sample included physicians working in  VA medical facilities full-time and part-time, through a contract, or  without direct compensation from VA. In some cases, these physicians  also worked at non-VA medical facilities. Eight of the 17 physician files at  each medical facility represent eight clinical specialties that are offered at  most VA medical facilities: anesthesiology, gastroenterology, neurology,  oncology, ophthalmology, orthopedics, radiology, and urology. Four of the  17 represent general surgery and internal medicine and 5 of the 17 had no  specialty identified on the list provided by VA. To determine whether the  files we reviewed demonstrated compliance with the four VA credentialing  requirements and VA\u2019s privileging requirements at each of the seven VA  medical facilities, we reviewed paper copy credentialing and privileging  files for our sample of physicians to determine whether these files  included documentation demonstrating that medical facility officials had  complied with the credentialing and privileging requirements. We also  reviewed credentialing information on these physicians stored in VetPro, a  Web-based credentialing system VA implemented in March 2001. Based on  the sample of physician files we reviewed at each of the seven medical  facilities, we can discuss a medical facility\u2019s compliance for the physician  files we reviewed; we cannot draw conclusions about the remaining  physician files at the medical facilities we visited or about the compliance  of other VA medical facilities. In collecting information on the  credentialing and privileging requirements from physician files at each  facility, we employed standard data collection techniques to ensure the  accuracy and reliability of the data used in this report.", "Finally, we included in our review a requirement that is related to the  privileging process. Under this requirement, medical facility officials must  submit to VA\u2019s Office of Medical-Legal Affairs any information on VA  practitioners, including physicians, who were involved in a paid VA  medical malpractice claim. The Office of Medical-Legal Affairs determines  whether the physicians involved in these claims delivered substandard  care to veterans. We collected information about the extent to which each  of the seven medical facilities in our review submitted malpractice  information to the Office of Medical-Legal Affairs.", "To determine whether VA has internal controls to help ensure the  accuracy of information medical facilities use to renew physicians\u2019 clinical  privileges, we interviewed the director of VA\u2019s credentialing and  privileging program, as well as other VA headquarters and medical facility  officials. We identified the internal controls VA has in place for its  privileging process and, using GAO\u2019s standards for internal controls in the  federal government, determined whether these controls are adequate.

State medical licenses are issued by state licensing boards, which  generally establish state licensing requirements governing their licensed  practitioners. To keep a license current, physicians must renew their  licenses before they expire and meet renewal requirements established by  state licensing boards, such as continuing education. Renewal procedures  and requirements vary by state. When state licensing boards discover  violations of licensing practices\u2014such as the abuse of prescription drugs  or the provision of substandard care\u2014that result in adverse health effects,  they may place restrictions on licenses or revoke them. Restrictions issued  by a state licensing board can limit or prohibit a physician from practicing  in that particular state. Generally, state licensing boards maintain a  database that contains information on any restrictions or revocations of  physicians\u2019 licenses.", "VA requires its medical facility officials to credential and privilege facility  physicians periodically in order to work at VA.

This query  enables officials to determine all the state medical licenses a physician has  ever held, including those not disclosed by a physician to VA, and whether  a physician has had any disciplinary actions taken against these licenses.  VA does not require this query at reappointment because VA headquarters  regularly receives reports from FSMB on any VA physician whose name  appears on FSMB\u2019s list, indicating that disciplinary action has been taken  against the physician\u2019s state medical license. When VA headquarters  receives a report from FSMB, it notifies the appropriate VA medical  facility.", "VA\u2019s credentialing process requires VA medical staff specialists to verify  medical malpractice claims at initial appointment and at reappointment.  These claims may be verified by contacting a court of jurisdiction or the  insurance company involved in the medical malpractice claim, or by  obtaining a statement of claims status from the attorney representing the  physician in the medical malpractice claim. In addition, VA requires  medical staff specialists to query NPDB, which contains reports by state  licensing boards, hospitals, and other health care entities on  unprofessional behavior on the part of physicians or adverse actions taken  against them. This query enables officials to determine whether physicians  fully disclosed to VA any involvement they might have had in paid medical  malpractice claims. Once a physician\u2019s credentialing information has been  verified, the medical staff specialist sends the information to the  physician\u2019s supervisor, who is known as a clinical service chief.

Medical facility officials told us that after  becoming aware of the problem, they confronted the medical staff  specialist responsible for the data inaccuracies, who then resigned.  Medical facility officials then began to check the clinical privileges of all of  their physicians and identified inaccuracies in the privileging information  for 106 physicians. After reviewing the 106 physician files, facility officials  told us they did not find any problems that would have warranted the  physicians\u2019 removal from the facility\u2019s medical staff or that placed veterans  at risk.", "Although this medical facility did not identify any problems with the   106 physicians\u2019 clinical privileges or with their clinical competence to  deliver care to veterans, the potential exists for problems to occur at other  VA medical facilities. During our site visits, we did not identify any  facilities that had established internal controls that would help ensure the  accuracy of the information used to renew clinical privileges. A VA  headquarters official told us that there is no requirement for VA medical  facilities to have such internal controls in place. While VA does not require  facilities to establish these internal controls, the facility that identified  inaccuracies in its privileging information subsequently implemented  internal controls to reduce the risk of a similar situation occurring in the  future. Facility officials have taken steps to help ensure that a similar  situation does not recur. For example, the facility now provides each  facility clinical service chief with a list of physicians on a quarterly basis  and asks the clinical service chiefs to verify that the listed physicians are  currently working at the medical facility and to identify those physicians  working at the facility who are not on the list. This allows medical facility  officials to know if physicians have been inappropriately deleted from  VetPro and are working at the facility without current clinical privileges.  Without internal controls such as this for their privileging information,  VA\u2019s medical facilities may not know whether they have allowed some of  their physicians to practice with expired privileges."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["VA is responsible for ensuring that its physicians are qualified to deliver  health care to veterans at VA medical facilities and has requirements in  place that medical facility officials are to use to help ensure that  physicians meet these qualifications.

While officials  at six of the seven facilities we visited made an attempt to comply with  VA\u2019s requirement to use performance information, these officials deviated  from VA\u2019s policy by collecting all or most of the performance information  through their facilities\u2019 quality assurance programs. This occurred, in part,  because VA has not provided guidance on how to collect this information  in accordance with VA\u2019s policy. In addition, VA medical facility officials  did not have all the information they needed on physicians involved in  paid VA medical malpractice claims, because the facilities had not  submitted such information to VA\u2019s Office of Medical-Legal Affairs in a  timely manner. This could have placed veterans at risk of receiving care  from physicians who did not have adequate clinical skills.

We also interviewed the director  of VA\u2019s credentialing and privileging program, as well as officials  responsible for credentialing and privileging at the VA medical facilities  we visited. We selected four credentialing requirements for review  because they are requirements that\u2014unlike others\u2014address information  about physicians that can change or be updated with new information  periodically. As a result, VA requires that this information be verified by  facility officials at least every 2 years. Other credentialing requirements,  such as where a physician attended medical school or previous  employment history, are not subject to change or updating and are  required by VA to be verified when the physician initially applies for  employment. The four credentialing requirements are  1.  verify that all state medical licenses held by physicians are valid;  2.  query the Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB) database to  determine whether physicians had disciplinary action taken against  any of their licenses, including expired licenses;  3.  verify information provided by physicians on their involvement in  medical malpractice claims at a VA or non-VA medical facility; and  4.  query the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) to determine  whether a physician was reported to this data bank because of  involvement in VA or non-VA paid medical malpractice claims, display  of professional incompetence, or engagement in professional  misconduct.", "Of the privileging requirements in VA\u2019s credentialing and privileging  policy, we selected four requirements that VA identifies as general  privileging requirements. In addition, we selected another privileging  requirement about the use of individual performance information because  of its importance in the renewal of clinical privileges. The five VA  privileging requirements we selected are  1.  verify that all state medical licenses held by physicians are valid;  2.  verify physicians\u2019 training and experience;  3.  assess physicians\u2019 clinical competence and health status;  4.  consider any information provided by a physician related to medical  malpractice allegations or paid claims, loss of medical staff  membership, loss or reduction of clinical privileges at a VA or non-VA  facility, or any challenges to a physician\u2019s state medical license; and  5.  use information on a physician\u2019s performance when making decisions  about whether to renew the physician\u2019s clinical privileges.", "Two of the five privileging requirements\u2014verify all state medical licenses  and consider medical malpractice information\u2014are also VA credentialing  requirements.", "We conducted site visits to seven VA medical facilities that were chosen  based on size and geographic location. The medical facilities selected for  review were located in Boise, Idaho; Kansas City, Missouri; Las Vegas,  Nevada; Lexington, Kentucky; Martinsburg, West Virginia; Miami, Florida;  and San Antonio, Texas. For each medical facility visited, we obtained  from VA a list of physicians and their specialties. Using this list, at each  facility we randomly selected 17 physicians and obtained files with their  credentialing and privileging information. Our sample included physicians  working in VA facilities full-time and part-time, through a contract, or  without direct compensation from VA. In some cases, these physicians  also worked at non-VA medical facilities. At each facility we visited, we  selected one file from the following clinical specialties that are offered at  most VA medical facilities: anesthesiology, gastroenterology, neurology,  oncology, ophthalmology orthopedics, radiology, and urology. We also  selected two physician files from general surgery and internal medicine,  and five files from physician names that had no specialty identified on the  list provided by VA. At some facilities, we found that the physician  specialty indicated on the list provided by VA was incorrect. We replaced  these files by random selection with physician files in the specialty  needed.", "To determine whether the files we reviewed demonstrated compliance  with the selected VA credentialing requirements and privileging  requirements, we compared the documentation found in our sample files  against the credentialing and privileging requirements. During our site  visits, we reviewed the documentation in VetPro and in a physician\u2019s paper  copy credentialing file to determine whether the facility complied with  each of the four VA credentialing requirements that we reviewed. If  documentation was present either in VetPro or the paper copy file, we  determined that the medical facility complied with VA\u2019s requirement. For  each physician, we reviewed the three most recent appointment cycles\u2014 the period from one appointment process to the next appointment  process, which occurs every 2 years. Some of the physicians in our sample  had not been through three appointment cycles. For those physicians, we  reviewed only the number of cycles that had been completed. We  documented our findings from these reviews on a data collection  instrument.", "At each medical facility, we reviewed a physician\u2019s paper copy privileging  file to determine whether the physician\u2019s file contained documentation  that the medical facility met the five VA privileging requirements we  examined. For the fifth requirement\u2014use of information on a physician\u2019s  performance when making decisions about whether to renew physicians\u2019  clinical privileges\u2014we also interviewed facility officials, including the  facility quality assurance manager, to determine whether the facility  collected this physician performance information outside of the facility\u2019s  quality assurance program. For some physician files we reviewed, the  physician had only been through initial appointment and therefore did not  have individual physician performance information in the privileging file.", "Based on the sample of physician files we reviewed at each of the seven  medical facilities, we can discuss a medical facility\u2019s compliance for the  physician files we reviewed; we cannot draw conclusions about the  remaining physician files at the medical facilities we visited or about the  compliance of other VA medical facilities. In collecting information on the  credentialing and privileging requirements from physician files at each  facility, we employed standard data collection techniques to ensure the  accuracy and reliability of the data used in this report, such as  interviewing medical facility officials about the accuracy and timeliness of  the information contained in the physician files we reviewed and taking  steps to have a consistent interpretation of VA\u2019s credentialing and  privileging requirements for the physician files we reviewed at each  medical facility.", "To determine the extent to which the selected VA medical facilities  complied with a requirement to submit information on paid VA medical  malpractice claims, we obtained data from VA\u2019s Office of Medical-Legal  Affairs in Buffalo, New York to identify the VA medical facilities that were  delinquent\u2014more than 60 days had passed since the facility was notified  that a claim had been paid\u2014in submitting medical malpractice claim  information to this office. The data included the name of the VA medical  facility, the veteran who was named in the claim, the date the Office of  Medical-Legal Affairs was notified that a claim had been paid, and the date  the Office of Medical-Legal Affairs notified the facility that a VA medical  malpractice claim had been paid. VA\u2019s Office of Medical-Legal Affairs  determines whether a physician who was involved in a VA medical  malpractice claim delivered substandard care to veterans, and if so, was  reported to NPDB. We interviewed officials at this office to obtain  information about VA\u2019s process and requirements for determining if  substandard care was delivered.", "To determine whether VA has internal controls to help ensure the  accuracy of medical facility information that is used to renew physicians\u2019  clinical privileges, we interviewed the director of VA\u2019s credentialing and  privileging program, as well as other VA officials.
