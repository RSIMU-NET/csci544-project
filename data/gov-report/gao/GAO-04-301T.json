For example, the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks have heightened the need for increased focus on security within the global trade environment. In response, the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection has implemented new programs to improve the security of the global supply chain. These new programs require greater attention to human capital strategies to ensure that they achieve their goals of facilitating trade while preventing terrorist acts. In addition, the administration has continued to pursue multilateral negotiations within the World Trade Organization and with the Free Trade Area of the Americas countries as well as a series of new, bilateral and subregional trade negotiations. The increase in the number of initiatives has strained available human capital, leading to a USTR request for additional staff. Finally, the shifting global trade environment has complicated efforts to monitor and enforce trade agreements. For example, the United States has become the most frequent defendant in World Trade Organization trade dispute proceedings. Furthermore, as the U.S. economy has shifted toward services and high-tech industries, the industry advisory committees that provide trade advice to the U.S. government have required structural realignment to reflect these changes. Also, China's growing influence in international trade has resulted in new challenges to its trading partners. These changing global forces require U.S. trade agencies to continuously ensure that their human capital strategies closely link to the nation's strategic trade functions."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss the implications of recent trade  developments on the human capital strategies of major U.S. trade agencies  that negotiate, monitor, and enforce trade agreements and laws.

USTR\u2019s role includes developing and  coordinating U.S. international trade policy and leading or directing  negotiations with other countries on trade matters. It also has primary  statutory responsibility for monitoring and enforcing U.S. trade  agreements. The Department of Commerce has a relatively broad role with  respect to trade agreement activities, with three units in the International  Trade Administration performing the key trade functions: The Import  Administration helps enforce U.S. trade laws; Market Access and  Compliance is responsible for ensuring that other nations live up to their  trade agreements; and Trade Development focuses on advocacy for U.S.  companies, export promotion services, support for trade negotiations, and  market analysis. Trade functions at the CBP are primarily directed toward  enforcing U.S. import and export laws and facilitating legitimate trade as  well as collecting duties, fees, and other assessments (more than $23  billion in fiscal year 2002). Other agencies also play important roles, such  as the departments of Agriculture and State, which have relatively broad  roles with respect to trade agreement activities. The departments of the  Treasury and Labor have more specialized roles, such as advising on  financial services or labor and workers\u2019 rights issues. Federal trade policy  development and monitoring and enforcement efforts are coordinated  through an interagency mechanism comprising several management- and  staff-level committees and subcommittees.", "The number of authorized full-time staff at USTR, Commerce\u2019s Import  Administration, and Commerce\u2019s Market Access and Compliance division  has increased in recent years (see fig. 2).

CBP is  expected to maintain these staff levels, as the Homeland Security Act of  2002 stipulates that the Secretary of Homeland Security may not reduce  the staffing levels attributable to such functions on or after the effective  date of the act. In addition, more than 18,000 CBP inspectors perform  trade and nontrade functions depending on the nature of their assignment.

Within this  kind of organization, activities performed by persons in the offices that  support both goals could shift from trade to nontrade activities when  security threat levels are higher without actually seeing a reduction in the  number of staff dedicated to trade.

Due to the limited compliance sampling, CBP was unable to  calculate an overall trade compliance rate for fiscal year 2002.  Moreover, compliance measurement helps ensure the quality of trade  data, and unreliable trade data increase the risk that critical threats will  not be identified.", "In fiscal year 2003, 3 of 14 scheduled textile production verifications  were canceled when the national security alert level increased, so that  the verification teams could remain at their ports and field offices to  focus on security-related activities.

In January  2002, CBP also initiated the Container Security Initiative whereby CBP  officials are placed at strategic foreign seaports to screen cargo manifest  data for ocean containers to identify those that may hold weapons of mass  destruction. We reported in July 2003 that CBP had not taken adequate  steps to incorporate human capital planning, develop performance  measures, or plan strategically- - factors crucial to the programs\u2019 long-term  success and accountability.", "Initially, 10 officials were assigned to roll out the Customs-Trade  Partnership Against Terrorism. Under the program, companies enter into  partnership agreements with CBP and agree to self-assess their supply  chain security practices and document it in a security profile. These 10  officials provide guidance to companies on how to prepare their security  profiles as well as review the completed security profiles and prepare  feedback letters. As of May 2003, more than 3,300 agreements had been  signed, 1,837 security profiles reviewed, and 1,105 feedback letters  prepared. However, early on CBP realized that it did not have a cadre of  staff with the skills necessary to conduct site visits to observe supply  chain practices and make substantive recommendations for improving  security. In October 2002, CBP began the process of developing a new  position, called \u201csupply chain specialists,\u201d to review company security  profiles, visit companies to validate information contained in the security  profiles, and develop action plans that identify supply chain vulnerabilities  and the corrective steps companies need to take. CBP was authorized to  hire more than 150 supply chain specialists and expected to hire 40 supply  chain specialists in fiscal year 2003. As of October 2003, CBP has visited  more than 130 companies to verify their supply chain security practices.  While CBP officials acknowledged the importance of human capital  planning, they said they had not been able to devote resources to  developing a human capital plan that outlines how the program will  increase its staff 15-fold and implement program elements that require  specialized training.", "The Container Security Initiative seeks to deploy 120-150 inspectors,  intelligence research analysts, and agents to 30 overseas ports by the end  of fiscal year 2004. CBP eventually plans to expand to 40 to 45 ports.  Deploying four-to-five person CSI teams to foreign ports will be a  complex, multiyear task. CBP seeks candidates with specialized skills  needed to review cargo manifest data and identify suspicious containers  for inspection as well as diplomatic and language skills to interact with  their foreign counterparts. While CBP officials told us that they did not  experience significant difficulties in finding qualified staff to fill their  short-term human capital needs from among the pool of existing CBP  employees, CBP had only 12 ports up and running under the Container  Security Initiative at that time (May 2003). In addition, the teams were on  120-day temporary duty assignments; however, CBP plans to create 2- to 3- year assignments to replace the 120-day temporary duty assignments. In  spite of the potential challenges CBP could face, CSI officials had not  devised a systematic human capital plan.", "To help ensure that the Container Security Initiative and the Customs- Trade Partnership Against Terrorism achieve their objectives as they  transition from smaller start-up programs to larger programs with an  increasingly greater share of the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s  budget, we recommended in July 2003 that CBP develop human capital  plans that clearly describe how these programs will recruit, train, and  retain staff to meet their growing demands as they expand to other  countries and implement new program elements. Human capital plans are  particularly important given the unique operating environments and  personnel requirements of the two programs. According to CBP officials,  the professional and personal relationships that supply chain specialists  and the Container Security Initiative teams build with their clients over  time will be critical to the long-term success of both programs. For  example, the success of the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism  will depend, in large part, on the supply chain specialists\u2019 ability to  persuade companies to voluntarily adopt their recommendations.  Similarly, a key benefit of the Container Security Initiative is the ability of  CBP officials to work with foreign counterparts to obtain sensitive  information that enhances their targeting of high-risk containers at foreign  ports.

According to Commerce officials,  bringing all advisors together at the same time will facilitate a higher level  of representation of U.S. trade negotiators at the meetings and that, as a  result, trade advisors will be better informed about ongoing negotiations.  In turn, the officials said, trade advisors should be better prepared to  deliberate on issues of interest to them and thus better able to provide  advice to U.S. trade negotiators.", "In addition, the agencies revised their process for clearing proposed new  members, thus reducing the amount of time it takes for clearance.  Moreover, a secure Web site has been established that allows members to  review the texts of draft trade negotiating documents. In addition, the  Assistant U.S. Trade Representative for Public Liaison now holds a  monthly teleconference with the chairmen of all committees. During this  call, USTR provides feedback to committees on previously raised areas of  concern or recommendations, discusses USTR\u2019s long-term negotiating  calendar to highlight upcoming issues, and is open to discussion of general  issues or concerns. According to Commerce and USTR officials, they have  taken these actions without increasing the size of their authorized staffs.  However, it was noted that Commerce staff, who did much of the  implementing work on this issue, sometimes put in long hours in  completing their tasks. In addition, in the case of Commerce, a position  that had been vacant was filled, thus increasing the actual number of staff.", "While administering the trade advisory committee system is only one of  many functions that trade agencies perform, the system does provide an  important forum for candid discussion of trade negotiating topics with a  wide range of private sector experts. Our review found that the system has  not realized its potential, however, and that lack of administrative support  was one of the reasons for this situation. While the agencies have taken  actions to improve the trade advisory committee structure and its  management, these kinds of improvements illustrate how U.S. trade  agencies need to utilize human capital strategies that anticipate and  respond to shifts in global market forces.

Economic and financial reforms have  introduced market forces into China, and privileges accorded state-owned  firms are gradually being removed. However, the transition from a state- controlled economy to a market-driven one is far from complete.  According to USTR, reforms have been particularly difficult in sectors that  traditionally relied upon substantial state subsidies as the central  government continues to protect noncompetitive or emerging sectors of  the economy from foreign competition. Moreover, USTR said, provincial  and lower-level governments have strongly resisted reforms that would  eliminate sheltered markets for local enterprises or reduce jobs and  revenues in their jurisdictions, inhibiting the central government\u2019s ability  to implement trade reforms. During 2003, the Commerce Department  held more than 20 roundtable discussions with U.S. manufacturers, both  large and small, across the United States and heard similar complaints.  According to Commerce\u2019s under secretary for the International Trade  Administration, no foreign country raised more attention as a source of  concern than China. Manufacturers complained about rampant piracy of  intellectual property, forced transfer of technology from firms launching  joint ventures in China, a broad range of trade barriers, and capital  markets that are largely insulated from free-market pressures.", "Another issue concerns the Chinese government\u2019s decade-long practice of  pegging the Chinese yuan to the dollar as a means, according to Chinese  officials, of fostering economic stability, the absence of which could hurt  its export industries and political stability. In order to maintain this fixed  exchange rate, the government has had to intervene in the foreign  exchange market and, according to Treasury officials, recently intervened  very heavily to prevent the yuan from appreciating against the dollar.  Considerable debate has occurred among experts and observers about  whether China\u2019s intervention to maintain a lower-valued yuan is having a  negative effect on U.S. manufacturers. This issue has been the subject of  numerous congressional hearings with administration witnesses and was  also a topic of discussion between Presidents Bush and Hu Jintao at the  October 2003 Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Economic Leaders\u2019  Meeting and during the Secretary of the Treasury\u2019s September 2003 trip to  China. Also in September, the Group of Seven finance ministers issued a  statement favoring more flexibility in exchange rates for large economies.  In an October 30, 2003, report to the Congress, the Treasury Department  concluded that no major trading partner of the United States was  manipulating the rate of exchange between its currency and the U.S. dollar  for the purposes of preventing effective balance of payments adjustments  or gaining unfair competitive advantage in international trade. However,  the report also found that China\u2019s fixed exchange rate was not appropriate  for a major economy like China and should be changed. According to the  Treasury, the Chinese government has indicated it will move to a flexible  exchange rate regime but believes taking immediate action would harm its  banking system and overall economy.", "The growing importance of the Chinese economy for the United States has  been a particular focus of attention from U.S. officials due to the  implications for U.S. firms and for compliance with trade agreements.

Almost 40 officials,  representing 14 departments and executive offices, participate in this  subcommittee. The subcommittee was very active in 2002, meeting 11  times.

USTR officials sought to delineate tasks related to  carrying out their monitoring action plan in China; Washington, D.C.; and  Geneva (the WTO\u2019s headquarters), including expectations for information  gathering, reporting, and setting initial priorities. Finally, USTR officials  undertook several activities at the beginning of the year to educate  themselves on China\u2019s WTO obligations. This was important, because  monitoring these obligations entailed new or expanded responsibilities for  officials in the field, and many of the Washington-based officials were  relatively new to their current jobs.

In some areas, failure to sufficiently plan the  human capital approach, such as the CBP programs to secure the global  supply chain, show that the success of the programs is not assured in the  absence of human capital planning. In other cases, such as the U.S.\u2019s  ambitious trade negotiating agenda, human capital resources may be a  constraint on the ability of the trade agencies to carry out their  negotiations at the multilateral, regional, bilateral, and subregional level.  Finally, the array of shifting global forces described in some of our recent  studies also demonstrates the implications for U.S. trade agency activities  and, in many cases, the agencies\u2019 human capital activities. For example, in  the case of the rapid growth of China in the world economy and its WTO  accession agreement, the demand for specialized expertise and focus on  issues related to China\u2019s economy have led to growth in personnel and  efforts to reorganize to meet these new monitoring and compliance  challenges.", "As your Subcommittee has stressed in its guidance and hearings regarding  other parts of the federal government, agencies must constantly reevaluate  their human capital strategies to adapt and even anticipate major shifts in  their environment.
