Then, in 1998, the U.S. Congress passed the Workforce Investment Act (WIA), seeking to create a system connecting employment, education, and training services to better match job seekers to labor market needs. WIA specifies separate funding sources for each of the act\u2019s main client groups\u2014adults, youths, and dislocated workers. In general, dislocated workers are those who have been laid off and are unlikely to return to their previous employment. During program year 2000, the Congress appropriated about $950 million to provide services to adults, $1.2 billion to provide services to youths, and $1.6 billion to assist states in providing services to some of the 3.3 million people laid off from their jobs each year. The dislocated worker program under WIA has taken on increased importance because the economy, which had entered a recession in March of 2001, took a sharper downturn with the loss of an estimated 415,000 jobs during the month following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001\u2014the largest employment decrease in a single month in more than 20 years.", "When WIA replaced the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA), it changed the definition of who is targeted for services and the way that the services are funded and delivered. The new legislation introduced a greater degree of state and local flexibility that allows training and employment programs to be designed and managed at the local level to meet the unique needs of local businesses and individuals. Under WIA, states can set aside up to 25 percent of their dislocated worker allotment to provide \u201crapid response\u201d to layoffs and plant closings. States can also set aside up to 15 percent of their dislocated worker allotment and combine these funds with similar  funds from their adult and youth allotments to support a variety of other  statewide activities. States allocate the remainder of the dislocated worker  funds to local workforce areas. Because states did not implement many of  WIA\u2019s provisions until July 1, 2000, little information has been available on  how WIA changed the way that services are provided to dislocated  workers.

One survey focused on  how states used dislocated worker set-aside funds for rapid response  activities, and the other survey focused on how states used combined set- aside funds from the adult, youth, and dislocated worker programs. We  received 50 responses to each survey. We also visited six states  (California, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, and Minnesota)  that provided variety in terms of program year 2000 funding, number of  dislocated workers, and geographic dispersion. Within each state, we  visited two local workforce areas, except in California where we visited  four areas. We judgmentally selected these workforce areas to represent a  range of funding amounts and urban and rural areas. We also interviewed,  either in person or by telephone, state officials and representatives of the  local Workforce Investment Boards in each local area that we visited.

A dislocated worker is an individual who  (1) has been terminated or laid off, or who has received a notice of  termination or layoff, from employment; is eligible for, or has exhausted  entitlement to, unemployment insurance or is not eligible but has been  employed for a sufficient duration to demonstrate attachment to the  workforce; and is unlikely to return to previous industry or occupation;  (2) has been terminated or laid off, or has received a notice of termination  or layoff, from employment as a result of any permanent plant closure of,  or substantial layoff at, a plant, facility, or enterprise; (3) was self  employed but is unemployed as a result of general economic conditions in  the community in which the individual resides or because of natural  disasters; or (4) is a displaced homemaker.", "The secretary of Labor retains 20 percent of the dislocated worker funds  in a national reserve account to be used for emergency grants,  demonstrations, and technical assistance and allots the remaining funds to  each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico according  to a specific formula. The formula, first adopted in 1982 under the Job  Training Partnership Act, was grandfathered into the dislocated worker  program under WIA. According to the formula, of the total funds that  Labor allots to the states, one-third is based on each of the following:  the number of unemployed in the state compared with the total number of  unemployed in all states,  the number of excess unemployed in the state compared with the total  number of excess unemployed in all states (i.e., the number of  unemployed greater than 4.5 percent of the total civilian labor force in  each state), and  the number of individuals unemployed for 15 weeks or more in the state  compared with the number of individuals unemployed for 15 weeks or  more in all states.", "Upon receiving its allotment, each state can reserve no more than 25  percent of its dislocated worker funds to provide \u201crapid response\u201d services  to workers affected by layoffs and plant closings. The funds set aside by  the states to provide rapid response services are intended to help  dislocated workers transition quickly to new employment. In its  regulations, Labor divides rapid response activities into the following  three categories:  Required services. These include immediate and on-site contact with the  employer experiencing layoffs as well as with employee representatives to  assess the needs of affected workers and to provide information to the  affected workers about unemployment insurance (UI) and other services.", "Optional services. These include developing programs for layoff aversion  and incumbent worker training and for analyzing economic dislocation  data.", "Additional assistance. This includes providing aid to local areas that are  experiencing increased unemployment, to pay for direct services such as  training.", "Under WIA regulations, each state is required to have a rapid response unit  with responsibility for rapid response services. The staff in these units may  deliver services directly by providing orientations or workshops for  dislocated workers, or they may supervise the provision of such services.  In the latter capacity, the state unit staff would assign the delivery of direct  services to other personnel such as local area staff or private contractors.", "In addition to the dislocated worker funds that are set aside for rapid  response, WIA allows states to set aside up to 15 percent of their  dislocated worker allotment to support statewide activities other than  rapid response. These may include a variety of activities that benefit  adults, youths, and dislocated workers statewide, such as providing  assistance in the establishment and operation of one-stop centers,  developing or operating state or local management information systems,  and disseminating lists of organizations that can provide training. WIA also  permits states to combine the set-aside from the dislocated worker  allotment with similar set-asides from their adult and youth allotments.  After states set aside funds for rapid response and for other statewide  activities, they allocate the remainder of the funds\u2014at least 60 percent\u2014  to their local workforce areas. Approximately 600 local workforce areas  exist throughout the nation to provide services to dislocated workers.", "When the Congress passed WIA in 1998, the dislocated worker program  was changed in ways that have important implications for dislocated  workers. Unlike JTPA, WIA ensured that some job search and placement  assistance is offered to anyone who seeks it, whether or not he or she is  eligible for the dislocated worker program. WIA also created three  sequential levels of service\u2014core, intensive, and training. In order to move  from the core level to the intensive level and from the intensive level to  training, an individual must be unable to obtain a job that allows him or  her to become self sufficient.", "Under WIA, the initial core services\u2014including job search and placement  assistance, the provision of labor market information, and preliminary  assessment of skills and needs\u2014are available to everyone, whether or not  he or she is a dislocated worker. If a dislocated worker is determined to be  unable to find a job or has a job that does not lead to self-sufficiency after  core services, he or she can receive intensive services, which include  comprehensive assessments, development of an individual employment  plan, case management, and short-term prevocational services. A  dislocated worker cannot receive intensive services until he or she is  officially registered in the program. A dislocated worker who is  determined to be unable to find a job leading to self sufficiency after  intensive services can move on to training. At this level, a dislocated  worker can receive occupational skills training, on-the-job training, and  customized training."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "With Greater Flexibility, Local Workforce Areas Tailored Services to Meet Dislocated Worker Needs", "paragraphs": ["With the greater flexibility granted by WIA, local workforce areas are  likely to offer services tailored to local needs and services that emphasize  a quick return to employment.

This meant that  more individuals returned to work before being registered in the  dislocated worker program. Thus, fewer dislocated workers were  registered in the program and fewer were enrolled in training.

At this two-hour orientation, benefits  and requirements specific to dislocated workers were described and  counselors met one-on-one with interested workers for more in-depth  needs assessments and strategy development. Unlike other local areas that  we visited, this area had two staff members who were responsible for  providing a range of services only to dislocated workers.", "Another local area in California established a separate career resource  program to assist the area\u2019s professional workers who have been  dislocated and employers seeking qualified job applicants in areas such as  software development, biotechnology, communications, and human  resources. The program, tailored to professional and high-tech dislocated  workers, provided the dislocated workers with their own one-stop center  where job information and computers were available. In addition, regular  meetings were held to share information on job leads and career fairs as  well as for moral support. This program also had its own Web site where  participating dislocated workers could post their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s.

The program focused on entry-level information technology and  telecommunication jobs and, to date, has established training programs for  Web developers and cable technicians. This same local area also  developed a career transition workshop to help dislocated workers cope  emotionally with being laid off and plan for the future.", "A local area in Louisiana facing a major plant closing tailored a program to  meet the needs of the 1,300 workers being laid off.

Some  local officials have interpreted WIA\u2019s requirements as supporting a work- first philosophy. In four of the local areas we visited, officials required  individuals to spend a certain amount of time or perform a specific  number of tasks related to finding employment before registering in the  dislocated worker program and receiving additional services. In its March  2001 Status of WIA Readiness Implementation Report, Labor  acknowledged that many local areas have adopted some form of a work- first approach to the delivery of services that stresses the importance of a  quick entry or reentry into the workforce. Officials from several of the  local areas that we visited confirmed that they viewed WIA as a work-first  program that emphasizes returning dislocated workers to the workforce.  For example, a counselor from a local area in Massachusetts told us that if  a client has a marketable skill, he or she must reenter the workforce  regardless of any desire for training for a career change.", "Unlike JTPA, which required that an individual be enrolled as a participant  before receiving any services, WIA requires the provision of core services  to all adults who seek them, regardless of program eligibility. All of the  one-stop centers that we visited had a resource area where individuals  could access labor market information, review job openings, create  r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, and even attend some workshops, with topics such as  interviewing techniques, without registering for the dislocated worker  program. Some local program officials believe that many individuals found  employment through these core services and that they therefore did not go  on to seek other services that would have required program registration.  Because program participation is not recorded before receipt of these  preliminary services, the total number of people who used them and found  employment is not known. Collectively, the 14 locations that we visited  registered nearly 3,000 fewer dislocated workers during the first year of  WIA than they had registered under JTPA during the previous program  year (5,603 vs. 8,462). Of these locations, eight registered fewer dislocated  workers under WIA and six registered more dislocated workers (see fig.1).", "Officials from the local workforce areas that registered more dislocated  workers under WIA than during the previous year under JTPA cited  various reasons for the increase. For example, officials from two local  workforce areas said that they had more dislocated worker funds available  in program year 2000 and thus were able to provide services to more  workers, while another official said that the local workforce area  experienced several plant closings that resulted in more workers\u2019 needing  assistance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "In Some Local Workforce Areas, Fewer Dislocated Workers Received Training", "paragraphs": ["Under WIA, the 14 local workforce areas that we visited enrolled 52  percent fewer dislocated workers in training than they had enrolled under  JTPA.

Of these areas, nine enrolled fewer dislocated workers and five  enrolled an equal or greater number of dislocated workers in training  under WIA (see fig. 2).", "The decrease in the percentage of dislocated workers entering training is  tied to local requirements that dislocated workers spend a certain amount  of time receiving services or complete a certain number of tasks before  being enrolled in training. Although the act requires individuals to receive  sequential services, Labor has not imposed a required minimum period of  participation in the core or intensive services, leaving this decision instead  to the discretion of local workforce boards. Four local areas have set  requirements for the amount of time or the number of tasks that a  dislocated worker must complete at each level of service before he or she  can move to the next level. Officials in three of these areas required  dislocated workers to spend at least three weeks searching for a job and  documenting their attempts at finding employment. Officials in the fourth  local area required dislocated workers to complete a certain number of  tasks, such as documenting 12 unsuccessful job applications or five case  management appointments, before moving to the next level of service.", "The decrease in the percentage of dislocated workers being trained is also  tied to the wages of the jobs they may be offered during the job search  required before training. The receipt of future services\u2014specifically,  training\u2014hinges on a dislocated worker\u2019s ability to find a job leading to  self-sufficiency. Only those who are unable to find such a job can continue  to training. Among the locations we visited, self-sufficiency was defined  differently. Because the definition, within certain parameters, is left to the  discretion of state or local workforce boards, the dislocated workers who  are allowed to continue to training vary from area to area. For example, a  local area in Maryland defined self-sufficiency as having a job that pays  $8.50 per hour, while a local area in Louisiana had recently increased its  self-sufficiency standard to having a job that pays $16.39 per hour. Three  other local areas we visited had no set standard at all.

Several officials in the states and  local workforce areas that we visited voiced a need for more guidance.  They said that they felt uncertain about when individuals should be  registered into the dislocated worker program, how to determine when  training is an appropriate service strategy, and how to use rapid response  funds to provide additional assistance to local workforce areas. For  example, a rapid response official in the state of Maryland told us that he  would like additional guidance from Labor concerning the extent to which  a state could use rapid response funds to provide additional assistance to  local workforce areas experiencing layoffs. Labor\u2019s guidance, however,  does not adequately address this issue. In addition, WIA created a new  mindset for workforce development professionals and makes substantial  changes in how dislocated workers receive services. Unlike the more  prescriptive dislocated worker program under JTPA, state and local  workforce officials must continually interpret WIA\u2019s requirements in order  to meet the constantly changing needs of the workers and employers they  serve. However, all local workforce officials were not prepared to meet  this challenge. For example, Labor\u2019s February 2001 final interim report on  the early state and local progress toward WIA implementation noted that  state and local workforce officials would like to have more guidance on  how to interpret the requirements of the act.", "Labor has provided guidance and technical assistance to aid state and  local workforce officials in transitioning from JTPA to WIA ranging from  training sessions conducted by headquarters and regional office staff to  the dissemination of guidance concerning WIA\u2019s technical requirements.  This guidance, in addition to information about best practices, is generally  available via the Internet. According to some workforce officials, however,  Labor\u2019s guidance has generally been too broad for them to use when  implementing WIA\u2019s requirements and the information available on the  Internet is often outdated. According to Labor officials, the guidance that  it has provided to state and local workforce officials on a range of WIA  topics has been intentionally nonprescriptive to allow state and local  workforce officials to use the flexibility that the act allows to design  programs that will accomplish state and locally established goals.", "Despite Labor\u2019s efforts to provide state and local workforce officials with  program guidance, misunderstandings still exist concerning some of WIA\u2019s  dislocated worker program requirements.

Most states, however, have not changed the way they provide  rapid response services since implementing WIA. During program year  2000, state set-aside obligations for rapid response averaged 12 percent  and ranged from less than 1 percent to the maximum allowable 25 percent.  When providing rapid response, most states responded primarily to layoffs  and plant closings affecting at least 50 workers and provided, at a  minimum, basic informational services for affected workers. Many states  also offered other services such as group workshops on job search and  used a portion of their rapid response funds to provide additional  assistance to local areas experiencing an increase in unemployment. In  addition, as allowed by the act, most states combined funds from the 15- percent dislocated worker set-aside with set-aside funds from the adult  and youth programs to support a variety of statewide activities and  programs.

On average,  these states obligated about 12 percent of their dislocated worker funds  for rapid response activities. Appendix II shows each state\u2019s dislocated  worker allotment and the amount obligated for rapid response activities.", "Any rapid response funds not used in program year 2000, up to the 25- percent ceiling, could be distributed to local areas or carried over to the  following program year to conduct rapid response activities.

Forty-five of the 50 states  that responded to our survey had a rapid response unit consisting of state  employees who delivered at least some direct services to the workers  being laid off. Almost all of these state units contacted employers  experiencing layoffs to explain available rapid response services and  provided orientations for workers being laid off. State staff often delivered  these services in conjunction with local area staff. In the six states that we  visited, orientation sessions provided information to workers on topics  such as UI benefits, services available at the local one-stop centers, and  training opportunities. In many states, services in addition to orientation  are also available to dislocated workers. These services, including group  workshops on topics such as job search and stress management and one- on-one meetings to discuss subjects such as financial planning, were  provided usually by local area staff but sometimes in conjunction with the  state unit or private contractors, such as unions (see fig. 4).", "Rapid response units in some states were more involved in providing  direct services after a layoff than were units in other states. For example,  in Florida, the state rapid response unit provided a broader range of  services than did the units of most other states. The Florida unit directly  provided workshops and one-on-one meetings in addition to general  informational services. In Maryland, as in many states, the state unit  played a more limited role. The Maryland unit contacted employers  experiencing layoffs and participated, along with staff from local one-stop  centers, in orientations for the affected workers. Any services beyond the  orientations, including workshops and one-on-one meetings at the work- sites, were provided exclusively by local staff. Louisiana had a state unit  that met with employers and conducted orientations but provided no other  direct services. To supplement the additional services provided by its local  areas, Louisiana contracted with a private agency to provide workshops  on topics such as r\u00e9sum\u00e9 development and stress management for  dislocated workers around the state. A state official explained that  Louisiana hired this agency because some local areas that experience  significant layoffs infrequently lack the experience to provide effective  rapid response services.", "Five of the 50 states that responded to our survey delegated all  responsibility for direct rapid response services to staff in the local  workforce areas. For example, California had a state unit that informed  local areas of impending layoffs but delivered no direct services. The state  distributed a portion of its rapid response funds to the local areas to  provide direct services. State officials believed that the state\u2019s size and  diversity made local flexibility more feasible than a single, uniform  approach. Another advantage, according to a local official, was that  referrals of workers from rapid response units to one-stop centers were  smoother because rapid response staff were also local area staff. While the  state stressed local flexibility, it also encouraged coordination among local  areas that share a labor market. Ten local areas in northern California  were collaborating to standardize their rapid response services, provide  services jointly, and possibly contract with a private agency for all rapid  response. New York was another state where local workforce area staff  were generally responsible for delivering rapid response services. Unlike  California, however, New York did not provide the local workforce areas  with funding for these services. New York also had a $1 million contract  with representatives of organized labor to provide rapid response  assistance when their union members were affected by a layoff.", "Most states provided rapid response primarily for larger layoffs and plant  closings affecting 50 or more workers. Responding to layoffs of 50 or more  workers appears to be related to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining  Notification (WARN) Act of 1988, which requires companies with 100 or  more full-time employees to notify state dislocated-worker staff of layoffs  and plant closures generally affecting 50 or more full-time workers. Of the  45 states using state staff to provide rapid response services, staff in 37  states generally provided rapid response services for layoffs affecting 50 or  more workers, which, on average, represented 75 percent of the layoffs to  which each state unit responded during program year 2000. Workers  affected by dislocation events that are too small to trigger state unit  involvement may nonetheless receive local rapid response services. In  fact, almost all of the states that had a trigger for state rapid response said  that local staff in their states may have provided rapid response services  for layoffs and plant closings that were too small to trigger rapid response  by the state unit.", "Illinois and Massachusetts illustrate different approaches to the use of a  trigger for state unit response. Illinois obligated about $2.4 million for  rapid response and had a unit of state employees that was responsible for  rapid response services statewide. These employees provided direct  services for all layoffs and closures affecting 50 or more workers and  responded to 170 such events during program year 2000. Some local  workforce areas provided rapid response services for dislocation events  affecting fewer than 50 workers, but the state did not require them to serve  these smaller events and did not distribute any rapid response funds to  them for this purpose. On the other hand, Massachusetts obligated about  $1.2 million for rapid response and had a unit of state employees that  attempted to provide rapid response for all layoffs regardless of size.  During program year 2000, the unit responded to 158 events affecting 50 or  more workers and 149 events affecting fewer than 50 workers.", "In addition to providing direct rapid response services to workers affected  by a layoff or plant closing, 32 states said that they used a portion of their  rapid response set-aside funds to provide additional assistance to local  areas that experienced an increase in unemployment owing to plant  closings or mass layoffs. In the states for which data were available, more  than half of the $129.6 million that these states set aside for rapid response  was used to provide additional assistance to local workforce areas (see  app. II). Of the 32 states responding that provided additional assistance, 15  states said that they provided additional assistance to local areas only to  help them address specific layoffs and required that local areas spend the  funds exclusively on workers affected by those layoffs. For example,  Maryland provided $250,000 in additional assistance to one local  workforce area that intended to provide training to a small number of  workers laid off from a bottled water plant, and Louisiana provided  $72,531 in additional assistance to a local workforce area to set up a  worker transition center at a clothing plant that was closing. Another eight  states said that they provided additional assistance to local areas that  experienced a general rise in unemployment and did not tie the use of the  funds to specific layoffs. For example, California provided $3 million in  additional assistance to a local workforce area to provide comprehensive  services for its dislocated workers in a region with high job turnover. Nine  other states said that they awarded funds for both rapid response and  additional assistance during program year 2000.", "Thirty of the 50 states responding to our survey have not changed the way  they provide rapid response since implementing WIA. The remaining 20  states reported making changes in the way they provide rapid response as  a result of WIA, but few of these changes were significant and none were  required by the act or the regulations. The more significant changes  involved giving the state unit greater responsibility for direct services or  developing new programs to distribute set-aside funds to local workforce  areas. For example, Washington state and Kansas assigned state staff to  each local workforce area to coordinate and deliver rapid response  services. Also, Indiana developed a program to quickly distribute  additional funds within one or two days to local workforce areas  experiencing mass layoffs to help them provide rapid response services.  Other changes included increasing coordination between the state rapid  response unit and other workforce partners, changing the focus of  orientations from training benefits to available job search services, and  shifting state units from one state department to another. (See table 1.)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States Used Set-Aside Funds to Support a Wide Range of Services and Various Programs", "paragraphs": ["During program year 2000, most states took advantage of the flexibility  under WIA and combined dislocated worker set-aside funds with set-aside  funds from the adult and youth programs to support a variety of statewide  activities. Some activities, such as developing or operating a statewide  management information system, benefited dislocated workers along with  other types of workers such as adults and youths; other activities, such as  career training for at-risk youths, benefited a specific segment of the  population who were not dislocated workers.", "During program year 2000, states used their set-aside funds for statewide  activities for various purposes. Under WIA, states can set aside up to 15  percent of their dislocated worker allotment to support some required  statewide workforce investment activities. These activities include  providing additional assistance to local areas that have high  concentrations of eligible youths, assisting in the establishment and  operation of one-stop center systems, disseminating a list of eligible  providers of training services, and operating a management information  system. In addition, the act allows states to use the funds for other  allowable activities such as state administration, research and  demonstration projects, and innovative incumbent worker training  programs (i.e., programs to improve the skills of employed workers). Of  the 50 states responding to our survey, 43 said that they combined set- aside funds for statewide activities from the dislocated worker allotment  with similar funds from the adult and youth programs. Appendix III lists  each state\u2019s allotment for their adult, youth, and dislocated worker  programs and identifies the maximum amount of funds that could be set  aside to support statewide activities. As allowed by the act, these states  combined the funds and used them for a variety of purposes. For example,  41 states reported that they spent, on average, 25.7 percent of the  combined set-aside funds on carrying out general state-level administrative  activities, while 37 states reported spending, on average, 14.8 percent on  assisting the establishment and operation of one-stop centers (see table 2).", "Several states are using the flexibility that WIA provides by spending the  majority of their combined set-aside funds on a single activity. For  example, Virginia spent over half of its $5.8 million combined set-aside  funds to operate a fiscal and management accountability information  system. Missouri used over half of its $6.7 million combined set-aside  funds to assist in the establishment and operation of one-stop centers.  Iowa used nearly two-thirds of approximately $900,000 of its combined  set-aside funds to carry out general state-level administrative activities.  Appendix IV shows the percentage of combined set-aside funds that the 43  states dedicated to each activity listed in table 2.", "In addition to funding the required and optional activities identified in the  act, 30 states funded other activities. Many of these activities were  directed to programs that benefit a specific group. For example, Arizona  used about 4 percent of its $6.6 million combined set-aside funds for older  worker training and support, Kentucky used about 19 percent of its $6.4  million combined set-aside funds for statewide youth programs, and  Montana used about 5 percent of its $2.2 million combined set-aside funds  for adult literacy and education.", "Several of the states that we visited used the flexibility provided by the act  to fund projects that the states determined were most in need of additional  funding. In many instances, these projects were targeted to specific  groups. For example, of its $63 million combined set-aside, California  spent $6 million on a project to train veterans, $15 million on a project to  train caregivers who work with the aging and disabled population, and $20  million to provide job training to targeted groups including at-risk  pregnant teens, homeless individuals, noncustodial parents, and farm  workers. Similarly, Illinois spent $1.3 million of its $13 million set-aside to  help individuals obtain their high school general equivalency diploma over  the Internet; Louisiana spent $1.5 million of its $10 million set-aside on  services for UI claimants who were projected to exhaust their UI benefits  (the projection is known as UI profiling); Maryland spent $330,000 of its $6  million set-aside to train at-risk youths for a career in the merchant marine  service."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Funding Formula Is Problematic", "paragraphs": ["The dislocated worker funding formula distributes funds that vary  dramatically from year to year and that do not recognize fluctuations in  state dislocated worker populations. State and local officials said that the  volatility in the allotment of formula funds could limit the ability of some  states to provide basic program services to dislocated workers. Without  stable funding levels that are tied to the number of dislocated workers,  states are unable to conduct the meaningful long- or short-term financial  planning that is necessary to develop and deliver high-quality services for  dislocated workers. Information obtained from Labor on state allotments  between program years 1997 and 2001 also raises concerns about the  performance of the current funding formula (see app. V for a detailed  listing of the dislocated workers funding formula allotments by state).  Many states have experienced very substantial changes in funding from  one year to the next over this time period. For example, Mississippi\u2019s  funding for program year 2001, increased nearly 130 percent over that for  program year 2000 (from $13.4 million to $30.7 million), while Arkansas\u2019s  funding dropped by more than 40 percent (from $12.4 million to $7.1  million). Figure 5 displays the ten states with the largest percentage  changes in dislocated worker funding allotments between program years  2000 and 2001. Such changes, which do not seem to be in proportion to the  number of dislocated workers in a state, appear to corroborate concerns  raised by state officials regarding the volatility of the current formula.", "The dislocated worker funding formula consists of three factors, each of  which determines one-third of the allotment given to a state. None of the  three factors is directly related to the dislocation activity in a state. Two  parts of this funding formula, however, contribute to the fluctuations in  state funding of the dislocated worker program. An analysis of the funding  formula reveals the primary cause of funding fluctuations to be the result  of the parts of the formula that incorporate the number of excess  unemployed (exceeding 4.5 percent of the total labor force) and the  number of long-term unemployed.", "The number of excess unemployed displayed an extremely high degree of  volatility during the 1997 2001 time period. For example, in program year  1997, 36 states had unemployment rates above 4.5 percent and therefore  qualified for funding under this part of the formula. By program year 2001,  only 13 states continued to receive funding under this part of the formula.  Thus, as economic conditions improve, the number of states receiving  funding under this part of the formula decreases (see fig. 6).", "The decline in the number of states that received funding under this part  of the formula, in combination with increased funding during this period,  resulted in more funding for states that received funds under this part of  the formula; states falling below the 4.5 percent threshold saw their  allotments reduced substantially. In program year 1997, $345 million was  allotted among 36 states, for an average of $9.5 million per state. By  program year 2001, $424 million was allotted to 13 states, resulting in an  average allotment of $32.6 million per state. The nearly 130 percent  increase in funding between program years 2000 and 2001, reported for  Mississippi in figure 5, was largely the result of a two-thirds reduction in  the number of states that received funding under this criterion.", "This volatility in funding will likely persist as unemployment rates rise in  response to the current economic slowdown. Rising unemployment in the  future means that more states will again qualify for funding based on the  excess unemployment criterion and that even as their own unemployment  increases, the 13 states will likely experience substantial funding losses as  more states become eligible for funding based on this criterion.", "In addition to the number of excess unemployed, the number of long-term  unemployed also contributed to the fluctuations in program funding for  individual states. For example, the allotments for long-term unemployed in  Minnesota declined by more than 20 percent in program year 2000 and  increased by more than 50 percent the following year. In New Hampshire,  the pattern was the opposite: an increase of more than 85 percent was  followed by a decline of nearly 45 percent (see fig. 7). The funding  fluctuation introduced by the number of long-term unemployed is  particularly problematic in that the number of long-term unemployed is  not necessarily indicative of the number of dislocated workers in a state,  because individuals can be unemployed for 15 weeks or more and not  have been laid off. Furthermore, the long-term unemployed are no longer  included under the definition of a dislocated worker and are therefore not  automatically eligible for the dislocated worker program.", "The high degree of volatility in formula allotments has resulted in  increasingly wide disparities in funding across states. In program year  1997, both Texas and Mississippi received the same funding per  unemployed resident. However, because Texas became ineligible for  funding based on excess unemployment in 2001, its funding per  unemployed resident dropped slightly, while Mississippi (one of the  thirteen states still eligible) saw its funding jump more than three-fold. As  shown in figure 8, the program year 2001 funding per unemployed  individual in Mississippi was three times higher than in Texas, even though  in program year 1997, the funding per unemployed individual was nearly  identical. (See table 11 in app. V for a complete listing of each state\u2019s  funding per unemployed resident for program years 1997 through 2001.)", "When the Congress passed WIA in 1998, it mandated that the secretary of  Labor undertake a study to improve the formula for the adult program.  This mandate includes the study of the formula used to allot adult program  funds to the states and of the formula used to allocate these funds within  the states. The study has been completed but has not yet been released.  The mandate did not address the formula for allocating dislocated worker  program funds."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["WIA was passed with the intention of providing greater flexibility to states  and local workforce areas, but more detailed guidance could enable local  workforce areas to better use the act\u2019s flexibility. Clearly, WIA intends to  provide state and local areas with the flexibility to design programs that  meet the specific needs of dislocated workers in their areas. Given the  early stage of implementation, it is not surprising that some state and local  officials remain confused about how to put into practice some of the act\u2019s  new requirements, such as when to register individuals in the dislocated  worker program. Although Labor has provided broad guidance and  technical assistance to aid the transition from JTPA to WIA, some  workforce officials have stated that the guidance does not address specific  implementation concerns. Efforts to design flexible programs that meet  local needs could be enhanced if Labor addressed the concerns of  workforce officials with specific guidance regarding the act\u2019s  implementation and disseminated information on best practices in a timely  manner.", "Some states have trouble meeting the needs of their dislocated workers,  because the amount of dislocated worker funds they receive varies  dramatically from year to year and is not directly related to the states\u2019  dislocated worker populations. The fluctuation in funding is caused by a  three-part funding formula that incorporates factors that are no longer  relevant to the dislocated worker program, that are highly volatile from  year to year, and that do not reflect the number of dislocated workers in a  state.

We also  recommend that the secretary identify strategies for disseminating this  information in a timely manner. In particular, Labor should proactively identify areas that emerge as requiring additional guidance to  help state and local areas implement the dislocated worker program; disseminate guidance that is more responsive to the concerns of  workforce officials responsible for implementing the act\u2019s requirements,  including when to register individuals into the dislocated worker program  and how to provide additional assistance to local areas using rapid  response funds; and disseminate timely information on best practices being developed by local  areas to meet the needs of their dislocated workers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matter for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["We suggest that the Congress consider modifying the existing dislocated  worker funding formula to minimize funding volatility and to ensure that  dislocated worker funds are better distributed to states in relation to their  dislocated worker population.

Labor also recognizes that  registration guidance cannot be developed in isolation and must reflect the  complexities of WIA\u2019s performance accountability system. Regarding the  issue of guidance on the use of rapid response funds for additional  assistance, Labor said that a lack of guidance on this subject was not  identified previously in its implementation assessments or the  workgroups\u2019. Labor noted that the information in our report would allow  further exploration of this issue and a determination of whether federal  guidance is necessary on this topic.

It believes that resource allocation practices should  ensure that funds are distributed in a manner that puts resources where  they are most needed, and it acknowledged that because worker  dislocations take place after formula funds are allocated, available  resources do not always match need. Labor noted that it has initiated a  review of the WIA dislocated worker funding formula.
