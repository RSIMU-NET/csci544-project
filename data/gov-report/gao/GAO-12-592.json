Using IRS and FHA data, GAO identified Recovery Act recipients and compared them to federal tax debtors as of June 30, 2010. GAO reviewed relevant policies and interviewed agency officials and lenders. GAO also reviewed detailed IRS and FHA documents for a nonrepresentative selection of 18 individuals who received FHA mortgage insurance. These were selected based on a combination of factors, such as amount of taxes owed and number of delinquent tax periods. Due to data availability and other factors, GAO was able to completely evaluate only 8 of 18 individuals on their eligibility for FHA mortgage insurance.

Of these borrowers, 3,815 individuals claimed and received $27.4 million in Recovery Act First-Time Homebuyer Credits (FTHBC). This analysis includes tax debtors who (1) benefited from FHA\u0092s increased loan limits, or (2) claimed the FTHBCs and received FHA mortgage insurance of any value. Federal policy makes delinquent tax debtors ineligible for FHA mortgage insurance unless they repay their debt or are in a valid repayment agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), but the FTHBC, like all tax credits, was available to those who qualified, regardless of their tax debt. GAO could not determine the proportion of borrowers who were ineligible for FHA insurance because GAO could not systematically identify which of the 6,327 borrowers were in valid repayment agreements using the data GAO received from IRS. However, GAO did find that 5 of the 8 borrowers completely evaluated were ineligible because they were not in valid repayment agreements at the time they obtained FHA mortgage insurance. In addition, GAO found that Recovery Act borrowers with unpaid taxes had foreclosure rates two to three times greater than borrowers without unpaid taxes, which potentially represents an increased risk to FHA.", "Some ineligible tax debtors received FHA mortgage insurance, in part, due to shortcomings in the capacity of FHA-required documentation to identify tax debts, and shortcomings in other policies that lenders may misinterpret. Lenders must perform steps to identify an applicant\u0092s federal debt status, but sources commonly used, such as the loan application and credit report, do not reliably indicate an applicant\u0092s tax debt. Statutory restrictions generally prohibit the disclosure of taxpayer information, such as tax debt, without the taxpayer\u0092s consent. Lenders are already required to obtain such consent through an IRS form they use to validate the income of some applicants. This same form could also be used to obtain permission from applicants to obtain reliable tax-debt information directly from IRS, but doing so is not addressed in FHA policies. Requiring lenders to collect more reliable information on tax debts could better prevent ineligible tax debtors from obtaining FHA mortgage insurance. Further, FHA\u0092s policies requiring lenders to investigate whether tax liens indicate unresolved tax debt are unclear and may be misinterpreted. The lenders GAO spoke with believed they were in compliance with FHA\u0092s policies when they provided FHA-insured loans to applicants with tax liens and no repayment agreements, but FHA officials indicated otherwise.

The  Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated the Recovery Act\u2019s cost at  $825 billion as of August 2011. The Recovery Act included provisions to  help stimulate the housing market, including increasing loan limits for  FHA-insured mortgages in 669 high-cost counties in calendar year   The provision allowed FHA to insure mortgages at a higher  2009.amount than would have been authorized without the Recovery Act.  Under this provision, FHA insured over $20 billion in mortgages for  87,000 homeowners who were approved for FHA mortgage insurance in  2009. The Recovery Act also adapted and extended the FTHBC through  November 2009. Through July 3, 2010, IRS reported that about 1.7  million individuals claimed more than $12 billion in FTHBCs under the  Recovery Act for homes purchased in 2009. Office of Management and  Budget (OMB) Circular A-129 states that delinquent tax debtors are  ineligible for federal loan insurance, such as FHA mortgage insurance,  unless they repaid the debt or were in a valid repayment agreement with  IRS, but the FTHBC was available to those who qualified regardless of  their tax debt."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FHA Mortgage Insurance", "paragraphs": ["FHA\u2019s single-family programs insure private lenders against 100 percent  of the value of the loan for foreclosures on mortgages that meet FHA  criteria, including mortgages for initial home purchases, construction  rehabilitation, and refinancing. As of September 2011, almost 3,700  lenders were approved to participate in these programs. The insurance  covers the principal, interest, and associated foreclosure costs, among  other things. Lenders usually require mortgage insurance when a home  buyer makes a down payment of less than 20 percent of the value of the  home. FHA mortgage insurance allows a home buyer to make a modest  down payment\u2014as low as 3.5 percent\u2014and obtain a mortgage for the  balance of the purchase price. As the recent housing and economic  recession set in, FHA\u2019s share of the market for home purchase  mortgages grew sharply due to the contraction of other mortgage market  segments\u2014rising from about 5 percent in 2006 to nearly 30 percent in  2009. FHA insured almost 2 million single-family mortgages valued at  more than $300 billion in mortgage insurance in 2009. FHA generally is  thought to promote stability in the market by ensuring the availability of  mortgage credit in areas that may be underserved by the private sector or  that are experiencing economic downturns. It has played a particularly  large role among minority, lower-income, and first-time home buyers;  almost 80 percent of FHA-insured home purchase loans in 2010 went to  first-time home buyers.", "The FHA home mortgage insurance programs are funded by the FHA  Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMIF), which is supported by  insurance premiums charged to borrowers. The MMIF is used to cover  claims on foreclosed mortgages, among other things. The Omnibus  Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 required the Secretary of HUD to take  steps to ensure that the MMIF attained a capital ratio (i.e., economic  value divided by the unamortized insurance-in-force) of at least 2 percent  by November 2000 and maintain a 2 percent ratio at all times thereafter.The act also required an annual independent actuarial review of the  economic net worth and soundness of the MMIF. The actuarial review  estimates the economic value of the MMIF as well as the capital ratio to  determine whether the MMIF has met the capital standards in the act.  The capital ratio has dropped sharply in recent years due to declines in  home prices and increases in seriously delinquent loans and  foreclosures. The most recent actuarial study shows that the capital ratio  is currently below the statutorily mandated level, at 0.24 percent,  representing $2.6 billion in estimated capital resources against an active  portfolio of $1.08 trillion. The MMIF has historically been sufficient to  fund the FHA home mortgage insurance programs without additional  funding from the federal government, but if the reserve were to be  depleted, FHA would need to draw on permanent and indefinite budget  authority to cover additional increases in estimated losses. A weakening  in the performance of FHA-insured loans could increase the possibility  that FHA will require additional federal funds. Our work has previously  shown that the increased reliance on FHA mortgage insurance highlights  the need for FHA to ensure that it has the proper controls in place to  minimize financial risks to the federal government while meeting the  housing needs of borrowers.", "Lenders are responsible for underwriting the loans to determine an  applicant\u2019s eligibility for FHA mortgage insurance in accordance with FHA  policies. Underwriting is a risk analysis that uses information collected  during the loan origination process to decide whether to approve a loan  for FHA insurance. Lenders employ automated underwriting\u2014 the  process by which lenders enter information on potential borrowers into  electronic systems that contain an evaluative formula, or algorithm,  known as a scorecard. The scorecard attempts to quickly and objectively  measure the borrower\u2019s risk of default by examining data such as  application information and credit score. Since 2004, FHA has used its own scorecard called Technology Open to Approved Lenders (TOTAL).  FHA lenders now use TOTAL in conjunction with automated underwriting  systems to determine the likelihood of default. Although TOTAL can  assess the credit risk of a borrower, it does not reject a loan outright.  Rather, TOTAL will assign a risk assessment of either \u201caccept\u201d or \u201crefer\u201d  for each borrower. FHA requires lenders to manually underwrite loans  that are assessed as \u201crefer\u201d by TOTAL to give a final determination if the  loan should be accepted or rejected. According to FHA policy, a lender  remains accountable for compliance with FHA eligibility requirements,  regardless of the risk assessment provided by TOTAL.", "Virtually all of the lenders that participate in FHA\u2019s mortgage insurance  programs for single-family homes have direct endorsement authority.  These lenders can underwrite and close mortgage loans without FHA\u2019s  prior review or approval. FHA insures lenders against nearly all losses  resulting from foreclosed loans and covers 100 percent of the value of the  loan. In general, foreclosure may be initiated when three monthly  installments are due and unpaid, and it must be initiated when six monthly  installments are due and unpaid, except when prohibited by law. To  minimize the number of FHA loans entering foreclosure, servicers are  responsible for pursuing various loss mitigation strategies, including  suspended payments, loan modification, reduced mortgage payments,  and sale of the property by the borrower. If, despite these loss mitigation  strategies, the lender forecloses on the loan, the lender can file an  insurance claim with FHA for the unpaid balance of the loan and other  costs. However, FHA reviews a selection of insured loans, including  early payment defaults (loans at least 60 days delinquent in the first six  payments), in part to minimize potential FHA losses and ensure the  underwriting for these mortgages met FHA guidelines. Reviews revealing  serious deficiencies may result in FHA requiring the lenders to  compensate the department for financial losses, known as  indemnification, which requires the lender to repay FHA for any losses  that it incurs after a loan has gone into default and the property has been  sold.", "Congress, through legislation, sets limits on the size of loans that may be  insured by FHA. These loan limits vary by county and can change from  year to year. To mitigate the effects from the economic downturn and the  sharp reduction of mortgage credit availability from private sources,  Congress increased FHA loan limits. The Economic Stimulus Act (ESA)  enacted in February 2008 stipulated that FHA loan limits be set  temporarily at 125 percent of the median house price in each area, with  a maximum loan limit of $729,750 for a one-unit home. Immediately  prior to ESA\u2019s enactment, the limits had been set at 95 percent of area  median house prices. In July 2008, 5 months after passing ESA,  Congress passed the Housing and Economic Recovery Act (HERA),  which established new statutory limits of 115 percent of area median  home prices. Then, in February 2009, Congress passed the Recovery  Act, which stipulated that FHA loan limits for 2009 be set in each county  at the higher dollar amount when comparing loan limits established under  2008 ESA requirements and limits for 2009 under HERA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "First-Time Homebuyer Credit", "paragraphs": ["Congress passed the FTHBC to assist the struggling real estate market  and encourage individuals to purchase their first home.

While it contains delinquent debt information from six  agencies, such as the Department of Education and the Small  Business Administration, CAIVRS does not contain federal tax  information from IRS because statutory restrictions generally prohibit  IRS from disclosing taxpayer information without the taxpayer\u2019s  consent. Two of the three lenders we spoke with mistakenly believed  CAIVRS could be used to identify federal tax debt.", "Credit reports. Lenders told us that credit reports, which contain public  records such as federal tax liens, were a primary method of identifying  liens to indicate certain tax debts. However, delinquent federal taxes  do not always appear on credit reports because IRS does not file liens  on all tax debtors with property. In addition, many FHA borrowers are  first-time home buyers and may not have real property on which IRS  can place a lien. IRS records indicated that only two of our eight  selected borrowers had tax liens filed against them at the time they  obtained FHA mortgage insurance.", "Lenders using only these FHA-required methods for identifying tax debt  are missing an opportunity to more accurately determine whether  applicants are eligible for FHA-insured mortgages, in part, because they  do not have access to certain information. Access to the federal tax  information needed to obtain the tax payment status of applicants is  restricted under section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code, which  prohibits disclosure of taxpayer data to lenders in most instances.  However, lenders may request information on federal tax debts directly  from IRS if the applicant provides consent. To verify the income of self- employed and commission-income applicants, FHA requires that lenders  obtain an applicant-signed consent form allowing the lender to verify the  applicant\u2019s income directly with IRS.", "The three lenders we spoke with indicated they use IRS form 4506-T  Request for Transcript of Tax Return to satisfy this requirement. FHA  could also compel lenders to use this form or otherwise obtain borrower  consent to identify tax debts. Files for four of our eight selected  borrowers had a copy of the IRS Form 4506-T in their FHA mortgage  files. The lenders for these borrowers used the 4506-T only to validate  income by requesting federal tax return transcripts and did not use the  form to request account transcripts that would have disclosed tax debt  information. None of the eight mortgage files contained IRS tax account  transcripts. Officials from each of the lenders we interviewed said it is  their policy to use the 4506-T only to validate the income of these  applicants, as this is the requirement under FHA policies. Officials from   In  two of the lenders used the form to verify income for all borrowers.contrast, officials from the third lender stated that they executed this form  for a random sample of additional applicants for income verification, but  noted that doing so for every applicant would be too burdensome.", "As shown in figure 4, checking box 6a on the form allows a lender to  obtain tax return transcripts for applicants, which do not disclose tax debt  information. Checking box 6b would allow a lender to request and receive  account transcripts. Account transcripts contain information on the  financial status of the account, including information on any existing tax   These transcripts would allow a lender to identify federal taxes  debts. owed by any applicant, including debts not found on credit reports  because a federal tax lien does not exist. Checking box 6c would allow a  lender to obtain both tax return transcripts and account transcripts, which  the lender could use to verify the income of an applicant as well as  identify whether the applicant has federal tax debt. The lender may  request account transcripts only for the current year and up to 3 prior  years and must state the requested years on the form; transcripts beyond  this are generally unavailable. Despite this limitation, the IRS form 4506-T  could serve as a method for lenders to identify loan applicants with  unpaid debt. Without such a method, lenders may approve federally  insured mortgages for ineligible applicants with delinquent tax debt in  violation of OMB and FHA policies.", "IRS returns the information requested on IRS form 4506-T within 10 business days at no  expense to the requester, or within 48 hours through the IRS Income Verification Express  Service (IVES) at an expense of $2.00, according to IRS officials."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Shortcomings in FHA Policies May Have Led to Ineligible Tax Debtors Obtaining Mortgage Insurance", "paragraphs": ["All three lenders we spoke with unknowingly violated FHA policies on  requirements to investigate tax liens. Federal tax liens remain on a  property until the associated tax debt has been paid in full or otherwise  satisfied. The presence of a lien does not prevent an applicant from  receiving FHA mortgage insurance because, per OMB and FHA policies,  applicants are eligible for mortgage insurance if they are in a valid  repayment agreement. However, according to FHA officials, FHA requires  lenders to investigate whether the tax debt that caused the lien has been  resolved or brought current under a repayment plan. If it has not,  insurance must be denied. Lenders understood these policies to have  exemptions for some applicants. FHA officials told us that endorsing a  mortgage without determining applicant eligibility by investigating the  status of tax debts related to federal tax liens for any applicant is improper  due diligence.", "Specifically, officials from two of the three lenders said they would  approve FHA insurance for applicants with a federal tax lien on their  credit report if IRS agreed to subordinate the lien to FHA. The lenders  believed this was in accordance with FHA policy that indicates that tax  liens may remain unpaid if the lien holder subordinates the lien to FHA.  One of the lenders told us that this policy could potentially allow ineligible  applicants with delinquent federal tax debt to obtain FHA mortgage  insurance. However, FHA officials told us that this policy is only  applicable if the lender has previously determined the applicant is eligible  by investigating the lien (i.e., requesting verification from IRS that they  have repaid their debt or are in a repayment agreement). See figure 5 for  FHA policy excerpts.", "Officials from the third lender said they would approve any applicant rated  as \u201caccept\u201d by TOTAL without additional review or manual underwriting,  even if the applicant\u2019s credit report showed a tax lien. The officials  believed this was consistent with FHA policy because TOTAL would not  have granted an \u201caccept\u201d unless the application met FHA requirements.  However, FHA officials told us that while TOTAL considers an applicant\u2019s  credit score in its risk evaluation, it does not consider other factors such  as tax liens. FHA guidance states that the lender remains accountable for  compliance with FHA eligibility requirements, regardless of the risk  assessment provided by TOTAL.", "Due to potential shortcomings in FHA policies, lenders may misinterpret  them, which could result in lenders approving federally insured mortgages  for ineligible applicants with delinquent tax debt in violation of OMB and  FHA policies. Our review was limited to mortgages obtained under the  Recovery Act provisions; however, these policies are the same for all  FHA mortgages. Our review included only a small percentage of all  mortgages insured by FHA in 2009, and it is likely that FHA\u2019s unclear  policies may negatively affect some of the other mortgages."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["FHA has helped millions of families purchase homes through its single- family mortgage insurance programs. As more and more Americans turn  to FHA to finance their homes, it is critical for FHA to ensure that it has  policies in place to minimize financial risks to the federal government  while meeting the housing needs of borrowers. Tax debtors who were  ineligible for FHA mortgage insurance were still able to obtain insurance,  despite FHA policies intended to prohibit this. Our review focused  exclusively on individuals who benefitted from the Recovery Act, which  only accounted for a small percentage of FHA borrowers in 2009;  nevertheless we were able to identify thousands of tax debtors who  obtained insurance. These debtors became seriously delinquent in their  payments and lost their homes to foreclosures at a higher rate than those  without tax debt.", "Current shortcomings we found in the capacity of available information  sources to identify applicants\u2019 tax debts could be addressed by improved  access to federal tax information. But because FHA\u2019s underwriting  policies apply equally to all mortgage insurance applicants, it is likely that  loans we did not review also included tax debtors. To ensure compliance  with the confidentiality requirements associated with the disclosure of  taxpayer information, FHA would need to consult with IRS to take action  to identify tax debtors who are ineligible for FHA mortgage insurance, as  has been done to verify the income of certain applicants. This would  include developing appropriate criteria and safeguards to ensure taxpayer  privacy and minimize undue approval delays. In addition, strengthening  FHA policies and their interpretation by lenders can help prevent ineligible  tax debtors from continuing to receive the benefit of FHA insurance. To  the extent that borrowers with tax debt represent additional risk, FHA  could minimize the potential for this risk by taking steps to address the  issues identified in this report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["The Secretary of HUD should direct the Assistant Secretary for Housing  (Federal Housing Commissioner) to implement the following two  recommendations:", "Consult with IRS to develop written policies requiring lenders to collect  and evaluate IRS documentation appropriate for identifying ineligible  applicants with unpaid federal taxes, while fully complying with the  statutory restriction on disclosure of taxpayer information. For  example, FHA could require lenders to obtain consent from borrowers  to allow FHA and its lenders to verify with IRS whether recipients of  FHA insurance have unpaid federal taxes.", "Provide FHA lenders with revised policies or additional guidance on  borrower ineligibility due to delinquent federal debts and tax liens to  more clearly distinguish requirements for lenders to investigate any  indication that an applicant has federal tax debt (such as a federal tax  lien) to provide reasonable assurance that ineligible borrowers do not  receive FHA mortgage insurance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to IRS and HUD for review and  comment.

We also obtained and analyzed tax debt data from the Internal Revenue  Service (IRS) as of June 30, 2010. Using the taxpayer identification  numbers (TIN) present in these data, we electronically matched IRS\u2019s tax  debt data to the population we identified of Recovery Act borrower Social  Security numbers (SSN) from the SFDW. The Recovery Act stipulated  that revised FHA loan limits for 2009 be set in each county at the higher  of the loan limits established under the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008  (ESA) or those established under the Housing and Economic Recovery  Act of 2009 (HERA). Since loan limits would have reverted to HERA- established rates if the Recovery Act had not been promulgated, we  considered an FHA borrower to be part of our Recovery Act population if  he or she obtained mortgage insurance in 2009 at a value greater than  would have been authorized under HERA. FHA officials agreed with  this methodology.", "To determine the extent to which individuals with unpaid taxes received  the FTHBC under the Recovery Act, we obtained and analyzed FTHBC  transaction data from IRS as of July 10, 2010, and then electronically  matched IRS\u2019s tax debt data to the population of individuals who claimed  the FTHBC under the Recovery Act. Since IRS\u2019s FTHBC data do not  contain home purchase dates, we were unable to isolate all individuals  who benefitted from the FTHBC under the Recovery Act. As a result, we  used the SFDW to obtain home purchase dates to determine which  FTHBCs were awarded under the Recovery Act. We electronically  matched the FTHBC transaction data TINs with the SSNs in the SFDW  and extracted mortgages with closing dates from January 1, 2009,  through November 30, 2009, to identify a population of Recovery Act  FTHBC recipients with FHA mortgage insurance. We identified 722,003  FTHBC claims associated with the Recovery Act for individuals who  financed their home using FHA mortgage insurance, and in our prior work  we found that there were 1,669,081 FTHBC claims filed under the  Recovery Act.approximately 43 percent of all FTHBCs claimed under the Recovery Act.", "Therefore, our analysis includes two groups:  1.  individuals who received FHA mortgage insurance under the higher  limits authorized under the Recovery Act, and  2.  individuals who received the FTHBC under the Recovery Act and  obtained FHA mortgage insurance of any value.", "Further, to determine the extent to which these Recovery Act FTHBC  recipients with unpaid tax debt received federal tax refunds in the same  year they claimed the FTHBC, we obtained and analyzed federal tax  refund data from IRS from fiscal years 2009 and 2010.matched the refund data TINs with the TINs we identified to be FHA   We electronically  mortgage insurance borrowers who claimed the FTHBC under the  Recovery Act while having unpaid federal tax debt.", "To avoid overestimating the amount owed by borrowers who benefitted  from the increased loan limits for FHA mortgage insurance under the  Recovery Act and FTHBC recipients with unpaid federal tax debts, and to  capture only significant tax debts, we excluded from our analysis tax  debts meeting specific criteria to establish a minimum threshold in the  amount of tax debt to be considered when determining whether a tax debt  is significant. The criteria we used to exclude tax debts are as follows:  tax debts IRS classified as compliance assessments or memo  accounts for financial reporting,  tax debts from calendar years 2009 and 2010 tax periods,  tax debts that were assessed by IRS after the mortgage insurance  was issued, and  tax debts from individuals with total unpaid taxes of less than $100.", "The criteria above were used to exclude tax debts that might be under  dispute or generally duplicative or invalid, and tax debts that were  recently incurred. Specifically, compliance assessments or memo  accounts were excluded because these taxes have neither been agreed  to by the taxpayers nor affirmed by the court, or these taxes could be  invalid or duplicative of other taxes already reported. We also excluded  tax debts from calendar years 2009 and 2010 tax periods to eliminate tax  debt that may involve matters that are routinely resolved between the  taxpayers and IRS, with the taxes paid or abated within a short time. We  excluded any debts that were assessed by IRS after the mortgage  insurance was received because those debts would not have been  included in IRS records at the time the mortgage insurance was issued.  We also excluded tax debts of less than $100  because we considered  them insignificant for the purpose of determining the extent of taxes owed  by Recovery Act recipients. Using these criteria, we identified at least  6,327 Recovery Act recipients with federal tax debt.", "To provide examples of Recovery Act recipients who have unpaid federal  taxes, we selected a non-probability sample of Recovery Act beneficiaries  for a detailed review.

We also selected 9 additional cases of FTHBC recipients who  received tax refunds to determine how they were able to receive federal  tax refunds while having unpaid federal taxes.
