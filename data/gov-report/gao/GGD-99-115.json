In 1998, it provided approximately $264 billion in annual benefits to 31 million workers and their dependents.  However, the Social Security program is facing significant future financial challenges as a result of profound demographic changes, including the aging of the baby boom generation and increased life expectancy.   In response, different groups and individuals have advanced numerous proposals that have called for the creation of some sort of mandatory or voluntary individual accounts. To better understand the potential implications of individual accounts, the Chairman of the House Committee on Ways and Means asked GAO to determine how individual accounts could affect private capital and annuities markets as well as national savings, the potential risks and returns to individuals, and the disclosure and educational information needed for public understanding and use of an individual account investment program."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Social Security Has a Financing Problem", "paragraphs": ["The Social Security program is not in long-term actuarial balance.  That is, Social Security revenues are not expected to be sufficient to pay all benefit obligations from 1999 to 2073.

Based on the Social Security Trustees latest \u201cbest estimate\u201d projections, in 2014 the combined OASDI program will experience a negative cash flow that will accelerate in subsequent years.

According to the Trustees\u2019  intermediate set of these assumptions (or best estimate), the nation\u2019s Social Security program will face both solvency and sustainability problems in the years ahead unless corrective actions are taken.  Over the next 75 years, Social Security\u2019s total shortfall is projected to be about $3 trillion in 1998 dollars.", "Social Security\u2019s long-term financing problem is primarily caused by the aging of the U.S. population.  As the baby boom generation retires, labor force growth is expected to slow dramatically.  Beyond 2030, the overall population is expected to continue aging due to relatively low birth rates and increasing longevity.  These demographic trends will require substantial changes in the Social Security benefits structure and/or revenues (i.e., taxes and/or investment returns).  Without such changes, current Social Security tax revenues are expected to be insufficient to cover benefit payments in about 2014, less than 15 years from now.  These trends in Social Security\u2019s finances will place a significant burden on future workers and the economy.  Without major policy changes, the relatively smaller workforce of tomorrow will bear the brunt of financing Social Security\u2019s cash deficit.  In addition, the future workforce also would likely be affected by any reduction in Social Security benefits or increased payroll taxes needed to resolve the program\u2019s long-term financing shortfall.

Such proposals basically also try to restore the Social Security program\u2019s solvency and conserve its sustainability.  In its report to the Social Security Commissioner, the 1994- 1996 Advisory Council on Social Security offered three alternative reform proposals, two of which would create individual accounts.  The remaining proposal called for having the government invest the trust fund in financial assets, such as corporate equities.  Numerous other proposals, also calling for individual accounts, have since been put forth by various organizations. Currently, therefore, there are a wide array of proposals that rely on some form of individual accounts.   These proposals have in common the idea that to varying extents, individuals would manage their own individual accounts.  The returns from these accounts would provide some or much of an individual\u2019s future retirement income.", "Social Security is currently structured as a defined benefit program.   The current Social Security program\u2019s benefit structure is designed to address the twin goals of individual equity and income security\u2014including retirement income adequacy.  The basis of the benefit structure is that these twin goals, and the range of benefits Social Security provides, are currently combined within a single defined benefit formula.  Under this defined benefit program, the worker\u2019s retirement benefits are based on the lifetime record of earnings, not directly on the payroll tax he or she contributed.  Alternatively, a number of individual account proposals introduce a defined contribution structure as an element of the Social Security program.  A defined contribution approach to Social Security focuses on more directly linking a portion of the worker\u2019s contributions to the retirement benefits that will be received.  The worker\u2019s contributions are invested in financial assets and earn market returns, and the accumulations in these accounts can then be used to provide income in retirement and an additional pre-retirement death benefit.  One advantage of this approach is that the individual worker has more control over the account and more choice in how the account is invested.   In essence, the defined contribution structure is similar to the current 401(k) or IRA systems.", "Some proposals combine defined contribution and defined benefit approaches into a two-tiered structure for Social Security.  The aim is to maintain in some form the current existing system as a base tier and add an individual account component as a supplemental tier.   Some proposals modify the existing benefit structure; and others propose features that provide guarantees of current law benefits or some other level, such as the poverty line.   Other proposals have a more complicated formula including forms of matching.  Thus, the relationship between contributions and benefits may be less direct.  Under most of these proposals, individuals would receive part of their future benefits from a modified Social Security program and part from the accumulations from their individual account."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Four Main Characteristics of Individual Account Proposals", "paragraphs": ["Most of the individual account proposals seek to create investment accounts that to varying extents are managed by the participants themselves.  However, the actual details of how to structure individual accounts vary by each proposal.  Individual account proposals are usually framed by four characteristics: (1) carve-out versus add-on; (2) mandatory versus voluntary participation; (3) range of investment options offered; and (4) distribution options (e.g., required annuitization or lump-sum pay- out)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Carve-out Versus Add-on", "paragraphs": ["The first characteristic pertains to whether to carve-out a portion of Social Security\u2019s tax that is to be invested in financial assets or to add-on a percentage to the current tax that is to be invested in financial assets. OASDI has a payroll tax of 12.4 percent.  A carve-out involves creating and funding individual accounts with a portion of the existing payroll tax. Thus, some portion of the 12.4 percent payroll tax, such as 2 percent, would be carved out of the existing Social Security cash flow and allocated to individual account investments.   The resulting impact would be that revenues are taken out of Social Security and less is left to finance current benefits.  Other proposals take a different approach and add-on individual accounts as a type of supplementary defined contribution tier.  For instance, 2 percent would be added on to the current tax of 12.4 percent. The resulting effect of an add-on leaves the entire 12.4 percent payroll tax contribution available to finance the program while dedicating additional revenues for program financing either from higher payroll taxes and/or from general revenue."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Mandatory Versus Voluntary", "paragraphs": ["The second characteristic of individual account proposals concerns whether to make investments in individual accounts mandatory or voluntary.  Mandatory participation in individual accounts would require that each individual invest some percentage of his or her payroll tax contribution in financial assets such as equities.  Voluntary participation in individual accounts could allow individuals to opt in or opt out of investing any portion of their payroll tax contributions into financial assets. Individuals would rely on the existing Social Security if they chose to opt out of participating in individual accounts.   Other voluntary approaches allow individuals to contribute with or without matching to a retirement account.  Additionally, mandatory or voluntary can also refer to the pay- out an individual receives upon retirement, such as a pay-out in the form of a lump sum."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Investment Choices", "paragraphs": ["The third characteristic has to do with the degree of choice and flexibility that individuals would have over investment options.   Some proposals would allow unlimited investment choices, such as investments in corporate equities, bonds, or  real estate.  Other proposals would offer a more limited range of choices, such as equity or bond indexed funds. Thus, individual account investments offer individuals some range of choice over how to accumulate balances for their retirement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Annuitization Versus Lump-Sum", "paragraphs": ["The final characteristic centers around how the accumulated earnings in individual accounts will be paid out.  Preserving individual\u2019s retirement income prior to pay-out by prohibiting pre-retirement distributions or loans is also a requirement of most proposals.  However, upon pay-out, some proposals would permit requiring annuities--contracts that convert savings into income and provide periodic pay-outs for an agreed-upon span of time in return for a premium.

Thus, although individual accounts are a form of advanced funding, the two terms are distinct.  For instance, building up the balance in the Trust Funds is a form of advanced funding.  The creation of individual accounts refers to a defined contribution system of accounts connected to Social Security and held in individuals\u2019 names.  Essentially, individual accounts would be advanced funded income arrangements similar to defined contribution plans or 401 (k) plans.  Although privately held individual accounts are a widely discussed means to achieve advanced funding, there are other ways to achieve advanced funding. Another approach to advanced funding using private markets would have the government invest directly in private capital markets.  Building up the Trust Fund using Treasury securities (marketable or nonmarketable) is another form of advanced funding, although it does not involve diversification gains.", "Proponents of individual accounts often state that advanced funding and asset diversification are benefits of their proposals.  Yet, although advanced funding, individual accounts, and asset diversification are often linked, they are conceptually different.  Diversification refers to investing in more than one asset and can be performed by individuals investing in individual accounts or by the government investing the trust fund in corporate equities stocks as well as corporate bonds.  Any one of the three categories could change without changing the other.  For instance, Social Security\u2019s Trust Funds are currently invested in nonmarketable Treasuries.  Allowing the Trust Funds to invest in assets other than Treasuries would be diversifying without introducing individual accounts. Alternatively, individual accounts could be introduced whereby individuals are allowed to invest in only one asset--thereby introducing individual accounts without diversifying."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Savings Implications of Advanced Funding", "paragraphs": ["Whether advanced funding through individual accounts increases national saving is uncertain.  The nation\u2019s saving are composed of the private saving of individuals and businesses and the saving or dissaving of all levels of government.   Supporters of advanced funding point out that individual accounts offer a way to increase national savings as well as investment and economic growth.  Others suggest that the national saving claims of those favoring advanced funding through individual accounts may not be realized.  Whether advanced funding through individual accounts increases national saving depends on a number of factors, including how individual accounts are financed (existing payroll tax, general revenues); how private saving responds to an individual account system; the structure of the individual account system (mandatory or voluntary), and the limitation or prohibition of pre-retirement distributions and loans to make sure retirement income is preserved.", "Furthermore, even if national saving increases as a result of individual accounts, individuals may or may not be better off.

Most of the proposals use either the Social Security cash flow or federal general revenues as a source of funds. As a result, the primary capital market effect is a purely financial one: borrowing in the Treasury debt market (or retiring less debt) to provide funding for investment in private debt and equity markets. Although the amounts involved are likely to be sizeable, the effect would primarily be one of redirecting funds and readjusting the composition of financial portfolios. There may also be some effect on the difference between the return on Treasury debt and that paid on riskier assets, although the effect is not likely to be large. Although substantial inflows into the private debt market could, in certain circumstances, result in some increased volatility, both the private equity and debt markets should be able to absorb the inflows without significant long-term disruption. There could eventually be a significant increase in the amount of new funds flowing into the annuities market.

Increased government borrowing from the public could put some upward pressure on the interest rate at which the government borrows, if private sector borrowers are to be persuaded to hold the increased supply of government debt.

For certain proposals, changes in borrowing may not arise because these proposals rely on a tax increase or benefit reduction so that current cash flow is not affected.

Alternatively, if the source of funding is general revenues, either additional borrowing from the public or less debt retired will be necessary depending on whether the overall budget is in deficit or surplus.

For instance, a government bond mutual fund may yield a lower return to investors than an equity indexed mutual fund.", "Overall, the capital markets offer higher market returns only by having investors take on additional risk.

Individuals should therefore not only be interested in the returns of various assets but also in the risks that have to be incurred to achieve higher returns under an individual account program.  The difficulty is how to measure risk and how to adjust rates of return for risk so that investors would be able to compare various returns to investments.", "Risk is often considered to be the uncertainty of future rates of return, which in turn are equated with variability.  In fact, one of the underlying concepts of risk is inherent volatility or variability.  For instance, the variability of equity prices is among the key factors that cause investors to consider the stock market risky.  The price at which an individual purchases shares of a company early in the morning is not guaranteed even later in the day.  Bond prices also vary due to changing interest rates and inflation."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "There are Many Ways to Measure Risk", "paragraphs": ["There are a number of different ways to try to measure variability or risk. All such measures give some estimate of the riskiness of investments. Classic risk measures such as variance or the standard deviation are often used to measure the risk of an asset. However these measures are often considered to be difficult for investors to understand and may not reflect how people perceive risk.  For instance, investors do not generally take a symmetrical view of the variability of returns\u2014downward deviations are perceived as economic risks, but upward deviations are regarded positively or as unexpected gains.  Furthermore, quantifying uncertainty or risk is usually done using probability distributions.  As long as the probability distribution falls symmetrically about the mean or average\u2014what is known as a normal distribution\u2014the variance and standard deviation are adequate measures of risk.  However, to the extent that the probability distributions are asymmetrical, as is the case with the returns from a combination of securities, those measures are not as meaningful in terms of measuring risk.", "Other ways to measure risk include (1) the value at risk (VAR) --how much the value of a portfolio can decline with a given probability in a given time period, or (2) the beta of a security--the tendency of a security\u2019s returns to respond to swings in the broad market.  VAR is an approach used by money risk managers to measure the riskiness of their portfolios.  It is an estimate of the maximum amount a firm could lose on a particular portfolio a certain percent of the time over a particular period of time.  For example, if an investor wanted to put money into a mutual fund and wanted to know the value at risk for the investment of a given time period, the investor could determine the percentage or dollar amount that their investment could lose, e.g., a 2-percent probability that the investor could lose at least $50 of a $1,000 investment over a certain period of time.   VAR models construct measures of risk using the volatility of risk factors, such as interest rates or stock indexes, which is helpful for mutual funds that have a wide variety of investments.", "Measuring the beta is another way to measure risk.  In essence, if an investor wanted to know how sensitive a particular asset\u2019s return is to market movements, calculating the beta would do so.  Beta measures the amount that investors expect the equity price to change for each additional 1-percent change in the market.  The lower the beta, the less susceptible the stock\u2019s return is to market movements.  The higher the beta, the more susceptible the stock\u2019s return is to market movements.  Thus, the beta would measure the risk that a particular stock contributes to an individual\u2019s portfolio."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Adjusting for Risk", "paragraphs": ["As previously stated, estimating a return on investments without taking in to account the riskiness of the investment is likely to overstate the benefit of investing in that asset.  Adjusting returns to account for risk is important because risk-adjusted returns are likely to be lower than unadjusted returns but more comparable across asset classes.", "There are different ways to adjust returns for risk, but there is no clear best way to do so.  The appropriate risk-adjusted measurements depend on what is being evaluated.  For instance, in terms of evaluating the returns of mutual funds, various risk-adjusted performance measures could be used.One measure used is the Sharpe Ratio, which basically measures the reward to volatility ratio and is the most commonly used measure for determining the risk-adjusted performance of mutual funds.  A high Sharpe ratio means that a mutual fund delivers a high return for the level of volatility of the fund\u2019s investments.  Thus, if individuals were trying to determine the mutual fund that had the best combination of return for risk, they would choose the fund that had the highest Sharpe Ratio.   An alternative to the Sharpe Ratio is the Modigliani Measure, which measures a fund\u2019s performance relative to the market.   The measure uses a broad- based market index, such as the S&P 500, as a benchmark for risk comparison.  In essence, the measure is equivalent to the return a mutual fund would achieve if it had the same risk as a market index.   Another measure is one calculated by Morningstar, Incorporated.  Unlike the Sharpe Ratio, which compares the risk-adjusted performance of any two mutual funds, Morningstar measures the risk-adjusted performance of mutual funds within the same asset class.  It usually assigns ratings to mutual funds on the basis of the risk-adjusted return and risk of a mutual fund.  Thus, if individuals wanted to know how various mutual funds did within their asset groups, they would look at the Morningstar rating.", "There are other risk-adjusted measures that are used.  However, there is no clear best way to adjust a return for risk, and there is no one risk- adjusted measure that everyone agrees is the correct measure.  Many of the measures are complicated and may require more sophistication to understand than could be expected of individual account investors.  It should be noted, however, that although risk-adjusted rates of return are the appropriate measure for individual account investments, an investor\u2019s entire portfolio has a different risk than that of its individual components.

Other issues, such as compounding\u2014the calculation of interest earned on a daily, quarterly, semiannual, or annual basis\u2014or the impact of inflation on returns are issues that individuals need to fundamentally understand.  For example, with compounding interest individuals could earn interest on the money they save and on the interest that the money earns, e.g., if they invested $1,000 at 3-percent interest they could double their money in 24 years, but at 4 percent interest they could double it in 18 years.  With inflation, or rising prices, the money that individuals earn on their investments would potentially be worth less and less as prices rose.  In addition, seemingly small annual fees can eat away at the accumulated value. Offering fewer, more well-diversified options enables the education effort to be targeted on basic issues that would be helpful for individuals to understand in order to save for retirement."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Default Option", "paragraphs": ["Despite current efforts to increase people\u2019s awareness to save more, many people are still not saving and making the retirement choices they need to make, effectively relying on Social Security to be their primary source of retirement income.  It is unlikely that moving to individual accounts will result in active participation by all individuals.  Thus, various officials have suggested that a default option be provided for those individuals who, regardless of educational effort, will not make investment choices.", "Default options could include a default to the defined benefit portion of Social Security (staying in the current Social Security program) or to some type of mandatory allocation.  One example would be an investment vehicle in which, depending on the age of the individual, certain portions of the investment could be in equities and certain portions in bonds.  The portion in bonds would increase with the age of the individual. Alternatively, the default option could be invested totally in Treasuries.  As with any option, a default option with less risk is also likely to provide lower returns."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
