We cut an additional 14  countries from the list because they received a relatively small amount of  OPIC funding or had a relatively high gross per capita income. Finally, we  selected the four countries from the remaining list based on geographical  dispersion, risk\u2014including security risks, country governance and  development indicators, and characteristics of the projects such as  sector, development impact, and type of OPIC financial instrument. To  select the 21 projects for our review, we considered several factors,  including the project\u2019s (1) size relative to the total OPIC commitments in  the country, (2) sector, (3) type of financing instrument, (4) age of the  commitment, and (5) whether any disbursements had been made. In  addition, in order to assure broad coverage of each country\u2019s committed  projects, the team sought to achieve 40 percent coverage of both the  number of projects in each selected country and the overall committed  dollars.", "To examine how OPIC selects projects for financing support, we met with  officials from OPIC, Department of State (State), Department of the  Treasury (Treasury), the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR),  and USAID in Washington D.C.; the USAID Office of Inspector General,  responsible for auditing OPIC; the former Director of OPIC\u2019s Office of  Accountability; and nongovernmental organizations, including Friends of  the Earth and the Accountability Counsel. In addition we obtained and  reviewed OPIC policy documents, such as the finance policies and  procedures and policies guiding the U.S. economic and host-country  development impact, environmental and social, human rights, and worker  rights clearances processes. We interviewed OPIC staff to discuss how  they administer OPIC selection policies and procedures, including internal  controls. We also interviewed State, Treasury, USTR, and USAID officials  to discuss each agency\u2019s role on OPIC\u2019s Board of Directors, which is  required to approve projects that exceed $50 million.", "For our review of OPIC\u2019s project selection process, we developed a data  collection instrument based on OPIC\u2019s project selection policies and  conducted a review of the 21 projects based on OPIC-provided project  documentation, such as project applications and policy clearance  documents. Based on the questions in the data collection instrument we  developed a method for analyzing the data against OPIC policies to  develop our findings. Specifically, with the use of the data collection  instrument, we reviewed how each project met eligibility requirements,  including U.S. connections and additionality requirements; verified that  OPIC finalized the four policy clearances for each project and reviewed  the clearances for content; and reviewed applicable credit due diligence  and character risk due diligence documentation. We did not review the  sufficiency of OPIC\u2019s credit and legal due diligence processes while  reviewing project documentation as this was outside the scope of our  review.", "We also visited two of the four focus countries, Honduras and Pakistan, to  augment information we obtained from OPIC and other sources. In each  country, we met with U.S. embassy and host-government officials,  recipients of OPIC loans and loan guarantees, and officials from other  development finance institutions. In addition, we visited some project  sites.", "To examine how OPIC monitors active projects\u2019 compliance with  environmental and social, worker rights, and human rights policies and  the U.S. economic and host-country development impact of these  projects, we met with OPIC\u2019s Office of Investment Policy (OIP) to discuss  its procedures for monitoring projects, collecting data, and validating data  provided by its clients. As part of this review, we also discussed the  procedures OPIC follows in case of missing or incomplete self-monitoring  questionnaires (SMQs), which is the source for client-reported monitoring  data. In addition, we met with OPIC officials to discuss OIP\u2019s monitoring  site visit policies and methodology for selecting projects for site visits. We  also examined the development impact profiles that OPIC develops prior  to approving projects, which aim to assess each project\u2019s anticipated  contribution to the development of the host country. We obtained OPICs  development impact profile guidelines for scoring projects as  developmental, highly developmental, or indeterminate. We interviewed  the USAID Office of Inspector General and OPIC\u2019s Office of  Accountability to discuss OPIC monitoring methodology and reports both  offices had issued on specific audits of OPIC projects in Turkey, Jordan,  and Liberia. In addition we interviewed World Bank and International  Finance Corporation officials about their monitoring procedures for similar  activities, their indicators for assessing development outcomes, and the  new harmonized indicators that several development finance institutions,  including OPIC, are developing to standardize development impact  information collection from clients.", "We also developed a data collection instrument to review OPIC\u2019s  compliance and impact monitoring efforts for the selected 21 projects. We  focused on the following monitoring related issues:  the presence of SMQs in project files, date of submission, and  completeness of responses, including client responses regarding  compliance with OPIC covenants and local laws and regulations; the presence of site visit reports and trip notes in project files, and the  extent to which corrective actions or risks were identified during the  course of site visits; and pre-selection development impact scores that project development  impact outcomes for OPIC projects, and the re-scoring analyses  conducted during a site visit, which measure the extent to which these  projections have been achieved.", "We used the data collection instrument to analyze changes in  development impact scores for OPIC projects from initial to final  estimates following site visits, if any, as well as to classify qualitative  findings from OPIC clients\u2019 SMQs and site visit reports into broad  categories. We did not review OPIC\u2019s processes for monitoring projects\u2019  financial performance.", "The documentation we obtained for the 21 projects we reviewed  supported our work for the second and third reporting objectives. These  documents covered the topics and issues listed above, including OPIC\u2019s  project selection and monitoring processes. To ensure completeness of  our document files, we met with OPIC officials to discuss documentation  for selected case study projects and changes to OPIC\u2019s requirements for  project screening and monitoring documentation over time. When  necessary we followed up with OPIC when the project files did not contain  expected or required documents."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) Project Commitments in Selected Countries for Fiscal Years 2008 through 2014", "paragraphs": ["To provide detailed information on all OPIC projects for our selected  focus countries, the tables below list the commitments OPIC made in  fiscal years 2008 through 2014 in Honduras, Kenya, Pakistan, and Peru.
