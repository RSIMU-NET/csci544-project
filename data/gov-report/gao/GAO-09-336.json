GAO compared new support standards with the current support levels, visited nine installations that will become four joint bases, and compared facility sustainment funding levels with requirements and goals."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DOD has made a comprehensive effort to ensure consistent delivery of installation support at the planned joint bases, but the cost of installation support is expected to increase rather than decrease as forecasted by the 2005 Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission. In January 2008, DOD began issuing joint base implementation guidance that for the first time established a set of common definitions and standards for installation support. The guidance defined 47 installation support areas (e.g., airfield operations, grounds maintenance, custodial services, and child and youth programs) and provided 267 standards to define the expected level of service in each area. DOD officials stated that the standards represented the service levels needed to meet mission and personnel requirements in view of DOD policies and guidance, commercial standards, other federal agency guidance, or in some cases, military judgment. However, contrary to the expectations of the commission, for two primary reasons installation support costs at the joint bases are expected to increase above the cost of support provided by the separate installations before consolidation. First, DOD has required the joint bases to deliver installation support in accordance with the new standards even though the military services have not previously funded installation support in the amounts needed to meet each of the standards. GAO's comparison of 40 selected standards to the service levels currently provided at the nine installations it visited showed that on average service levels would have to increase to meet the standards in about 27 percent of the areas compared. Second, in some instances the services' approach to implementing joint basing will result in additional administrative costs and the loss of some existing installation support efficiencies. Although DOD officials stated that the increased support costs at the joint bases might be at least partially offset over time as experience is gained and new efficiencies are identified and adopted, it is unclear whether joint basing will result in actual savings. The military services have not budgeted and spent sufficient funds to meet their facility sustainment requirements and goals and prevent facility deterioration at the installation level. Citing other budget priorities as the reason, the military services did not budget funds to meet about $2.3 billion (9 percent) of their total facility sustainment requirements during fiscal years 2005 through 2008 and, according to DOD, needed sustainment work that is not performed may eventually result in damaged facilities, shortened facility service lives, and increased future costs for facility restoration. The services have further exacerbated the sustainment funding issue by using some budgeted sustainment funds for other purposes. During fiscal years 2006 through 2008, the military services used about $2.6 billion (14 percent) of the funds budgeted for sustainment for other purposes, primarily to pay for unfunded facility restoration and modernization projects. Although service officials stated that these projects were needed, the consequence was that sustainment requirements were not met. During visits to nine installations, GAO found backlogs of deferred sustainment needs and some facilities that were not in good condition because funds were not available to pay for all needed sustainment work."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Estimating that $2.3 billion could be saved over a 20-year period, the 2005  Defense Base Closure and Realignment (BRAC) Commission  recommended that the Department of Defense (DOD) establish 12 joint  bases by consolidating the management and support of 26 separate Army,  Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps installations. The commission noted  that, because all installations perform common functions in support of  installation personnel and facilities and because these installations shared  a common boundary or were in close proximity, the joint bases could  reduce duplication of efforts and achieve greater efficiencies through  economies of scale, which could result in significant long-term savings in  installation support costs. For each of the joint bases, the commission  designated which military service would become the lead component with  responsibility for delivering installation support services for the  consolidated base. This arrangement\u2014with one military service assuming  responsibility for supporting another military service\u2019s installation\u2014 created concerns about the delivery of installation support at the joint  bases because DOD had not established common definitions and  standards for installation support functions and services. Instead, each  military service had its own long-standing policies and practices on how  each installation support function was defined and the level of service  typically provided in each area. In view of the differences, it was not clear  that the joint bases, scheduled to be fully implemented by October 2010,  would deliver installation support consistently and at a level considered  acceptable by each of the installations combining into the joint bases.", "One installation support area that has been of particular concern, not only  at the planned joint bases but at all military installations, is facility  sustainment, which includes the maintenance and repair necessary to  keep facilities in good working order. DOD is one of the world\u2019s largest  organizations in terms of physical plant, managing and operating about  545,000 buildings and structures with a total replacement value of about  $706 billion. DOD determined that the most cost-effective approach to  managing its facilities is to fully fund sustainment requirements because  this method provides the most performance over the longest period for the  least investment. To implement this approach, DOD developed a facilities  sustainment model that determines these requirements and established a  goal that the military services budget for sustainment in accordance with  the model. However, in an April 2008 report, we found that although  DOD\u2019s model provided reasonable and consistent requirements estimates,  the military services were not budgeting for sustainment in the amounts  estimated by the model. As a result, some installation facilities were not  being sustained at a level to keep them in good working order and will  likely experience reduced service lives, which in turn will lead to more  costly recapitalization requirements in the future.", "The House Armed Services Committee cited our 2008 report in its report  accompanying the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2009 and expressed concerns about the delivery of installation  support across the joint bases and the adequacy of facility sustainment  funding at all installations. The committee directed that we perform an  assessment of these areas. In response, this report evaluates DOD\u2019s   (1) efforts and expected costs to deliver installation support at the planned  joint bases and (2) funding for facility sustainment at all installations.", "To address these areas, we (1) reviewed DOD implementation plans,  guidance, and cost estimates associated with the delivery of installation  support at the planned joint bases and compared the levels of service in  selected support areas currently provided by the separate installations  with the levels of service to be provided by the joint bases and   (2) examined and compared DOD\u2019s requirements and goals for facility  sustainment funding with the amounts actually budgeted and spent on  sustainment. Also, to gain local-level insight into the planned delivery and  expected costs of installation support at the joint bases as well as  sustainment funding levels and facility conditions, we visited 3 Army, 3  Navy, and 3 Air Force installations that are consolidating into 4 of the 12  planned joint bases. We selected bases for visits that had the highest  potential reduction in jobs according to DOD\u2019s 2005 BRAC report. We  conducted this performance audit from May 2008 through February 2009,  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. See appendix I for more  information on our scope and methodology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The 2005 BRAC Commission final report noted that all installations  employ military, civilian, and contractor personnel to perform common  functions in support of installation facilities and personnel and that all  installations execute these functions using similar or near similar  processes. The report also noted that, in areas where the military services  operated separate installations that share a common boundary or were in  close proximity, there was significant opportunity to reduce duplication  and costs by consolidating the installations. Specifically, the report stated  that by consolidating nearby installations, savings in personnel and  facilities costs could be realized by eliminating duplication of efforts,  paring unnecessary management personnel, achieving greater efficiencies  through economies of scale, consolidating and optimizing existing and  future service contract requirements, establishing a single space  management authority that could achieve greater utilization of facilities,  and reducing the number of base support vehicles and equipment  consistent with the size of the combined facilities.", "The report recommended that DOD establish 12 joint bases from 26  existing installations and estimated that the net present value of the costs  and savings from this effort over 20 years would be about $2.3 billion. For  each of the joint bases, the report designated which military service would  become the lead component with responsibility for delivering installation  support services for the consolidated base. To implement the  recommendation, DOD established a schedule that divided the 12 planned  joint bases into two implementation phases. Five joint bases involving   11 installations were placed into phase I with a September 30, 2008,  milestone for signing a joint base memorandum of agreement, which  would provide a detailed implementation plan including the personnel and  financial arrangements for the combined base, and an October 1, 2009,  milestone for full implementation, which included the transfer of  personnel and funds to the joint base. The remaining 7 joint bases  involving 15 installations were placed into phase II with a September 30,  2009, milestone for signing the joint base memorandum of agreement and  an October 1, 2010, milestone for full implementation. Table 1 provides  details on the planned joint bases.", "DOD officials stated that, although none of the phase I joint bases met the  September 30, 2008, milestone for signing their memorandums of  agreement, joint bases Myer-Henderson Hall, Andrews-Naval Air Facility  Washington, and Little Creek-Fort Story had signed agreements by January  2009.

During fiscal year 2009, DOD plans to spend about $62 billion  to support its facilities and installations. DOD refers to this funding as  installation support, which includes broad categories of services,  programs, and support activities, as shown in figure 1.", "The largest categories of installation support are installation services and  facilities. Installation services, funded primarily with operation and  maintenance appropriations, includes the personnel, support equipment,  contracts, and associated costs to plan, manage, and deliver installation  services and functions, such as installation airfield and port operations;  security; transportation; supply; communications; information  management; personnel management; food services; administrative, legal,  and financial services; unaccompanied personnel housing management;  family and quality of life programs; and environmental compliance.", "The facilities category is composed of five subcategories\u2014facilities  operation services, sustainment, recapitalization, disposal, and new  footprint, which includes facility construction related to new or expanded  missions.", "Facilities operation services, funded primarily with operation and  maintenance appropriations, includes 10 facility-related services\u2014fire  and emergency services, utilities, pavement clearance, refuse  collection and disposal, real property leases, grounds maintenance,  pest control, custodial services, real property management and  engineering services, and engineering readiness. DOD previously  referred to facility operations as real property services and, together  with installation services, family housing, and environment, were  referred to as base operations support. In general, the military  services\u2019 budgets continue to refer to funding for installation services  and facility operation services as base operations support funding.", "Sustainment, funded primarily with operation and maintenance  appropriations, includes the maintenance and repair activities  necessary to prevent deterioration, maintain safety, and keep facilities  in good working order over their service lives. Sustainment includes  routine and preventive maintenance tasks and emergency response  and other service calls for minor repairs. Sustainment also includes  major repairs or replacement of facility components that are expected  to occur periodically throughout a facility\u2019s life cycle, such as regular  roof replacement; refinishing wall surfaces; repairing and replacing  electrical, heating, and cooling systems; and replacing tile and carpets.  Since fiscal year 2003, DOD has used a model\u2014the facilities  sustainment model\u2014to estimate annual facility sustainment funding  requirements in each military service. Although the Office of the  Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Installations and Environment  has overall responsibility for DOD\u2019s installations and facilities, the  individual military services are responsible for budgeting and  allocating facility sustainment funds to installations. Appendix II  summarizes each service\u2019s sustainment funding allocation process.", "Recapitalization, funded primarily with operation and maintenance  and military construction appropriations, provides for improving  facilities through restoration and modernization. Restoration includes  repair and replacement work needed to restore facilities degraded  from several causes, such as natural disaster, fire, accident, excessive  age, or inadequate sustainment.

In a January 2009 update to our high-risk series, we noted that  although DOD has made progress in managing its support infrastructure in  recent years, a number of challenges remain in managing its portfolio of  facilities and reducing unneeded infrastructure while providing facilities  needed to support several simultaneous force structure initiatives.  Further, we noted that because of these issues, DOD\u2019s management of  support infrastructure remains a high-risk area.", "We have issued several reports on DOD\u2019s implementation of the  recommendations from the 2005 BRAC round. The reports generally found  that, compared with the original cost and savings estimates,  implementation costs were expected to increase and savings were  expected to decrease. For example, in a December 2007 report, we found  that DOD planned to spend more, save less, and take longer to recoup up- front costs than expected to implement the 2005 BRAC recommendations  due to increased construction cost estimates, the effects of inflation,  environmental clean-up costs not accounted for in the original estimates,  and other miscellaneous expenses including operation and maintenance  expenses. We also found that DOD\u2019s estimated costs and savings to  implement the recommendations were likely to change further due to  uncertainties surrounding certain implementation details, potential  increases in military construction costs, and likely increases in the cost of  environmental cleanup for some BRAC properties. In a March 2008 report  on two BRAC recommendations that were intended to improve DOD\u2019s  logistics systems, we found that DOD would spend more, save less, and  take longer than expected to recoup up-front costs to implement those  recommendations due to the use of inaccurate or outdated data,  misinterpretation of terms, and changes in operational requirements. On  January 30, 2009, we reported that while DOD has made progress in  implementing the BRAC 2005 round, it faces challenges in its ability to  meet the September 15, 2011, statutory completion deadline. Further,  DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2009 BRAC budget submission shows that DOD plans to  spend more to implement recommendations and save slightly less  compared to the 2008 BRAC budget and that the potential remains for  BRAC cost estimates to continue to increase. DOD concurred with several  recommendations from these reports on ways that DOD could improve its  development of BRAC savings estimates.", "We have also issued several reports over the past few years highlighting  the long-term challenges DOD faces in managing its portfolio of  installations and halting the degradation of facilities. For example, in  February 2003, we found that funds designated for facilities sustainment  were held back at the service headquarters, major command, and  installation levels to cover more pressing needs or emerging requirements  and that, as a result, facility deterioration continued. DOD concurred  with our recommendation that the military services reassess the funding  priorities attached to sustaining and improving their facilities. In a June  2005 report, we found that DOD did not have a common framework for  identifying installation support functions and funding requirements to  ensure adequate delivery of services, particularly in a joint environment.  We also found that, because of a lack of a common terminology across the  military services in defining installation support functions and the lack of a  mature analytic process for developing credible and consistent  requirements, the services moved hundreds of millions of operation and  maintenance dollars designated for facilities sustainment and other  purposes to pay for installation support services. While such funding  movements are permissible, we found that they were disruptive to the  orderly provision of installation support and contributed to the overall  degradation of facilities. In an April 2008 report, we found that the military  services had not met all of DOD\u2019s goals for funding facility sustainment  and recapitalization at levels to prevent deterioration and, because DOD  continued to lack common definitions and performance standards for  installation support functions, each military service had developed  methods to determine its installation services requirements and funding  needs subject to its own definition of the types and levels of services it  deemed necessary. We also found that DOD\u2019s facilities sustainment  model provided a consistent and reasonable framework for preparing  estimates of DOD\u2019s annual facility sustainment funding requirements, even  though the reliability of the model\u2019s estimates could be improved through  increased accuracy of the model\u2019s inputs. The 2005 and 2008 reports made  recommendations related to resolving the inconsistencies among the  military services\u2019 definitions of installation support functions and, with the  joint basing guidance issued during 2008, DOD completed the  development of common installation support definitions.

However, instead of decreasing, support costs at the joint bases are  expected to increase primarily because past funding for installation  support has been insufficient to provide support at the levels called for by  either existing or the new common service standards, and in some  instances the military services\u2019 approach to implementing joint basing will  result in additional administrative costs and the loss of some existing  installation support efficiencies. In the long term, DOD officials stated that  the increased installation support costs might be at least partially offset as  best practices and new operational efficiencies are identified and adopted  over time.

The standards include the following.", "About 62 percent of the standards, in areas such as fire protection and  emergency services and airfield operations, were based on existing  OSD and military service policies and requirements.", "About 13 percent of the standards, in areas such as custodial services  and grounds maintenance and landscaping, were based on commercial  industry standards or guidance from other federal agencies.", "About 25 percent of the standards, in areas such as installation  chaplain services and legal support, were based on the judgment of  military subject matter experts. According to DOD, the standards  determined by military subject matter experts were in areas that were  not covered by DOD policy or other requirements and did not have  comparable commercial standards. To determine standards for these  areas, the subject matter experts generally reviewed the practices of  each military department and reached agreement on the service levels  needed that in their judgment would best meet installation mission and  personnel requirements. Judgment was used to decide the standard  level of service in view of mission, facility, personnel, and quality of  life factors. Also, because costs generally increase as the level of  service increases, some of these decisions also involved the  consideration of trade-offs between alternative levels of service and  affordability.", "Officials at OSD and each of the military services stated that the new  common standards called for service levels that were very close to each  military service\u2019s existing installation support standards or practices.  However, the officials also noted that because installation support had not  been fully funded in the past, military installations normally did not  provide support at the levels called for by all of their existing standards.", "The following examples illustrate a few of the installation support function  definitions and standards that DOD established for joint basing, and  appendix III provides a list of the 47 defined installation support functions  and the number of standards developed for each area.", "Information technology services management was defined to include  the personnel, contracts, and equipment necessary to plan, manage,  coordinate, and execute the delivery of services including fixed and  wireless voice, data, and video services. Twenty-six standards were  established to define the expected level of service for this support  function. For example, each joint base is to (1) maintain 99.99 percent  telephone dial tone availability, (2) provide wireless local mobile radio  service for 100 percent of the base\u2019s populated area and 85 percent of  the total base area, (3) respond within 90 minutes to critical circuit  outages 99 percent of the time, and (4) resolve 95 percent of  nonmission critical trouble calls within 4 days.", "Installation law enforcement operations was defined to include the  personnel, contracts, and support equipment necessary to enforce  federal, state, and military law; investigate crimes; apprehend and  detain suspects; manage traffic; and detect and prevent crime.

The guidance also  provides a template memorandum of agreement that, among other things,  commits the lead component to deliver installation support in accordance  with the support definitions and standards.

Second, to facilitate  consistency in developing the memorandums, OSD officials stated that  they held workshops and conducted visits to the installations involved in  joint basing. Third, to ensure top management support for the terms  included in each memorandum, OSD\u2019s guidance requires that the Vice  Chief of Staff of the Army, the Vice Chief of Naval Operations, the Vice  Chief of Staff of the Air Force, and the Assistant Commandant of the  Marine Corps approve and sign the memorandum at each joint base  involving their military service. Because the memorandums include the  expected joint base personnel and funding requirements, the signatures of  the Vice Chiefs are considered to be a commitment that each involved  military service will provide the necessary personnel and funding to fully  support the joint base and the delivery of installation support services in  accordance with the definitions and standards. Fourth, OSD has  established a framework, termed the cost and performance visibility  framework, which is designed to collect and report cost and performance  data pertaining to installation support and also assess compliance with the  terms of the joint base memorandums of agreement.

For example, according to Army officials, installation and facility  operations support services\u2014collectively classified as base operations  support in the Army\u2019s budget\u2014were funded at about 80 percent,   82 percent, 87 percent, and 85 percent of requirements in fiscal years 2005,  2006, 2007, and 2008, respectively. Army officials stated that, because of  these funding levels, some installation services were reduced and provided  at lower than optimum levels at some installations, which reduced the  support provided to military personnel.", "To obtain some insight into how many areas might require increased  service levels at the installations consolidating into the joint bases, we  performed a comparison of current service levels to the joint base  standard service levels at the installations we visited. Specifically, we  judgmentally selected 40 of the 267 joint base service-level standards and,  at each installation we visited, compared the level of service that the  installation was currently providing with the new standard. As shown in  table 3, in about 27 percent of areas we compared, the joint base will have  to increase the level of service provided to meet the standards.", "The following examples provide details on some of the support standards  and current service levels that we compared at the installations visited.", "One standard for an installation\u2019s child care program calls for 100  percent of children to be placed in the program within 3 months of a  request.

For example,  additional costs for installation administration are expected at the six joint  bases where the Air Force will be the lead component. DOD officials noted  that the typical smaller Air Force installation has one base commander  who is responsible for both installation support and the operational  mission of the installation. This differs from larger Air Force bases and  typical Army and Navy installations, which have separate commanders  responsible for installation support and for operational missions. Because  of the increased administrative workload associated with providing  installation support at a joint base, Air Force officials decided that it  would be preferable to have a commander solely responsible for  installation support at each joint base. To accomplish this, the Air Force  intends to establish a new organization unit, consisting of a commander  and supporting staff, which will be responsible for managing installation  support at six joint bases where the Air Force will be the lead component.  Although the Air Force did not have estimates of the added costs for the  new units, officials at McGuire Air Force Base estimated that 19 additional  administrative personnel will be needed to establish the new unit that will  manage installation support at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, which  will result in increased costs.", "As another example, officials at some of the Army and Navy installations  we visited stated that in a few instances existing installation support  efficiencies will be lost at joint bases where the Air Force will be the lead  component. The officials stated that currently their regional commands  provided some support services to the installation, such as certain  personnel- and travel-related services, which would become the  responsibility of the Air Force under joint basing where the Air Force is  the lead component. However, the officials stated that the efficiencies  from these existing arrangements will be lost because the joint base will  begin to provide these services and at the same time no reduction in  personnel was expected at the Army and Navy regions since the regions  will continue to provide services for the installations that are not involved  with joint basing.", "Officials at McGuire Air Force Base and Fort Dix cited another example of  increased support costs resulting from the way that Joint Base McGuire- Dix-Lakehurst is being implemented. As the lead component, McGuire Air  Force Base will become responsible for installation support at this joint  base and, in the area of delivering contract support, the Air Force has  decided that McGuire\u2019s existing contracting office will be expanded in  order to provide contracting services for the joint base. However,  according to McGuire Air Force Base and Fort Dix officials, this approach  will result in higher support costs compared to an alternative approach.  Specifically, the officials stated that an existing contracting office at Fort  Dix, which currently provides contracting services to Fort Dix as well as  to other Army reserve units across the United States, could provide  contracting services for the joint base with fewer personnel and at less  cost than McGuire Air Force Base\u2019s contracting office. Although  installation officials stated that this alternative was feasible and less  costly, Air Force decided not to use the contracting office at Fort Dix  primarily because the office is outside the Air Force\u2019s direct chain of  command and the Air Force will ultimately be responsible for all joint base  contracting services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Officials Believe Increased Installation Support Costs Could Be Offset in the Long Term", "paragraphs": ["In the long term, OSD officials stated that the increased cost of installation  support at the joint bases might be at least partially offset as experience is  gained and best practices and new operational efficiencies are identified  and adopted over time.

For example, according to Army officials, the Army first considers  each installation\u2019s facility sustainment requirement, as determined by  DOD\u2019s model.

The same  percentage is used for all installations and, historically, each installation  has been allocated about 70 to 75 percent of its sustainment requirement.  These funds are expected to be used to pay for routine sustainment work,  such as regular facility inspections, preventive maintenance, and service  calls, as well as some larger sustainment projects, such as roof  replacements. According to Army officials, in the past few years all  budgeted sustainment funds were not allocated to the installations. Some  funds were retained at Army headquarters and used to pay for unfunded  restoration and modernization projects related to specific Army  investment strategies, such as barracks improvement and upgrades to  transportation infrastructure.", "According to Navy officials, the Navy first considers the facility  sustainment requirement of all installations, as determined by DOD\u2019s  model, under each of the Navy\u2019s regional commands. Then, the Navy  allocates funding based on a set percentage of each region\u2019s total  sustainment requirement. The regions then allocate sustainment funds to  their installations. According to Navy officials, the percentage used to  allocate funds to the regions is determined by the amount of sustainment  funds that the Navy budgeted and the Navy\u2019s practice of retaining a  portion of the funds at headquarters to centrally pay for some larger  sustainment projects, maintenance dredging, specialized inspections,  demolition projects, and some unfunded restoration and modernization  projects. With this practice in fiscal year 2008, the Navy allocated to each  of its regional commands about 55 percent of each region\u2019s total  sustainment requirement. Some regional commands reallocate all of the  funds they receive to their installations based on the same percentage of  each installation\u2019s sustainment requirement. Other regional commands  retain a portion of the funds they receive to pay for regional projects\u2014 such as design work on facility projects, larger sustainment projects, and  some unfunded restoration and modernization projects. Installations use  their sustainment funds to pay for routine sustainment work and can  submit to their regional commands or Navy headquarters a prioritized list  of needed larger sustainment projects, which compete for funding based  on Navy and regional priorities.", "According to an Air Force official, the Air Force first considers the facility  sustainment requirement of all Air Force active, guard, and reserve  installations, as determined by DOD\u2019s model. Then, the Air Force allocates  to each component about 90 percent of each component\u2019s total  sustainment requirement. The components, in turn, allocate funding to  their major commands based on the commands\u2019 specific mission needs  and their model-determined sustainment requirements, and the commands  allocate the funds to the installation level in accordance with execution  plans, unique funding priorities, and advice from financial management  and civil engineering experts.", "According to a Marine Corps official, the Marine Corps first considers the  facility sustainment requirement of all installations, as determined by  DOD\u2019s facilities sustainment model, under each of the Marine Corps\u2019  regions. Then, the Marine Corps allocates funding based on a set  percentage of each region\u2019s requirements. The same percentage is used for  all regions and, historically, each region has been allocated about 60  percent of its sustainment requirement. The regions then allocate  sustainment funds to their installations based on their specific knowledge  of each installation\u2019s requirements. Installations are expected to use these  funds to pay for routine sustainment work, such as regular facility  inspections, preventive maintenance, and service calls. According to  Marine Corps officials, all budgeted sustainment funds are not allocated to  the regions. Some funds are retained at Marine Corps headquarters and  used to pay for larger sustainment projects. Specifically, each installation  can submit a prioritized list of larger sustainment projects to Marine Corps  headquarters. Headquarters decides which projects to fund based on  Marine Corps priorities and the amount of funds available, which is the  amount of budgeted funds that was not initially allocated to the regions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: List of Installation Support Functions and Number of Associated Standards for Joint Bases", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) issued joint basing implementation  guidance in January and April 2008 that for the first time established a set  of common definitions and standards for installation support.
