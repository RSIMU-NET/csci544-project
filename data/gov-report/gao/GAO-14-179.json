With coastal populations growing and the possibility of more frequent and severe weather, more homeowners could experience heavy losses not covered by homeowners insurance, putting increasing financial pressure on government programs and thus on taxpayers.", "GAO was asked to study the possibility of private insurers providing more comprehensive insurance. This report addresses (1) what perils homeowners policies typically cover and exclude, (2) how exclusions impact homeowners and taxpayers and the potential benefits of more comprehensive coverage, and (3) what additional perils insurers might be willing to cover and what challenges are associated with expanding policies. GAO reviewed homeowners insurance policies and conducted interviews with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, other industry organizations, consumer advocates, and risk experts, among others.", "GAO requested comments on a draft of this report from the Federal Insurance Office and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.

The insurance industry considers these perils insurable because they are accidental, predictable, and do not involve catastrophic losses. These policies also typically exclude losses from a number of perils, including disasters caused by floods, earthquakes, and war. Industry officials said that such events are difficult to predict and involve extensive losses that are a challenge for private insurers to cover. Insurers also exclude losses from defective products, which industry participants said could be addressed by manufacturer warranties and commercial general liability insurance. Intentional losses; damage from wear, tear, or neglect; and losses caused simultaneously by covered and uncovered perils, such as wind (covered) and flood (uncovered) during a hurricane are also generally excluded.", "Policy exclusions can impact homeowners, communities, and state and federal governments. When excluded losses occur, they can create significant costs for homeowners to repair homes and replace possessions. Wide-scale catastrophes can also cause shortages of building materials and contractors that delay reconstruction and substantially increase the costs of repairing homes. When damage to properties caused by excluded losses is not repaired, affected communities may experience blight and face reduced tax revenue. When federal and state governments have stepped in to cover what private insurers exclude, taxpayers may face a significant expense. In addition to federal disaster assistance, the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) paid more than $7 billion in claims after Superstorm Sandy. In Florida, insurers and policyholders can be assessed extra charges to help pay for state efforts to cover wind damage where it is not covered by insurers. Industry participants suggested that expanded private coverage could provide additional protection for homeowners and reduce reliance on government programs, but the resulting policy premiums would likely be prohibitively expensive for many homeowners.", "Multiple factors make expanding private coverage challenging and several conditions would need to be addressed for insurers to offer more comprehensive insurance. A main challenge is that expanded coverage would have higher costs, potentially limiting consumer demand. Even if insurers charged higher rates that were based on risk, the severity and unpredictability of catastrophic losses could still jeopardize insurers' solvency. Some industry participants said that insurers and others are discussing possibilities for expanding private homeowners coverage, with a focus on risk-based premiums, mitigation efforts, effective building codes, and sound land use policies. The challenging mix of financial risk, political and regulatory issues, policy cost, and consumer demand has thus far prevented private sector insurers in the U.S. from offering flood insurance to homeowners, let alone more comprehensive or all-perils policies. Because of this mix of factors, some in the insurance industry have suggested that a continuing financial role by federal and possibly state governments may be required, and that ensuring a response to the impact of disasters and other perils will require the cooperation and resources of government, homeowners, and insurers, as well as balance in the assumption of risk and cost by each of these parties."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Homeowners in the United States are exposed to a wide range of  disasters, including hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, and wildfires, and  may also experience losses from lightning, hail, and fire, among other  perils.

As of  2012, properties in hurricane-prone areas on the coast had an insured  value of about $15 trillion, with Florida, New York, and Texas having the  greatest risk exposure. In addition to floods and hurricanes, some states  such as California face risks such as earthquakes and wildfires while  Florida faces risks from sinkholes. With more people moving to coastal  areas, the possibility of more frequent and severe weather could impact  the ability of homeowners and insurers to protect homes and other  property. These and other risks underscore the importance of insurance  to help protect homes and property from various hazards. Homeowners  insurance, however, does not cover all types of perils and some  homeowners may not clearly understand what protection their policy  includes and excludes until after an event occurs.

The loss must result  from chance and not be something that is certain to happen. If a  future loss were sure to occur, coverage would have to be priced at  the full value of the loss plus an additional amount for the expenses  incurred.", "Losses that are not catastrophic. The losses should not affect a very  large percentage of an insurance company\u2019s policyholders at the  same time in, for example, a limited geographic area. The losses  should be independent of each other in order to spread and minimize  risk. Additionally, the peril should not be so catastrophic that the  insurer would be unable to charge a sufficient premium to cover the  exposure.", "Losses for which the law of large numbers applies. There must be a  sufficiently large number of homogeneous units exposed to random  losses, both historically and prospectively, to make the future losses  reasonably predictable. This principle works best when there are  many losses with similar characteristics spread across a large group.  The greater the experience with losses, the better insurers can  estimate both the frequency and severity of future losses.", "When these criteria are generally satisfied, the insurer can add other  expenses and profits to the expected losses and determine a price that is  appropriate for the risk. Insurers may still decide to offer insurance for  risks that deviate from these ideal characteristics.

According to some industry participants, some perils are  excluded because they do not meet the criteria for insurable risks. For  example, perils that result in catastrophic losses are generally infrequent,  high-impact events that are difficult to predict and measure. The chances  of these events occurring are difficult to calculate, and the losses can be  so large and simultaneously impact so many homeowners that they could  jeopardize a company\u2019s solvency because the insurer may not have  sufficient capital to pay out the large number of claims. Examples of these  types of risks include flood, earthquake, war, and nuclear hazard.", "Other risks are excluded because they could raise moral hazard issues if  they were covered and because they are not accidental. Moral hazard is  an increase in the probability of loss caused by the policyholder\u2019s  behavior\u2014for example, intentional loss, neglect, deterioration, and lack of  maintenance. According to some industry participants, if these risks were  covered, homeowners could, for example, neglect their roofs or not  address mold problems and then file claims for replacement and  remediation. Further they noted that these types of risks also fall outside  the realm of insurance because they are not sudden or accidental and are  generally unpredictable.", "Some industry participants also said that homeowners policies list  defective products as exclusions for a couple of reasons. First, they said  that defective products are listed as exclusions because insurers would  find it difficult and impractical to evaluate the wide range of manufactured  products to determine the likelihood and extent of defects and price this  risk for policies accordingly. Second, they suggested that manufacturers  are responsible for defects in their products, and product warranties and  commercial general liability insurance can help affected homeowners.  For example, some homeowners affected by defective drywall may  receive compensation from settlements partly funded by commercial  general liability insurance policies held by companies responsible for the  distribution or installation of defective drywall. Additionally, some  homeowners impacted by defective drywall have filed insurance claims  through their homeowners\u2019 insurance policies, and litigation in multiple  states will determine the extent to which coverage for this drywall is  covered by homeowners insurance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Coverage Depends on Several Factors, Including Policy Provisions and Location", "paragraphs": ["Certain provisions found in homeowners policies can also affect  coverage. Some industry participants cited as an example anticoncurrent  causation clauses. For example, under these clauses, if damage is  simultaneously caused by both an excluded peril (such as flood) and a  covered peril (wind), coverage is excluded for that loss. They noted that  these clauses presented a particular challenge for owners of coastal  properties when hurricanes occurred. Cases challenging the  enforceability of the anticoncurrent clause arose after the 2005 hurricane  season because damage to properties may have resulted from a  combination of high winds and flooding. According to reports, this clause  may similarly become an issue for homeowners in the aftermath of  Superstorm Sandy. In addition to the anticoncurrent causation clause,  policies may also contain conditions that policyholders are required to  comply with in order to maintain coverage. Under the HO-3 policy, for  example, homeowners must provide prompt notice to their insurance  company or agent following a loss and are also required to protect  property from further damage once a loss has occurred. Failure to comply  with these types of requirements may result in a loss of coverage.", "In addition, the facts and conditions surrounding the loss event\u2014including  the cause of the damages and court decisions\u2014may also impact  coverage. For example, according to some industry participants, an HO-3  policy typically excludes mold damage. However, mold damage that is  hidden within walls or ceilings, or beneath the floors of a structure, that  results from the accidental discharge or overflow of water or steam from  within a plumbing or heating system may be covered, among other things.  Further, the HO-3 policy typically covers theft of personal property from a  home. However, theft in a home that is under construction, for example,  may not be covered. Court decisions may also impact coverage when  disputes between policyholders and insurers end up in litigation,  something that can take time to resolve. Ultimately, whether a loss is  covered in these cases may depend on how the court interprets the  policy. Following Hurricane Katrina, for example, some coverage disputes  raised the question of whether a policy\u2019s flood exclusion language clearly  excluded a water-related event, such as storm surge, that caused the  damage at issue.", "Coverage may also depend on where homeowners live and whether they  have purchased endorsements\u2014optional coverage that alters a policy\u2019s  terms and conditions that can be added at an additional cost\u2014or have  other insurance policies. For example, homeowners policies typically do  not cover flood damage, but flood insurance may be available through  NFIP, depending on where a home is located. Additionally, private  insurers sometimes exclude coverage for wind-related damage to  properties in coastal areas, requiring policyholders to either pay an  additional premium for wind-related risks or purchase a supplemental  policy for wind-related damages. In such cases, this supplemental  coverage is typically provided by a state-sponsored wind insurance pool  that has been created to address shortages in the availability of private  insurance for wind-related risks. In Florida, for example, coverage is  provided through its state insurance entity, the Citizens Property  Insurance Corporation (Citizens).", "Earthquakes and sinkholes are two other perils that are also typically  excluded from homeowners policies but that may be covered by a  separate policy or an endorsement in some states. In California, for  example, state law requires all residential property insurance companies  to offer earthquake coverage to homeowners. In offering earthquake  coverage, insurance companies can manage the risk themselves,  contract with an affiliated or non-affiliated insurer, or become members of  the California Earthquake Authority (CEA), a publicly-managed but  privately funded entity that offers residential earthquake policies.  Similarly, sinkhole coverage is typically excluded under the earth  movement exclusion found in standard homeowners policies, but in  Florida, the state requires insurers to offer catastrophic ground cover  collapse, which is a narrow form of coverage that protects against the  total loss of a home due to sinkholes. Florida does not require any other  sinkhole coverage to be included in homeowners policies, but insurers  are required to offer additional sinkhole coverage.

Figures  1 and 2 illustrate the damage caused by two perils, floods and sinkholes,  which are typically excluded from homeowners policies.", "In addition to paying for excluded losses on their own, one industry  organization said that homeowners may have to pay additional out-of- pocket expenses for temporary housing or a car rental that may not be  covered by a homeowners policy. When impacted by a disaster,  homeowners may need these types of rentals for many months, and they  can be costly.", "Further, industry participants said that rebuilding after a disaster can  present additional challenges for homeowners. One industry organization  said that catastrophes can cause shortages of building contractors and  building supplies that can delay reconstruction. This phenomenon is  known as \u201cdemand surge.\u201d In these circumstances, the short-term costs  of repairing and rebuilding homes can escalate substantially. Another  industry participant noted that homeowners can also have their policies  cancelled if home repairs are not adequate.", "Disasters and excluded perils also sometimes highlight differences  between consumers\u2019 expectations for insurance and actual policy  coverage, resulting in added frustrations for homeowners. According to  some industry participants with whom we spoke, some consumers may  not learn what their policy actually covers until losses occur. For example,  one industry association recalled that some consumers who had recent  problems with drywall sourced from China filed insurance claims through  their homeowners policies. As noted earlier, litigation in multiple states  may determine the extent to which homeowners insurance applies to  losses associated with this drywall.", "Others may not understand their coverage well enough to know what is  covered, what is excluded, and what loss events and circumstances  might result in paid, partially paid, or denied claims. For example,  according to a 2013 survey conducted by one industry organization, many  homeowners mistakenly believe that their homeowners policies cover  flooding from a hurricane. According to some industry participants,  homeowners policies can be difficult to understand because they often  are long, technical, legal documents. One consumer advocate we spoke  with suggested that few tools exist to help consumers understand their  coverage, and noted that even though some states have policy readability  requirements and disclosure rules about coverage and exclusions, these  measures do not help consumers understand their policies. Other  participants said that many homeowners do not read their policies or  study them closely. Additional analysis would be needed to determine to  what extent readability requirements, disclosure rules, or other factors  impact homeowners\u2019 ability to understand their policies.", "In addition to the devastation disasters may cause homeowners,  neighborhoods and communities can also be impacted if some  homeowners are unable to rebuild because they do not have coverage for  a loss. Damaged homes that are not rebuilt can result in blight and affect  the willingness of others to rebuild. A neighborhood where property is  vacant or deteriorated will also likely impact the property value of  surrounding homes. In addition, when some homeowners do not rebuild,  communities may experience a diminution of the tax base. Collecting less  in property taxes can impact the ability of communities to fund schools,  libraries, parks, and roads, among other uses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Government Coverage of Excluded Losses Can Involve Costs and Risks to Taxpayers", "paragraphs": ["Both the federal and some state governments offer disaster assistance  and other programs to help homeowners with some of the perils that  private insurers do not cover, and this support can rely on taxpayer as  well as policyholder resources. At the federal level, the government  provides a range of assistance to individuals after major disasters. This  assistance is generally made available after the President issues a  disaster declaration under the authority of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster  Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (the Stafford Act), and is  administered by various federal agencies through various programs.  FEMA, for example, provides disaster relief and recovery assistance to  individual citizens through its Individuals and Households Program (IHP),  which is intended to provide money and services, including assistance in  repairing and replacing damaged homes, to people in a disaster area  when losses are not generally covered by insurance. The growing  number of major disaster declarations has contributed to an increase in  federal expenditures for disaster assistance, however. For example,  through January 31, 2012, FEMA obligated $80.3 billion in disaster relief,  including $23.5 billion in individual assistance, for 539 disasters declared  during fiscal years 2004 through 2011. More recently, Superstorm  Sandy has also involved significant federal disaster assistance. In  January 2013, Congress passed and the President signed the Disaster  Relief Appropriations Act of 2013 and the Sandy Recovery Improvement  Act of 2013, which provided about $50 billion in federal assistance to  support rebuilding efforts.", "In addition to providing disaster assistance, the federal government also  offers flood insurance to homeowners through NFIP, a program that  involves significant costs for the government and ultimately for taxpayers.  According to FEMA information, as of September 2013, there were 5.6  million flood insurance policies in force in almost 22,000 communities  across the United States. In years when losses were high, NFIP has used  statutory authority to borrow funds from the Department of the Treasury  (Treasury) to pay claims and keep the program solvent. For example,  NFIP borrowed $16.8 billion from Treasury to cover claims for the 2005  hurricanes\u2014primarily Hurricane Katrina\u2014and received additional  borrowing authority in the amount of $9.7 billion following Superstorm  Sandy in 2012. As of October 2013, NFIP owed Treasury $24 billion.  NFIP is generally expected to cover its claim payments and operating  expenses with the premiums it collects. However, NFIP has sold some  flood insurance policies at subsidized rates to help keep flood insurance  affordable, and these subsidized policies have been a financial burden on  the program because of their relatively high losses and premium rates  that are not actuarially based. As a result, the annual amount that NFIP  collects in both full-risk and subsidized premiums is generally not enough  to cover its operating costs, claim payments, and principal and interest  payments for the debt owed to Treasury, especially in years of  catastrophic flooding, such as 2005. This arrangement results in much  of the financial risk of flooding being transferred to the federal government  and ultimately the taxpayer. As shown in figure 3 below, NFIP has  handled a significant number of claims and paid losses for flood events  caused by hurricanes and a superstorm since 2005.", "Some states, such as Florida, have created residual insurance pools to  cover what the private market will not, sometimes at a cost to  policyholders and taxpayers across the state. In Florida, Citizens  provides homeowners coverage, including for wind damage, for those  who cannot find coverage from private insurers. If Citizens\u2019 funds are  depleted by paying claims after a catastrophic event, Florida law requires  that Citizens charge assessments until any deficits are eliminated.  Citizens\u2019 policyholders are the first to be assessed, and if necessary,  additional assessments can be levied against certain private insurance  companies, who can then pass the cost of these assessments on to their  policyholders.  This ability to levy assessments provides Citizens with  resources to pay claims to policyholders.", "Storms in 2004 and 2005, for example, resulted in more than $30 billion  in insured damage in Florida. Citizens sustained deficits of $515 million  and $1.8 billion, respectively, in those years. To fund its 2004 deficit,  Citizens assessed insurance companies and surplus lines policyholders  over $515 million in regular assessments. To fund the 2005 deficit, the  Florida legislature appropriated $715 million from the Florida general  revenue fund, reducing the size of the regular assessment from $878  million to $163 million. In 2005, the Florida legislature also directed  Citizens to amortize the collection of the emergency assessment for the  remaining $888 million deficit over a 10-year period, resulting in an  emergency assessment levied beginning in June 2007.

First, according to some industry  participants homeowners would have more protection because more  perils would be covered under their policy. Second, some industry  participants noted that more comprehensive coverage could lead to less  ambiguity for consumers seeking to understand their policies. Policies  with fewer exclusions and conditions for coverage would be simpler and  more efficient for insurers to write and consumers to understand than  having separate policies for homeowners, flood, and in some states, wind  coverage. Third, some industry participants said that enhanced coverage  could reduce litigation and disputes between policyholders and insurers  over coverage. For example, a policy that offered more comprehensive  coverage could reduce disputes over the anticoncurrent causation clause,  often over whether wind or water caused residential damage, something  some industry participants noted is a particular challenge for homeowners  when hurricanes occur.", "Assuming homeowners purchased expanded private coverage without  government subsidies, these policies could also reduce reliance on  federal and state programs. According to some industry participants, if  homeowners policies covered flooding, for example, fewer taxpayer  resources may be needed for paying NFIP\u2019s claims and subsidized  premiums. In addition to having benefits at the federal level, greater  private coverage could also reduce or eliminate the need for state-based  insurance mechanisms, such as state wind pool coverage, and the  insurer and policyholder assessments they can involve. Moreover,  expanded coverage could encourage more informed decisions by  homeowners. For instance, expanded coverage with more accurate  pricing for risk could provide beneficial information to consumers on the  risk associated with their housing location decisions and could encourage  more consumers to mitigate risks to their property or to not locate to high- risk areas.", "Notwithstanding these potential benefits, expanded coverage would likely  increase insurance premiums for homeowners. According to some  industry participants with whom we spoke, the increase could amount to  several times what some homeowners currently pay. For example, one  industry organization said that a policy that covered flood, earthquake,  sinkholes, and some other perils could cost homeowners anywhere from  three to five times what homeowners pay now, while another estimated  that the cost of a policy that covered nearly all the currently excluded  perils could exceed $15,000 annually. Other industry participants said the  cost for this coverage would be so high that many homeowners would be  unable to afford it. Additionally, FEMA information on the changes to the  cost of flood insurance following the Biggert-Waters Act and the  elimination of some subsidized rates may further illustrate how costly  expanded coverage could potentially be for some homeowners.  According to FEMA information, the cost of a NFIP policy for a home  located in a very high-risk area without a subsidy could exceed $20,000 in  annual premiums for certain policyholders."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Multiple Challenges Make Expanding Private Coverage Difficult", "paragraphs": ["Several factors make it challenging for private insurers to offer all-perils  homeowners insurance, or even more comprehensive policies.

Insurers manage risk by  charging appropriate rates and diversifying their risk pool. Industry  participants with whom we spoke said that if only riskier households\u2014for  example, those located near the coasts or rivers\u2014were the primary  purchasers of expanded coverage, insurers might end up with an  insurance pool with concentrated risk and policies that could cause losses  that may jeopardize insurers\u2019 profitability and solvency.", "A requirement that insurers offer and homeowners purchase more  comprehensive coverage may reduce this problem but raises questions  about how such a requirement would be implemented. Further, some  questioned whether it would be fair to require those living in low-risk  areas to purchase expanded coverage they may not need, in effect  subsidizing those living in high-risk areas. One industry organization said  that legislative or regulatory attempts to mandate all-perils coverage could  destabilize the insurance marketplace in certain high-risk areas such as  coastal regions and floodplains. It could also cause private insurers to  further limit their exposures in disaster-prone areas, and some insurers  may withdraw from the market altogether. Industry participants suggested  that offering policies that covered all losses could also raise issues of  moral hazard, or incentivize risky behavior by homeowners. For example,  comprehensive policies may encourage people to locate their homes in  high-risk areas.

However, some industry participants with whom we spoke said that  getting regulators to approve rates that insurers determined would be  appropriate for certain risks has been difficult and that getting approval for  rates that could be several times more expensive than those currently in  force would be an important challenge. One regulator, however, said that  inability to charge higher risk-based rates might not be an issue because  loss experience is a critical factor that drives rates. If insurers faced  greater losses by covering more perils, they would likely be able to justify  and gain approval for higher premiums.

Private insurers could play a greater role in coverage  with the federal government possibly serving as an insurer for only the  highest risk properties.

The possibility of improved data,  better risk modeling, and emerging private-sector interest, however,  suggest that some additional coverage may be possible. For this to  happen, private insurers must be able to assess and diversify risk and  charge rates adequate for the risk they are assuming. At the same time,  consumers will need to better recognize the risk and cost of their housing  decisions and the likely higher rates that come with protecting homes and  possessions in certain locations. One of the most fundamental challenges  is achieving a policy premium rate that allows insurers to stay solvent and  meet their obligations to consumers, yet is affordable enough so that  consumers are willing and able to buy insurance.
