In July 2006, SORNA was enacted, which established minimum standards for sex offender registration and notification. Congressional requesters asked GAO to assess registration of alien sex offenders. This report addresses the extent to which alien sex offenders (1) under ICE-ERO order of supervision are registered and (2) who are removed or released under ICE-ERO order of supervision are informed of registration requirements and relevant jurisdiction officials are notified about these offenders. GAO analyzed a representative sample of 131 of 1,309 alien sex offenders who were under orders of supervision as of September 2012.

According to officials, offenders were not required to register for various reasons, such as the offense not requiring registration in some states. Of the 6 offenders in GAO's sample that should have registered, officials from ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations (ICE-ERO) field offices informed 4 of their registration requirements. However, officials at some of these field offices identified several reasons why they did not ensure that these offenders actually registered. For example, the offender may have moved and no longer resided in the area of responsibility for that particular field office. ICE had not informed the remaining 2 offenders of their registration requirements.", "Alien sex offenders are not consistently informed of potential registration requirements, and relevant jurisdiction officials--that is, state, territorial, and tribal sex offender registry and law enforcement officials--are not consistently notified when an offender is removed from the country or released. The Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act of 2006 (SORNA) and other federal laws identify when sex offenders and relevant jurisdiction officials should be notified. However, the agencies that have these notification responsibilities are limited in their ability to provide information to and about alien sex offenders, in part because they do not know when ICE-ERO will release or remove these offenders. ICE-ERO has a procedure in place to inform alien sex offenders who are being removed about potential registration requirements, but not alien sex offenders who are being released into the community under supervision, primarily because ICE-ERO is uncertain whether it has a responsibility to do so. ICE-ERO also does not consistently notify relevant jurisdiction officials when an alien sex offender is removed or released under supervision, for similar reasons. However, officials from the Department of Justice's Sex Offender Sentencing, Monitoring, Apprehending, Registering, and Tracking (SMART) Office said that state correctional facilities, in the interest of public safety, have notification processes in place, even though sometimes not required to do so. ICE-ERO is reviewing options for informing alien sex offenders under supervision about their potential registration requirements and notifying jurisdictions when alien sex offenders are released under supervision, but has not established a deadline for completing its review, which is inconsistent with project management standards. Without a deadline, it will be difficult to hold ICE-ERO accountable for providing these notifications. Further, ICE-ERO does not plan to notify relevant jurisdictions when an alien sex offender is removed. Providing such notification could help jurisdictions ensure public safety and avoid unnecessarily spending resources trying to locate the offender.", "This is a public version of a sensitive security report GAO issued in August 2013, which also included information about steps ICE has taken to determine its responsibility for informing alien sex offenders of their notification requirements."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends, among other things, that ICE-ERO (1) set a deadline for its review of options for providing notifications to and about alien sex offenders under supervision and (2) in consultation with SMART and others, consider options for notifying jurisdictions about removed offenders.

ICE-ERO prioritizes the removal of convicted criminals, among other  groups. However, there are circumstances in which criminal aliens who  have been ordered removed from the United States\u2014including those  convicted of a sex offense\u2014cannot be removed. For example, a criminal  alien may not be removed because the designated country will not accept  the alien\u2019s return. The decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in Zadvydas v.  Davis imposes strict limits on ICE\u2019s ability to detain aliens beyond 6  months after the issuance of a final order of removal if removal is not  significantly likely in the reasonably foreseeable future. In these  instances, ICE-ERO may release the alien into the community under an  order of supervision. According to U.S. Immigration and Customs  Enforcement (ICE), of the 59,347 aliens under an order of supervision as  of September 2012, 2,837 (5 percent) of them had been convicted of a  sex offense.", "Given the risk that some individuals previously convicted of a sex offense  may pose, in July 2006, Congress passed and the President signed the  Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act of 2006 (SORNA), which  provided a new set of sex offender registration and notification standards,  including criminal penalties for those who fail to comply with these  standards. These standards require convicted sex offenders to register  and keep the registration current in the state, territorial, or tribal  jurisdictions in which they live, work, and attend school, and for initial  registration purposes only, in the jurisdiction in which they were  convicted, if such jurisdiction is different from the jurisdiction of  residence. Registration generally entails convicted sex offenders  appearing in person at a specified agency\u2014often a local law enforcement  agency\u2014within the jurisdiction to provide the agency with personal  information, such as name, date of birth, and Social Security number,  among other information. The law enforcement agency enters this  information into the jurisdiction\u2019s sex offender registry, and the agency  that manages the jurisdiction\u2019s registry\u2014such as the state police  department, department of public safety, or the attorney general\u2019s office\u2014 enters this information into the national sex offender registration system,  composed of a national database and a national website. The national  database, called the National Sex Offender Registry (NSOR), is operated  by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), while the national website\u2014 the Dru Sjodin National Sex Offender Public Website (public website)\u2014is  maintained by the Sex Offender Sentencing, Monitoring, Apprehending,  Registering, and Tracking (SMART) Office within the Department of  Justice (DOJ).

For this  review, we assessed the extent to which aliens living under order of  supervision were registered as sex offenders in the jurisdictions of  residence. Specifically, this report addresses the following questions:   In August 2013, we began another review on progress  (1) To what extent are alien sex offenders under an ICE-ERO order of  supervision registered as sex offenders?  (2) To what extent are alien sex offenders who are removed from the  country or released under an ICE-ERO order of supervision informed  of registration requirements, and state sex offender registry and law  enforcement officials notified about these offenders?", "This report is a public version of the prior sensitive report that we  provided to you. ICE deemed some of the information in the prior report  as For Official Use Only (FOUO), which must be protected from public  disclosure. Therefore, this report omits information about additional steps  that ICE has taken, or could take, to determine what, if any, responsibility  ICE-ERO has with regard to informing alien sex offenders of their  registration requirements. The information in this report is more limited in  scope as it excludes such sensitive information, but the overall questions  and methodology used for both reports is the same.", "To address our objectives, we drew a random probability sample of 137  of the 1,369 alien sex offenders who, as of September 2012, were under  order of supervision and for whom ICE had a record of the alien\u2019s  complete date of birth. We subsequently found that six individuals from  our sample should not have been included in the population of alien sex  offenders under an ICE-ERO order of supervision, resulting in a final  sample size of 131 and an estimated total population of 1,309.Percentage estimates derived from this sample have margins of error at  the 95 percent confidence level of plus or minus 8.08 percentage points.  We chose September 2012 because we requested this information as  part of a separate review, and this date provided us with current  information at the time.", "To determine whether each alien sex offender in our sample was  registered in the state where the offender resides, in February and March  2013, we searched the public website. On the basis of the search results,  we divided the alien sex offenders into three categories: (1) definitely  included in the public website, meaning there was an exact match on the  name and date of birth for the alien sex offender in the public website; (2)  possibly included in the public website, meaning there was a partial or  similar name, date of birth, or age in the public website (e.g., J. Smith as  opposed to John Smith), but not an exact match; and (3) definitely not  included in the public website, meaning the public website did not include  the offender\u2019s exact name or date of birth or even a partial or similar  name, date of birth, or age. For the offenders who were possibly included  and definitely not included in the public website, using the addresses ICE- ERO provided to us, we contacted sex offender registration officials in  each of the 27 states where these offenders were located to determine  whether the officials were aware of the offenders and whether the  offenders were registered. We assessed the reliability of the data ICE  provided by questioning knowledgeable agency officials and reviewing  the data for obvious errors and anomalies. We determined that the data  were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "To determine the extent to which alien sex offenders who are removed  from the country or under ICE-ERO order of supervision are informed of  registration requirements, and whether relevant sex offender registration  and law enforcement officials are notified about these offenders, we  reviewed SORNA, other applicable laws, and guidelines developed by the  SMART Office to obtain information on federal sex offender registration  requirements. We also met with policy officials from the ICE-ERO  Executive Information and Reporting Unit; the Director and policy  advisors for the SMART office; officials from the U.S. Marshals Service  (USMS); headquarters officials with the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP);  and state sex offender registry and local law enforcement officials in  Minnesota, Florida, and Maryland. We selected Minnesota and Florida  because they are among the states where the largest number of alien sex  offenders in our sample who were not included in the public website  reside. We selected Maryland because local law enforcement officials in  this state had raised concerns about the registration of alien sex  offenders during our prior work, which we completed in February 2013.  In addition, we conducted phone interviews with ICE-ERO field office  directors and deputy directors in the field offices that either released or  currently supervise the alien sex offenders in our sample who were not  registered, but potentially should have been. We also conducted phone  interviews with U.S. Marshals Service officials in these same locations.  While these officials\u2019 perspectives cannot be generalized to all states and  to all ICE-ERO and U.S. Marshals Service field offices, they provided  insights into the registration of alien sex offenders under order of  supervision. We compared the sex offender notification requirements in  SORNA and other federal statutes with the notifications that state and  federal agencies provide to alien sex offenders to determine if there were  any gaps. We then obtained perspectives from the federal, state, and  local officials we interviewed on how best to address these gaps. We also  compared efforts that ICE-ERO has under way regarding notifications to  and about alien sex offenders with internal control standards pertaining to  communication with stakeholders and program management standards  that involve establishing milestone dates and deadlines.

State registry and local law enforcement  officials in our review also provided examples of how their lack of  awareness about removed alien sex offenders, in particular, could pose a  risk to public safety. For example, registry officials in one state said that  there have been instances when they were not aware that an alien sex  offender had been removed from the country until the sex offender  subsequently returned to the United States, committed another offense,  and ended up back in the state criminal justice system. Local law  enforcement officials from another state described an instance in which  they were not aware that an alien sex offender had been removed from  the country until the offender returned to the United States and was  subsequently arrested for committing another sex offense against the  same child that he had previously victimized. According to the data that  ICE-ERO provided to us, of the 4,359 alien sex offenders who were  removed from the country between January and August 2012, 220 of  them (5 percent) had previously been removed but subsequently returned  to the United States and were arrested for another offense. As we  reported in February 2013, the FBI is in the process of developing a  mechanism by which the U.S. Marshals Service and relevant jurisdiction  officials will be notified when a sex offender who has been registered in  the United States legally reenters the country.", "18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4042(c). way to ensure that they are aware of alien sex offenders whom ICE-ERO  has in custody, removed from the country, or released under supervision  is for ICE-ERO to tell the officials."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "ICE-ERO Plans to Review Notification Options for Offenders under Supervision, but Has Not Set a Deadline for Doing So, and Does Not Plan to Consider Options for Removed Offenders", "paragraphs": ["ICE-ERO plans to review options to help address notification gaps  pertaining to alien sex offenders who are released under order of  supervision, but has not established a deadline for when it will complete  this review. ICE-ERO, however, does not plan to consider options for  notifying jurisdictions when an alien sex offender is removed from the  country, which, as discussed previously, could have an impact on a  jurisdiction\u2019s ability to monitor these individuals if they return to the United  States.", "As a result of our review, in May 2013, officials from ICE-ERO, the U.S.  Marshals Service, and the SMART Office met to discuss notification gaps  with regard to registration of alien sex offenders and options for  addressing these gaps. However, the agencies were not able to agree to  a solution at that time, in part because of ICE-ERO officials\u2019 concerns  about their organization\u2019s lack of authority and responsibility regarding  sex offender registration. Officials we interviewed from the U.S. Marshals  Service and the SMART Office stated that ICE-ERO was in the best  position to inform alien sex offenders about potential registration  requirements, and to notify relevant jurisdiction officials\u2014either state  registry or law enforcement officials\u2014when an alien sex offender is  removed from the country or released, because ICE-ERO is the last  federal agency that has had contact with these offenders and releases  these offenders from custody into the community.", "However, in addition to uncertainty regarding ICE-ERO\u2019s authority and  responsibility, ICE-ERO officials identified other concerns about providing  these notifications. Specifically, officials we interviewed in the five ICE- ERO field offices included in our review said that because they are  responsible for supervising such a large number of aliens\u2014anywhere  from 750 to 3,000 at any point in time\u2014they would not have the time or  resources to notify jurisdiction officials when an alien sex offender is  released or removed from the country. However, as noted previously,  alien sex offenders make up a relatively small fraction (5 percent) of  aliens under ICE supervision, in which case providing these notifications  may not pose a significant resource burden on ICE-ERO. Further, ICE- ERO officials as well as one of the five ICE-ERO field offices in our review  said that they thought that, to notify jurisdiction officials, they would first  have to confirm that the alien does in fact have to register in that state,  which could be very time-consuming. However, under SORNA, the state  is responsible for determining whether a convicted sex offender is  required to register, in which case ICE-ERO would not have to do so prior  to providing notice of the offender\u2019s release.", "ICE-ERO officials also stated that SORNA also requires individuals  convicted of certain crimes against children that are not sex offenses\u2014 such as kidnapping\u2014to register as sex offenders. However, these  officials explained that it would be difficult for deportation officers to  determine whether aliens under their supervision were convicted of a  crime that is not a sex offense but may require registration. We  acknowledge that this could be a challenge and an issue that the SMART  Office may be able to help ICE-ERO resolve. Moreover, officials from all  five ICE-ERO field offices in our review said that even if they informed  alien sex offenders of their registration requirements, the officials would  not be able to take any action to enforce these requirements even when  registering as a sex offender is a condition of release for aliens under  ICE-ERO supervision. However, ICE-ERO could notify all offenders who  are released on supervision, as it does for offenders who are removed  from the country, and then state and local law enforcement would be  responsible for enforcing registration requirements. Also, if ICE-ERO  notifies jurisdiction officials of the offender\u2019s release, these officials would  be able to identify those offenders who did not register after their release;  ICE-ERO would not have to assume this responsibility. Finally, officials  from two ICE-ERO field offices in our review said that they would not  know who, specifically, to contact at the state registry to notify it that ICE- ERO is deporting or releasing an alien sex offender. However, the  SMART Office maintains points of contact for each state, territory, and  tribal sex offender registration agency, which the SMART Office could  provide to ICE-ERO.", "In July 2013, an ICE-ERO official stated that ICE-ERO will begin  reviewing options to accomplish the goal of sex offender notification, to  include efforts to inform alien sex offenders of their potential registration  requirements and to notify jurisdictions of alien sex offenders who are  released under order of supervision. However, ICE-ERO did not provide a  deadline for when it plans to complete its review of the various options.  Standard practices for project management state that managing a project,  such as ICE-ERO\u2019s review, involves developing a timeline with milestone  dates. Further, Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government call for agencies to ensure that there are adequate means of  communicating with, and obtaining information from, external  stakeholders that may have a significant impact on the agency achieving  its goals. By developing a deadline for when it will complete its  assessment of options for providing notifications to and about alien sex  offenders, ICE-ERO will help to ensure that any public safety concerns  that may arise as a result of the current notification gaps\u2014such as law  enforcement officials being unaware of sex offenders living in their  jurisdictions\u2014are mitigated in a timely manner. Finally, communicating  the results of its assessment with federal stakeholders will help provide  clarity going forward with regard to who has responsibility for notifying  alien sex offenders of their potential registration requirements.", "Although ICE-ERO plans to address notification gaps regarding alien sex  offenders under order of supervision, it does not plan to consider options  for notifying relevant jurisdictions when an alien sex offender is removed  from the country. ICE-ERO stated that it already updates NCIC\u2014which is  routinely accessed by law enforcement officials\u2014when an alien sex  offender is removed, including the date of the removal. However, if law  enforcement officials were last told that the alien sex offender was in ICE- ERO custody, they may not have a reason to search NCIC to determine  the status of the offenders. Given the threat that alien sex offenders who  are removed from and return to the United States may pose to public  safety, developing an appropriate mechanism for informing relevant  jurisdictions when an alien sex offender has been removed from the  country will assist jurisdiction officials in ensuring that all alien sex  offenders have been registered. This will facilitate the monitoring of these  sex offenders in the event that they return to the United States. Such  notification would also prevent jurisdictions from spending limited  resources trying to locate these offenders because they were not aware  that the offenders had been removed from the country. Other federal  agencies, including the SMART Office, U.S. Marshals Service, and BOP,  may have resources and information that are useful for ICE-ERO in  developing a mechanism for notifying relevant jurisdictions when an alien  sex offender is removed from the country. For example, SMART  maintains contact information for all state, territorial, and tribal registry  agencies. Also, internal control standards call for agencies to ensure that  there are adequate means of communicating with, and obtaining  information from, external stakeholders that may have a significant impact  on the agency\u2019s achieving its goals. Therefore, consulting with these  agencies could be beneficial for ICE-ERO in developing this notification  mechanism."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Without mechanisms in place to consistently inform alien sex offenders  who are released under ICE-ERO supervision about their registration  requirements, and consistently notify jurisdictions when an alien sex  offender has been removed from the country or released under  supervision, the risk that alien sex offenders will reside in U.S.  communities without being registered is increased. ICE-ERO is in the  process of a review to determine whether continued use of the Form I- 220B addendum as a means to notify alien sex offenders of their potential  registration requirements is warranted; however, ICE-ERO has not set a  deadline for timely completion of this review. A deadline will help enhance  accountability for completion of this effort, which is important because  until this review is completed, there will continue to be uncertainty as to  whether and how ICE-ERO should be notifying alien sex offenders who  are released under order of supervision of their duty to register. In  addition, a time frame for when ICE-ERO will complete its assessment of  options for notifying alien sex offenders of their potential registration  requirements will help provide accountability for completing this important  effort. Also, communicating the results of ICE-ERO\u2019s assessment with  federal stakeholders will help provide clarity going forward with regard to  who has responsibility for notifying alien sex offenders of their potential  registration requirements.

ICE-ERO plans to complete its review and assessment by  October 31, 2013. Establishing such a deadline for the completion of  these efforts will help ensure that ICE-ERO can be held accountable for  identifying and effectuating any actions they deem appropriate to help  ensure that alien sex offenders are indeed registered.

(2) To what extent are alien sex offenders who are removed from the  country or released under an ICE-ERO order of supervision informed of  registration requirements, and state sex offender registry and law  enforcement officials notified about these offenders?", "To address our objectives, we requested that ICE-ERO provide the  names and dates of birth for all alien sex offenders who were under  orders of supervision as of September 2012. We chose this date because  we requested this information as part of a separate review and this date  provided us with current information at the time. ICE-ERO provided us  with the names for 2,837 alien sex offenders under orders of supervision  as of September 2012. However, ICE-ERO was able to provide us only  with a complete date of birth\u2014which is important for verifying the identity  of these individuals\u2014for 1,369 of these alien offenders. We drew a  random probability sample of 137 of the 1,369 alien sex offenders with  complete dates of birth. We subsequently found that six individuals in our  sample should not have been included in the population of alien sex  offenders under supervision, resulting in a final sample size of 131 and an  estimated total population of 1,309. We determined whether each alien  sex offender, as of March 2013, was registered in the state where he or  she resides using the steps described below. Percentage estimates  derived from this sample have margins of error at the 95 percent  confidence level of plus or minus 8.08 percentage points.the reliability of the data ICE provided by questioning knowledgeable  agency officials and reviewing the data for errors and anomalies. We  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "To determine whether the 131 alien sex offenders in our sample were  registered in the states where they reside, we first searched the National  Sex Offender Public Website (public website) to determine which of these  offenders were included. All persons included on the public website are  also registered with their respective states. On the basis of the search  results, we divided the alien sex offenders into three categories: (1)  definitely included in the public website, meaning there was an exact  match on the name and date of birth for the alien sex offender in the  public website; (2) possibly included in the public website, meaning there  was a partial or similar name, date of birth, or age in the public website  (e.g., J. Smith as opposed to John Smith), but not an exact match; and  (3) definitely not included in the public website, meaning the public  website did not include the offender\u2019s exact name or date of birth or even  a partial or similar name, date of birth, or age. We determined that of the  131 alien sex offenders in our sample, 51 (39 percent) were definitely  included in the public website, 16 (12 percent) were possibly included,  and 64 (49 percent) were definitely not included. We asked ICE-ERO to  provide us with the current addresses for the 80 alien sex offenders who  were possibly included or definitely not included in the public website;  these offenders were located in 27 states. We contacted sex offender  registration officials in each of the 27 states to ask whether the officials  were aware of these offenders; whether the offenders were registered  with the state; and, for any offenders who were not registered, an  explanation for why they were not.", "To address our second objective, we reviewed the Sex Offender  Registration and Notification Act of 2006 (SORNA), other applicable laws,  and guidelines developed by the Sex Offender Sentencing, Monitoring,  Apprehending, Registering, and Tracking (SMART) Office to obtain  information on federal sex offender registration requirements. We also  met with officials from ICE-ERO Executive Information and Reporting  Unit\u2014which is responsible for administering and coordinating ICE-ERO\u2019s  policy development, review, clearance, and information disclosure  functions\u2014to obtain information on how they determine whether an alien  in ICE-ERO custody is a sex offender and any actions they take to help  ensure that alien sex offenders who are released under ICE-ERO  supervision are registered. In addition, we conducted phone interviews  with ICE-ERO supervisory detention officials; U.S. Marshals Service  officials; state sex offender registry officials; and local law enforcement  officials in Minnesota, Florida, and Maryland to inquire about actions they  take to help ensure alien sex offenders are registered and how they  become aware of alien sex offenders who live in their jurisdiction. We  selected Minnesota and Florida because these are the states where the  largest number of alien sex offenders in our sample who were not  included in the public website reside. We selected Maryland because  local law enforcement officials in this state had raised concerns about  registration of alien sex offenders during our prior work, which was  completed in February 2013. In addition, we conducted phone interviews  with ICE-ERO field office directors and deputy directors in the field offices  that either released or currently supervise the alien sex offenders in our  sample who were not registered, but potentially should have been. We  obtained information from the Administrative Office of the United States  Courts and the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) regarding their efforts to  inform alien sex offenders about their registration responsibilities and  notifying relevant sex offender registry and law enforcement officials  about these offenders. In addition, we interviewed officials from the U.S.  Marshals Service who are responsible for locating sex offenders who fail  to register. We also met with the director and policy advisors for the  SMART Office within the Department of Justice (DOJ) to obtain their  perspectives on acceptable reasons for why alien sex offenders may not  be registered in the state where they reside or included in the public  website. The SMART Office is responsible for assessing states\u2019,  territories\u2019, and tribes\u2019 progress in implementing SORNA. We compared  the sex offender notification requirements in SORNA and other federal  statutes with the notifications that state and federal agencies provide to  alien sex offenders to determine if there were any gaps. We then  obtained perspectives from the federal, state, and local officials we  interviewed on how best to address these gaps.
