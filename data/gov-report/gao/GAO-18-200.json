GSA officials stated that the approximate cost of equipping a building with these technologies ranged between about $48,000 to $155,000. However, they stated that accurately calculating installation costs is challenging because GSA typically installs these technologies in selected buildings incrementally and sometimes as part of other capital improvement projects. Additionally, GSA officials identified perceived operational benefits of the smart buildings program's key technologies, including that these technologies enable officials to more precisely identify building system problems and more closely monitor contractors. However, existing data on the smart buildings program are of limited usefulness in quantifying the program's benefits. For example, according to GSA officials, while data from an application within GSAlink that estimates avoided costs from addressing each fault that GSAlink identifies are useful for prioritizing maintenance actions, the imprecise estimates preclude their use as a measure of actual avoided costs in quantifying program benefits.", "GSA does not have documented, clearly defined goals for the smart buildings program, nor has GSA developed performance measures that would allow it to assess the program's progress. These omissions are contrary to leading practices of results-oriented organizations identified in previous GAO work. GSA officials verbally described broad goals for the smart buildings program to GAO, but the agency has not documented these goals. Further, because GSA has not clearly defined its verbally expressed goals, it cannot demonstrate progress in achieving them. For example, GSA officials said that the agency cannot measure progress for the stated goal of improving tenant productivity and comfort because of the subjective nature of individual tenant preferences, such as for office temperatures. Additionally, GSA has not developed performance measures to assess the program, and GSA's lack of data that can be used to quantify benefits of the program impedes its ability to measure the success of the program. Without clearly defined goals, related performance measures, and data that can be used to measure its progress, GSA is limited in its ability to make informed decisions about the smart buildings program.", "GSA faces challenges in implementing the smart buildings program and has taken steps to mitigate these challenges. Since smart building technologies are Internet-connected, they are potentially vulnerable to cyberattacks that could compromise security or cause harm to facilities or their occupants. GSA has taken actions intended to mitigate cybersecurity challenges, such as instituting policies to address threats and known vulnerabilities and moving Internet-connected building systems to GSA's secured network. Separately, according to GSA officials, GSA faces implementation challenges related to the limited technological proficiency of some GSA building managers and contractors or lack of buy-in from them. GSA is taking actions intended to address these challenges. For example, it has provided training to staff and contractors, and its central office monitors the extent to which staff address problems detected by the smart buildings program's key technologies."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that GSA establish clearly defined performance goals and related performance measures for the smart buildings program, and identify and develop data to measure progress.

In addition, we conducted site visits and interviewed GSA  building managers and operations and maintenance services contractors  who work at selected GSA smart buildings in San Francisco, California,  and Washington, D.C. We selected these locations because of the high  number of GSA smart buildings located in each city. To obtain a wider  perspective on smart buildings in general, we interviewed officials at three  other federal agencies that have implemented smart building efforts,  including the Department of Energy, the Department of Defense, and the  National Aeronautics and Space Administration. We also interviewed  seven industry stakeholders\u2014including five service contractors and two  university researchers\u2014who were near the GSA smart buildings we  visited and had experience in operating smart buildings or researching  related technologies.

According to GSA officials, their federally owned  smart buildings are managed by a GSA building manager who oversees a  private operations and maintenance services contractor.", "According to GSA officials, the agency began implementing what would  become its smart buildings program around 2005 in response to  numerous federal policies aimed at improving federal building energy and  environmental management. These officials told us that the smart  buildings program includes two key technologies: advanced utility meters  and a computer software program known as \u201cGSAlink.\u201d According to GSA  officials, outfitting buildings with these technologies allows for more  precise monitoring of energy use and equipment operations in these  buildings, and was initially based on the use of advanced utility meters to  meet federal mandates. Later, this concept was expanded to include use  of analytics, through GSAlink, aimed at reducing energy consumption and  increasing the efficiency of operations and maintenance activities.  According to GSA officials, GSA\u2019s smart buildings use these technologies  to connect and monitor multiple pieces of building equipment, such as  heating and air conditioning system components. Further, according to  these officials, the program is intended to achieve efficiencies in energy  use and in operations and maintenance activities while also providing a  comfortable workplace potentially conducive to improved tenant  productivity. As GSAlink and advanced meters are Internet-connected,  GSA officials told us that they implemented protections that are intended  to help mitigate potential cyberattacks, including using firewalls.", "Advanced Utility Meters: In response to energy reduction and  advanced metering requirements established in the Energy Policy Act  of 2005\u2014as well as subsequent amendments and an Executive  Order\u2014GSA began installing advanced meters in its federally owned  buildings starting around 2005. Internet-connected advanced utility  meters measure utility use in real-time, which GSA officials told us  allows GSA\u2019s building managers to identify opportunities to reduce  energy use or anomalies that contribute to energy waste. For  example, GSA officials said that advanced utility meters can be used  to monitor energy consumption patterns and detect lights or other  building systems being used after normal business hours. According  to a senior GSA official, GSA currently has 675 advanced meters  installed in the agency\u2019s approximately 1,600 federally owned  buildings.", "GSAlink: GSA officials told us that GSAlink is a computer software  program that collects and analyzes data from advanced meters\u2014 including gas, electric, and water meters\u2014and from a facility\u2019s  \u201cbuilding automation system\u201d and uses this information to alert  building staff to potential problems. Further, GSA officials said that  GSAlink allows them to identify building problems that occur over time  that may not be readily observable through the building automation  system, which generally presents information to building personnel on  how a building system is operating in real-time, not over a longer time  frame. For example, GSA officials told us that GSAlink can collect  data on the temperature and pressure of chilled water that is being  circulated through a building\u2019s cooling system and identify equipment  that is operating outside of normal parameters or normal business  hours when a building automation system may not be actively  monitored. If GSAlink detects a potential issue, GSA officials told us  the software creates a record so that building maintenance staff can  investigate and remedy that issue. GSA building managers as well as  GSA staff at the regional and national levels told us they can log in to  GSAlink to check on the status of building system issues. According  to GSA officials, the contract for GSAlink was awarded in 2012 and  GSAlink is currently in use in 81 buildings, with at least one GSAlink- equipped building in each of GSA\u2019s 11 regions. A senior GSA official  told us that eighty of these buildings are also equipped with advanced  meters. Further, in September 2017, this official told us that GSA  contracted to equip 4 additional buildings with GSAlink. According to  GSA officials, GSA generally plans to limit installation of GSAlink in  additional buildings until more is learned about using the technology in  the buildings in which it is currently installed.", "Figure 1 illustrates an example of a GSA smart building that includes  advanced meters, GSAlink, and the building systems monitored by these  technologies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limited Quantified Information Exists on the Costs and Benefits of Key Smart Buildings Program Technologies", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Smart Buildings Program\u2019s Installation Costs Are Affected by Building Characteristics and Can Be Difficult to Quantify", "paragraphs": ["According to GSA officials, the approximate cost of equipping a building  with smart building technologies ranged from between about $48,000 to  $155,000. This includes costs for installing: advanced utility meters (approximately $25,000 to $55,000), and", "GSAlink (approximately $23,000 to $100,000).", "The cost of installing GSAlink depends on the condition of the building  automation system to which GSAlink is connected as well as the number  of individual building components (e.g., chilled water pumps, cooling  tower fans, thermostats) to be monitored by GSAlink. GSA officials  anticipate that advances in system architecture and reduced software  licensing costs will lower the cost of future installations. For example, a  senior GSA official told us in October 2017 that the cost to install GSAlink  in four additional buildings\u2014the most recent buildings in which GSAlink  was installed\u2014ranged between $23,000 and $25,000.", "In addition, GSA is undertaking a broader effort to upgrade building  automation systems in its buildings to enable these systems and  connected applications, such as GSAlink, to operate on GSA\u2019s protected  information technology network. According to GSA officials, GSA can only  install GSAlink in buildings whose building automation system operates  on GSA\u2019s protected network. To date, GSA has upgraded building  automation systems to operate on the agency\u2019s protected network in  approximately 400 buildings. GSA officials told us that the cost of these  upgrades has varied by building and depends on several factors,  including the size of the building, the complexity or condition of its building  automation system, and its age. According to GSA officials, upgrading  building automation system components to enable them to operate on the  protected network has cost approximately $90,000 per building, on  average. However, in some cases, these costs can be much higher;  integrating older systems in larger buildings has cost up to $3 million,  according to GSA officials.", "Further, according to GSA officials, accurately calculating smart building  implementation costs can be difficult because GSA typically installs key  technologies\u2014that is, advanced meters and GSAlink\u2014and makes  upgrades necessary to install GSAlink in selected buildings incrementally,  sometimes as part of other capital improvement projects. For example,  the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and annual  appropriations have provided funding to GSA for energy and  conservation measures, including the purchase and installation of  advanced meters."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GSA Has Taken Steps toward Assessing Benefits of the Smart Buildings Program, but Efforts to Quantify Benefits Have Been Limited", "paragraphs": ["GSA officials we interviewed at the central office, regional, and individual  building levels identified perceived operational benefits from implementing  the smart buildings program, including that it (1) enables them to identify  problems with building equipment or system operations more quickly and  more thoroughly and (2) allows for their greater oversight of operations  and maintenance services contractors relative to other GSA buildings. For  example, according to GSA regional staff we spoke to, both advanced  meters and GSAlink could detect if the cooling system was operating  when tenants were not occupying the building, thereby allowing the  building managers to adjust operations to avoid unneeded energy use  and wear on the cooling system equipment. Regarding contractor  oversight, GSA building managers stated that GSAlink allows the agency  to better monitor operations and maintenance contractors\u2019 performance,  potentially yielding a better-run building with lower operations and  maintenance costs. For example, GSA officials described how the  analytic capability of GSAlink might allow building managers to precisely  identify and address a problem with a building before that problem is  noticed by tenants. This may result in, for example, a reduction in the  number of maintenance service requests from tenants and contribute to  lower building operating costs. In addition, GSA officials told us that  GSAlink allows GSA building managers to confirm the information  operations and maintenance services contractors present to them on the  status of issues identified by GSAlink. Further, according to these  officials, GSAlink allows building managers to monitor contractor  compliance with GSA\u2019s requirement that contractors address building  issues identified by GSAlink within 30 days, thereby giving GSA officials  closer oversight of contractor performance.", "GSA has taken some steps in the past to quantify the benefits associated  with the smart buildings program. While those efforts have identified  benefits, they have had some limitations. For example, in 2009\u2014after  having begun installing advanced meters but before installing GSAlink\u2014 GSA attempted to forecast benefits of the smart buildings program by  commissioning a business case analysis. The business case concluded  that GSA\u2019s energy and operating costs could be reduced by a smart  buildings program and that such a program would pay for itself in 1.7  years based on combined energy and operational savings. However,  this business case\u2019s estimates of the program\u2019s benefits have limited  usefulness for evaluating the current program because this study took  place before the program was fully implemented and did not account for  constraints affecting building operations. For example, a senior GSA  official told us that GSA\u2019s operations and maintenance service contracts  are generally for multiple years at a fixed price, calling into question  whether operational cost savings can be realized to achieve payback  within the time frame estimated by the study.", "In addition, GSA\u2019s service contractor developed an application within  GSAlink that automatically estimates the costs that would be avoided by  addressing each type of fault that GSAlink identifies. According to GSA  officials, these estimates are imprecise and do not reflect actual avoided  costs, which thereby precludes their use in quantifying program benefits.  However, according to these officials, these estimates can be used to  compare the relative benefits expected to be achieved by addressing  identified faults and to prioritize maintenance and repair actions. GSA  officials told us that they took steps in June 2017 to improve the accuracy  of avoided cost estimates produced by this application, for example, by  enabling adjustments to account for differences in weather conditions and building size, and plan to continue their efforts to adjust and refine this  tool.", "In a separate study in October 2016, GSA\u2014in collaboration with  researchers at Carnegie Mellon University\u2014analyzed the energy use  changes associated with both capital upgrades and operational initiatives,  including the use of smart building technologies. Capital upgrades  include actions such as installing new energy-efficient building systems  and equipment, whereas operational initiatives include, among other  things, changes to building operations based on the analysis of advanced  meter and GSAlink data. While the researchers concluded that the use of  advanced meter and GSAlink data led to reductions in energy use, the  researchers found that GSA\u2019s utility consumption records were  incomplete and that GSA records of capital upgrades often do not include  key details, such as project start or completion dates, to indicate when  GSA would have received the benefit derived from the capital project.  This lack of complete data adds to the difficulty of estimating the reduced  energy consumption attributable to specific factors, including use of  advanced meters and GSAlink."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "GSA Does Not Have Documented, Clearly Defined Performance Goals or Measures to Help It Manage the Smart Buildings Program", "paragraphs": ["We have previously found that results-oriented organizations set  performance goals to clearly define desired program outcomes and  develop performance measures that are clearly linked to the performance  goals. Program goals communicate what results the agency seeks and  allow agencies to assess or demonstrate the degree to which those  desired results are achieved. Performance measures also show the  progress the agency is making toward achieving program goals. We have  previously reported that performance measurement gives managers  crucial information to identify gaps in program performance and plan any  needed improvements.", "GSA has not documented the smart buildings program\u2019s goals, contrary  to leading practices we identified in our prior work, which call for program  goals to clearly define desired program outcomes. GSA officials verbally  described to us broad goals for the smart buildings program: (1) reducing  energy consumption, (2) generating operations and maintenance cost  savings, and (3) creating a comfortable work environment conducive to  improved tenant productivity. However, GSA has not documented these  goals\u2014for example, in the agency\u2019s performance plan or in other program  documents. GSA officials could not provide a reason for why the agency  has not documented the smart buildings program\u2019s goals.", "Further, because GSA has not clearly defined its verbally expressed  goals, it cannot demonstrate progress in achieving them. This lack of  clearly defined goals is contrary to federal internal control standards,  which state that agency management should define objectives in  measurable terms so that performance toward those objectives can be  assessed. GSA could potentially measure progress toward its stated  smart buildings program goals of reducing energy consumption and  generating operations and maintenance cost savings, if data were  available to do so, as these goals seek to identify changes in quantifiable  outcomes, specifically energy use and cost savings. However, GSA  officials said that the agency cannot measure progress toward the stated  goal of improving tenant productivity and comfort because of the  subjective nature of individual tenant preferences, such as for office  temperatures. This subjectivity is consistent with statements from the  industry stakeholders we spoke with, who also said that identifying the  existence of a causal relationship between a building\u2019s environment and  the productivity of its inhabitants is challenging. For example, an industry  stakeholder we spoke to told us that different building occupants have  different temperature or ventilation preferences and may accordingly be  the most productive at different ambient temperatures, making it  challenging to determine a building\u2019s optimal temperature. Without  documented, clearly defined goals, it will be challenging for GSA to  determine what type of evaluative information it will need to monitor the  progress of the smart buildings program.", "In addition, contrary to the leading practices we have identified in our  previous work, GSA has not developed performance measures for the  smart buildings program. According to these leading practices,  performance measures allow for an assessment of progress toward  achieving goals by including concrete, objective, and observable ways to  measure the program\u2019s performance and compare this with the program\u2019s  expected results. Further, federal internal control standards call for  federal program managers to use quality information to achieve that  program\u2019s objectives and make informed decisions. However, GSA  lacks quality information that can be used to measure program  performance. As discussed in the previous section, GSA\u2019s efforts to  quantify the smart buildings program\u2019s benefits, including energy  reductions and cost savings, have been limited because GSA has had  difficulty in compiling data that would allow it to do so. For example,  GSAlink\u2019s calculation of avoided costs estimated to be achieved by  addressing identified faults is useful for prioritizing maintenance actions  but not for measuring program performance because, according to GSA  officials, the estimates lack precision and relation to actual costs. In  addition, GSA\u2019s October 2016 study on energy use reductions attributable  to the program faced problems owing to incomplete records on utility  consumption and capital upgrades. While we recognize that determining  what data can be collected in a cost-effective manner and can be used to  measure the performance of the smart buildings program may be difficult,  without such data and measures, GSA lacks the ability to determine the  program\u2019s progress and make informed decisions about its current and  future operations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GSA Faces Some Challenges in Implementing Smart Building Technologies and Is Taking Steps to Mitigate Them", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GSA Is Taking Actions That May Mitigate Challenges Related to Cybersecurity", "paragraphs": ["GSA faces cybersecurity challenges to its buildings, but is taking steps  intended to mitigate these challenges.
