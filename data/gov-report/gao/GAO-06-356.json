For example, the JSF program plans to produce 424 low-rate initial production aircraft, at a total estimated cost of more than $49 billion, by 2013--the same time at which the program plans to complete initial operational testing. Producing aircraft before testing demonstrates the design is mature increases the likelihood of design changes that will lead to cost growth, schedule delays, and performance problems. Because the program will lack key design and testing knowledge, DOD plans to use cost reimbursement contracts to procure early production aircraft. This type of contract places a substantially greater cost risk on DOD and the taxpayers. Confidence that investment decisions will deliver expected capability within cost and schedule goals increases as testing proves the JSF will work as expected. At the same time, the JSF program has not adopted an evolutionary approach to acquiring the aircraft--despite DOD policy that prefers such an approach. Instead, the JSF program has contracted to develop and deliver the aircraft's full capability in a single-step, 12-year development program--a daunting task given the need to incorporate the technological advances that, according to DOD, represent a quantum leap in capability. DOD's buying power has already been reduced. Since initial estimates, program acquisition unit costs have increased by 28 percent, or $23 million. Development costs have increased 84 percent, planned purchases have decreased by 535 aircraft, and the completion of development has slipped 5 years, delaying delivery of capabilities to the warfighter. With more than 90 percent of the JSF investment remaining, DOD officials have the opportunity to adopt a knowledge-based and evolutionary acquisition strategy that would maximize DOD's return on its investment. The acquisition approach used for the F-16 fighter, the Air Force's JSF predecessor, could provide a model for delivering JSF capabilities to the warfighter sooner and recapitalizing tactical aircraft forces more quickly while lowering risk. The F-16 program successfully evolved capabilities over the span of about 30 years, with an initial capability delivered to the warfighter about 4 years after development started."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program began in 1996, Congress has  appropriated nearly $25 billion for its development.

Lockheed Martin won the competition, and the  program entered system development and demonstration in October 2001.", "DOD has set major expectations for the program. The program\u2019s objective  is to develop and deploy a technically superior and affordable fleet of  aircraft that support the warfighter in performing a wide range of missions  in a variety of theaters. The single-seat, single-engine aircraft is being  designed to be self-sufficient or part of a multisystem and multiservice  operation, and to rapidly transition between air-to-surface and air-to-air  missions while still airborne. To achieve its mission, JSF will incorporate  low observable technologies, defensive avionics, advanced onboard and  offboard sensor fusion, internal and external weapons, and advanced  prognostic maintenance capability. According to DOD, these technologies  represent a quantum leap over legacy tactical aircraft capabilities. At the  same time, the JSF aircraft design includes three variants: a conventional  takeoff and landing variant for the Air Force; an aircraft carrier-suitable  variant for the Navy; and a short takeoff and vertical landing variant for  the Marine Corps, the Air Force, and the United Kingdom. JSF is intended  to replace a substantial number of aging fighter and attack aircraft in  DOD\u2019s current inventory (see table 1).", "In recent years, DOD has revised its acquisition policy to embrace an  evolutionary, or incremental, approach to improve program outcomes. The  acquisition policy states evolutionary acquisition is the preferred DOD  strategy for rapid acquisition of mature technology for the user by  delivering capability in increments, recognizing up front the need for  future capability improvements. The objective is to balance needs with  resources in order to put capability into the hands of the warfighter more  quickly. The policy states that a product enters system development and  demonstration when an affordable increment of militarily useful capability  has been identified, technology has been demonstrated in a relevant  environment, and a system can be developed for production in a short  time frame (normally less than 5 years). Each increment of an evolutionary  acquisition will have its own decision milestones and baseline\u2014cost,  schedule, and performance requirements.

The JSF program has already  encountered increases to estimated development costs, delays to planned  deliveries, and reductions in the planned number of JSF to be procured  that have eroded DOD\u2019s buying power. We believe the current acquisition  strategy to begin production in 2007 is too risky. By committing to procure  large quantities of the aircraft before completing testing that demonstrates  that the design is mature and reliable, DOD has significantly increased the  risk of further compromising its return on investment\u2014as well as adding  more cost and delaying the delivery of critical capabilities to the  warfighter. Also, making sizable investments in tooling and other  manufacturing capability needed to produce JSFs at higher rates before a  fully integrated aircraft is demonstrated in testing places the program at  risk for expensive design changes as testing uncovers problems. Deferring  production decisions until all three variants\u2019 performance has been  demonstrated throughout their flight envelopes and with the full  integrated capability would allow additional time to capture knowledge  and help to significantly minimize these risks.", "To continue with the current plan to deliver the ultimate JSF capability  will require (1) execution of a 7-year test program without further  schedule delays, (2) development of 5 major blocks of software (19 million  lines of code), and (3) new and yet undemonstrated technologies for  advanced mission systems that must collect, analyze, and synthesize  information from other platforms or sensors not all a part of the JSF  aircraft. These are necessary to ensure the JSF has increased situational  awareness to destroy enemy air defenses and perform deep strike  missions with advanced weapons. The JSF program will also need,  annually, an average of $11 billion of development and procurement  funding for the next two decades.", "All of these factors add to the challenges faced by DOD in trying to  manage this highly concurrent program, increasing the risk it will have the  same poor outcomes experienced by similar major acquisition programs  with significant cost and schedule growth and delayed modernization and  recapitalization of aging systems. DOD has an alternative. With 90 percent  of DOD\u2019s remaining planned investment in JSF, it can adopt a knowledge- driven and evolutionary acquisition approach to reduce JSF program risks,  recapitalize its aging tactical air force sooner, and deliver needed  capabilities to the warfighter more quickly. The experiences of the F-16  program\u2014evolving and improving capabilities over time while providing  the warfighter combat capability\u2014provide a precedent for this.  Requirements for the first increment of JSF under this evolutionary  approach would match a level supported by current knowledge of  technologies and design. This would allow the testing of those reduced  requirements to support a knowledge-based low-rate production decision  sooner and allow delivery of a useful product and in sufficient quantities  to start replacing the aging legacy fighter force. Capabilities that demand  as yet undemonstrated technologies, for example, advanced mission  systems and software, would be included as requirements in subsequent  future JSF aircraft increments\u2014managed as separate development  programs\u2014as technology is demonstrated in the technology base and  becomes available."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matters for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["DOD does not plan to change its business case or acquisition plan for  developing and buying the JSF. Without changes, the acquisition plan will  put at risk $50 billion for procuring JSF aircraft at the same time the  program develops and tests the aircraft\u2019s expected performance  capabilities over a 7-year, 12,000 hour flight test program. The JSF  program has continually missed its cost and schedule targets over the 5  years it has been in development. If DOD were to make smaller, more  manageable commitments in capabilities, it would make cost and schedule  more predictable and deliver needed capabilities to the war fighter sooner.  For these reasons, Congress may want to consider delaying authorizations  and appropriations for procuring JSF aircraft until   1.  DOD develops a knowledge-based business case that matches  requirements with proven technologies and design knowledge and  available funding. Capabilities that demand technological advances not  yet demonstrated should be part of future increments that are funded  and managed separately once demonstrated.   2.  DOD demonstrates the aircraft design qualities and integrated mission  capabilities of the fully configured and integrated JSF variants work as  designed based on actual flight testing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following recommendations to reduce program risk  and increase the likelihood of successful program outcomes by delivering  capabilities to the warfighter when needed and within available resources.  Specifically, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense:  1.  Delay the investment in production aircraft until sufficient testing has  at least demonstrated the basic airframe design of each JSF variant in  important parts of the flight envelope, including combinations of  critical altitudes, speeds, and angles of attack.  2.  Once the basic airframe design has been demonstrated, limit  production quantities to the number of aircraft needed for operational  testing and that can be produced using the current production  capability (based on existing tooling, materials, and personnel) until a  fully integrated aircraft (with advanced mission systems and predictive  maintenance systems) demonstrates through flight testing the required  capabilities.  3.  Plan an incremental acquisition strategy that follows the intent of DOD  evolutionary acquisition policy and delivers a first increment that  limits new content to proven technologies and design. The plan should  be completed and reported to the Congress by July 2006, and include  adjustments in associated programs as necessary to maintain needed  capabilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["DOD provided us with written comments on a draft of this report. The  comments appear in appendix III.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendation that the Secretary of  Defense delay the investment in production aircraft until sufficient testing  has at least demonstrated the basic airframe design of each JSF variant in  important parts of the flight envelope, including combinations of critical  altitudes, speeds, and angles of attack. DOD agreed that a knowledge- based approach is critical to making prudent decisions and that this type  of approach is being used by JSF. However, DOD\u2019s response did not  provide a plan of action to show how it will ensure flight testing  demonstrates acceptable performance before significant production  investments are made. In the past, Congress has raised concerns about the  costly outcomes of highly concurrent development and production efforts  that are not \u201cflying before buying.\u201d DOD points out that the JSF program is  in its fifth year of a 12-year development, but starting production with  nearly 7 years of development and testing remaining leaves a high  probability that, because it is not flying before buying, it will incur costly  design changes and delay getting capability to the warfighter.  Until there  has been testing to demonstrate that all three variants will work as  intended, we believe entering production in 2007 places financial  investments at significant risk. The risk increases as spending for  production goes from about $100 million a month in 2007 to over $500  million a month just 2 years later.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendation to the Secretary of  Defense to limit production quantities to the number of aircraft needed for  operational testing and that can be produced using the current production  capability until a fully integrated aircraft demonstrates the required  capabilities through flight testing. DOD stated it is limiting production  until aircraft capabilities are fully demonstrated and that further limits are  not necessary. It stated that various program reviews to assess  performance, including test objectives, are conducted to ensure associated  program risks are understood and mitigated. We believe DOD\u2019s plan to  invest almost $50 billion to buy over 400 aircraft concurrent with testing is  very risky. Significant efforts remain in the JSF program to demonstrate  the aircraft will perform as expected. A number of major DOD acquisition  programs have employed highly concurrent acquisition strategies in the  past and experienced significant cost increases and schedule delays. DOD  stated its use of modeling and simulation and laboratory testing reduces  risk. However, DOD operational test officials have stated that  demonstrations need to occur in the actual aircraft in an operational  environment to verify that the system works as intended. For example, the  F-22A avionics software performed successfully in the laboratory but  experienced significant problems that delayed the program and increased  costs once it entered actual flight testing in the F-22A aircraft. JSF  software and advanced electronics are more complex than the F-22A\u2019s.  While DOD believes it can manage program risk by holding regular  program reviews, DOD\u2019s own experience has shown this approach is not  effective. Accepting and managing risk instead of capturing technology,  design, and manufacturing knowledge, as suggested in DOD policy, has  made it difficult for DOD to make informed decisions at key points.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendation to the Secretary of  Defense to plan an incremental acquisition strategy that follows the intent  of DOD evolutionary acquisition policy and delivers a first increment that  limits new content to proven technologies and design and to report this  plan to Congress by July 2006. It stated the JSF Acquisition Strategy fully  complies with policy and is a knowledge-based, incremental approach that  includes three blocks of increasing degrees of warfighter capability. We  believe DOD\u2019s strategy does not provide the benefits of an evolutionary  approach, as suggested by DOD\u2019s policy and best practices. In commenting  on our report, DOD did not address the salient points concerning the true  significance of adopting an incremental acquisition approach\u2014reducing  program risk, delivering needed capabilities to the warfighter quicker, and  recapitalizing the aging tactical aircraft fleet sooner. The JSF strategy  resembles other past major acquisition programs that have attempted to  achieve the ultimate capability in a single development increment,  producing nearly all of the fleet with the fully required capability from the  outset. DOD has allowed technology development to spill over into  product development, weakening the foundation for program cost or  schedule estimates. This has led to disastrous outcomes for other major  acquisition programs in the past. We continue to believe the successful F- 16 program can serve as a model for the JSF program.  The F-16 program  evolved capabilities over a 30-year period, buying substantial quantities of  each increment in order to recapitalize aging tactical aircraft and provide  new capabilities to the warfighter more quickly.  If DOD were to make  smaller, more manageable commitments in capabilities, it would make  cost and schedule more predictable and deliver needed capabilities to the  warfighter sooner.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Defense; the  Secretaries of the Air Force, Army, and Navy; and the Director of the  Office of Management and Budget.

Our work has shown that valuable lessons can be learned from  the commercial sector, as well as successful Department of Defense  (DOD) cases, and can be applied to the development of weapon systems.  We reviewed JSF management reports, acquisition plans, test plans, risk  assessments, cost reports, independent program assessments, and  program status briefings. We identified gaps in product knowledge at the  production decision points, reasons for these gaps, and the risks to  program cost and schedule associated with moving forward.

We compared the JSF program\u2019s approach with the approaches  used by leading companies and successful DOD programs to evolve  products to their ultimate capabilities. We also reviewed DOD guidance on  structuring evolutionary acquisition programs. To determine the JSF  program outcomes to date, we used the program estimates that justified  the program when it started in 1996.

At that time, total  production, acquisition, and ownership costs had not been estimated. The  total production, acquisition, and ownership cost estimates were first  established to support the decision to enter the system development and  demonstration phase in 2001. We used these estimates as the baseline for  these costs.
