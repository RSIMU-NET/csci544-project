They help build and  maintain our nation\u2019s infrastructure by funding highways, bridges, and  mass transit systems. Grants help educate young people by supporting  the construction of school buildings, the hiring of teachers, and increasing  student access to higher education. They also help care for the sick and  economically disadvantaged by funding medical services, nutrition  programs, and housing assistance. Federal grants are diverse, varying  greatly in both size and the grantees who receive them. Some can be  small, such as a research grant from the National Science Foundation for  less than a couple of thousand dollars, or they can be very large, such as  Medicaid grants to individual states, which are worth billions of dollars.  Grant recipients may include states and their agencies, local  governments, tribal governments, nonprofit organizations, research  institutions, or individuals.

In scoping the research objectives for this  work we limited our review to federal grants involving state and local  governments because reliable historical data exist for this group of grants  and according to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) they  represent roughly 80 percent of all federal grant funding. We could not  identify a similarly reliable data source for the wider universe of all federal  grants.", "To determine key information regarding grant funding for fiscal year 2011,  the growth in grant funding over the last three decades, and shifts in the  focus of grant funding during that time, we used data from OMB. We  obtained the data for fiscal years 1980 through 2011 and converted them  to 2011 constant dollars for a more accurate comparison of grant  spending from year to year. We determined the data were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of this report. In addition to OMB, we identified  other sources of data on federal grant funding, and then analyzed and  described how the data in each source differs. In an effort to identify the  number of grant programs, we looked at the Catalog of Federal Domestic  Assistance (CFDA), a data base containing information on federal  assistance programs. We also reviewed our prior work, and the work of  others, on federal grants in the CFDA, reviewed studies by the  Congressional Research Service, and discussed the issue with OMB and  the General Services Administration (GSA). To identify key issues and  challenges related to the structure and operation of grants management,  we reviewed our previous reports and audits as well as those from federal  IGs and others. We also searched various federal, public policy, and  research organizations\u2019 websites to identify relevant reports and other  literature regarding federal grant programs and how they are structured  and managed.

They can vary greatly in numerous ways  including size, the nature of their recipients, and the type of programs  they fund. Grant programs can also vary in two important dimensions\u2014 the amount of discretion they give to the recipient in how the funds will be  used, and the way they are allocated or awarded. Typically, grants are  grouped into three types based on the amount of discretion given to the  recipient for the use of funds: categorical grants, block grants, and  general purpose grants.", "Taken as a whole, federal grant", "Categorical grants are the most restricted, permitting funds to be used  only for specific activities related to their purpose, such as funding for  the narrowly defined purpose of nutrition for the elderly.", "Block grants are less restrictive, funding broader categories of  activities, such as community development or public health, and  generally give greater discretion to recipients in identifying problems  and designing programs to address those problems.", "General purpose grants, such as revenue sharing, offer the greatest  amount of discretion to the recipient, as they require only that the  funds be spent for government purposes.", "However, grant categories with regard to categorical grants and block  grants are not rigid and sometimes overlap occurs. Each of these grants  strikes a different balance between the interests of the federal grant- making agency that funds be used efficiently and effectively to meet  national objectives, and the interests of the recipient to use the funds to  meet local priorities and to minimize the administrative burdens  associated with accepting the grant.", "Grant programs also vary in the methods they use to allocate or award  funds, that is, by formula or through discretionary project grants.", "Formula grants allocate funds based on distribution formulas  prescribed by legislation or administrative regulation.", "Project grants are generally awarded on a competitive basis to eligible  applicants for specific projects. OMB has emphasized the use of  competitive grants as a means of increasing innovation in grant  proposals.", "While these labels help classify grants based on prominent  characteristics, they should not be understood to be mutually exclusive  definitions, as more than one can apply to a given grant program. For  example, the federal government distributes Community Development  Block Grant funds to states using a formula, but states redistribute the  funds to localities, sometimes as project grants.", "While there is substantial variation among grant types, competitive grants  generally follow a life cycle that includes announcement, application,  award, post-award, and closeout, as seen in figure 1. Once a grant  program is established through legislation, which may specify particular  objectives, eligibility, and other requirements, a grant-making agency may  impose additional requirements on it. For competitive grant programs, the  public is notified of the grant opportunity through an announcement, and  potential recipients must submit applications for agency review. In the  award stage, the agency identifies successful applicants or legislatively  defined grant recipients and awards funding. The implementation stage  includes payment processing, agency monitoring, and recipient reporting,  which may include financial and performance information. The closeout  phase includes preparation of final reports, financial reconciliation, and  any required accounting for property. Audits may occur multiple times  during the life cycle of the grant and after closeout.", "Federal agencies do not have inherent authority to enter into grant  agreements without affirmative legislative authorization. In authorizing  grant programs, federal laws identify the types of activities that can be  funded and the purposes to be accomplished through the funding.  Legislation establishing a grant program frequently will define the  program objectives and leave the administering agency to fill in the details  by regulation.", "Grant programs are typically subject to a wide range of accountability  requirements under their authorizing legislation or appropriation and  implementing regulations so that funding is spent for its intended purpose.  For example, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)  administers grants to aid states and localities in providing affordable  housing for low-income families. Congress mandated that HUD  administer these grant programs in a manner that furthers fair housing.  HUD regulations direct grant recipients to prepare planning documents  and maintain certain records proving the legislation\u2019s fair housing  requirements as a condition to receiving funds. Congress may also  impose requirements on specific funding for grant programs. The  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act)  required increased reporting and oversight on both grant-making  agencies and recipients for many different grant programs receiving  additional funding under the Recovery Act.", "In addition, grant programs are also subject to cross-cutting requirements  applicable to most assistance programs (see table 1 for more  information). For example, recipients of grant funds are prohibited from  using those funds to lobby members and employees of Congress and  executive agency employees. OMB is responsible for developing  government-wide policies to ensure that grants are managed properly  and that grant funds are spent in accordance with applicable laws and  regulations. For many decades, OMB has published guidance in various  circulars to aid grant-making agencies with such subjects as audit and  record keeping and the allowability of costs.

Federal outlays for grants to state and local  governments totaled more than $606 billion in fiscal year 2011, equivalent  to 4.1 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) in that year.

However, even when Medicaid is excluded, HHS remains the largest  federal grant-making agency. While many federal agencies award grants,  the large majority of grant outlays to state and local governments are  made by just a few agencies, with the top five accounting for more than  90 percent of those grant outlays in fiscal year 2011. Following HHS, the  next four agencies with the largest amount of grant outlays to state and  local governments in fiscal year 2011 were the Departments of Education  (Education), Transportation, HUD, and Agriculture.

However, during this  period the proportion of federal grant outlays to state and local  governments dedicated to Medicaid more than tripled, rising from 2.4  percent of all federal outlays in 1980 to 7.6 percent in 2011.

For example, as part of the  Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, nine block grants were  created from about 50 of the 534 categorical programs in effect at that  time. Overall, funding for the categorical grants bundled into these block  grants was reduced 12 percent, about $1 billion, from their combined  funding level the previous year. State officials believed that funding  reductions would not result in the loss of services for recipients because  the reductions would be offset by administrative efficiencies, although in  our subsequent work we found that the administrative cost savings were  difficult to quantify. Figure 4 also shows the upturn in federal grant  outlays in 2009 and 2010 that were the result of the Recovery Act.", "Grant outlays can also be analyzed historically using OMB\u2019s grant  programs\u2019 functional categories. In fiscal year 2011, the five largest grant  program categories by government function were health; income security;  education, training, employment, and social services; transportation; and  community and regional development.

By fiscal year 2011, outlays for health- related grant functions increased to almost 50 percent of these total grant  outlays. While outlays for health-related grants experienced a relatively  steady increase in the last three decades\u2014more than doubling in 30  years\u2014outlays for other grant functions generally decreased relative to  the total of all federal grants to state and local governments during the  same period.", "OMB and others have noted that the relative growth and contraction of  grant outlays for different purposes reflects a broader shift in the focus of  federal outlays for grant programs. According to OMB data, since the  1980s, funding has shifted from providing grants to state and local  governments for physical capital and societal activities (e.g., highways,  mass transit, sewage treatment plants, public education, government  administration and community development), toward grants for payments  for the benefit of individuals or families. These grants benefitting  individuals are primarily entitlement programs such as Medicaid,  Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, child nutrition programs, and  housing assistance. In fiscal year 1980, the percentage of grant outlays  for the benefit of individuals and families was just under 36 percent. By  fiscal year 2011, federal outlays for grants benefitting individuals and  families, a major component of which is Medicaid, had grown to almost  two-thirds (64 percent) of all grant outlays to state and local governments.", "There are various sources for data on the amount the federal government  spends on grants, including OMB budget data, USAspending.gov, and  Census Bureau surveys of state and local governments.

Both OMB and the former U.S. Advisory  Commission on Intergovernmental Relations (ACIR) periodically  published counts of the total number of federally funded grant programs  during the 1980s and 1990s, but because they used different  methodologies to determine which grant programs to include, they came  up with different results.

Substantial variation in the  way federal agencies administer these programs has further increased  their complexity. As a result, the management of grants to state and local  governments presents both grant-making agencies and grant recipients  with a variety of challenges. We and others have previously reported on  many of these issues which can be grouped into the following broad  themes: (1) challenges related to effectively measuring grant  performance; (2) uncoordinated program creation; (3) need for better  collaboration; (4) internal control weaknesses in grants management and  oversight; and (5) lack of agency or recipient capacity."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Lack of Appropriate Performance Measures and Accurate Data Limit Agencies\u2019 Ability to Effectively Measure Grant Program Performance", "paragraphs": ["In our past work, we have reported that effective performance  accountability provisions are of fundamental importance in assuring the  proper and effective use of federal funds and determining if grant program  goals are met.

However,  we have found that while agencies may implement measures with some  of these attributes, other key attributes may not be incorporated. For  example, the Department of Justice (Justice) developed and implemented  86 new performance measures for the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice  Assistance Grant (JAG) funds to state and local governments for criminal  justice activities in 2009. While Justice continued to make efforts to  improve these measures in 2009, we reported that 19 of the JAG  performance measures we reviewed generally lacked, in varying degrees,  several key attributes of successful performance measurement systems,  including clarity, linkages with strategic or programmatic goals, objectivity,  reliability, and the measurability of targets. Specifically, we found that 14  of the 19 measures were not clearly defined; 14 of the 19 measures were  not linked to Justice\u2019s strategic or programmatic goals; 13 of the 19  measures were not reliable; and 17 of the 19 measures did not have  measurable targets. Our report noted that by more fully incorporating  such attributes of effective performance measures into its performance  measurement and reporting system, Justice could facilitate accountability,  be better positioned to monitor and assess results, and subsequently  improve its grants management. We recommended that Justice should, in  revising its performance measures, consider incorporating key attributes  of successful performance measurement systems, such as clarity,  reliability, linkage, objectivity, and measurable targets. Justice concurred  with the recommendations in our report and they have actions underway  that address the recommendations.", "In another example of an agency\u2019s publishing measures that do not  necessarily contribute to its ability to assess grant program effectiveness,  Department of Homeland Security (DHS) implemented some  performance measures for the State Homeland Security Program (SHSP)  and Urban Areas Security Initiative (UASI) in the fiscal year 2011 grant  guidance. However, the type of measures DHS published in the SHSP  and UASI guidance did not contribute to DHS\u2019s ability to assess the  effectiveness of these grant programs, but instead provided DHS with  information to help it measure completion of tasks or activities. We  recommended, among other things, that DHS revise its plan to ensure the  timely implementation of performance measures to assess the  effectiveness of these grants. According to DHS, it has efforts under way  to develop additional measures to help it assess grant program  effectiveness; however, until these measures are implemented, it will be  difficult for DHS to determine the effectiveness of these grant-funded  projects, which totaled $20.3 billion from fiscal years 2002 through  2011. As we have previously reported, performance measures that  evaluate program results can help Congress make more informed policy  decisions regarding program achievements and performance. Agencies  could facilitate accountability, be better positioned to monitor and assess  results, and subsequently improve their grants management by including  key attributes of successful performance measurement systems in their  performance measure revisions.", "Data Collection and Validation Challenges. Grant programs often rely  on recipients\u2019 administrative systems to provide performance information.  Our prior work has shown that agencies relying on third parties for  performance data can have difficulty collecting the data as well as  ascertaining its accuracy and quality. In past work, we have also found  that the availability and credibility of performance data has been a long- standing weakness. An example of this can be seen in our November  2011 report on federal \u201cgreen building\u201d initiatives that foster\u2014in part  through the use of grant funds\u2014construction and maintenance practices  designed to make efficient use of resources, reduce environmental  problems, and provide long-term financial and health benefits in the  nonfederal sector. Eleven agencies implemented 94 federal initiatives, 47  of which were funded by grants. Agency officials reported that they may  not have had information on the results of green building initiatives for the  nonfederal sector, in part because they faced several challenges in  gathering appropriate and reliable performance data, such as utility usage  data for multifamily properties. These difficulties included obtaining the  resources necessary to develop systems for accurate data collection, a  lack of industry standards for performance data collection, third party  utility companies\u2019 diverse policies governing data sharing, as well as the  utility companies\u2019 wide-ranging capacities to collect data. In particular,  HUD officials told us the quality of utility data can vary by utility company,  especially for water consumption data\u2014which can be incomplete and  inaccurate and is often not available in electronic form.", "In other instances, actual performance data may not be available until  after the completion of the grant project. For example, Department of  Energy (DOE) officials said that for the Energy Efficiency and  Conservation Block Grant program (EECBG) actual energy savings data  are generally available only after a project is completed; therefore, to  comply with the program\u2019s reporting requirements, most recipients  reported estimates calculated using the Environmental Protection  Agency\u2019s Portfolio Manager tool. While DOE officials said they had  anecdotal examples of program successes, DOE had experienced  challenges in assessing the reasonableness of the energy-savings  estimates provided by recipients because DOE did not require recipients  to use the most up-to-date estimating tool when calculating and reporting  energy-savings estimates. Consequently, DOE could not identify  instances where recipients\u2019 estimates may need to be more carefully   We recommended, among other things, that DOE should  reviewed. solicit information on recipients\u2019 methods for estimating energy savings  and verify that recipients use the most recent version of the estimating  tool. To address our recommendation, DOE issued guidance effective  June 23, 2011, that eliminates the requirement for grant recipients to  calculate and report estimated energy savings. DOE officials said the  calculation of estimated impact metrics will now be performed centrally by  DOE by applying known national standards to existing grantee-reported  performance metrics. Based on DOE\u2019s action, we concluded that DOE  has addressed the intent of this recommendation. Even in federal grants  with designs that favor performance accountability, challenges related to  collecting and reporting performance data can affect the extent to which  performance accountability can be achieved.", "GAO-11-379."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Numerous Federal Grant Programs, Created over Time without Coordinated Purposes and Scopes, Can Result in Grants Management Challenges", "paragraphs": ["In our 2012 Annual Report: Opportunities to Reduce Duplication, Overlap  and Fragmentation, Achieve Savings, and Enhance Revenue, we  reported on examples of how multiple federal grant programs, created  without coordinated purposes and scopes, can result in structural grants  management challenges. One example involved four DHS grant  programs\u2014the State Homeland Security Program, the Urban Areas  Security Initiative, the Port Security Grant Program, and the Transit  Security Grant Program. DHS\u2019s Federal Emergency Management Agency  (FEMA) allocated about $20.3 billion to recipients through the four  programs from fiscal years 2002 through 2011. These four grant  programs have similar goals and fund similar activities in overlapping  jurisdictions. For instance, many jurisdictions within designated Urban  Areas Security Initiative regions also apply for and receive State  Homeland Security Program funding. Similarly, port stakeholders in urban  areas could receive funding for equipment such as patrol boats through  both the Port Security Grant Program and the Urban Areas Security  Initiative, and a transit agency could purchase surveillance equipment  with Transit Security Grant Program or Urban Areas Security Initiative  funding. We, as well as DHS\u2019s IG, concluded that FEMA should use more  specific project-level data in making grant award decisions in order to  identify and mitigate potential duplication. Our work, and the work of the  DHS IG, concluded that coordinating the review of grant projects  internally would give FEMA more complete information about applications  across the four grant programs that could help FEMA identify and mitigate  the risk of unnecessary duplication across grant applications. We  recommended in February 2012, among other things, that FEMA take  steps to ensure that it collects project information with the level of detail  needed to better position the agency to identify any potential unnecessary  duplication within and across the four grant programs. DHS concurred  with our recommendation in this area.", "In another example of this challenge, we found instances where Justice  could improve how it targets nearly $3.9 billion to reduce the risk of  potentially unnecessary duplication across more than 11,000 grant  awards it makes annually. Justice\u2019s grant-making agencies had awarded  funds from different grant programs to the same applicants whose  applications described similar\u2014and in some cases, the same\u2014purposes  for using the grant funds. While we acknowledged that there may be  times when Justice\u2019s decision to fund recipients in this manner is  warranted, our work found that Justice made grant award decisions  without visibility over whether the funds supported similar or the same  purposes, thus potentially resulting in unintended, and unnecessary,  duplication. We found that Justice had not assessed its grant programs to  determine the extent to which they may overlap with one another and  determine if consolidation of grant programs may be appropriate. Further,  Justice\u2019s grant-making agencies had not established consistent policies  and procedures for sharing grant application information that could help  them identify and mitigate unnecessary duplication in how recipients  intend to use their grant awards. We recommended that Justice should  conduct an assessment to better understand the extent to which the  department\u2019s grant programs overlap with one another and determine if  grant programs may be consolidated to mitigate the risk of unnecessary  duplication. To the extent that Justice identifies any statutory obstacles to  consolidating its grant programs, it should work with Congress to address  them, as needed.

Because grants management can be complex,  collaboration among the grant participants, particularly with regard to  information sharing, is important. With this in mind, we have identified key  practices to enhance and sustain collaboration among federal agencies.  We have also recommended these same key practices to strengthen  partnerships between government and nongovernmental entities, such as  nonprofit organizations. In that same report, we describe an example  related to hurricane recovery that involves difficulties in collaboration  between federal agencies and state and local case management  providers. Disaster case management is a process that assists people in  identifying their service needs, locating and arranging services, and  coordinating the services of multiple providers to help people recover  from a disaster. State and local agencies providing federally funded  disaster case management services faced challenges in, among other  things, obtaining timely and accurate information from the federal  agencies overseeing the disaster case management programs. While  FEMA had a lead role in coordinating other types of disaster assistance  after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, its role for coordinating disaster case  management was not explicit. Initial coordination activities among federal  agencies and case management providers were minimal following the  hurricanes. As a result, we found that some victims may not have  received case management services while others may have received  services from multiple providers. We recommended, among other  things, that FEMA establish a time line for developing a disaster case  management program that includes practices to enhance coordination  among stakeholders involved in this program. FEMA agreed with our  recommendations in this area and reported that it would take steps to  coordinate with stakeholders. Among other actions, FEMA has since held  a disaster case management summit, and participants made  recommendations for improving coordination among federal and  nonfederal stakeholders that will be included in the disaster case  management program guidance.", "GAO, Transportation-Disadvantaged Populations: Federal Coordination Efforts Could  Be Further Strengthened, GAO-12-647, (Washington, D.C.: June 20, 2012). were developing guidance and technical assistance for transportation  coordination, other federal departments still had more work to do in  identifying and assessing their transportation programs, working with  other federal departments to identify opportunities for additional  collaboration, and developing and disseminating policies and recipient  guidance for coordinating transportation services.
