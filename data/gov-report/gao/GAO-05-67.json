However, IRS did not improve in all dimensions of its filing season services and lacks sufficient data to evaluate quality in others. IRS processed returns and issued refunds smoothly. The proportion of returns filed electronically is up to 47 percent. Despite this achievement and numerous initiatives to increase electronic filing, IRS does not expect to reach its long-term goal of having 80 percent of all individual tax returns filed electronically by 2007. A higher percentage of taxpayers was able to reach IRS assistors by telephone than last year and the accuracy rate for providing taxpayers with information about their accounts remained stable. However, the accuracy rate for answering tax law questions declined to 2001 levels. Consistent with IRS's strategy, the number of taxpayers visiting IRS walk-in sites declined, while the number having tax returns prepared at volunteer sites increased. Finally, although IRS continued to expand its Web site services, the site's feature for answering tax law questions raises some concerns. Despite the 2004 improvements, IRS has opportunities for further service improvements. For example, IRS has limited data with which to assess the quality of key services at its walk-in sites and sites staffed by volunteers. Although IRS has initiatives under way to measure quality at both types of sites, the initiatives have been delayed and important details have not yet been determined, which may undermine IRS's efforts to improve services in this area. In the meantime, some of IRS's quality data is likely to be biased. Until IRS fully implements its initiatives and gathers data on quality, it will have difficulty monitoring and improving performance at its walk-in sites and volunteer sites."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Most taxpayers have their only contact with the IRS during the tax filing  season making the agency\u2019s performance during this period a key indicator  of how well IRS is serving the public and helping them fulfill their tax  obligations.

Electronic filing allows taxpayers to receive  refunds faster, and processing is less labor-intensive and error prone than  for paper returns. IRS does not have to transcribe electronic tax return  information and built-in checks eliminate many errors that IRS has to deal  with when processing paper tax returns, such as computational mistakes  and incorrect social security numbers. The rate for this type of error on  electronic tax returns was almost 4 percent compared to almost 25 percent  on paper tax returns, as of July 9, 2004.", "To help taxpayers comply with their tax obligations, IRS provides various  services at its call sites, walk-in sites, and on its Web site.

In addition,  low-income and elderly taxpayers get tax returns prepared at over 13,500  volunteer sites run by community-based coalitions that partner with IRS.  IRS awards grants, trains and certifies volunteers, and provides reference  materials, computer software and, in some cases, computers to these  volunteer organizations.", "IRS\u2019s Web site is important because it allows taxpayers to instantly  download hundreds of tax forms and publications, access current  information on tax issues and electronic filing, and ask IRS tax law and  procedural questions.", "Since passage of the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 (RRA 98),  IRS has been focused on improving filing season services. In 2001, IRS  established a suite of balanced performance measures. The system  emphasizes accountability for achieving specific results and reflects IRS\u2019s  priorities, including providing quality service to each taxpayer in every  interaction. As part of its strategic planning and budgetary processes, IRS  establishes performance goals each fiscal year and uses them to hold  managers and frontline staff more accountable for improving filing season  performance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS Has Generally Improved Its Performance Processing Tax Returns but Does Not Expect to Meet Its Long-Term Electronic Filing Goal", "paragraphs": ["IRS processed individual income tax returns and issued refunds smoothly  in 2004.

According to these same  officials, these mandates led to significantly more electronic filing of  federal tax returns in these states because tax practitioners converted their  entire practices to electronic filing. For example, for California and  Michigan, the largest of the five states, the number of tax returns filed  electronically increased from 4.7 million and 1.9 million in 2003 to 7.1  million and 2.6 million respectively as of May 2004.", "The current rate of growth of electronic filing, however, will not allow IRS  to achieve its long-term electronic filing goal of 80 percent of all returns by  2007, provided by RRA 98.

IRS estimates it  saves $2.15 on every individual tax return that is processed electronically.  However, we cannot independently verify this estimate and its basis is  unclear, because as we have reported, IRS does not have a cost accounting  system to support preparation of such cost estimates. Electronic filing  has allowed IRS to close paper processing centers, devote less staff to the  processing of tax returns, and control processing costs by shifting  resources from labor-intensive paper return processing to other areas, such  as compliance. For example, with the elimination of paper tax return  processing at the Brookhaven Submission Processing Center, IRS used  about 1,000 fewer staff years to process paper returns in 2003 than in 2002,  and plans additional staff-year savings when paper tax returns processing  at the Memphis Submission Processing Center is eliminated in 2005.

Usage has  also declined, apparently by design.", "IRS did not meet its 2004 goal to respond to e-mail questions within  2 business days. On average, IRS responded to e-mail questions in  over 3 business days and only reached the 2 business day goal in 6 of the  27 tax law categories. Neither did IRS meet its accuracy goal. IRS\u2019s  performance data showed that IRS answered about 64 percent of the e-mail  questions accurately, compared to its goal of 78 percent.", "IRS did not meet its goals because of a mismatch between the number of  questions from taxpayers and staff available to respond to the questions. At  the beginning of the 2004 filing season, IRS increased the prominence of  the ETLA feature. However, an IRS official told us that this resulted in the  site receiving more questions than staff could handle. The official said that  in response IRS moved the ETLA feature to a less prominent position on  the Web site. In fact, in its current location, IRS does not expect taxpayers  to be aware of the ETLA feature unless they stumble upon it accidentally  while looking for other information on IRS\u2019s Web site. As a result, the ETLA  feature was used significantly less this year than last. In 2004, taxpayers  and practitioners submitted about 90,000 tax law and procedural questions  via the Web site, down from 153,000 in 2003, a 41 percent decrease. IRS  officials have decided not to move the ETLA feature to a more prominent  location as of October 2004.", "Although the number of questions received from taxpayers via the Web site  is small, when compared to the number of questions received over the  telephone, providing accurate responses to these questions is particularly  important. Not only do inaccurate and untimely responses disappoint the  taxpayers asking the questions, IRS also runs the risk of widespread  dissemination of inaccurate e-mail responses to other taxpayers.", "The decisions about the prominence of the feature and staffing are related.  Achieving timeliness and accuracy goals depends, in part, on recognizing  that decisions about the prominence of the feature, which affect taxpayer  demand, and decisions about staffing are related. If IRS is unwilling to  devote significant staff to answering tax law questions, then the feature  cannot be prominent on the Web site. If IRS believes the feature is worth  making prominent, then there are implications for staffing. For the 2004  filing season, IRS\u2019s decisions failed to recognize the relationship."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS Continues to Offer New Web Services", "paragraphs": ["IRS continued to offer new services via its Web site.

More importantly, in many areas the improved performance is part of a  trend that IRS is sustaining over time. IRS\u2019s filing season performance is  important because it affects over 100 million taxpayers. Taxpayers want a  quick turnaround on their refunds; they want easy access to IRS\u2019s  telephone assistors if they have questions; and they want to instantly  download forms and publications when they need them.", "The improvements we found are the result of systematic, long-term efforts  by IRS. Processing results have improved and resources have been saved  because of IRS\u2019s promotion of electronic filing, telephone access has  improved because IRS implemented new call routing technology, and labor- intensive walk-in assistance is decreasing because of improvements to  alternative services. IRS should be commended for its efforts to improve  service.", "At the same time, however, we have identified several areas that present  opportunities for further improvement. IRS has limited performance  measures and data with which to assess the quality of services at walk-in  and volunteer sites, primarily because its initiatives for doing so are only  partially implemented. IRS deserves credit for planning initiatives to  address these data limitations. However, we are concerned that until the  walk-in initiative is fully implemented, IRS will have biased quality data on  walk-in service. Furthermore, the history of delays and incomplete plans  for the walk-in and volunteer site initiatives leaves us unsure about when  IRS will fully implement them. Until IRS fully implements these initiatives  and gathers data on quality, it may not be able to effectively monitor and  improve performance at its walk-in sites or volunteer sites and, as a  consequence, could be risking its credibility among taxpayers who use the  sites and the community-based coalitions that prepare returns at volunteer  sites.", "Finally, IRS failed to meet its goals for accuracy and timeliness of e-mail  responses to tax law questions, at least in part, by failing to match taxpayer  demand for the feature with staffing.

The Commissioner noted that the  2004 filing season was one of the best ever, with improved telephone  service, timely and effective return processing, substantial increases in  electronic filing, and a successful shift in the number of tax returns  prepared in IRS walk-in sites to volunteer sites. The Commissioner said he  appreciated that our report recognized IRS\u2019s achievements for this filing  season and over the past few years as well.", "The Commissioner agreed with the importance of recognizing and  disclosing the limitations of performance data obtained by managers  directly observing employees in 2005. He also said that IRS has  communicated the limitations in briefings with all levels of management  and outside stakeholders, and will continue to do so. However, the  Commissioner differs with our assessment of the extent of the limitations  in the data. While he agreed that there may be some bias in the data  because employees know that their managers are observing them, he  disagreed with our subsequent finding that data obtained through this  method may not be representative of true performance. However, as our  report indicates, because of the potential for bias and absence of other  data, we cannot determine if the observed performance is representative or  not. Further, according to IRS officials, the accuracy rates compiled by the  quality review staff and managerial reviews cited by the Commissioner are  not based on statistically representative samples.", "The Commissioner agreed with the recommendation to ensure that causes  of delays in implementing improved quality measurement at walk-in sites  are addressed. He said that while the delay in the implementation of  contact recording as a means of collecting embedded quality data is  attributable to the lengthy approval process, IRS expects to begin the  contact recording pilot by January 2005 and is on target for post-pilot initial  implementation for the last quarter of fiscal year 2005. Regarding volunteer  sites, the Commissioner also agreed with the recommendation to  implement quality initiatives in a timely manner and address delays.", "The Commissioner agreed with the intent of our recommendation about  the ETLA feature, but disagreed with our assessment of the cause. He  agreed that it is important to recognize the relationship between the  prominence of the feature and staffing, but disagreed that the decline in  ETLA performance is attributable to inadequate recognition of this  relationship. He stated that the ETLA feature was inadvertently placed in a  more prominent location on IRS\u2019s Web site, thus creating unexpected  demand. However, inadvertent placement suggests that the IRS needs to be  more deliberative in recognizing the impact that placement of this feature  can have on demand and staffing.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Chairmen and Ranking Minority  Members of the Senate Committee on Finance, the House Committee on  Ways and Means, and the Ranking Minority Member, Subcommittee on  Oversight, House Committee on Ways and Means.
