Overseeing contractors' corrective actions: To compound the problems in conducting security assessments, NNSA contractors do not consistently conduct required analyses in preparing corrective action plans.

Concerns over security within the nuclear weapons  complex were brought into sharper focus by the September 11, 2001,  terrorist attacks. These attacks highlighted the importance of effective  physical security in response to a potentially large and well-organized  threat.", "NNSA relies upon its safeguards and security program to ensure the  physical security of the nation\u2019s nuclear weapons complex.

Category I material includes plutonium and uranium in the following  forms: (1) assembled nuclear weapons and test devices; (2) products  containing higher concentrations of plutonium or uranium, such as major  nuclear components, and recastable metal; and (3) high-grade materials,  such as carbides, oxides, solutions, and nitrates. The risks this radioactive  material poses vary, but include the potential for sabotage, or theft for  illegal use in a nuclear weapon.

Historically, NNSA has conducted  comprehensive annual surveys of contractors\u2019 operations for safeguards  and security. These surveys, which can draw upon subject matter experts  throughout the complex, generally take about 2 weeks to conduct and  cover 5 \u201ctopical\u201d areas and 32 subtopical areas. The topical areas include  program management, protection program operations, information  security, nuclear materials control and accountability, and personnel  security. The survey team assigns ratings of satisfactory, marginal, or  unsatisfactory. Currently, NNSA\u2019s facilities have been rated satisfactory in  most topical areas. All deficiencies (findings) identified during a survey  require the contractors to take corrective action, and both findings and  corrective actions are to be entered in the Safeguards and Security  Information Management System\u2014a DOE-wide, integrated tracking  database for findings of surveys and other safeguards and security  activities.", "In addition, NNSA\u2019s Office of Facilities and Operations is expected to  provide policy guidance for safeguards and security.

The office is expected to integrate and defend the budget  for safeguards and security to ensure that program components can  achieve mission objectives. Through various contract mechanisms, NNSA  provides financial incentives, such as award fees, for contractor  performance. NNSA assesses this performance based on the extent  contractors meet a set of measures, which are generally established in  annual performance plans\u2014so-called performance measures.", "DOE\u2019s Office of Independent Oversight and Performance Assurance  supports NNSA in safeguards and security assessments and conducts  independent oversight activities in line with DOE and NNSA policies and  priorities. Among other things, the office is responsible for evaluating the  effectiveness of contractors\u2019 performance in safeguards and security. To  carry out this function, this office periodically assesses both federal and  contractor operations at a site and identifies findings, issues, and  opportunities for improvement.

However, NNSA needs a  stable structure to establish clear roles and responsibilities for its  headquarters and site offices, including safeguards and security oversight.  In May 2001, NNSA\u2019s Administrator proposed a management structure for  his organization, but in December 2001, we reported that a clearly  delineated overall management structure still did not exist. In February  2002, NNSA reported in more detail to Congress on its outline for a new  management structure to improve NNSA\u2019s effectiveness and efficiency.  NNSA expected to implement the new structure later in the year.", "Since then, NNSA headquarters and field officials have been defining  safeguards and security roles and responsibilities. In December 2002,  NNSA fundamentally changed the management structure for safeguards  and security. It abolished operations offices, which had been responsible  for conducting the annual, comprehensive surveys as well as other  safeguards and security activities. It divided these operations offices\u2019  responsibilities among the site offices and a service center, formerly the  Albuquerque operations office; headquarters will oversee the performance  of the site offices. The restructuring brings day-to-day federal oversight of  laboratories and plants closer to the site offices. However, these changes  do not complete the management structure. NNSA plans to further  streamline its oversight of contractors by reducing site activities. Among  other things, NNSA plans to focus more on ensuring that contractors\u2019  management systems are valid. Furthermore, NNSA plans to review its  policies and practices and decide which site office oversight activities can  be reduced or eliminated in order for the site offices to work more  efficiently. It has not yet identified which specific activities will be  modified. At the time of our review, headquarters could not provide details  on how it intends to monitor the NNSA site offices\u2019 performance with  respect to safeguards and security or address deficiencies.", "In creating this new management structure, NNSA has not yet developed a  Functions, Responsibilities, and Authorities Manual (FRAM), an  organizational tool used by managers at federal agencies, including DOE,  for defining roles and responsibilities. This manual is to address the  functions, responsibilities, and authorities of all elements within NNSA.  NNSA headquarters security officials agree that this guidance is crucial  and stated that they are currently developing the components of a FRAM,  which should be finalized in 2003. NNSA told us that completing the FRAM  takes significant time because of the highly detailed planning necessary for  determining staff functions at the various sites.", "According to NNSA site office officials, as they wait for formal guidance  from headquarters on conducting security oversight, each office is  carrying out oversight activities as it deems appropriate. In addition, these  officials told us that they have not received formal notification about the  change in their safeguards and security oversight responsibilities, such as  responsibilities for the survey program. Officials at several site offices  expressed frustration with this lack of direction."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NNSA\u2019s Security Assessment Processes Differ among Sites and Are Inconsistent with DOE Requirements", "paragraphs": ["NNSA site offices are not consistent in how they assess contractor  safeguards and security activities, and they may not be conducting these  assessments in accordance with DOE policy. The lack of consistency and  the failure to implement DOE policy occurs in part because the site offices  have had to assume new oversight responsibilities without, among other  things, clear guidance from headquarters on how to carry out these  responsibilities. As a result, three offices of the seven NNSA site offices we  visited continue to use the traditional survey approach to oversee security  activities (Oak Ridge, Savannah River, and NNSA\u2019s Office of  Transportation Safeguards), while the remaining four have adopted or are  adopting a surveillance model\u2014-Amarillo, Kirtland, Livermore, and Los  Alamos. The distinction between these two activities is important: A  survey provides a comprehensive annual review, by a team of experts, of  contractor safeguards and security and generally takes about 2 weeks;  formerly, the operations offices generally conducted surveys, assisted by  experts from throughout the complex, as necessary. In contrast,  surveillance relies on a single or small number of NNSA site officials  overseeing one or more aspects of a contractor\u2019s safeguards and security  activities throughout the year, and the documentation from a surveillance  or a group of surveillance activities may be used as part of the survey.", "By relying on surveillance, NNSA may have less assurance that it fully  knows the condition of security at its sites and therefore potentially  cannot act to correct deficiencies undisclosed by this limited review.  Surveillance allows subject matter experts at the sites to evaluate areas of  contractor safeguards and security performance more often than the  traditional survey process and therefore potentially identify deficiencies  faster. However, according to DOE officials, reliance on surveillance is not  consistent with DOE orders calling for a comprehensive survey of a  contractor\u2019s safeguards and security performance. This survey provides a  unified assessment of all security-related topical areas. Officials from  DOE\u2019s Office of Security\u2014which developed the policy for conducting  surveys\u2014believe the surveillance model does not comply with DOE order  survey requirements because it is not comprehensive. Officials from DOE\u2019s  Office of Independent Oversight and Performance Assurance expressed  concern about the site offices\u2019 ability to conduct surveillance because of  shortfalls in available expertise. Furthermore, the director of NNSA\u2019s  Office of Defense Nuclear Security acknowledged that although some  NNSA site offices, such as the Los Alamos site office, are using the  surveillance model, this site and others lacked the necessary personnel to  conduct surveillance.", "According to officials from DOE\u2019s Office of Independent Oversight and  Performance Assurance and one site office, surveillance is not compatible  with the current Safeguards and Security Information Management  System, a DOE information database system used to track findings and  associated corrective actions, and therefore could pose problems for sites  in entering information. On the other hand, NNSA officials at site offices  and headquarters argue that using the surveillance model for oversight will  produce an annual end of the year survey report and should have the same  end result as an annual survey. However, NNSA could have difficulty  ensuring consistent and comprehensive assessments because of the  difficulties posed by using the surveillance model without appropriate  NNSA-wide implementation guidance, site office staffing shortfalls, and  database compatibility problems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NNSA\u2019s Corrective Action Practices Are Inconsistent with DOE Requirements", "paragraphs": ["Contractors have not consistently prepared effective, formal root cause  analyses in developing corrective action plans for identified deficiencies,  as DOE policy requires. An effective, formal, root cause analysis can  enhance the development of corrective actions, as we observed while  reviewing some plans. However, less than half of the 43 corrective action  plans we reviewed, dated between 1999 and 2002, showed that the  contractor had performed the required root cause analysis. Furthermore,  in a few cases corrective action plans were based on root cause analyses  that were poorly prepared, resulting in confusion and contradictions. For  example, NNSA had identified a deficiency at one site of potential entry  into a critical facility. The contractor did not fully develop a root cause for  this problem but merely rebutted the finding\u2019s validity. Nevertheless, the  contractor took a corrective action in response to this deficiency\u2014 spending about $150,000. However, because the root cause analysis was  not fully developed, we could not determine how, or if, the contractor\u2019s  corrective actions would correct the deficiency. Furthermore, the  contractor\u2019s staff preparing the analysis did not have formal training in  how to conduct root cause analyses. NNSA site officials agreed that the  root cause analysis was performed incorrectly and that their oversight  review of the analysis had not detected this problem.", "Despite the problems some contractors have had in preparing root cause  analyses, corrective action processes in 2002 at all 7 sites showed that  some sites are making progress. For example, in late 2000, the Office of  Transportation Safeguards, which is responsible for securely transporting  critical NNSA items and material, had begun to correct significant  weaknesses in its process for preparing and tracking corrective actions.", "According to an official responsible for corrective actions at the office, the  new process has already resulted in documented improvements to the  quality and completeness of its corrective action plans. For example, the  new process for root cause analyses identified additional reasons for a  recurring NNSA finding on problems in how three federal agent facilities  in NNSA\u2019s Office of Transportation Safeguards inspected the vehicles used  to transport critical materials across the nation. These inspections are  crucial in preventing individuals from attaching explosives or other foreign  devices to the vehicles in potential attempts at sabotage or theft. The new  process enabled NNSA to identify specific actions to ensure consistent  interpretation and implementation of vehicle inspection procedures  among the three facilities. Because the finding has not been repeated since  July 2000, it appears that the additional corrective actions proved  effective. Another site, Sandia National Laboratories, has developed a  process for root cause analysis that other sites may find useful. Sandia  uses a designated root cause analyst to systematically lead teams of  subject matter experts at the laboratory through the steps for determining  root cause. With this expert in root cause analyses, Sandia helps ensure  that these analyses are consistent and effective.", "Other analyses and assessments that are critical to planning corrective  actions are also not consistently prepared at NNSA sites. In particular, less  than 25 percent of the corrective action plans we reviewed showed  documentation of other analyses required by the DOE order for corrective  action, such as risk assessment or cost-benefit analysis. Without this  documentation, we found it difficult to determine what process, if any, the  sites had used to determine the risk level of the problem or the cost and  relative benefit of implementing corrective actions.", "Consistency problems are likely to continue without effective NNSA  guidance for corrective actions. For example, at four sites we visited, the  sites either did not require a risk assessment and cost-benefit analyses or  stated that they were optional, depending on the site\u2019s evaluation of the  need for an analysis. However, the remaining three sites we visited  required these analyses for all corrective action plans. This inconsistency  resulted in part from differing interpretations of the DOE order governing  corrective actions. As a result, NNSA cannot be assured that all  contractors are considering the costs of corrective actions in conjunction  with the risk posed or the potential benefits to be gained. NNSA officials at  some sites stated that, without implementation guidance, the intent of the  DOE order requiring these analyses can be interpreted differently from site  to site, which contributes to the inconsistent practices we observed. Since  we provided our draft report to NNSA in April 2003, it has sent a brief  guidance letter on corrective action plans to its site offices, clarifying its  analysis and documentation requirements. An NNSA headquarters official  stated that issuance of additional guidance for implementing DOE security  policies is expected in 2003.", "And finally, NNSA sites do not consistently measure all performance  aspects of contractors\u2019 preparation of corrective action plans and may  reward contractors simply for closing the finding on schedule. According  to our review of performance measures concerning corrective actions,  four of the six contractor-operated sites we visited had measures that  were primarily based on whether the contractor met the schedule for  completing corrective actions, not on whether and how well the  contractor had performed the analyses. The other two sites did not  consider any corrective action performance measures in assessing  contractor performance\u2014not even the schedule. However, DOE guidance  encourages sites to measure qualitative factors, whenever possible, to  minimize the need to rely solely on schedule-driven measures. Effective  qualitative performance measures would essentially reflect how well the  contractor completes root cause analyses, risk assessment, and cost- benefit analyses.", "The lack of qualitative performance measures affects the quality of the  correction plan. For example, in fiscal year 1999, DOE\u2019s Office of  Independent Oversight and Performance Assurance criticized a site that  had schedule-driven performance measures for poorly prepared corrective  action plans. Out of the 50 plans reviewed for that site, 27 had inadequate  root cause determinations, and 15 had corrective actions that were  unlikely to fix the deficiency cited. The performance measures in place for  this contractor in fiscal year 1999\u2014and then again in fiscal years 2000 and  2001\u2014did not reflect qualitative aspects of these analyses; instead, they  were primarily focused on schedule-driven outcomes. Some contract  provisions permit the contractor to forfeit some of the award fee based on  other generic performance factors, such as \u201cmanagement failure.\u201d  However, these generic provisions may not be fully effective in motivating  contractors in all aspects of their corrective action performance because  these provisions are not explicitly focused on corrective action and are  therefore not highly visible."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Difficulties in Allocating Staff Could Hinder Effective Safeguards and Security Oversight", "paragraphs": ["NNSA\u2019s site offices have shortfalls in the total number of staff and in the  expertise for effectively overseeing contractors, including covering all  topical areas in the annual surveys.

In particular, some of the site  offices are experiencing difficulty in filling positions because some staff  consider the site locations less desirable than others and because NNSA  has instituted a hiring freeze. Some of these vacancies are for specialists in  particular subject areas, such as industrial security systems\u2014a key  specialty needed for conducting physical security inspections. Officials in  the Office of Independent Oversight and Performance Assurance  concurred that NNSA\u2019s reorganization and the shifting of responsibilities  to the site offices has the potential to weaken security oversight.", "To offset the lack of some subject matter experts at sites, NNSA field  officials indicated that they frequently rely on subject matter experts from  headquarters or other site offices to cover site offices that do not have  expertise locally. With only a limited number of subject matter experts in  the complex, the sites have to coordinate oversight carefully. Coordination  is particularly complicated at those sites that have switched to a  surveillance model since they may have to rely on particular subject  expertise that is only available during certain times.", "NNSA\u2019s new management structure further complicates the problems in  staff allocation. NNSA expects to reduce headquarters and field staff by 20  percent by the end of fiscal year 2004. In this restructuring, NNSA plans to  share staff expertise, creating a \u201cvirtual\u201d organization to cover the needs of  site offices and other areas within the complex until a final move of  personnel can be made. Headquarters officials told us that it may take 1 to  2 years to move the appropriate safeguards and security persons to the  areas where they are needed. Until then, they expect the virtual  organization to meet the complex\u2019s needs. The virtual organization will  include subject matter experts whose knowledge will be needed  throughout the nuclear weapons complex and not just at their current  sites. Some of these experts will work from the service center or be  detailed to site offices as needed. With competing demands for the  experts, it is unclear how they will successfully provide assistance to site  offices in their surveillance processes.

Without a functional management structure, some site offices and  contractors may not be carrying out their security responsibilities, as DOE  orders require. In particular, NNSA has not fully assured itself that the four  sites that rely on surveillance activities, rather than on the DOE-required  surveys, are overseeing contractors\u2019 security activities in the integrated,  comprehensive fashion that are called for in the annual surveys. Moreover,  when NNSA site offices allow and reward contractors for closing findings  without ensuring that the contractors have correctly identified the root  cause, assessed risk, and conducted a cost-benefit analysis, NNSA cannot  be assured that the security problem identified was adequately addressed.

NNSA also concurred that corrective action  plans must be prepared in accordance with established standards and  policy and based on documented root cause analysis, risk assessments,  and cost-benefit analysis. Since we provided our draft report to NNSA, it  has sent its site offices a guidance letter on corrective action plans that  clarifies its analysis and documentation requirements. NNSA now allows  required elements to be omitted from corrective action plans, but only if  the contractors document the rationale for the exclusion as a formal part  of their plan.

Specifically, NNSA disagreed with our conclusion that it was not  ensuring the comprehensive annual assessments of contractors\u2019  performance that DOE policy requires. As we reported, four of the seven  site offices no longer conduct comprehensive, integrated surveys to assess  security but instead rely on surveillance activities. NNSA believed that  these surveillance activities were also comprehensive; however, NNSA  provided no evidence\u2014such as implementation guidance to the sites that  are conducting surveillances\u2014that would ensure that the sites\u2019  surveillance activities conform to DOE\u2019s policies. Without such guidance,  NNSA cannot be fully assured that surveillance activities, as presently  conducted, provide the comprehensive assessment DOE requires in its  surveys. Our recommendation therefore is intended to focus NNSA  management attention on ensuring that site offices conduct security  assessments that are integrated, comprehensive, and on par with the  survey approach previously used and currently described in DOE orders.  Furthermore, NNSA asserted, incorrectly, that we found its security  posture to be at risk. Assessing NNSA\u2019s security posture was not the  objective of this report. Rather, our objective was to assess the way NNSA  manages its overall security program. We have clarified the report, where  appropriate.", "Finally, regarding our recommendation that NNSA develop and implement  a plan to ensure that it effectively allocates staff to provide safeguards and  security oversight, NNSA commented that managers have staffing plans  and that its virtual organization and additional hiring will address sites\u2019  need for certain types of skilled personnel. Reliance on the virtual  approach may be effective in the short term. However, the continuing  vacancies at some sites indicate that NNSA may have difficulty attracting  and retaining necessary expertise at specific, understaffed locations over  the long term.
