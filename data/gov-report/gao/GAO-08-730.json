In calculating ERR for 20 projects within the compacts, MCC used a 20-year time frame for 9 projects and used different time frames for the other 11. In 2 of the 11 projects, using a 20-year time frame, as MCC used for similar projects, would reduce the ERR below the level MCC set as the minimum acceptable ERR. At the compact level, MCC's use of varying time frames did not affect the ERRs significantly. MCC used varying methods to account for the costs of same-sector projects, although its approaches to determining project benefits were generally similar. MCC also used two different methods to calculate compact-level ERR; however, the choice of method did not reduce it below the minimum ERR. In three of the four compacts that we reviewed, MCC did not retain documentation of the economic analyses used to support the investment decision, but continued to modify the analyses. MCC has recently begun to standardize elements of its economic analyses and centralize its records management. MCC identified and corrected analytic errors in its projections of impact on income and poverty. MCC also used varying methods to project these impacts. In responding to GAO's questions about its published projections of impact on income and poverty, MCC identified analytic errors for three of the four compacts and, in correcting these errors, generally lowered the projected impacts. Correcting these errors raised one projection by 5 percent but reduced others by 3 percent to 96 percent. According to MCC officials, the revised projections would not have affected MCC's decision to recommend signing the compacts. The officials noted that, in the future, compact impact projections will undergo peer review. However, MCC has not documented procedures for these reviews. MCC used varying methods for its projections of impact on income and poverty, limiting comparability and replicability across compacts. To project impact on income for Armenia, El Salvador, and Mozambique, MCC estimated the compacts' impact by summing the total benefits of individual compact projects and adding them to the income that would have prevailed without MCC. However, for Lesotho, MCC estimated the impact on income based on the published results of a World Bank model based on elements different from those of the MCC compact. In response to our questions, MCC revised its initial estimate of the effect of income growth on poverty for Mozambique by presenting two estimates, based on Mozambique-specific and cross-country data, respectively. Although a number of methods for projecting poverty impact are valid, the method chosen can affect the results, and MCC's guidelines do not identify preferred methods for these calculations. MCC also used varying methods to estimate numbers of beneficiaries for the compacts and has not provided specific criteria for defining beneficiaries; however, MCC officials reported they are taking steps to provide more detailed guidance."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In January 2004, Congress established the Millennium Challenge  Corporation (MCC) to administer the Millennium Challenge Account  (MCA) for foreign assistance.

For Mozambique, MCC  projected a gradual increase in the number of beneficiaries as benefits  accrue over time, whereas for Armenia it did not.", "For El Salvador, MCC reported that the entire population of the  intervention area would benefit, although the project-specific beneficiary  counts did not sum to the area\u2019s population.", "For Lesotho, assuming that the compact would have economywide impact,  MCC reported the country\u2019s entire population as beneficiaries although  estimates of project beneficiaries were available.", "MCC guidelines define program beneficiaries as individuals or groups that  derive economic gains from MCC investments. However, the guidelines do  not explicitly define economic gain or provide criteria for counting  beneficiaries based on the amount of accrued benefits or the degree of  exposure to compact-provided services. As a result, it is unclear whether  MCC\u2019s transaction teams would count as equal beneficiaries a person using a  compact-related benefit once and a person using the same benefit regularly or  whether MCC would apply an equivalence scale to adjust for varying use of  the benefit. For example, for El Salvador education programs, MCC first  counted as beneficiaries all individuals entering the programs\u2014assuming  they would experience some income increases, and later revised the method  to include only individuals completing the programs, assuming they would  experience measurable income increases. The transaction team\u2019s choice of  method for defining beneficiaries, in turn, affects the compact-level  projections of impact on income and poverty. For example, MCC\u2019s estimate of  the number of persons to be lifted out of poverty by the compact as a whole  ranges from 145,000 in the first case to 83,000 in the second, depending on the  assumptions used. (See app. IV for more details.)", "According to MCC officials, MCC is in the process of making its guidance  regarding program beneficiaries more operational by establishing criteria  for defining beneficiaries.

Without a consistent  approach and preferred methods for its due diligence economic analyses,  MCC\u2019s transaction teams and individual team members have used different  methods to identify compact results. This heterogeneity means that  different teams could reach different conclusions about the worthiness of  individual projects or compacts based on the method chosen. MCC has  refined its guidance over time, and continues to do so. Further refinements  that include formal procedures for reviewing the results of due diligence  economic analyses and establishing a consistent approach with preferred  methods\u2014which could be modified if required by specific country  conditions\u2014would help MCC reduce the likelihood of errors and provide a  common MCC lens for projecting compacts\u2019 ERRs and impacts.

MCC commented that there is not a single cost-benefit standard practice  and that in many cases the inconsistencies we identified were technically  appropriate. We acknowledge that there is not a single standard practice;  however, we maintain that consistent analytic approaches are needed to  ensure the reliability of MCC\u2019s analyses. According to MCC, the choice of  analytic time frames was in some cases based on the judgment of the  individual lead economist rather than on established criteria.

To carry out this review, we reviewed MCC compacts with  four countries: Armenia, El Salvador, Lesotho, and Mozambique. We  selected these countries based on their percentage of total compact  funding, the recentness of the compact, and geographical representation.  These four compacts make up a total of about $1.56 billion in compact  assistance. When we began our work in August 2007, this represented  about 41 percent of the $3.85 billion MCC had set aside for 13 compacts  and included the most recent compacts signed in Eurasia, Latin America,  and Africa.

Next, we consulted MCC\u2019s guidance for ERR  analyses as well as the spreadsheets provided by MCC to support its  calculations of ERR and document its work. We reviewed MCC guidance  on calculating ERR and minimum ERRs and compared MCC\u2019s internal  documentation and spreadsheets to elements of this guidance. We  examined the spreadsheets to determine how MCC aggregated project- level ERRs into one compact-level ERR for the four countries in our  review and identified the two approaches\u2014-summing net benefits and  using weighted averages\u2014that MCC used. To determine the effects of  MCC\u2019s alternative approach on the compact ERR, we used MCC\u2019s cost and  benefit data to calculate the alternative ERRs. We also used these data to  calculate compact- and project-level ERRs over different time horizons to  explore the sensitivity of the ERRs to differing time horizons. To  determine how MCC approached same-sector projects in different  compacts, we studied road and water projects because these were each in  three of the four compacts. We then compared the broad approaches MCC  used in assessing the costs and benefits associated with these projects. We  interviewed MCC economists and other officials regarding MCC\u2019s ERR  analysis to further discuss MCC\u2019s approaches and clarify aspects of MCC\u2019s  analysis.

We identified statements  that fell into four categories of economic projections: impact on national  or regional income, impact on national or regional gross domestic product  (GDP) growth rate, impact on national or regional poverty, and number of  compact beneficiaries. MCC reviewed and concurred with our compilation  and summary of these statements of compact impact. We also reviewed  MCC\u2019s guidance on projecting these economic impacts.

After an initial examination of these spreadsheets,  we met with MCC economists and other officials to discuss MCC\u2019s  methods and calculations for projecting compact impact. MCC officials  also provided responses to our questions in written form.
