In addition, it partially satisfies conditions for meeting the capital planning and investment control review requirements established by OMB in Circular A-11 (part 7), including information security, and for complying with the DHS enterprise architecture. DHS has implemented eight open GAO recommendations made during the past 4 years, including those related to performance measures and targets, independent verification and validation, cost estimation, and program reporting. Seven other recommendations made during this time are in the process of being implemented. With respect to these seven, DHS has taken steps to satisfy each, such as establishing an accountability framework, reducing overlap and concurrence among ACE releases, and completing a privacy impact assessment, and actions are under way or planned to more fully address them. GAO is making three new observations about the expenditure plan and the management of ACE. First, the program is taking needed steps to redefine requirements for several ACE releases because of limitations in the completeness of original requirements, but this redefinition is likely to introduce significant program schedule delays and cost increases. Second, the changes to ACE requirements have led to replacement of a key commercial product, but the new product carries the risk of negatively impacting user productivity. Third, the automated database used for managing ACE risks is incomplete and does not contain information needed to adequately inform program decisions. All told, DHS has continued to make progress on ACE, and the program is better positioned today for delivering promised capabilities and benefits than it has been in the past. Nevertheless, key program management practices relating to, for example, human capital management, requirements management, and risk management remain a challenge, and other management areas, such as information security and architecture alignment, continue to require attention. As a result, GAO sees major program schedule delays and cost overruns on the horizon. To improve ACE management and minimize exposure to risk, it is important for DHS to remain vigilant in its efforts to satisfy ACE legislative requirements, fully implement prior GAO recommendations, and keep Congress fully informed about the program's status, plans, and risk."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), as part of the Department  of Homeland Security (DHS), submitted to Congress in February 2007 its  fiscal year 2007 expenditure plan for the Automated Commercial  Environment (ACE) program pursuant to the Department of Homeland  Security Appropriations Act, 2007.", "Begun in 2001, ACE is to replace and supplement existing cargo processing  technology.

To address this, key stakeholders are now  collaborating and decomposing legacy code. However, this effort is  expected to significantly delay some system releases and drops. Program  officials have taken several actions that they say will minimize the impact  of the delays, such as prioritizing shared functionality, dividing  releases/drops into smaller increments, and changing release deployment  strategies.

The program office subsequently stopped work on SAP  Enterprise Portal design and configuration efforts and reported that ITS  would be used for release 5/drop A2 instead of the SAP Enterprise Portal.  This decision is expected to have some near-term schedule impacts  because much of the completed work for A2 had been based on the  planned use of SAP Enterprise Portal. Further, use of ITS raises the risk of  inadequate user response time, which would, in turn, negatively impact  user productivity and introduce a high probability of significant cost and  schedule impacts. Program officials reported that actions are under way to  mitigate the risk through performance modeling and test planning.

Most recently, we reported1 that defined ACE performance targets are not  always realistic and that goals, expected mission benefits, and performance  measures are not fully defined and adequately aligned.", "In response, the program office has established an initial set of performance  measures that are tied to program objectives and related performance goals, and it  has established processes for the collecting, analyzing, and integrating  performance data for each measure. Among other things, these performance  measures address user satisfaction, efficiency, and productivity. Moreover, these  measures have been made an integral part of the ACE accountability framework and they were approved by the CBP Commissioner and the DHS CIO on June 30  and July 6, 2006, respectively.", "Objective 2: Open Recommendations  According to program officials, these initial measures will continue to be revised  and augmented, and thus will evolve over time based on lessons learned, changes  to existing release capabilities, and refinements of requirements for future releases.  For example, the program office reported in March 2007 that new measures are  still being developed, reviewed, and evaluated for Releases 2, 3, and 4 at the same  time that performance data is being collected and reported for existing measures  for these releases. According to program officials, the new measures will be  combined with existing performance measures.", "In addition, CBP\u2019s December 2006 quarterly congressional report stated that  performance measures for future releases, such as Release 5, are being scheduled for identification and development and that changes are being made to  existing measures when they are determined to be inappropriate. For example, the  program office learned that the performance measure \u201cpercentage of truck  manifests being filed electronically\u201d did not recognize that empty trucks are not  required to file manifests, and thus it revised the metric used to divide the number  of electronically filed truck manifests by the total number of required truck manifests  instead of the total number of trucks in order to get a more meaningful reflection of  ACE performance.", "To assist in managing these performance measures, the program has established  a life cycle process for performance measures as well as a database tool to record  and manage modifications.", "Objective 2: Open Recommendations  Performance Measures Alignment  Open recommendation 3: Explicitly align ACE program goals, benefits, desired  business outcomes, and performance measures.", "Use advanced passenger and cargo information (NTC, ATS-Air, ATS, Screening and Targeting- ACE) to pre-screen, target, and identify potential terrorists and terrorist shipments and any related activity.", "Increased use of targeting."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Further, this model links the measures to specific ACE releases.

Specifically,  The estimates assumed different timelines for completing development of all  releases. The independent estimate assumed development completion by  fiscal year 2010, while the government estimate assumed fiscal year 2011.  According to program office officials, this accounts for about five percent of the  difference.", "The government estimate included a number of items that the independent  estimator did not. For example, the independent estimator did not include  training and outreach items, such as the cost of conferences with trade  associations, training materials, and associated travel. As a result, the  government estimated training and outreach costs over the life of the program  to be about $90 million, while the independent estimate put these costs at  about $39 million.

We have continued to report  on extensive overlap and concurrence in ACE releases and the cost overruns and  schedule delays that have resulted. Most recently, we reported1 that the ACE  schedule continued to provide for such overlap and concurrency and that the risks  associated with doing so were not being effectively addressed.", "Since then, the program office has reduced this overlap and concurrence. For example, it has  decoupled (i.e., reduced dependencies among) certain ACE program components by separating Screening 1-3 from Releases 4-6 and   aligned the development and delivery of functionality for different releases  with the availability of required hardware environments.", "Recent quarterly congressional reports stated that CBP has taken actions to  reduce potential contention for limited resources. Examples include  dividing releases into smaller subreleases, called drops, to provide more  improving planning for development, integration, testing, and training activities  and milestones to better schedule use of development and test environments;  and  centralizing management of shared software services to address, among  other things, allocation of resources and responsiveness to workload peaks  and use of consistent technical management approaches across releases.", "Moreover, the program\u2019s risk database identifies overlap and concurrency-related  risks. However, the mitigation strategies for these risks contain vague or  incomplete data. These data limitations make it difficult to determine the status or  the effectiveness of the efforts to reduce the risks associated with overlap and  concurrence among releases. (See the observations section of this briefing for  additional information on program risk management.)", "Objective 2: Open Recommendations  The program office is also conducting regular integration meetings with the teams  supporting each release to discuss concerns, decisions, and schedules associated  with resource availability and is using a software tool to track and mitigate release- specific concurrency risks.", "Notwithstanding these steps, the program continues to face challenges in  managing dependencies among releases, which any associated concurrency in the  program\u2019s development exacerbates. For example, the schedule slips expected  with Release 5/Drop A2 will affect Release 6/Drop M1, as resources have been  shifted from M1 to address the A2 delay.

Among other things, requirements should be complete, and to  accomplish this, best practices advocate engaging all key stakeholders in the  requirements definition and management process.", "In defining ACE requirements, the program office discovered that its original  requirements definition approach did not adequately engage all key stakeholders,  and to its credit, has since taken steps to address this. Specifically,  In the spring of 2004, the program office and the ACE support team conducted  more than 300 business process workshops with the ACE user community to  help define ACE requirements for the future releases. This requirements  definition approach was referred to as the Global Business Blueprint (GBB)  effort.", "Objective 3: Observations Requirements Limitations Likely to Cause Delays In June and July of 2005, a key group of ACE stakeholders that were not  originally involved in the GBB (application programmers familiar with the  legacy system that ACE is to replace) raised questions about the completeness of the requirements. To address these questions, the program  office examined the GBB\u2019s completeness by first reverse-engineering the  legacy software for a small number of legacy system programs and then comparing the reverse-engineered requirements to the GBB-derived  requirements. Based on this, which is referred to as legacy code decomposition, the program office found that the GBB-derived requirements  were missing about 20 percent of needed ACE functionality.", "In August 2005, the program office decided that it needed to decompose all of  the legacy system code in order to completely capture the requirements for all  ACE releases. Work began with decomposition of the legacy code related to  ACE Release 5/Drop A2 (Entry Summary Accounts and Revenue).", "Objective 3: Observations Requirements Limitations Likely to Cause Delays In September 2006, the program office determined that the legacy code decomposition approach alone was not sufficient to gain a full understanding  of the requirements given the size and complexity of A2. As a result, the  requirements definition process was expanded to engage another key  stakeholder group (business process subject matter experts). Under the  expanded approach, referred to as legacy code decomposition and  collaboration, legacy system software programmers and subject matter  experts were to examine the code line by line in defining ACE requirements.", "In November 2006, the legacy system code decomposition and collaboration  effort for Release 5/Drop A2 fell behind schedule because of lack of personnel  with legacy system expertise and experience.

They also said that, while they have not yet estimated how long A2 will be delayed and what the  associated cost implications are, they do not expect the cost increases to breach  the current acquisition program baseline of $3.3 billion, which translates into a cost  increase of less than $200 million. Moreover, they said that several actions have  been taken to minimize the impact of the delays. For example,  A2 functionality necessary for M1 has been given priority in order to support  M1 deployment as originally planned and  A2 scope is being divided into increments to allow some functionality to be  delivered sooner and to minimize the impact on other drops.", "Objective 3: Observations Requirements Limitations Likely to Cause Delays However, these actions carry consequences, such as missed opportunities to  combine field training and an increase in the number of legacy interfaces, thus  increasing the potential for introducing software problems.", "In addition, program officials told us that they are considering changes to the A2  and M1 deployment strategies to address stakeholder concerns, and they said that  these changes could also minimize the magnitude of the A2 and M1 delays. Specifically, they said that they had planned to deploy on a national basis, meaning  that A2 and M1 functionality would be deployed to all ports at the same time and  concurrently adopted by all users nationwide. However, deployment may change to  a filer-by-filer basis, meaning that A2 and M1 functionality would be deployed to all  ports at the same time, but not all filers would begin using it at the same time.", "Objective 3: Observations Requirements Limitations Likely to Cause Delays According to program officials, they believe that the change in the deployment  strategy would both address stakeholder concerns and minimize any A2 and M1  schedule delays caused by the redefinition of requirements.

For example,   many risks were missing information on the status of efforts to implement the   many risks (18) were missing criteria for completing mitigation steps, clear  descriptions of what the risk entailed, and start and end dates for planned  mitigation activities.", "Because of such database limitations, we could not determine the status of and  mitigation progress on 17 risks. Moreover, these database limitations were  reflected in the documentation used at key program events, such as PMRs. This  means that the program does not have the risk-related information that it needs to  inform its program decisions and to reduce the chances of potential problems  becoming actual problems.", "As of May 23, 2007 the risk database contained 46 risks.", "Objective 3: Observations Risks Not Being Effectively Managed Program officials, including the official responsible for risk management, stated that  risk management is immature and needs to be strengthened. The reasons they  gave for these risk management weaknesses are due to   all staff not being trained on how to use the tool (last training was provided in  2003, and the since then a number of people have joined the program); the tool is unique to the ACE program and thus no CBP guidance exists on its  use); and  each ACE group addresses risk differently in its weekly meetings.", "To improve ACE risk management, program officials told us that they are:  establishing a group to ensure the quality and completeness of the database;  holding regular group meetings with contract staff and team leads to discuss  risks and their impacts; and   conducting risk management training.", "Objective 3: Observations Risks Not Being Effectively Managed If implemented effectively, such steps should result in more meaningful information  about program risks that can be useful to DHS in managing the program and to  Congress in overseeing it.
