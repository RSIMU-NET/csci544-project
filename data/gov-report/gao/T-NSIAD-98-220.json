To help inform the debate on these and other matters, on June 1, 1998, you asked us to evaluate the adequacy of IMF\u2019s public reporting in two areas: (1) its finances and financial condition and (2) its \u201csurveillance\u201d or monitoring of member countries\u2019 economies. We have not yet completed our work on these issues; however, as you requested we are prepared today to discuss (1) what resources IMF currently has available to carry out its operations and (2) whether IMF\u2019s financial condition can be determined from publicly available information. We expect to report on the other matters addressed in your June 1 request later this fall."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["A few important concepts need to be explained when discussing IMF finances. Two of these are members\u2019 \u201cquotas\u201d and \u201ccurrency purchases.\u201d Quotas are the membership dues that countries pay when they join IMF.Up to 25 percent of quotas normally must be paid in reserve assets, which are special drawing rights or currencies that are \u201cfreely usable\u201d in the principal foreign exchange markets (U.S. dollars, Japanese yen, Deutsche mark, French francs, or pound sterling), and the balance may be paid either in a country\u2019s domestic currency or with non-interest-bearing promissory notes. The portion paid in freely usable currency or special drawing rights is referred to as the member\u2019s \u201creserve assets\u201d or \u201cinitial reserve tranche position\u201d and can be drawn on by the member as needed without prior IMF approval. If withdrawn, these amounts are replaced with the country\u2019s own currency. Members are not obligated to replenish their reserve tranche positions.", "When a country needs additional funds other than from its reserve tranche position, IMF does not loan the funds to the country, per se. Rather, the country \u201cpurchases\u201d the currency it needs from IMF with an equivalent amount of its own currency and then later \u201crepurchases\u201d its own currency using SDRs or other currency on terms established by IMF. Because IMF\u2019s financial assistance is in the form of currency purchases and repurchases by member countries, the financial assistance does not reduce the combined total of IMF\u2019s currency holdings in terms of SDR equivalents. Instead, the composition of IMF\u2019s currency holdings changes. For example, the composition of IMF\u2019s holdings of member currencies can change when members purchase and repurchase currency. The relationship of IMF\u2019s holding of a member\u2019s own currency to its quota is an important one, because it can illustrate whether the member is a creditor, debtor, or in a neutral position with IMF. In general, currencies of members who are creditors are considered usable by IMF to finance transactions, while currencies of countries in a neutral borrowing or a debtor position are considered unusable by IMF.", "A brief discussion about the accounting standards that IMF uses is also useful. According to the IMF External Audit Committee\u2019s (EAC) audit opinion, IMF\u2019s financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. However, according to IMF, IMF is not bound by specific legal provisions or accounting principles adopted in the individual member countries. EAC and IMF officials told us that the accounting principles referred to in the EAC\u2019s auditor\u2019s report are neither U.S. generally accepted accounting principles nor international accounting standards, but are described in a note to the financial statements and do not differ materially from these two.", "You also asked us to provide information on the current amount of outstanding IMF credit, including the share of that credit that was borrowed by developing countries. This information is provided in an attachment to my statement.", "I would like to emphasize that GAO does not take a position on what action the Congress should take on the executive branch\u2019s request. That is a policy decision beyond the scope of our review.", "I should also mention that, as you may know, we have no direct audit authority over IMF, as is the case with other international organizations. Nonetheless, working through the Treasury Department and the IMF\u2019s U.S. Executive Director\u2019s office, IMF has cooperated with our inquiry and provided us information not normally made publicly available."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Amounts and Potential Sources of IMF Funding", "paragraphs": ["IMF has several sources available from which it can potentially obtain funds for use in its operations. The most important of these, according to IMF, are the currency holdings provided through quota subscriptions that underpin most of IMF\u2019s operating funds. Other sources include IMF\u2019s GAB and other bilateral borrowing arrangements with IMF members. In addition, IMF could potentially borrow from private sources or sell some of its gold holdings. Some of these resources are clearly more accessible than others."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Availability of IMF\u2019s Currency Holdings", "paragraphs": ["IMF\u2019s determination of available currency holdings, its primary source of readily available funding for carrying out its operations, is based on its judgment concerning the level of usable currency and the level of reserves needed for contingencies. IMF officials have stated that reserves are necessary for two reasons: (1) to maintain sufficient working balances in various currencies to execute foreign exchange transactions and (2) to have available for use in the event that some currencies become unusable and can no longer be used to finance IMF transactions due to a deterioration in members\u2019 balance of payments and external reserve positions.", "There are several steps involved in calculating the amount of resources IMF has readily available for operations. First, IMF calculates the amount of currency holdings from quotas, which was estimated to be about $195 billion as of July 20, 1998. However, only the currencies of members with sufficiently strong balance of payments and gross external reserve positions are used or usable by IMF for financing its transactions and are included in its operational budget, which is a nonpublic document. Of the $195 billion of currency holdings, IMF estimates that, before taking into consideration IMF extended credit, about $130 billion, or 67 percent, is usable. The remaining $65 billion is unusable. These currencies cannot be used to finance IMF transactions because IMF has determined that the members providing these currencies may be experiencing balance of payment problems or may have drawn on their reserve assets. (See fig. 1.)", "Generally, IMF presently considers 30 of its 182 members to have sufficiently strong balance of payments and external reserve positions so that their currencies can be considered usable. As indicated in figure 2, the U.S. share of usable resources is about 27.3 percent.", "U.K.", "Currencies provided from quotas are recorded in IMF\u2019s balance sheet as an asset. The distinction between usable and unusable currency is not reported on IMF\u2019s balance sheet, but is discussed in its annual report.", "As shown in table 1, IMF reduces its total usable currencies of $130 billion by about $70 billion, the amount of its members\u2019 currency purchases outstanding, to determine its available usable resources.", "IMF further reduces its available and usable resources of $60 billion by the amount of the commitments it has made to countries in need of assistance in their balance of payment positions. Estimated undrawn commitments total about $17 billion. After these deductions, IMF\u2019s usable currency holdings amounted to about $43 billion as of July 20, 1998. (See fig. 3.) However, IMF adjusts this amount to establish a level of reserves it may need for contingencies.", "There has been some discussion about the appropriate level of IMF reserves, the outcome of which may lead to different estimates of the amount available for IMF operations. Table 2 will assist in understanding the two approaches. The results of both approaches have been cited by IMF and Treasury officials in public discussions and have thus led to some confusion about how much currency holdings are really available.", "Approach 1 in table 2 is used by IMF to calculate its available resources. Using this method, IMF adjusts its available and uncommitted resources by $12 billion for the establishment of a reserve, as required by the Executive Board. According to IMF documents, this reserve has two components. One component is an adjustment for minimum working balances, which IMF officials stated are needed due to the number and types of currencies it manages to execute its foreign exchange transactions. The second component is a reserve of 10 percent of the quotas of members included in the operational budget for transfers, in case one or more of these countries may encounter balance of payments problems and can no longer provide its currencies as a source of funding for IMF transactions. After this adjustment, IMF would have $31 billion available for operations.", "The second approach to estimating IMF\u2019s reserve requirements, shown in table 2, is based on the concept of a minimum IMF liquidity ratio. This approach has been used by the U.S. Treasury and endorsed by the IMF\u2019s First Deputy Managing Director. As shown in figure 4, as of July 20, 1998, IMF\u2019s liquidity ratio was about 44 percent, which is lower than at any time during the last 15 years. This approach considers IMF\u2019s historical low liquidity ratio of about 30 percent to be the minimum threshold that could be achieved before it becomes imprudent to lend. In order not to drop below this 30-percent threshold, IMF would have to retain about $30 billion to $35 billion of its $43 billion in usable and uncommitted resources, which would leave only about $8 billion to $13 billion of resources that IMF could use. The $30 billion to $35 billion adjustment represents the possibility that one or more countries providing usable currencies would draw on its reserve tranche position. The amount of IMF resources that should be retained is ultimately a judgment call of IMF\u2019s Executive Board. This decision would pinpoint the level below which the Executive Board would consider it imprudent to continue lending.", "July 20, 1998)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Potential Resources Available to IMF", "paragraphs": ["In addition to its permanent, quota-based resources, IMF\u2019s Articles of Agreement permit it to borrow funds for use in its operations and transactions. This borrowing may be from any source, public or private.Since 1962, IMF and 11 industrialized countries have maintained standing lines of credit, known as the General Arrangements to Borrow, for IMF to use in emergencies. Before the recent activation of GAB for Russia, GAB was last used by the United States in 1978 when the United States borrowed funds that IMF had borrowed from GAB participants and used them to intervene in world currency markets on behalf of the U.S. dollar. IMF has had other borrowing arrangements over the years, notably during 1979-86.

NAB would not replace GAB, which will remain in force; however, NAB would be the facility of first recourse in the event of a need to provide supplementary resources to IMF. The decision to create NAB grew out of concern following Mexico\u2019s financial crisis of 1994-95 that substantially more resources might be needed to respond to future sovereign financial crises. Under NAB, the number of participating countries will be increased to 25, and the total amount of credit available in NAB will be up to about $45.5 billion, which is composed of the $22.7 billion available under GAB and an additional $22.7 billion for NAB. NAB could be activated when participants representing 80 percent of the credit lines\u2019 resources determine that there is a threat to the international financial system. This could make it more difficult to use NAB than GAB, since GAB requires only a 60-percent approval for activation. As you know, NAB has not yet entered into force."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Borrowing Arrangements", "paragraphs": ["In the past, IMF has borrowed funds from official sources other than through GAB. The largest such borrowing arrangements were in 1979 and 1981. In 1979 IMF concluded a series of borrowing agreements with a group of 14 industrial and oil exporting countries to finance IMF\u2019s supplementary financing facility, which was designed to assist members whose balance of payments deficits were large in relation to their quotas. In 1981, due to the continued high demand for IMF financing, IMF concluded individual borrowing agreements with various central banks and the Bank for International Settlements. The 1979 and 1981 borrowing arrangements totaled SDR 23.1 billion (roughly $31 billion at today\u2019s dollar/SDR exchange rate). IMF\u2019s most recent bilateral borrowing arrangement was a SDR 3 billion arrangement with Japan in 1986. At one point, in 1985, IMF borrowings from member governments (under all borrowing arrangements) equalled almost 42 percent of outstanding IMF credit (loans).", "According to a U.S. Treasury official, the option to borrow funds from private sources was last seriously considered in the early 1980s. According to an IMF official, the IMF\u2019s structure is based on cooperation with its members, and that is what it considers to be its source of financing. According to a U.S. Treasury Department official, IMF decided not to borrow from private capital markets in the early 1980s for a number of reasons. First, it was believed that the cooperative nature of the institution might be undermined were IMF to begin relying on private sources, rather than its membership, to fund its operations. Also, there was a concern about the consequences of having IMF, which seeks to stabilize international capital markets, rely on those markets for its funding. And, there was uncertainty about whether IMF could have borrowed the amount of funds it needed from private markets quickly enough to employ them as needed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IMF\u2019s Gold Holdings", "paragraphs": ["IMF also has gold holdings that some have suggested it could potentially use to fund its operations. Currently it holds about 103.4 million fine ounces of gold at designated depositories in four member countries. IMF acquired most of its gold prior to 1978, when IMF\u2019s Articles of Agreement required that in most cases 25 percent of members\u2019 quota subscriptions be paid in gold and transactions between member countries and IMF normally be conducted in gold.", "IMF values its gold at SDR 35 per ounce (about $47 per ounce), the original cost at which the gold was acquired. Therefore, IMF\u2019s gold holdings are valued on IMF\u2019s balance sheet at SDR 3.6 billion (about $4.8 billion). However, IMF estimates and makes public as a note to its balance sheet the current market value of its gold holdings based on the market price. In April 1998 IMF estimated its gold was worth about $32 billion. Were IMF to decide to sell some of its gold, it is unclear how much money could be raised because the world price likely would be affected as a result of the sale.", "The regular use of gold in IMF transactions ended in 1978, when IMF\u2019s Articles of Agreement were amended to reflect the end of the fixed currency exchange rate system that had governed the international financial system up to that time. Under its amended articles, IMF may sell gold outright on the basis of market prices and may accept gold in the discharge of a member\u2019s obligations to IMF at an agreed price on the basis of market prices at the time of acceptance. IMF\u2019s General Counsel told us that IMF does not have authority to engage in any other gold transactions\u2014including loans, leases, or use of gold as collateral\u2014because these uses are not expressly allowed under IMF articles.", "Although IMF may sell gold to raise funds, it does not regard gold holdings to be a liquid asset and, therefore, does not consider gold to be a liquid resource for lending purposes. According to IMF documents and IMF officials, the principal reason for not considering gold to be a liquid asset is that IMF\u2019s Articles of Agreement require that any sale of gold be approved by IMF\u2019s Board of Governors by an 85-percent majority of total voting power. Thus, any group of countries that holds more than 15 percent of IMF\u2019s voting power could prevent a gold sale.
