During that period, female enlisted and commissioned officers had higher annual attrition rates than corresponding males. However, the gaps between male and female attrition rates have narrowed. For example, in fiscal years 2004 and 2018, female enlisted servicemembers' annual attrition rates were 33.1 and 8.6 percent, respectively, and enlisted males' annual attrition rates were 22.7 and 6.1 percent respectively. GAO's statistical model found that the likelihood of separation for female servicemembers is 28 percent higher than that of males. GAO's literature review of selected studies on reasons why females separate from the military identifed six themes, including family planning, sexual assualt, and dependent care, as influencing separations.", "GAO's analysis of fiscal year 2004 through 2018 data estimated that promotion rates were slightly lower for female enlisted in most years, but higher for officers as compared to their male counterparts. Specifically, female enlisted promotion rates ranged from 0.1 to 2.5 percentage points lower than male enlisted promotion rates during much of that period. However, from fiscal year 2004 through 2018, female commissioned officer promotion rates ranged from 3.3 to 5.3 percentage points higher than the rates of their male counterparts. GAO's statistical model also estimated that the likelihood of promotion outcomes varies by certain characteristics, such as gender and pay grade. For example, GAO estimated that the likelihood of promotion for female enlisted in the Navy may be lower than male enlisted, and the evidence is mixed for the other services.", "DOD has identified female recruitment and retention as important to diversity in the military, but the services do not have plans that include goals, performance measures, and timeframes to guide and monitor current or future efforts to recruit and retain females. According to officials, DOD is currently updating its diversity and inclusion strategic plan; however, neither its prior plan nor the updated plan include goals, such as recruitment or retention goals, performance measures, and timelines for any one particular demographic group. DOD officials stated that retention goals have, in the past, been misconstrued as quotas and, as such, the department does not set goals or targets for gender. However, goals are not quotas and can help guide continued improvement. Without DOD guidance and service plans with goals, performance measures, and timeframes to monitor female recruitment and retention efforts, DOD may continue to miss opportunities to recruit and retain a valuable segment for its active-duty force."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD provide the services with guidance to develop plans with goals, performance measures, and timelines to address female recruitment and retention efforts, and for the services to develop such plans.

In 2015, the Secretary of  Defense stated that he had made a commitment to building America\u2019s  force of the future\u2014the all-volunteer military that will defend the nation for  generations to come\u2014and that, like the outstanding force of today, the  force of the future must continue to benefit by drawing strength from the  broadest possible pool of talent, including women, who make up over 50  percent of the population. DOD officials have also stated that recruiting  and retaining female servicemembers is important in order to more  accurately reflect the nation\u2019s population, ensure the strongest possible  military leadership, and maintain and improve mission readiness.  Nevertheless, according to the 2017 Defense Advisory Committee on  Women in the Services (DACOWITS) report, there continues to be only  nominal gender diversity in the military, especially in the highest echelons  of departmental leadership, and more female servicemembers leave the  military at various career points than their male counterparts.", "In 2015, we reported on DOD\u2019s efforts to integrate female  servicemembers into ground combat roles. We found, among other  things, that DOD had been tracking, monitoring, and providing oversight  over the services\u2019 efforts to integrate women into ground combat  positions, but had not developed plans to monitor long-term integration  progress. We reported that after the decisions had been made to open  positions and occupations to women, there was a lengthy implementation  process before women were able to serve in the newly opened  occupations. However, we found that the Office of the Under Secretary of  Defense for Personnel and Readiness had not developed plans for a  mechanism or process to monitor the services\u2019 progress in their efforts to  integrate newly opened positions and occupations after January 1, 2016.  We recommended that the Secretary of Defense direct the Under  Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness to develop plans for  monitoring, after January 2016, the services\u2019 implementation of their  integration efforts and progress in opening positions to women, including  an approach for taking any needed action. DOD concurred with and took  action to address this recommendation in March 2016 by requiring that  annual assessments regarding the full integration of women in the armed  forces be submitted no later than December 31 of each calendar year.", "Additionally, in 2015, we reported on DOD and Coast Guard officer  recruiting efforts. Specifically, we reported that DOD officials recognized  the importance of increasing the representation\u2014or total number\u2014of  female servicemembers and that senior leadership in the military services  also expressed their intent to increase diversity within their respective  services, to include increasing the representation of female officer  applicants in both DOD and the Coast Guard. Prior to these changes, we  previously reported on the attrition and retention of female  servicemembers in the military and found that female servicemembers  generally leave the service at higher rates than male servicemembers,  although the basic pattern of attrition was similar for both male and  female servicemembers.", "House Report 115-676 accompanying a bill for the John S. McCain  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 stated that  concerns persist that higher attrition rates of female active-duty  servicemembers than male servicemembers will result in a  disproportionate impact to mission readiness if left unresolved. The  report also stated that, from an economic standpoint, when female  employees leave, organizations must deal with higher recruiting costs,  longer training times, and lower productivity. This report included a  provision for us to examine, among other things, promotion and attrition  for female servicemembers compared to other groups in the military and  the reasons for any differences in promotion and attrition.", "This report examines (1) trends in the percentage of female active-duty  servicemembers in the military and their attrition rates from fiscal year  2004 through 2018, including the reported factors leading to that attrition;  (2) how female active-duty servicemember promotion rates compare with  those of their male counterparts and among female servicemembers with  differing characteristics from fiscal years 2004 through 2018, and what  factors influence these rates; and (3) the extent to which DOD and the  military services have plans to guide and monitor female active-duty  servicemember recruitment and retention.", "To address these objectives, we focused our review on active-duty  enlisted servicemembers, commissioned officers, and warrant officers in  all pay grades, serving within DOD in the four military services (the Army,  the Navy, the Marine Corps, and the Air Force).", "For our first and second objectives, we obtained and analyzed  servicemember personnel data for fiscal years 2004 through 2018 from  the Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC), including service start date,  branch of service, grade, gender, race, marital status, and whether the  servicemember has dependents. We selected fiscal year 2004 through  2018 because this is the most recent 15-year time period for which DOD  has complete data available and allows for a robust trend analysis. These  data were obtained from three different files that DMDC maintains. We  aggregated these data into a single file that allowed us to analyze them  for both descriptive statistics to show trends, as well as model using  statistical analyses to examine the likelihood that specific events would  occur for various demographic characteristics. Specifically, we  implemented a discrete time method for the analysis of event histories,  using the logit model. This is a type of duration analysis methodology  that is suited to the analysis of event occurrences and their timing\u2014which  is the time elapsed until the event occurs (e.g. number of years until  separation or promotion).", "We could not control for all factors that may affect separation and  promotion, such as a servicemember\u2019s performance and labor market  conditions. We also do not model for the promotion process of each of the  services. Therefore, our modeling provides information on possible  associations in the data, and it does not establish a causal relationship.  We determined that the data obtained and used in our analysis are  reliable for the purposes of this review by reviewing related  documentation, for example, the data dictionary associated with the  active-duty file; interviewing knowledgeable officials from DMDC; and  conducting both electronic and manual data testing to look for missing or  erroneous data.", "We also conducted a literature search for existing studies that analyzed  female servicemember attrition and promotion. To identify these studies,  we conducted searches of various databases, including ProQuest,  EBSCO, Westlaw Edge, Scopus, Dialog, and the National Technical  Information Service, for studies published in calendar years 2008 through  2018. This search and review process yielded 213 potentially relevant  studies and, after further analysis, we selected 87 studies for full text  review. From the group of 87 studies, we excluded 81 studies because  they did not meet our inclusion criteria or the results were deemed not  relevant to this review. The resulting six studies were further reviewed for  content. Two analysts sequentially reviewed the full texts of these  studies to identify substantive content relevant to our review and two  methodologists sequentially reviewed them to help ensure that they were  methodologically sound for the purposes of our review. Any differences  were reconciled between the analysts and methodologists. All results  reported from the reviewed studies were deemed sufficiently reliable for  use in this report.", "For our third objective, we reviewed documentation on the Office of the  Secretary of Defense\u2019s (OSD) and services\u2019 efforts to collect and analyze  data on diversity in the department, as well as servicemember retention.  We reviewed the department\u2019s plans for developing and promoting  diversity and inclusion in the force, including the department\u2019s 2012-2017  Diversity and Inclusion Strategic Plan. We reviewed a draft version of  the department\u2019s forthcoming 2019-2024 Diversity and Inclusion Strategic  Plan. We evaluated their efforts to determine whether they met federal  internal control standards, including that management should design  appropriate types of control activities such as defining objectives clearly  and helping ensure that terms are understood at all levels. We reviewed  other publications on female recruitment and retention efforts in the  military, including reports and briefings developed by the DACOWITS and  the 2011 final report of the Military Leadership Diversity Commission to  determine what others had found and recommended with regard to  female recruitment, retention, and participation in the military. We also  analyzed our past reports and recommendations, for example, on military  personnel management and DOD\u2019s Career Intermission Pilot Program,  among others.", "For each of the objectives, we interviewed officials from the Office of  Military Personnel Policy and the Office for Diversity, Equity, and  Inclusion (ODEI), both under the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense  for Personnel and Readiness, as well as officials from the four military  services. We also interviewed representatives from DACOWITS and the  Service Women\u2019s Action Network.

For example, the Department of Defense  Appropriation Authorization Act, 1976 directed the secretaries of the  military departments to, among other things, take such action as may be  necessary and appropriate to insure that women were eligible for  appointment and admission to the military service academies. Almost  two decades later, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  1994, among other things, required the Secretary of Defense to ensure  that qualification of members of the armed forces for military occupational  career fields open to both male and female members is evaluated on the  basis of common, relevant performance standards without differential  standards or evaluation on the basis of gender. It also repealed the  remaining statutory prohibitions on the Secretary of the Navy assigning  female servicemembers to duty on vessels and aircraft engaged in  combat missions or expected to be assigned combat missions.", "In January 1994, the Secretary of Defense issued a memorandum  creating the Direct Ground Combat Definition and Assignment Rule,  which made servicemembers eligible for assignment to all positions for  which they were qualified, but it excluded female servicemembers from  assignment to units below the brigade level whose primary mission was  to engage in direct combat on the ground. The memorandum required  the services to coordinate approved implementing policies and  regulations\u2014including certain service restrictions on the assignment of  women\u2014with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Personnel and  Readiness prior to their issuance. The memorandum also permitted the  services to propose additional exceptions.", "In its 2011 final report, the Military Leadership Diversity Commission  stated that the services\u2019 have been leaders in providing opportunities for all servicemembers, regardless of racial/ethnic background, or gender,  and stated that the DOD\u2019s mission-effective force is a living testament to  progress in the areas of military equal opportunity policies and related  recruiting and management tactics. The report also stated that more  needs to be done to address 21st century challenges and that the Armed  Forces have not yet succeeded in developing a continuing stream of  leaders who are as demographically diverse as the nation they serve.", "A 2013 Secretary of Defense and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  memorandum rescinded the 1994 Direct Ground Combat Definition and  Assignment Rule. That memorandum also directed the military services  to open currently closed units and positions to female servicemembers,  consistent with certain principles and with the implementation of certain  standards. The memorandum also directed that the integration of female  servicemembers into these newly opened positions and units occur as  expeditiously as possible, considering good order and judicious use of  fiscal resources, and no later than January 1, 2016.", "The military services also took action through issuing guidance.

Our  analysis of these data found that the reasons active-duty servicemembers  separate from the military vary slightly based on gender, pay grade  category, and length of service, as well as by time period. For example,  misconduct was a top reason for separation from 2004 through 2013 for  enlisted male servicemembers with 5 or fewer years of service, whereas  pregnancy was one of the top three reasons for separation for female  enlisted with 5 or fewer years of service, during that same period.  However, neither misconduct for male servicemembers nor pregnancy for  female servicemembers were found to be in the top three reasons for  separation in fiscal years 2014-2018. The results of this analysis are  shown below in figures 6, 7, and 8."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Factors Identified in the Literature That Can Influence Female Active- Duty Servicemembers\u2019 Decisions to Separate from Military Service", "paragraphs": ["To better understand other factors that may underlie a servicemember\u2019s  decision to separate, we reviewed a variety of studies on female active- duty servicemember retention in the military. Through our review, we  identified six factors that were reported to influence female active-duty  servicemembers\u2019 separation from the military: work schedules,  deployments, organizational culture, family planning, sexual assault, and  dependent care.", "Work schedules. Specifically, four of the six studies in our literature  review cited work schedule as a reason for or factor influencing  separation by female active-duty servicemembers. For example, in  several studies female active-duty servicemembers cited the demands  and uncertainty of their work schedules. In one study, which asked senior  female enlisted Army personnel about the primary factors responsible for  their decision to leave the military, a review of the participants\u2019 responses  indicated that the primary factor responsible for female servicemembers  exiting the service sooner than their male counterparts was that the  female members believed they constantly had to sacrifice family time for  their careers. In another study, former female active-duty naval surface  warfare officers cited the uncertainty of their work schedules as having a  strong influence on their decision to separate from the military.", "Deployments. The occurrence of deployments and their effects on family  life were also highlighted in four of the six studies as factors influencing  female servicemembers\u2019 decisions to separate from the military. For  example, one study of female Air Force pilots identified deployments as a  factor that caused them to consider leaving active duty. In another study,  which included 295 active-duty and reserve female officers in grades O-1  to O-5, participants in 94 percent of the 54 focus group mentioned  deployments as an important negative influence on retention, given their  effect on spouses and children.", "Organizational culture. Organizational culture also had an effect on  female servicemembers\u2019 decisions to separate from the military in four of  the six studies we reviewed. In one study, female active-duty, reserve,  and Air National Guard officers in the Air Force mentioned the lack of  female mentors and role models in leadership positions, and the  experience of sexism as factors influencing the decision to separate.  Female servicemembers also discussed how having leaders who are not  supportive or understanding of family needs can contribute to a negative  or toxic work environment. Study participants also noted that they often  faced sexism and the existence of an \u201cold boy\u2019s network,\u201d especially in  career fields dominated by males. As such, these female servicemembers  felt they had to work harder to prove themselves and also felt they were  sometimes not treated equally because they were female.", "Family planning. Three of the six studies in our literature review cited  family planning as being another characteristic that influences separation  for female active-duty servicemembers. In one study, female officers in a  majority of focus groups (85 percent of 54 focus groups) mentioned  issues related to pregnancy that could affect their decisions to stay in or  leave the Air Force. More specifically, Air Force female officers (active  duty, reserve, and Air National Guard) cited the difficulty of timing  pregnancies to fit within rigid career timelines. These female  servicemembers stated that they felt they needed to ensure that  pregnancy occurred at certain times in their careers to minimize negative  career effects. Even with that effort, the female servicemembers stated  that negative effects still persisted due to missed opportunities while  pregnant, such as in-residence professional military education, or career- field specific problems, such as loss of flying time for pilots.", "Sexual assault. Two of the six studies in our literature review cited  sexual assault as a reason for separation by female active-duty  servicemembers. In one study, female military veterans mentioned both  the occurrence of a sexual assault and how it was handled by the military  as contributing to their separation. For example, two females stated that  the perpetrator was not punished, and another woman cited the lack of  support from other servicemembers as contributing to their decisions to  separate from the military. In another study examining female officer  retention (active duty, reserve, and Air National Guard) in the Air Force, a  few participants cited cases in which either they or individuals they knew  had decided to leave specifically because of a sexual assault.  Participants commented that female officers often do not want to report  the incident, deciding instead to separate.", "Dependent care. Two of the six studies in our literature review also  mentioned challenges with dependent care as influencing female  servicemembers\u2019 decisions to separate from the military. For example, in  one study, female military veterans cited difficulties being separated from  their children for long time periods as a reason for ending military service.  These difficulties were both emotional and practical, including limited  stable and safe placement options for children while mothers were  deployed. In another study, female Air Force officers in 59 percent of 54  focus groups stated that difficulties with childcare development centers on  military bases\u2014including service hours that were incompatible with their  work schedules, inconsistent quality of care, and long waitlists\u2014could  influence their separation decisions. Participants in that study\u2019s focus  groups stated that childcare development centers often have limited  hours that make it difficult to coordinate childcare with long work hours or  shift work. For example, according to the study\u2019s focus group participants,  pilots are sometimes required to fly at night and regularly need overnight  child care, outside of typical childcare development center hours. Further,  participants stated that some female servicemembers also raised  concerns about the quality of care at childcare development centers,  noting that the quality of employees is not consistent across locations and  that the childcare development centers generally do not provide day-care  services that include educational activities to enhance children\u2019s learning,  unlike some off-base options. In addition, some female servicemembers  in that same study\u2019s focus groups cited problems setting up childcare with  childcare development centers before the end of their maternity leave due  to lengthy wait lists."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Promotion Rates from Fiscal Year 2004 through 2018 Varied by Gender for Enlisted and Officers, and the Likelihood of Promotion Differs by Demographic Factors", "paragraphs": ["Our analyses determined that for fiscal years 2004 through 2018, female  active-duty servicemember promotion rates were slightly lower for  enlisted in most years, but higher for officers as compared to their male  counterparts.

Further, the report stated that women and  minorities face barriers to serving in such key assignments which can  affect their ability to reach senior leadership ranks. The Military  Leadership Diversity Commission also reported that one barrier may  include lack of sufficient knowledge about these key assignment  opportunities, perhaps because women and minorities may not receive  the same career counselling or mentoring about key assignments as their  white male counterparts.", "DOD officials stated that as part of the 2017 ODEI assessment, female  promotion rates were also analyzed across the services.

However, neither  the 2012-2017 plan nor the draft updated plan, according to officials, has  a focus on goals, such as recruitment or retention goals, for any one  particular demographic group. Officials we interviewed stated that there is  a general goal to recruit a force that reflects the makeup of the country it  represents as a method for encouraging trust in the military among the  population at large. However, according to OSD and service officials, the  department emphasizes gender-neutral occupational standards and  policies, with its focus on recruiting and retaining the best and brightest  service members. Specifically, OSD officials stated that the department\u2019s  priorities and goals are aimed at improving the retention and promotion  rates of all active-duty servicemembers, while ongoing OSD efforts to  evaluate diversity within the department focus more broadly on the overall  state of diversity of both the military and civilian workforces.

DACOWITS\u2019  report further stated that concerns persist that this attrition will result in a  disproportionate impact to mission readiness if left unresolved.  DACOWITS has also made a number of recommendations specific to the  services\u2019 efforts to address and increase female representation in the  military through the use of goals and targets. For example, in 2014,  DACOWITS recommended that the services should have targets to  increase the representation of enlisted female servicemembers and that  these targets should be benchmarked against the pool of eligible  recruits. Subsequently in 2015, DACOWITS recommended, among  other things, that the services should set goals to systematically increase  the representation of women in the officer and enlisted ranks.", "However, according to officials from the four services, the services  currently do not have plans that include goals, performance measures,  and timeframes to guide and monitor efforts to recruit and retain female  servicemembers. For example, Marine Corps officials stated that DOD  has not tasked the Marine Corps to prioritize gender with regard to  retention or promotion. Marine Corps officials also stated that the  Marine Corps does not have any programs or initiatives that focus  specifically on reducing attrition and increasing retention of female  servicemembers and that its programs focus on increasing the retention  of quality Marines\u2014regardless of gender. As another example, Air  Force officials stated that, while the Air Force has some specific initiatives  that each have their own goals, performance measures, and timeframes  included as part of those initiatives, these efforts have not been  consolidated into a deliberate plan that targets female servicemembers.  Navy and Army officials also stated that their respective services do not  have plans specific to female retention efforts.", "We found that OSD has not provided guidance to the services to develop  and implement plans to guide and monitor their efforts to recruit and  retain female servicemembers.

DOD\u2019s 2012- 2017 Diversity and Inclusion Strategic Plan recognized that, due to the  significant amount of time it takes to develop senior DOD leaders, it is  essential that the department act to tap into the nation\u2019s growing diverse  talent pool. We have previously reported that pressures facing DOD\u2014 including increased competition for resources and involvement in more  than a decade of conflict\u2014underscore the importance of using a strategic  approach to recruiting, developing, and retaining its workforce.

For our first and second objectives, we obtained and  analyzed servicemember personnel data for fiscal year 2004 through  2018 from the Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC), including, for  example, service start date, branch of service, status, grade, gender,  race, marital status, and whether the servicemember has dependents.  We selected fiscal year 2004 through 2018 because, at the time we  submitted our request for data, this was the most recent 15-year time  period for which DMDC had complete data available.", "These data were obtained from three different files maintained by DMDC,  including the (1) Active-Duty File Monthly Snapshots, (2) Transaction data  for active-duty separations for October 1, 2003 through September 30,  2018, and (3) the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System. The  data obtained from DMDC are granular down to the single month and  single servicemember. We aggregated these data into a single file that  allowed us to analyze them for (1) descriptive statistics to show trends  and (2) modeling using duration analysis to show trends to examine the  likelihood of occurrence for specific events for various demographic and  DOD-specific administrative characteristics. We analyzed these data  based on specific demographic characteristics, including gender, race,  ethnicity, pay grade, and other variables. While the focus of this review  was female active-duty servicemembers, we analyzed data on male  active-duty servicemembers, using the same demographic and  administrative characteristics, as the primary comparison group. We also  analyzed the data to identify and compare the reasons for separation by  these different groups and characteristics based on assigned separation  designator codes.", "To assess the reliability of the data obtained from DMDC, we reviewed  related documentation, for example, the data dictionary associated with  the active-duty file; interviewed knowledgeable officials from DMDC; and  conducted both electronic and manual data testing to look for missing or  erroneous data. For example, within the data, some servicemembers  changed their race, ethnicity, and/or gender over time. Through  discussions with DMDC, we determined that these are often errors in the  data, but in some instances can be the result of personal decisions by the  servicemember. DMDC recommended using the last known instance for  each of these attributes for each point on the servicemembers\u2019 timeline.  We implemented this recommendation, as it improved the results and  findings and avoided servicemembers being counted across multiple,  exclusive demographics\u2014i.e., double counted. Based on these steps, we  determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  analyzing and reporting on the representation of servicemembers with  specific demographic characteristics and the rates of attrition and  promotion among those servicemembers for fiscal year 2004 through  2018. We also determined that fiscal year 2004 through 2018 DMDC data  were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of constructing a duration  analysis statistical model to estimate the likelihood of attrition by  servicemembers with specific demographic factors.", "We used the fiscal year 2004 through 2018 DMDC data to construct  descriptive statistics of the demographic composition of the services\u2019  active-duty forces and drew comparisons between female and male  servicemembers, and across demographic and administrative  characteristics. According to service officials, the department does not  have a universal definition for attrition. We, therefore, constructed attrition  rates for active-duty servicemembers by capturing (1) any enlisted  servicemember who separated more than 1 week from the end of his or  her first service contract, and (2) any officer who separated within 3 years  of his or her start date. Attrition rates were calculated by taking the total  number of members who attritted, per the definitions above, in a given  fiscal year and dividing that number by the total number of officers or  enlisted servicemembers in that year, times 100 to express as a percent.  To prevent double counting of non-attritted members across multiple  fiscal years, attritted and non-attritted members were counted in the year  that they entered service and not the year that they separated. In order to  construct promotion rates for active-duty servicemembers, we used the  servicemembers\u2019 time-in-grade, time-in-service, and each service\u2019s policy  for time-in-service and time-in-grade minimums for each pay grade to  determine eligibility for promotion. For every fiscal year, if a  servicemember was eligible for promotion whether they promoted or not,  the servicemember was counted as eligible. If the servicemember did  promote, then the servicemember was counted as promoted. The  promotion rate for each category was calculated as the total number of  promoted servicemembers divided by the total number of promotion- eligible servicemembers, times 100 to express as a percent.", "We also conducted an analysis of associations between each of  separation and promotion outcomes and certain demographic  characteristics for servicemembers using the servicemember personnel  data from DMDC for fiscal years 2004 through 2018, which included  quarterly data on individual servicemembers. These data also contain  information for each servicemember on the timing of his or her separation  and promotions, if any. Specifically, we implemented a discrete time  method for the analysis of event histories, using a logit specification. This  is a type of duration analysis methodology that is suited to the analysis of  event occurrences and their timing\u2014which is the time elapsed until the  event occurs (e.g. number of years until separation or promotion).", "We examined the extent to which each active-duty servicemember\u2019s  separation and promotions (or lack thereof) may be associated with  certain factors related to that servicemember\u2019s demographic and  occupational characteristics. These factors were time-invariant (e.g. race,  gender, etc.) or time-varying (e.g. occupation, marital status, etc.). For our  duration models for separation, we generally included (1) gender, (2)  marital status, (3) the existence of dependents, (4) race and ethnic  groups, (5) pay grade categories, (6) having a bachelor\u2019s degree or  higher education degree versus not, (7) whether the individual has been  assigned to an overseas duty location, (8) occupation, (9) fiscal year fixed  effect, and (10) quarter-year time-in-service fixed effect. We tested  multiple models and included various sets of factors. Since the number of  female active-duty servicemembers decreases at higher pay grades, this  was taken into account for our duration models for promotion. To ensure  convergence of our promotion models, we made the following  adjustments in control variables. We started with the Marine Corps\u2019  promotion data because the service has the smallest proportion of female  active-duty servicemembers among the four services. After testing with  multiple sets of different control variables with the data, we decided to use  the following control variables. (See table 1.)", "We could not control for all factors that may affect separation and  promotion, such as a servicemember\u2019s performance and labor market  conditions. We also did not model the promotion process in the services.  Our modeling should thus be viewed as evidence that may inform on  possible associations in the data, and does not establish a causal  relationship. Additional inquiry into each of the observed separation and  promotion cases would be needed to truly ascertain the role of certain  factors, such as gender, in each of these cases.", "Additionally, we conducted a literature review and content analysis of  existing research on promotion and retention in the military, with a focus  on female servicemembers. To identify studies, we conducted searches  of various databases, including ProQuest, EBSCO, Westlaw Edge,  Scopus, Dialog, and the National Technical Information Service, for  English-language sources published in calendar year 2008 through 2018.  We searched for peer-reviewed material, government and non- governmental reports, conference papers, books, and dissertations or  theses. The database search was conducted from December 21, 2018 to  January 10, 2019.", "This search and review process yielded 213 potentially relevant studies  after initial scoping by a research librarian and, after additional screening  of titles and abstracts for relevance, resulted in the selection of 87 studies  for full text review. Specifically, two analysts sequentially reviewed the  full texts for substantive content and reconciled any differences. Two  methodologists sequentially reviewed the full texts for methodological  considerations and reconciled any differences. Then the analysts and  methodologists discussed and reconciled any remaining differences.", "To be included in our review, studies had to either (1) include factors  servicemembers reported about intended or actual separations, including  retention; or (2) report analyses designed to identify characteristics that  statistically predict service separation or attrition differences among  female servicemembers or between female and male servicemembers.  The studies had to include primarily one or more of the four military  services within DOD and could not focus exclusively on the Coast Guard.  The studies also had to include primarily active-duty personnel and could  not focus exclusively on reserve component personnel. Studies that  focused only on recruitment or accessions, exit or lateral transfer from a  career field but not separation from service, or data collected only from  military spouses were also deemed out of scope. The studies we included  in our literature review were published between 2008 and 2018 and  included information relevant to our research objective on female  servicemember retention, attrition, or promotion.", "From the group of 87 studies, we excluded 81 studies because they did  not meet our inclusion criteria or the results were deemed not relevant to  this review. The resulting six studies were further reviewed for content.", "We conducted a content analysis in order to be able to summarize the  relevant results from the literature search by identifying recurring themes.  To conduct this content analysis, the team developed a list of six  overarching themes with three to seven sub-themes associated with each  main theme. The resultant 54 sub-themes were documented in the team\u2019s  data collection instrument as a paired main theme and sub-theme. First,  an analyst recorded an assessment of whether the study included the  theme and sub-theme. A second analyst independently reviewed the  same information and recorded an assessment. The two analysts  reconciled their two independent assessments to produce the analysts\u2019  consensus and recorded that consensus in the team\u2019s final spreadsheet.  All results reported from the studies reviewed were found to be sufficiently  reliable for how they are used in this report and any limitations are  mentioned in the text.", "For our third objective, we reviewed documentation on the Office of the  Secretary of Defense\u2019s (OSD) and services\u2019 efforts to collect and analyze  data on diversity in the department, as well as servicemember retention.  We reviewed the department\u2019s plans for developing and promoting  diversity and inclusion in the force, including the department\u2019s 2012-2017  Diversity and Inclusion Strategic Plan. We also reviewed a draft version  of the department\u2019s forthcoming plan for 2019-2024 Diversity and  Inclusion Strategic Plan. We evaluated their efforts to determine whether  they met federal internal control standards, including that management  should design appropriate types of control activities such as defining  objectives clearly and helping ensure that terms are understood at all  levels. We reviewed other publications on female recruitment and  retention in the military, including reports and briefings developed by the  Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services (DACOWITS)  and the 2011 final report of the Military Leadership Diversity Commission  to determine what others had found and recommended with regard to  female retention and participation in the military. We also analyzed our  past reports and recommendations, for example, on military personnel  management and DOD\u2019s Career Intermission Pilot Program, among  others.", "For all three objectives, we also interviewed officials from the Office of  Military Personnel Policy Office and the Office for Diversity, Equity, and  Inclusion (ODEI), both under the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense  for Personnel and Readiness, as well as officials from the four military  services. We also interviewed representatives from DACOWITS and the  Service Women\u2019s Action Network. Further, we reviewed previously  made recommendations by DACOWITS and the Military Leadership  Diversity Commission aimed at improving promotion and retention,  specifically of female servicemembers, and interviewed OSD officials  about any progress made by the department and the services to address  these recommendations.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2018 to May 2020  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

We controlled for specific servicemember characteristics such as gender,  branch of military service, pay grade, race or ethnicity, marital status, and  the existence of dependents to estimate the association of these  characteristics on the likelihood of active-duty servicemembers separating  from the service. Table 15 depicts the results of our analysis. Positive  numbers higher than 1.0 indicate the comparison group (e.g., married  female servicemembers without dependents) is more likely to separate  than the baseline group (e.g., unmarried female servicemembers without  dependents). Positive numbers lower than 1.0 indicate the comparison  group (e.g., female officers) is less likely to separate than the baseline  group (e.g., female enlisted).", "Odds ratios from the duration analysis allow us to compare the relative  relationships between various characteristics and separation from the  military. For categorical variables, increase or decrease in the likelihood  of separation is in comparison to an omitted category, or reference  baseline group. Odds ratios that are statistically significant and greater  than 1.00 indicate that servicemembers with those characteristics are  more likely to separate than the baseline group. Odds ratio that are less  than 1.00 indicate that servicemembers with those characteristics are less  likely to separate. For example, the odds ratio for married female  servicemembers with dependents in the Air Force are 1.203. This implies  that the odds of separation for married female servicemembers with  dependents in the Air Force are 1.203 times the odds of separation for  unmarried female servicemembers without dependents in the Air Force,  holding other factors constant, or that the odds of separation for married  female servicemembers with dependents in the Air Force are about 20  percent higher than single female servicemembers without dependents in  the Air Force, if other conditions remain constant."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Kimberly Mayo (Assistant  Director), Jennifer Weber (Analyst in Charge), Adriana Aldgate, Emily  Biskup, Charles Culverwell, Edda Emmanuelli-Perez, Cynthia Grant,  Chad Hinsch, Yvonne Jones, Zina Merritt, Amie Lesser, Samuel Moore,  Moon Parks, Steven Putansu, Leigh Ann Sheffield, Michael Silver,  Pamela Snedden, Carter Stevens, Elaine Vaurio, and Lillian M.
