This progress has been the result of hard work throughout the agency and sustained commitment at the top levels of the agency. However, IRS still faces financial management challenges. At the beginning of GAO's audit of IRS's fiscal year 2007 financial statements, 75 financial management-related recommendations from prior audits remained open because IRS had not fully addressed the issues that gave rise to them. During the fiscal year 2007 financial audit, IRS took actions that enabled GAO to close 18 of those recommendations. At the same time, GAO identified additional internal control issues resulting in 24 new recommendations. In total, 81 recommendations remain open at the end of fiscal 2007. To assist IRS in evaluating and improving internal controls, GAO categorized the 81 open recommendations by various internal control activities, which, in turn, were grouped into three broad control categories. The continued existence of internal control weaknesses that gave rise to these recommendations represents a serious obstacle that IRS needs to overcome. Effective implementation of GAO's recommendations can greatly assist IRS in improving its internal controls and achieving sound financial management and can help enable it to more effectively carry out its tax administration responsibilities. Most can be addressed in the short term (the next 2 years). However, a few recommendations, particularly those concerning IRS's automated systems, are complex and will require several more years to fully and effectively address."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In its role as the nation\u2019s tax collector, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)  In its role as the nation\u2019s tax collector, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)  has a demanding responsibility to collect taxes, process tax returns, and  has a demanding responsibility to collect taxes, process tax returns, and  enforce the nation\u2019s tax laws.

IRS collects taxes  both at its own facilities as well as at lockbox banks that operate under  contract with the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Financial Management  Service (FMS) to provide processing services for certain taxpayer receipts  for IRS.

Consequently, it is critical that IRS maintain  appropriate separation of duties to allow for adequate oversight of staff  and protection of these vulnerable resources so that no single individual  would be in a position of causing an error or irregularity, potentially  converting the asset to personal use, and then concealing it. For example,  when an IRS field office or lockbox bank receives taxpayer receipts and  returns, it is responsible for depositing the cash and checks in a depository  institution and forwarding the related information received to an SCC for  further processing. In order to adequately safeguard receipts from theft,  the person responsible for recording the information from the taxpayer  receipts on a voucher should be different from the individual who  prepares those receipts for transmittal to the SCC for further processing.  Also, for procurement of goods and services, the person who places an  order for goods and services should be different from the person who  receives the goods and services. Such separation of duties will help to  prevent the occurrence of fraud, theft of IRS assets, or both.", "The following three open recommendations would help IRS improve its  separation of duties, which will in turn strengthen its controls over tax  receipts and refunds and procurement activities.

Therefore, it is important  that IRS maintain effective controls to ensure that all documents and  records are properly and timely recorded, managed, and maintained both  at its facilities and at the lockbox banks. IRS must adequately document  and disseminate its procedures to ensure that they are available for IRS  employees. IRS must also document its management reviews of those  controls, such as those regarding refunds and returned checks, credit card  purchases, and reviews of TACs. Finally, to ensure future availability of  adequate documentation, IRS must ensure that its systems, particularly  those now being developed and implemented, have appropriate capability  to trace transactions.", "The following 12 open recommendations would assist IRS in improving its  documentation of transactions and internal control procedures.

In  addition, the number of staff increases significantly during the peak of the  tax filing season. Because of the significant number of personnel involved,  IRS must maintain effective control over which employees are authorized  to either view or change sensitive taxpayer data. IRS\u2019s ability to establish  access rights and permissions for information systems is a critical control.", "Each year, IRS pays out hundreds of billions of dollars in tax refunds,  some of which are distributed to taxpayers manually.

Management should ensure that skill needs are continually assessed and that the  organization is able to obtain a workforce that has the required skills that match those  necessary to achieve organizational goals. Training should be aimed at developing and  retaining employee skill levels to meet changing organizational needs. Qualified and  continuous supervision should be provided to ensure that internal control objectives are  achieved. Performance evaluation and feedback, supplemented by an effective reward  system, should be designed to help employees understand the connection between  their performance and the organization\u2019s success.

For  fiscal year 2008, IRS is continuing to  enhance the CDDB in order to  process an even larger percentage  of accounts associated with unpaid  payroll taxes.", "Open. IRS\u2019s development and use of  CDDB has improved its ability to  analyze and classify related taxpayer  accounts associated with unpaid  payroll taxes. However, CDDB is  currently not able to analyze and  classify 100 percent of such cases. In  fiscal year 2007, IRS implemented  CDDB programs to begin journalizing  tax debt information from its master  files to its general ledger weekly, a  first step in establishing CDDB\u2019s  capability to serve as a subsidiary  ledger for unpaid tax debt. However,  IRS is presently unable to use CDDB  as its subsidiary ledger for posting tax  debt information to its general ledger  in a manner that ensures reliable  external reporting. Specifically, to  report balances for taxes receivables  and other unpaid tax assessments in  its financial statements and required  supplemental information, IRS must  continue to apply statistical sampling  and estimation techniques to master  file data processed through CDDB at  year-end. Even though CDDB is  capable of analyzing master file data  weekly to produce tax debt  information classified into the various  financial reporting categories (taxes  receivables, compliance assessments,  and write-offs), this information  contains material inaccuracies. For  example, over $20 billion in  adjustments to the year-end gross  taxes receivable balance produced by  CDDB were needed to correct for  errors.

For  example, IRS centralized all lien  processing at its Cincinnati Service  Center Campus in 2005. Additionally,  in July 2006, IRS enhanced various  lien-processing exception reports to  include a cumulative listing of  unresolved lien releases, allowing it to  more readily track the release status  and take corrective action. However,  during our fiscal year 2007 audit, we  continued to find delays in the release  of liens. In its OMB No. A-123 testing  of lien releases, IRS found 7 instances  out of 59 cases tested in which it did  not release the applicable federal tax  lien within the statutory period. The  time between the satisfaction of the  liability and release of the lien ranged  from 35 days to 135 days. Based on  its sample, IRS estimated that for  about 12 percent of unpaid tax  assessment cases in which it had filed  a tax lien that were resolved in fiscal  year 2007, it did not release the lien  within 30 days. IRS is 95 percent  confident that the percentage of cases  in which the lien was not released  within 30 days does not exceed 21  percent.

IRS  employs a ROI estimate for  compliance activities that uses labor  costs associated with protecting  revenue for both pre-refund and  post-refund activities. Since labor  represents approximately 73 percent  of the total IRS budget (2007) and 91  percent of the EITC budget, ROI  calculations using labor costs  provide valid cost/benefit data which  are used, along with other data and  program considerations, to make  sound program decisions.
