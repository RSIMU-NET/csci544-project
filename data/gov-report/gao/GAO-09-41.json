Within DOD, PBL is the purchase of performance outcomes, such as system availability, rather than the purchase of individual elements of logistics support--such as parts, repairs, and engineering support. Although PBL initially arose from efforts to reduce support costs, questions have arisen about whether PBL has reduced support costs as originally intended. GAO was asked to evaluate the extent to which DOD has used business case analyses to guide decisions related to PBL arrangements and the impact PBL arrangements have had on weapon system support costs. In conducting the review, GAO analyzed the implementation of PBL arrangements for 29 weapon system programs. GAO also looked at the use and characteristics of performance-based contracting in the United Kingdom's Ministry of Defence."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Although DOD's guidance recommends that business case analyses be used to guide decision making regarding the implementation of PBL to provide weapon system support, the services are not consistent in their use of such analyses. About half of the DOD program offices responsible for the 29 PBL arrangements GAO reviewed either did not use a business case analysis or could not provide documentation for significant parts of their analyses. Almost all of the remaining analyses were missing one or more of the recommended elements in DOD's instruction for economic analysis. Finally, business case analyses were often not updated in accordance with service policies and guidance. Program office use of these analyses is inconsistent because DOD only recommends, but does not require, that they be prepared and because DOD's guidance on preparing a business case analysis is not comprehensive and does not adequately specify the criteria to be included. Also, most of the services have not established effective internal controls to ensure that the analyses are prepared or that they provide a consistent and comprehensive assessment. As a result, DOD has implemented PBL arrangements without the benefit of sound analyses that ensure that the chosen approach will provide the most cost-effective support option. While one of DOD's goals in moving toward the use of PBL arrangements was to reduce weapon system support costs, the ability of these arrangements to reduce costs remains unclear 7 years after DOD first identified PBL as the preferred weapon system support strategy. Many DOD program offices that implemented PBL arrangements have limited cost data, and various other factors--such as the lack of business case analyses--further limit an evaluation of the costs of this support strategy. Available data from the programs GAO reviewed indicated mixed results. Although a few programs in GAO's sample provided evidence of some cost reductions, GAO's analysis of the only two systems in its sample that are managed using both a PBL arrangement and a more traditional, non-PBL arrangement indicated that in both cases the PBL arrangement had higher costs. Also, GAO found that certain characteristics of DOD's PBL arrangements--contract length, funding stability, ownership of inventory, and the lack of cost metrics and effective incentives--could limit the ability of and incentive for contractors to reduce support costs. Neither DOD nor the services require detailed cost reporting for PBL arrangements and the lack of detailed cost data hinders DOD's ability to determine whether PBL has reduced support costs as intended. GAO describes the use of performance-based arrangements for weapon system support in the United Kingdom's Ministry of Defence, which the ministry refers to as contracting for availability. The Ministry of Defence began awarding availability contracts as an approach to reduce weapon system support costs, and officials believe that support cost reductions have been achieved as a result of using availability contracts. In general, the availability contracts used are significantly longer than those used by DOD, and the ministry uses an \"open book accounting\" arrangement to gain visibility into the contractors' costs to provide support."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In the 1990s, the Department of Defense (DOD) predicted that it would  save billions of dollars by reengineering defense logistics to increase its  reliance on the private sector for the support of military weapon systems.  In 1999, DOD set a goal to reduce weapon system operating and support  costs by 20 percent by 2005. Around the same time, a DOD study identified  30 pilot programs on which to test various logistics reengineering  initiatives, and DOD began to consider the concept of long-term contractor  logistics weapon system support with performance metrics, which DOD  later called performance based logistics (PBL). By 2001, DOD had  identified PBL as its preferred weapon system support strategy. DOD  defines PBL as the purchase of performance outcomes (such as the  availability of functioning weapon systems) through long-term support  arrangements rather than the purchase of individual elements of support\u2014 such as parts, repairs, and engineering support. The concept of PBL  evolved from the more general concept of performance-based contracting,  which has been used in both the commercial and government sectors for  over 20 years. While the use of PBL was first applied to weapon system  platforms, DOD now also uses it to purchase support for subsystems and  components. Under DOD guidance, prior to entering into a PBL  arrangement, program offices should conduct a business case analysis as  part of their decision-making process. A business case analysis is an  analytical tool for assessing the projected costs and benefits of a PBL  arrangement compared with other alternative weapon system support  options. However, since DOD first implemented PBL arrangements,  questions have arisen about whether they have reduced the costs of  weapon system support as intended.", "In 2004 and 2005, we reported that DOD\u2019s use of PBL arrangements did not  reflect the best practices of private-sector companies and that DOD could  not demonstrate that PBL arrangements had reduced costs and improved  performance. Specifically, in 2004, we recommended that DOD  incorporate into guidance the private sector\u2019s practice of using  performance-based contracts at the component level (for example, to  support engines or auxiliary power units) rather than only at the weapon  system platform level (for example, to support aircraft). In response, DOD  issued policy memorandums emphasizing that PBL may be applied at the  weapon system, subsystem, or component level and revised its guidance to  implement our recommendation. In 2005, we recommended that DOD, in  conjunction with the military services, develop procedures to track  whether DOD program offices update their business case analyses as  called for under DOD guidance. We also recommended that DOD verify  the reliability of contractor cost and performance data. DOD concurred  with our recommendations and has issued limited guidance to the services  regarding the verification of the reliability of contractor cost and  performance data. However, DOD and the services, with the exception of  the Army, have not developed procedures to track whether program  offices update business case analyses after PBL implementation.", "Given concerns about the cost of programs using PBL arrangements, you  requested that we examine DOD\u2019s use of PBL for providing weapon  system support. In response to your request, we evaluated the (1) extent to  which DOD has used business case analyses to guide decisions related to  PBL arrangements and (2) impact PBL arrangements have had on weapon  system support costs. In addition, we describe the use and characteristics  of \u201cavailability contracts,\u201d a concept similar to PBL arrangements that the  United Kingdom\u2019s Ministry of Defence uses for weapon system support.", "We looked at the Ministry of Defence\u2019s use of availability contracts to  identify potential promising practices because reducing costs was a clear  goal of the implementation of this concept in the United Kingdom and a  National Audit Office report stated that the Ministry of Defence has  reduced support costs as a result of its implementation of this concept,  and related initiatives, for two aircraft systems.", "We collected and analyzed data on 27 PBL arrangements\u2014-specifically 9  from the Army, 8 from the Navy, and 10 from the Air Force\u2014-that were  initiated from 1996 through 2007 to support DOD weapon systems. In  addition, we reviewed 2 additional weapon systems that the Marine Corps  was considering as candidates for PBL arrangements. We selected these  programs from lists of PBL arrangements provided by the services and  chose both component- and system-level arrangements from each of the  services on the basis of the dollar value of the arrangements, prior audit  findings, and location. While we focused on the costs of PBL  arrangements, program officials said that performance generally met or  exceeded requirements established in the contracts or other agreements.", "To evaluate the extent to which DOD has used business case analyses to  guide decisions regarding PBL arrangements, we obtained and examined  the analyses prepared by program offices. In assessing the quality of these  analyses, we used applicable criteria in DOD Instruction 7041.3, Economic  Analysis for Decisionmaking. This economic analysis instruction is  generally consistent with DOD\u2019s guidance on conducting a business case  analysis; in both cases, DOD recommends that costs and benefits (both  qualitative and quantitative) be considered and documented. However, the  economic analysis instruction contains more specific information for  evaluation of program costs. This guidance is also consistent with Office  of Management and Budget guidelines for the benefit-cost analysis of  federal programs. DOD\u2019s economic analysis instruction also states that  analytical studies that evaluate the cost and effectiveness of weapon  system support are considered to be \u201ceconomic analyses\u201d even if not titled  as such.", "To evaluate the impact that PBL arrangements have had on weapon  system support costs, we asked program officials to identify and  document savings attributed to PBL implementation. In addition, if a  program had renewed a PBL arrangement or had finalized contract  options that were not priced, we analyzed the contracts for trends in PBL  support costs. We also compared PBL contract costs with estimated PBL  support costs in business case analyses to determine how closely the  estimates matched the actual PBL arrangement costs, where available. We  also relied on our previously issued reports and testimonies on DOD\u2019s  implementation of PBL.", "To provide information regarding the characteristics and use of availability  contracts for weapon system support in the United Kingdom\u2019s Ministry of  Defence, we met Ministry of Defence and National Audit Office officials  and officials from defense contractors having availability contracts with  the Ministry of Defence. We also reviewed a 2007 National Audit Office  report regarding the Ministry of Defence\u2019s use of availability contracting to  support Harrier and Tornado fast jets. We obtained these data for  informational purposes and to identify promising practices and did not  independently verify the statements or data provided by Ministry of  Defence and National Audit Office officials.", "We conducted this performance audit from February 2007 through  December 2008 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the  audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We  believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. A detailed  description of our scope and methodology is contained in appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["PBL is a method of providing support for weapon systems by designating  what system performance is required, such as a given level of system  availability, and placing the responsibility for how it is accomplished on  the support provider, which manages resources to achieve performance  objectives. Logistics support for almost all of DOD\u2019s weapon systems, such  as materiel management, maintenance, and engineering, is provided by a  combination of government and private-sector sources. In the past, under  traditional support arrangements, the government generally managed the  provision of weapon system support, using a combination of support  providers from the government and the private sector. PBL support  arrangements often use a private-sector support integrator to manage  support providers from both the public and private sectors to meet  specified performance requirements.", "PBL evolved from performance-based service contracting, which has been  used in both the public and private sectors. The Federal Acquisition  Regulation defines performance-based contracting as structuring all  aspects of an acquisition around the purpose of the work to be performed.  The Federal Acquisition Regulation further defines the statement of work  for a performance-based acquisition as describing the required results in  clear, specific, and objective terms with measurable outcomes.  Performance-based service contracting has been referenced in regulation,  guidance, and policy for more than two decades, and federal agencies have  used it to varying degrees for acquiring a range of services. In 1991 the  Office of Management and Budget issued a policy letter establishing the  use of a performance-based approach for service contracting, and in 1994  it initiated a governmentwide pilot project to encourage the use of  performance-based service contracts in federal agencies, including DOD.  In October 1997, the Federal Acquisition Regulation was amended to  incorporate the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s 1991 policy. The  Federal Acquisition Regulation currently establishes a policy that  agencies use performance-based contracting methods to the maximum  extent practicable for the acquisition of services, with certain exceptions.", "Using performance-based service contracts is intended to offer a number  of potential benefits, such as encouraging contractors to be innovative and  to find cost-effective ways of delivering services for a fixed level of  funding. By shifting the focus from process to results, these contracts can  potentially produce better outcomes and reduced costs. The Office of  Management and Budget reported that the agencies participating in the  pilot reduced contract prices and improved customer satisfaction with  contractor work after introducing performance-based contracting."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "PBL Implemented as a Strategy to Reduce or Minimize Costs and Improve Performance", "paragraphs": ["As an approach for supporting military weapon systems, PBL emerged  from a 1999 DOD study to test logistics reengineering concepts that placed  greater reliance on the private sector for providing weapon system  support to reduce support costs and improve weapon system  performance. The goal was for the military departments to reduce costs  and improve efficiency by pursuing logistics support \u201creengineering\u201d  efforts using contractors. The fiscal years 2001-2005 Defense Planning  Guidance advanced this cost reduction effort by establishing a goal that  directed each military department to reduce the operation and support  costs of its fielded systems by 20 percent by the year 2005. During this  time, the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition and Technology)  directed the services to use an existing pilot program containing 30  weapon systems to demonstrate the type of cost savings depicted in the  fiscal years 2001-2005 Defense Planning Guidance. The areas identified for  potential cost savings were reducing demand on the supply chain by  improving the reliability and maintainability of the equipment, reducing  supply chain response time, and increasing competitive sourcing of  product support. Some of the 30 pilot programs involved performance- type arrangements that the services subsequently converted to, or  designated as, PBL arrangements.", "This emphasis on reducing costs through PBL implementation was  reiterated in DOD\u2019s 2001 Quadrennial Defense Review Report, which  advocated the implementation of PBL to compress the supply chain by  removing steps in the warehousing, distribution, and order fulfillment  processes; to reduce inventories; and to decrease overhead costs while  improving the readiness of major weapon systems and commodities. In  November 2001, DOD identified PBL as the preferred weapons system  support strategy. In May 2003, DOD further strengthened this emphasis  on PBL by stating in a DOD policy directive that acquisition managers shall  use performance-based strategies for sustaining products and services  whenever feasible and PBL strategies shall optimize total system  availability while minimizing cost and the logistics footprint.", "In concept, a properly structured PBL arrangement is supposed to provide  a level of performance and also reduce costs over time. According to the  DOD/Defense Acquisition University PBL guide, a key aspect of PBL is  the inclusion of an incentive for the support provider to reduce costs  through increased reliability. Further, PBL arrangements can inherently  motivate support providers to improve component and system reliability,  since such improvements can provide the foundation for increased profit  over the long term. In other words, the support provider should have the  incentive to make reliability improvements to ensure that performance  metrics are met and also to increase profit by earning a performance  incentive tied to the metrics (an award fee or award term) and by reducing  costs while still being paid the agreed-upon, fixed price for the remainder  of the contract. The DOD/Defense Acquisition University PBL guide also  states that a critical element of the PBL arrangement that facilitates this  incentive and motivation is contract length. Further, long-term contracts  provide the support provider with confidence in continuing cash flows and  provide sufficient time for receiving an adequate return on any  investments made to improve reliability."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Recommended That Analyses Be Conducted to Guide Decisions regarding Weapon System Support Options", "paragraphs": ["In 1995, before DOD identified PBL as the preferred weapons system  support strategy, DOD\u2019s economic analysis instruction recommended  using an economic analysis for evaluating options for weapon system  support. The instruction stressed the importance of considering in the  analysis both qualitative and quantitative factors. With respect to  quantitative factors, the instruction recommended that costs and benefits  be expressed in terms of net present value to account for the time value of  money. These were also to be expressed as life cycle costs and benefits  that were to be calculated and compared for each feasible alternative for  meeting a given weapon system support objective.", "Specifically, the economic analysis instruction identified and  characterized the following seven elements that should be present in an  economic analysis:  objectives\u2014to clearly identify the function to be accomplished and not  to assume a specific means of achieving a desired result;    assumptions\u2014to incorporate both actual data and future    alternatives\u2014to comprise a comprehensive list of the feasible and  infeasible options followed by a discussion of the infeasible options  and comparisons of only the feasible options;  costs and benefits\u2014to compare the quantitative (expressed in terms of  net present value) and qualitative factors for each option;  sensitivity and uncertainty (risk) analyses\u2014to determine the effect  of uncertainties on the results of the analysis and to provide a range of  costs and benefits;  summary of the results of the analysis; and  summary of the analysis\u2019s recommendations.", "In DOD\u2019s 2001 PBL guide, in which DOD identified PBL as the preferred  weapon system support strategy, the department recommended that for all  new systems and fielded acquisition category I and II systems, program  offices use an analytical tool called a business case analysis to support the  decision to use PBL arrangements for weapon system support.", "In 2004 and 2005, DOD guidance on conducting business case analyses  described this tool in less specific terms than those used to describe the  criteria laid out in DOD\u2019s economic analysis instruction. However, there  are some common themes in the guidance and instruction. For example, a  January 2004 Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology and  Logistics) memorandum on PBL business case analysis calls for an  assessment of \u201cbest value,\u201d or the greatest overall benefit. The  DOD/Defense Acquisition University PBL guide repeats the  characterization of the business case analysis as a tool with the goal of  determining a best-value solution and suggests that at a minimum a  business case analysis should include an introduction outlining the  purpose and objectives of the program, an explanation of the methods and  assumptions used in the analysis, calculations of the relative costs and  benefits of each weapon system support option, the financial and  nonfinancial impacts of each, a risk assessment, and a section with  conclusions and recommendations. Finally, both DOD\u2019s economic analysis  instruction and the DOD/Defense Acquisition University PBL guide  recommend documenting the results of the analysis, including all  calculations and sources of data, down to the most basic inputs, to provide  an auditable and stand-alone document. According to the guidance, a  business case analysis must stand on its own and be able to withstand  rigorous analysis and review by independent agencies.", "DOD\u2019s 2004 and 2005 guidance on conducting business case analyses also  recommended that program offices    update their business case analyses at key decision points both to  validate the approach taken and to support future plans and    use certain criteria, such as the capability of a PBL arrangement to  reduce the cost per operational unit of performance (i.e., cost per  flight hour), to assess all acquisition I and II programs without plans  for a PBL arrangement for the potential application of a PBL strategy  at the system, subsystem, or major assembly level.

These PBL arrangements represent contract values  totaling approximately $12.1 billion and range from a low of $10.5 million  to a high of $4.9 billion.

However, the U.S.  Army Audit Agency reported that the prior analyses did not consider all  components included in the two PBL arrangements, other support  strategies, performance metrics, and relative costs. According to an Army  official, a business case analysis for the airframe components is being  conducted and is expected to be completed in December 2008, and efforts  to develop a business case analysis for the program\u2019s sensors are expected  to begin in November 2008.", "The F-22A Raptor and KC-130J are examples of programs where the Air  Force and Navy did not conduct a business case analysis as part of the  PBL decision-making process. When DOD recommended in 2001 that  program offices fielding new systems base PBL arrangement decisions on  business case analyses, the F-22 was beginning low-rate initial production.  In 2002, the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Acquisition) and the Air  Force Deputy Chief of Staff (Logistics, Installations and Mission Support)  directed the F-22 program office to develop a long-term support strategy  and manage life cycle product support through a PBL arrangement that  includes government-contractor partnerships as necessary. From 2003  through 2007, the program office acquired support as part of the aircraft\u2019s  production contract, and in 2008 the office signed a separate PBL support  contract with Lockheed Martin, one of the original equipment  manufacturers, to support the aircraft from 2008 to 2012. In March 2008,  program officials said that they did not conduct a business case analysis  before awarding the 2008 contract because current program data, such as  material usage rates and costs, are immature. Officials planned to conduct  an analysis in 2010 or 2011 when it could be completed using more  meaningful data.

For example, the 2007 business case  analysis for the Joint Surveillance and Target Attack Radar System did not  analyze the costs and benefits of alternative support strategies for the  program. The business case analysis was developed in response to a 2006  recommendation from the DOD Office of the Inspector General after a  review found that the program office had not evaluated alternative support  strategies prior to implementing a PBL arrangement in 2000. However,  the 2007 analysis covered only the potential impacts of changing the type  of contract used to obtain support for the program from cost plus award  fee to firm fixed price. The business case analysis for the B-2 also did not  analyze alternative support strategies but focused on potential efficiencies  available to the current program through funding consolidation, funding  stability, and long-term contracting. According to program officials, the  only assumption in the analysis that actually occurred to some extent after  PBL implementation was funding consolidation. Finally, although the C-17  program office developed a business case analysis in 2003, the DOD Office  of the Inspector General reported in 2006 that the analysis focused only on  one support option and did not evaluate the costs and benefits of multiple  support options. In 2007, a contract was awarded for development of  another business case analysis planned for completion prior to awarding  the next C-17 support contract.", "Two other important elements missing from some analyses were an  evaluation of costs over the remaining life cycle of the program and the  calculation of net present value to account for the time value of money.  For example, the analysis for the Patriot PBL arrangement only evaluated  the costs and benefits over a 3-year period. On the other hand, while the  business case analysis for the Assault Breacher Vehicle evaluated costs  over the 20-year life cycle of the program, the net present value of the  alternatives was not calculated. Four other business case analyses\u2014those  prepared for the F/A-18 E/F, AV-8B Harrier, Close-In Weapon System, and  Consolidated Automated Support System\u2014did not include these two  elements and several others, such as sensitivity or risk analysis. These  analyses were prepared in a similar format by the Naval Inventory Control  Point, an organization that provides supply support to the Navy, Marine  Corps, and others. We conducted a net present value analysis on the  amounts contained in the Naval Inventory Control Point\u2019s business case  analysis for the F/A-18 E/F PBL arrangement and found that the PBL  option it chose was about $1.7 million more expensive than the alternative  option. Its analysis, which did not use net present value, found that the  PBL option was about $277,000 less expensive. The Naval Inventory  Control Point\u2019s philosophy is that if the costs of PBL are equal to or less  than the costs for government-provided support, a PBL arrangement will  be used. Therefore, if Naval Inventory Control Point officials had  conducted a net present value analysis, based on this decision criterion,  they would not have implemented the PBL arrangement. According to  Naval Inventory Control Point officials, there is confusion in the Navy  regarding the purpose of the analyses they prepare. Officials said that the  analyses were conducted for internal decision making and were not  intended to satisfy Navy PBL policy, which places responsibility for  development of a life cycle business case analysis on the weapon system  program office.

The life cycle analysis included an estimate of future  cost savings associated with investments the contractor was willing to  make under the arrangement to reduce supply chain costs. In addition,  most of the analyses did not recognize or quantify the costs associated  with the transfer of risk that occurs under a performance-based support  arrangement. According to the DOD/Defense Acquisition University PBL  guide, PBL arrangements transfer responsibility for making support  decisions\u2014and corresponding risk\u2014to the support provider, and risk is  one of the major cost drivers for contractors. Therefore, the use of  performance metrics could introduce a large element of risk for the  contractor that may be built into the costs of such an arrangement. In  general, many of the business case analyses we reviewed simply estimated  the costs for contract logistics support and government-provided support.  One exception was the business case analysis for the Marine Corps\u2019  Assault Breacher Vehicle, which attempted to address the costs of risk  transfer and the benefits of contractor incentive to reduce costs by  estimating the costs for a traditional contractor logistics support  arrangement and a performance-based contractor logistics support  arrangement, in addition to estimates for government-provided support  and performance-based, government-managed support.", "Another business case analysis was based on questionable assumptions.  The 2002 business case analysis for the Sentinel program estimated that  the cost for the government depot to overhaul the system was 50 percent  of the total cost of the system. The business case analysis estimated that  for the alternative option\u2014a partnership between the government and the  contractor with the government depot performing enough work to meet  the system\u2019s core requirements\u2014the cost for an overhaul was only 25  percent of the system\u2019s cost. The analysis assumed that under the  partnership option the overhaul cost less because, instead of complete  disassembly and parts replacement, the system would be inspected and  repaired only as necessary. However, according to an official at the Army  depot that would perform the overhaul, the depot also could have used the  inspect and repair concept as the basis for its maintenance work.  Therefore, this assumption in the business case analysis may have  overstated the costs for the government depot to perform the work.", "Lastly, the Naval Air Systems Command\u2019s 2005 life cycle business case  analysis for the F/A-18 E/F estimated that over the 28-year life cycle of the  program, PBL support costs were $76 million more expensive than costs  for government-provided support. However, the business case analysis  estimated that Naval Inventory Control Point surcharges would be   $325 million less for the PBL arrangement. The Naval Inventory Control  Point adds a surcharge to the cost of goods sold to its customers  (including weapon system program offices) to recoup its expenses, but  according to officials, they do not adjust their resources based on PBL  implementation and would still need to recoup their expenses through  surcharges to other customers. Therefore, while the F/A-18 program office  may realize a $325 million benefit from the reduced surcharge, the overall  costs to the Navy may remain the same. Including this reduced amount in  the analysis is inconsistent with DOD\u2019s economic analysis instruction,  which states that all measurable costs and benefits to the federal  government should be included in the analysis. In addition, in the 2006  business case analysis prepared by the Naval Inventory Control Point,  which estimated supply chain management costs for both PBL and  government-provided support for a 5-year period from 2006 through 2011,  the Naval Inventory Control Point\u2019s costs were estimated to remain the  same under either option. If the Naval Inventory Control Point\u2019s costs had  been the same in the life cycle business case analysis prepared by the  Naval Air Systems Command for the F/A-18 E/F, the PBL arrangement  would be $401 million more expensive than government support for the  28-year period."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Business Case Analyses Were Often Not Updated for Decision Making After PBL Implementation", "paragraphs": ["In 2004, DOD guidance recommended that business case analyses  continue throughout the weapons system\u2019s life cycle and be updated at  key decision points both to validate the approach taken and to support  future plans.

Based on this comparison, three of these four PBL  arrangements indicate potential savings from PBL implementation, while  the fourth is more expensive than estimated in the business case analysis.  The remaining analyses could not be compared to actual program costs  after PBL implementation because of programmatic changes that occurred  after the analyses were conducted.", "The 2005 business case analysis for the Army\u2019s Patriot estimated a 3-year  cost savings of $1.6 million from using a PBL arrangement to provide 107  high-demand parts. According to a program official, the contract is in its  final year and total obligations are expected to be about $1 million less  than estimated in the business case analysis. Additionally, two business  case analyses prepared by the Naval Inventory Control Point estimated  that supply chain management support costs were reduced by  implementing a PBL arrangement. The business case analyses projected  cost savings of about $2.2 million for the 5-year Close-In Weapon System  PBL arrangement awarded in 2006 and $1.3 million for the 5-year Harrier  PBL arrangement awarded in 2007. Based on actual contract costs\u2014and  if the contracts are not modified in the future\u2014the total savings for these  programs are projected to be $5.2 million and $5.8 million, respectively.  Although the F/A-18 E/F business case analysis estimated a 5-year supply  chain management savings of approximately $1.4 million, the actual  contract cost is about $1.6 million more than the estimated amount in the  analysis. Given the difference, the PBL arrangement has not reduced  support costs for the program. As previously noted, two of the PBL  arrangements having evidence of reduced support costs are managed by  the Naval Inventory Control Point. This activity has used PBL  arrangements since fiscal year 2000 and has reported achieving cost  reductions as a result, using the Navy working capital fund to issue longer- term, multiyear contracts that can extend up to 5 years in length to  support aircraft or ship subsystems or components. According to agency  officials, these longer-term agreements have enabled the Naval Inventory  Control Point to guarantee the contractors a more stable business base,  which provides contractors an incentive to make investments to reduce  costs. Overall, as a result of using PBL arrangements, Naval Inventory  Control Point officials estimate that they have reduced support costs by  approximately $26.7 million and $63.8 million\u2014or 2.8 and 5.8 percent\u2014in  fiscal years 2006 and 2007, respectively.", "Although the V-22 program conducted a business case analysis in 1998 to  estimate alternative costs for supporting the engines and projected savings  of $249.5 million over the 53-year life cycle of the program, the analysis  did not take into account the time value of money and calculate savings  based on net present value. For this and other reasons, we cannot validate  that the savings are reasonable. In addition to DOD\u2019s economic analysis  instruction, guidance from the Office of Management and Budget also  states that net present value is the standard criterion for deciding whether  a government program can be justified on economic principles. In 2004,  another analysis was prepared for the V-22 engine program to determine  (1) if several assumptions used in the 1998 analysis were still valid and   (2) the impact of any changes to those assumptions on the cost savings  estimate for the PBL arrangement. The later analysis concluded that  differences in three of the original assumptions increased the projected  PBL cost savings to $305.9 million\u2014an increase of $56.4 million. The  updated savings again were not calculated using net present value.  Moreover, although limited actual data were available, the calculations  generally made adjustments using assumptions that generated the  maximum potential savings for the PBL alternative. For example, when  adjusting the 1998 analysis to account for differences in the costs  experienced for excluded repairs (repairs that were not covered by the  PBL arrangement), the total potential PBL cost savings were increased by  $48 million because the average excluded repair cost was lower than  previously estimated. However, even though data showed that excluded  repairs occurred at a higher frequency than projected in the original  analysis, the later analysis did not adjust for the higher frequency of  excluded repairs. Thus, the savings calculation is questionable, because  the analysis noted that the frequency of these repairs could eliminate all of  the estimated cost savings. Finally, the 10-year-old analysis has not been  completely updated to estimate costs based on actual data.", "The remainder of the analyses could not be compared to current PBL  arrangement costs because of programmatic changes that occurred after  the analyses were conducted. For example:    According to an Air Force C-130J program official involved in the  development of the 2004 business case analysis, the analysis was  conducted while the aircraft was supported by a commercial contract;  therefore, the program office did not have detailed cost data on which  to base the estimate. The estimate was developed, in part, using cost  data from other legacy programs and other assumptions that program  officials said did not turn out to be accurate.

In addition, when the first fixed-price PBL arrangement  was implemented in 2001 the program was fairly new with very few  systems, so the program office did not have an extensive amount of  historical program data with which to negotiate. Since 2001, the program  office has collected actual data that it used to negotiate lower rates in the  latest contract.

The maximum  amounts authorized in the annual cost-reimbursable PBL contract for the  support of this system were reduced by 28 percent from fiscal years 2006  through 2007. According to program officials, a program office review of  PBL processes in early fiscal year 2006 concluded that while the PBL  arrangement was effective in terms of meeting the performance levels  specified in the contract, it was not cost efficient and costs associated  with the vehicle\u2019s high accident rate were an area of particular concern. In  response, the program office changed the performance metrics in the  contract to encourage the contractor to improve reliability and reduce the  accident rate, and also to improve depot maintenance efficiency. As the  accident rate improved, the program office was able to negotiate for lower  support costs in the 2007 PBL contract.", "Finally, while the 2005 life cycle business case analysis for the F/A-18 E/F  program office estimated that support provided under a PBL arrangement  would be more expensive than government-provided support, program  officials for the Navy\u2019s F/A-18 E/F PBL arrangement have developed a  process to track and document support cost reductions attributed to  contractor investments to improve reliability and reduce costs. Program  officials said that both the Navy and Boeing have funded initiatives to  improve F/A-18E/F component reliability, maintainability, and  supportability as part of the Supportability Cost Reduction Initiatives  program. Under the current fixed-price PBL arrangement, Boeing has  invested approximately $11.39 million to fund initiatives that officials  currently estimate will generate cost reductions of approximately   $279 million over the remaining life cycle of the system.

Although  officials were expecting the fixed-price performance contract to motivate  the contractor to invest in improvements to increase reliability and  maximize profit, they found that the contractor minimized its own costs  during the contract period and passed on the costs to improve the  reliability of components with high failures to the government when the  contract was renegotiated.

Also, within the basic contract parameters there is a provision for surge  delivery for the Merlin helicopter. Finally, according to officials, the Sea  King helicopter support contract has a similar flexibility because there are  a number of flying hour bands and each band has its own price. In this  manner, the Ministry of Defence can increase or decrease flying hours  without renegotiating the contract. Officials pointed out that one  drawback is that the price charged per flying hour at the lower bands is  higher because the contractor must be able to cover fixed costs with fewer  flight hours to charge.

Without  instituting a more consistent, comprehensive, and sound process on which  to base decisions regarding the type of arrangement to be used in  supporting DOD systems, it is unlikely that the department will be  successful in achieving the sizable savings that were envisioned when the  PBL concept was adopted.", "Assessing the cost-effectiveness of PBL programs also requires the  availability of better cost data at a level of detail that would support the  improved management of ongoing PBL programs, including awarding  contract fees, assessing performance versus the cost to achieve it,  evaluating historical costs to determine whether the status quo should be  maintained over time, and making support decisions about future follow- on programs. Such data are usually not available for PBL programs,  limiting the ability of program offices to make program adjustments or  take restructuring actions when appropriate. Nonetheless, a few program  offices have acquired data at this level and indicate that they obtained  them in a cost-effective manner. Improved access to detailed cost data is  another essential element in improving the quality of data available to  DOD decision makers regarding the cost-effectiveness of PBL  arrangements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To ensure that PBL arrangements are the most cost-effective option for  weapon system support, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense  direct the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology and  Logistics) to take the following five actions:  revise DOD\u2019s Acquisition Directive to require development of a  business case analysis to support the decision-making process  regarding weapon system support alternatives, including PBL;  revise PBL business case analysis guidance to more clearly define  what should be included in a business case analysis and to establish  specific criteria and methods for evaluating PBL support  arrangements, including evaluation at the subsystem and component  levels;  revise PBL business case analysis guidance to more clearly define  when business case analyses should be updated during the weapon  system life cycle;  require that each service revise guidance to implement internal  controls to ensure that program offices prepare and update business  case analyses that are comprehensive and sound; and  require program offices to collect and report cost data for PBL  arrangements in a consistent, standardized format with sufficient  detail to support traditional cost analysis and effective program  management."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments to a draft of this report (see app. II), DOD generally  concurred with our five recommendations, noting that the department is  committed to evaluating PBL strategies using business case analyses as  part of the overall supportability assessment made during the development  stages of weapon system acquisition programs.

DOD stated that the department will  take steps to address this issue in the next iteration of the DOD Directive  5000.1 and DOD Instruction 5000.2 acquisition regulations. According to  DOD\u2019s response, this new policy will require that the use of a business  case analysis be mandatory and that this analysis serve as a sound basis  for the selected supportability strategy.", "In response to our second recommendation to revise PBL business case  analysis guidance to clearly define what should be included in a business  case analysis and to establish specific criteria and methods for evaluating  PBL support arrangements, DOD partially concurred, stating that it  established a Life Cycle Product Support Assessment Team in September  2008 to study product support policy, guidance, past performance, and  results. As part of the study, existing business case analysis policy is being  reviewed, and the department will evaluate the team\u2019s recommendations  on providing specific criteria and methods for evaluating support  arrangements and determine how best to incorporate these  recommendations into mandatory policy. The team\u2019s initial  recommendations are expected in April 2009.", "DOD fully concurred with our third recommendation to revise PBL  business case analysis guidance to more clearly define when, during the  weapon system life cycle, business case analyses should be updated.  According to DOD\u2019s response, the department\u2019s Life Cycle Product  Support Assessment Team will evaluate the appropriate timing of initial  business case analyses and follow-on updates to validate the life cycle  support approach for weapon systems, and the team\u2019s recommendations  will be evaluated for inclusion into mandatory policy.", "DOD fully concurred with our fourth recommendation to require that each  service revise guidance to implement internal controls to ensure that  program offices prepare and update business case analyses that are  comprehensive and sound. As we noted in our report, the Army has  already implemented a PBL business case analysis review and approval  process. DOD stated that the Army\u2019s internal controls will be reviewed by  the Life Cycle Product Support Assessment Team, which will make  recommendations for expansion for DOD-wide governance policy as part  of the team\u2019s overall recommendations expected in April 2009.", "DOD partially concurred with our fifth recommendation to require  program offices to collect and report support cost data for PBL  arrangements in a consistent, standardized format with sufficient detail to  support traditional cost analysis and effective program management. DOD  stated that a provision for tailored cost reporting for major acquisition  programs designed to facilitate future cost estimating and price analysis  has been included in the draft DOD Instruction 5000.2, which is expected  to be approved in the next 30 days. Additionally, the Life Cycle Product  Support Assessment Team is reviewing support cost reporting and cost  analysis as a part of its ongoing study. According to DOD\u2019s response, the  ultimate goal is standardized support cost reporting for all life cycle  product support efforts, to include support provided by government  activities.", "While concurring with our recommendations, DOD\u2019s response noted that  the department disagrees with the assertion that the goal of PBL  arrangements is to reduce costs. Rather, the primary goal of PBL  arrangements is to increase readiness and availability while reducing  overall sustainment costs in the long run. Our report recognized that the  current DOD Directive 5000.1 provides that PBL arrangements shall  optimize total system availability. However, our report notes that this  directive also provides that PBL arrangements shall minimize costs and  the logistics footprint. Moreover, our report stated that PBL emerged from  a 1999 DOD study to test logistics reengineering concepts that placed  greater reliance on the private sector for providing weapon system  support to both reduce support costs and improve weapon system  performance. Thus, reducing costs was a central focus of the adoption of  PBL as DOD\u2019s preferred support strategy. Based on our analysis in this  report, we continue to believe that the PBL support arrangement concept  was intended to be a cost reduction strategy as well as a strategy that  would result in improved performance.", "DOD\u2019s response also noted that 22 of the 29 programs we reviewed  produced business case analyses that enabled sound support strategy  determinations. DOD further stated that for 28 of the 29 programs, the PBL  strategies produced performance benefits, readiness benefits, or both, and  15 of the programs reflect cost-neutral or savings benefits resulting from  the application of the PBL strategies. However, based on our analysis in  this report, we continue to believe that only 20, rather than 22, of the  programs had business case analyses that evaluated PBL strategies.  Further, as we stated in our report, 6 of these did not retain some or all of  the documentation and 13 were missing elements of DOD\u2019s criteria for  economic analyses. For example, we found that for one analysis the less  costly option would have changed if the department had calculated the net  present value of the two options considered. Additionally, because the  department did not document all the potential support options in the  business case analyses, it is not possible to determine if the most cost- effective options were chosen. Thus we continue to question the extent to  which these analyses enabled sound support strategy determination.  Finally, while we recognize that the PBL arrangements may have produced  performance benefits, readiness benefits, or both, deficiencies in updated  business case analyses and detailed cost data did not support an  assessment of support costs. Therefore, it is unclear how many of the  programs may have actually had cost-neutral or savings benefits resulting  from PBL strategies. We continue to believe that improvements in  collection and reporting of support cost data and the updating of business  case analyses are essential if DOD is to determine the cost-effectiveness of  its PBL arrangements.", "We are sending copies of this report to interested congressional  committees and the Secretary of Defense.

The 29 PBL arrangements were selected from lists of  weapon systems supported by PBL arrangements provided by service  officials. With the exception of the Navy\u2019s, we found that the lists provided  by the services either were not current or contained inaccuracies, and the  content of the lists changed significantly during the course of our review,  which affected our sample selection. We chose system-, subsystem-, and  component-level PBL arrangements from each of the services based on  length of time since implementation, location of program office, dollar  value, and prior audit findings. The 29 PBL arrangements we selected  constitute a nonprobability sample and the results are not generalizable to  the population of PBL arrangements.", "To evaluate the extent to which DOD used business case analyses to guide  decisions regarding PBL arrangements, we interviewed officials regarding  DOD and service requirements, policies, and guidance for business case  analyses since 2001 and reviewed applicable documents.

In addition, we  asked program officials to identify support cost reductions that occurred  as a result of PBL implementation. If a program had renewed a fixed-price  PBL arrangement or had finalized contract options that were not priced,  we analyzed the contracts for trends in PBL support costs. We also  compared PBL contract costs to estimated PBL support costs in business  case analyses, where available, to determine how closely the estimates  matched the actual PBL arrangement costs. We also relied on previously  issued GAO reports on DOD\u2019s implementation of PBL.", "To analyze the use of availability contracts for weapon system support by  the United Kingdom\u2019s Ministry of Defence, we interviewed officials from  the Defence Equipment and Support organization regarding policies or  requirements for availability contracts and trends regarding the use of  these arrangements. We also interviewed officials from programs  identified by the Ministry of Defence as using availability contracts for  weapon system support to identify the characteristics of the specific  arrangements and the impact that the use of these contracts had on  support costs.
