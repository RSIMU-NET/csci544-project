Six agency CIOs also reported that they were  specifically interested in receiving better feedback on two reporting  requirements\u2014namely, the major IT investment documentation and the  Open Government directive. The Office of E-Government and Information  Technology officials stated that the information on the feedback,  particularly those requirements agency CIOs were interested in receiving  feedback on, was useful; nevertheless, the officials acknowledged that  they do consistently not provide this level of feedback to the CIOs  because in part, they did not know until now that the CIOs wanted  feedback to this extent. Having a process that consistently provides  effective feedback is key to helping agency CIOs better manage their IT  resources and improve reporting; it is also consistent with OMB\u2019s goals to  improve federal IT management, oversight, and transparency. Until an  effective feedback process is in place, there is a risk that agencies are  managing their IT in a suboptimal manner.", "As mentioned previously, our extensive experience at federal agencies  and recent reports have shown that a critical component to ensuring  OMB\u2019s effective management and oversight of key IT reform initiatives\u2014 specifically, TechStat, data center consolidation, and PortfolioStat\u2014 is agency reporting of current and accurate information about the status  of these initiatives, including the extent of any financial savings. However,  agency CIOs surveyed reported that requirements related to these IT  reform efforts, including agency TechStat outcomes, data center  closures/status updates, commodity IT baseline updates, and  PortfolioStat reviews and progress reports, helped their agency to only  some or to no extent in managing IT. It is concerning that CIOs do not  always see the value in reporting information that is essential to reform  initiatives aimed at improving IT management effectiveness, saving  money, and avoiding unnecessary costs, especially since key aspects of  a number of the reforms have also been recently incorporated into law.", "Consequently, establishing a common understanding between OMB and  the CIOs on the priority of the reporting and related initiatives is key to the  success of OMB reforms. As part of this understanding, it is also  important to address underlying reasons cited by CIOs regarding the  usefulness of requirements, including when department priorities are  reportedly different than OMB\u2019s and the burdensome and duplicative  nature of requirements.

These officials added that they incorporated the results  of these reviews into the 2014 PortfolioStat guidance, which may have  included adding requirements or streamlining others.

Agency CIOs expressed confusion in our survey on whether  certain reporting requirements (e.g., the IT Capital Plan and compliance  failures) were still in effect. This confusion was due in part to neither OMB  nor the majority of federal agencies we surveyed having a comprehensive  list of current CIO and related reporting requirements. In particular,  officials from the Office of E-Government and Information Technology  office noted that while they did not maintain a comprehensive list, they did  have a spreadsheet they used for selected review processes (e.g.,  PortfolioStat) but that this list was not available to the federal agencies  because it was an internal OMB working document.

Agency CIOs reported in our survey that having to enter data into multiple  online tools for reporting required information as part of capital planning,  system integration, and IT security takes additional time and resources  and can be duplicative. OMB requires agencies to use three online tools  (Data Point, IT Dashboard, and the Integrated Data Collection) as well as  e-mail for capital planning and system integration reporting requirements,  and four online tools (Cyberscope, MAX Portal, Integrated Data  Collection, and the Information Security Continuous Monitoring  Dashboard) for IT security.

They also noted that there were challenges when determining  whether to reuse an existing tool or create a new one for reporting  requirements, particularly when they needed agencies to report  information within a short time frame, but provided no specific date or  plan for the completing the above described efforts, including addressing  the related challenges. Having centralized tools for reporting required  data is critical to reducing the reporting of duplicative data, as well as  reducing the time and resources required to enter the data, and would be  consistent with OMB\u2019s goal of reducing CIO reporting burden.

As mentioned previously, agency CIOs reported  in our survey that six of the seven capital planning and investment  reporting requirements\u2014namely the exhibit 53, exhibit 300, major IT  investment documentation, IT Capital Plan, PortfolioStat progress report,  and compliance failures\u2014needed improvement. For example, agency  CIOs reported that the two key capital planning reporting requirements\u2014 the exhibit 53 and exhibit 300\u2014needed to be improved to remove data  elements that did not provide value in making decisions. For the exhibit  53, this included eliminating non-financial data elements, such as those  on cloud computing, and for the exhibit 300, eliminating the contracts and  acquisition information since it was reported elsewhere. In addition,  agency CIOs proposed eliminating three of the capital planning and  investment reporting requirements (e.g., major IT investment  documentation, IT Capital Plan, and compliance failures) because  agencies had either not provided this information in recent years or  information was reported elsewhere in accordance with other reporting  requirements.

Although OMB uses  reported information to meet its responsibilities, the majority of the 24  CIOs for the most part, do not, citing that (1) two thirds of the reporting  requirements are not very useful to them in managing IT and (2)  addressing reporting requirements entails a significant effort on the part of  the CIOs, including an annual multi-hundred-million-dollar financial  commitment. Nonetheless, our extensive experience at federal agencies  and recent work have shown that reporting requirements\u2014in particular,  those relating to TechStat, data center consolidation, and PortfolioStat\u2014 are key to carrying out OMB\u2019s IT reforms and their goal of improving  federal agency programs and operations, including producing financial  savings. Consequently, it is of particular concern that OMB and the CIOs  are not fully aligned on the utility of reporting requirements integral to the  success of OMB\u2019s reforms. This misalignment is due in part to a lack of a  common understanding between OMB and the CIOs on the priority nature  of these reporting requirements and their associated reforms. Without  such a common understanding, OMB and the CIOs risk missing key  opportunities to improve federal programs and operations and produce  savings.

Consequently, we stand by our findings on OMB\u2019s  key IT reform initiatives\u2014and their associated reporting requirements\u2014 which are critical to improving federal IT management effectiveness.  Further, ensuring the success of these reforms is a key reason why  Congress, in December 2014, incorporated key aspects of a number of  these reforms into law. Accordingly, we believe our recommendations to  OMB are still valid and essential.", "With regard to OMB\u2019s first concern about the accuracy of the number of  requirements identified in our report, OMB took issue with our inclusion of  seven requirements, although it provided no documentation to support its  comments; specifically, OMB said (1) two requirements did not exist at the time of GAO\u2019s audit (specifically,  Information Security Continuous Monitoring Dashboard and Cybersecurity  Plans of Action), (2) two had been eliminated by OMB during or shortly after the audit time  frame\u2014namely, the PortfolioStat Review and the Commodity IT Baseline,  and  (3) three appeared to have been had been double-counted (specifically,  the IT Capital Plan and Cloud First are components of the Exhibit 53  requirement, and Open Data Policy Public Data Listing is a subset of  Open Data Enterprise Inventory).", "Regarding the first two requirements (Information Security Continuous  Monitoring Dashboard and Cybersecurity Plan of Action), our analysis  shows these requirements were in effect at the time of our audit, and this  is why we therefore included them in our list. Specifically,", "OMB memorandum M-14-03 (dated November 2013)agencies, in addition to submitting data to this dashboard once it is  deployed, to report on the status of their preparation for meeting this  requirement starting in 2014, which was in the time frame specified in  our scope and methodology.", "OMB memorandum M-12-20 (dated September 2012) stated that The  Department of Homeland Security will \u201cask agencies to complete a  Plan of Action for improving specific cybersecurity responsibilities.  Agencies will provide quarterly and fiscal year targets and  demonstrate progress toward these targets as they mature their  programs.\u201d Although OMB assigned responsibility to the Department  of Homeland Security for these plans and subsequent quarterly  updates, we considered it to be an OMB reporting requirement  because the reporting requirement was included in an OMB  memorandum.", "In addition, for the two requirements that OMB said were eliminated (i.e.,  PortfolioStat review and Commodity IT Baseline), our evaluation shows  that both had not been eliminated as of March 2014, which is the \u201cas-of\u201d  date specified in our scope and methodology. Specifically,", "OMB memorandum M-13-09 (dated March 2013) required agencies to  submit a consolidated document of successes, challenges, and  lessons learned to OMB no later than 2 weeks after the transmittal of  the President\u2019s Budget for fiscal year 2015 to Congress (which was  sent on March 4, 2014). Since the requirement was in effect as of  March 2014, we included it in our list.", "OMB memorandum M-13-09 also required agencies to provide a  quarterly update of their commodity IT baseline to OMB. Because this  requirement was not eliminated until May 2014, as OMB\u2019s comments  and our report indicated, we therefore included it in our list since the  requirement was in effect as of March 2014.", "Thirdly, although OMB stated that we double counted three requirements  (i.e., IT capital plan, Cloud First, and the Open Data Policy Public Data  Listing), the evidence shows otherwise. Specifically, these requirements  are defined in OMB circulars or memoranda (as noted in appendix II) as  separate reporting initiatives, and we therefore treated them as such. For  example, the requirement for an IT capital plan is outlined in OMB  Circular A-130 (dated November 2000) and details several activities that  the agency must provide annually to OMB as part of the budget  submission.", "In addition to the above, it is important to note that (as described in our  report\u2019s scope and methodology) after we developed our list of  requirements, we asked all 24 CFO agencies as well as OMB to review  the list and provide feedback as a means to validate that our inventory  was accurate. Specifically, we had officials from the 24 agencies review  our list to ensure it was complete and accurate, adjusted our list as  appropriate based on their feedback, and reached consensus on the  number of requirements in the inventory. In the case of OMB, we had  officials from the Office of E-Government and Information Technology  review our list multiple times and adjusted our list as appropriate based  on their feedback. During these OMB meetings, the officials never raised  the specific issues OMB noted in its written comments.", "It is also important to note that we took these validation steps because, as  we noted in our report, OMB does not maintain a comprehensive list of  current CIO reporting requirements. This has left agencies confused  regarding what requirements were currently in place, and is therefore why  we recommended that OMB develop such a list. This inconsistency  among OMB\u2019s written response, what the agencies told us, and what  OMB representatives previously told us confirms the need for GAO\u2019s  recommendation.", "OMB\u2019s second concern was that our survey approach did not fully support  the report\u2019s findings and conclusions. Specifically, OMB stated that many  agency CIOs told OMB through the CIO Council that they delegated full  responsibility for completing the survey to lower-level staff and because of  this, OMB did not have full confidence in some of our findings and felt our  attributions was not appropriate. In addition to this concern, OMB said  that it believed GAO gave disproportionate weight to the estimated costs  reported, which appeared, in its opinion, to be unsubstantiated because  they were based on a survey question that did not require the basic  characteristics found in GAO\u2019s cost estimating and assessment guide.OMB further questioned the reliability of these estimates because they  believed staff other than the CIO had completed the survey and were  therefore not experienced enough to provide knowledgeable estimates.", "We disagree with OMB\u2019s opinion regarding the validity of our survey  results for the following reasons. First, in meetings with CIOs and  selected senior officials from agencies in our review to discuss our plans  to survey the CIOs, we consistently expressed our expectation that the  CIOs were to complete the survey. If this was not feasible, CIOs could  delegate it to other staff, especially when agencies wanted staff that  worked directly on addressing the reporting requirements to complete the  survey because they were best qualified to respond to our questions. In  these cases, we nevertheless told the agencies the CIOs were ultimately  responsible for reviewing the accuracy of the survey results.", "Second, we pretested the survey at seven agencies, again reinforcing our  expectation that CIOs were to complete the survey. Specifically, to  minimize errors that might occur from respondents interpreting our  questions differently from our intended purpose, we pretested the  questionnaire in person and by phone in three rounds of testing with  officials from the office of the CIO at seven agencies. The selection of  agencies for pretesting was based on agency availability to assist us with  pretesting, variation in size of agency, and variation in agency CIO  models (i.e., centralized or decentralized). During these pretests, we  asked agency officials to complete the questionnaire for one reporting  requirement as we listened to the process. We then interviewed the  respondents to check whether the questions were applicable, clear,  unambiguous, and easy to understand.", "Third, in transmitting the surveys to the CIOs, we sent them directly to  each of the 24 agency CIOs with instructions indicating that they were to  complete it, with assistance from other officials as appropriate, and that  the results would be summarized in a report to our congressional  requesters. Specifically, in coordination with GAO survey methodology  experts, we developed and administered a web-based survey that we  sent to the CIOs of the 24 CFO Act agencies. All 24 CFO Act agencies  completed the final survey. We then reviewed all responses, and followed  up by phone and e-mail to clarify the responses as appropriate.", "The above three points notwithstanding, we have revised the report to  note that CIO responses may have in some cases, come from agency  officials completing the surveys on behalf of the CIOs.", "In terms of the estimated costs of meeting reporting requirements, the  application of GAO\u2019s cost guide in this context would be inappropriate,  according to an internal GAO subject matter expert who co-authored the  guide. This expert said the guide is reserved for the evaluation of  government acquisition program cost estimates. The expert added that  given that GAO was not reviewing such programs in this case, OMB\u2019s  assertion is without merit. In addition, we initially asked OMB whether it  had cost information on the reporting requirements but was told it did not  and were directed to the 24 agencies as the best source. Further, we  believe that we have appropriately qualified the range of costs reported  by the agencies and note that we made no recommendations on the cost  of such reporting.", "Further, regarding OMB\u2019s comment about the experience of the staff  providing estimates, we expressed our expectation that the CIOs  complete this and the other parts of our survey. However, as previously  discussed, in some cases CIOs and selected staff from the 24 agencies  delegated this responsibility to agency subject matter experts who they  thought were more knowledgeable in this area. In these cases, we again  expressed our expectation that the CIOs at a minimum review the  accuracy of such estimates.", "With regard to the OMB concern about our report\u2019s contextual framing of  certain information related to its efforts, the agency stated that it  appreciated our draft report acknowledging that agency reporting is a  critical component of ensuring effective management and oversight of key  IT reform initiatives and that such information is essential to the success  of IT reform efforts; however, it said our draft lacked contextual framing  because it did not the fully address the value of the reporting  requirements beyond agency CIOs\u2019 use of the data. In particular, OMB  stated that these requirements helped ensure the successful  implementation of federal law and/or supported administration priorities,  including IT-related cross-agency priority goals (which OMB commonly  refers to as CAP goalscover areas\u2014specifically, cybersecurity, Open Data, and smarter IT  delivery\u2014in which increased cross-agency collaboration is needed to  improve progress towards shared, complex priorities reaching far beyond  the scope of the priorities of individual federal agencies.  ). According to OMB\u2019s comments, CAP goals  We included a description in our report of the value of the information to  OMB in carrying out federal laws and its statutory roles and  responsibilities. Specifically, consistent with OMB\u2019s comments, we point  out that OMB utilizes reported information to meet statutory  responsibilities. For example, our draft states that under federal law,  OMB\u2019s Office of E-Government and Information Technology is required to  submit a report on the implementation of the E-Government Act of 2002,  which summarizes information reported by agencies as required under  the act. The draft also says that during the period of our review, OMB was  required to submit a report on federal agencies\u2019 implementation of the  Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002. Further, the draft  notes that in order to prepare such reports, OMB requires agencies to  submit information on their implementation efforts as required under the  acts, which OMB then summarizes for Congress.", "Our report also discusses the administration\u2019s priorities such as the IT- related cross-agency priority goals. OMB\u2019s written comments  acknowledge this point by stating that our draft report mentions the CAP  goals. However, OMB notes that our draft does not provide essential  context as to how the goals relate to reporting requirements. We  disagree. Our draft stated that the CIO reporting requirements help the  Federal CIO in its efforts to meet the CAP goals. Specifically, the draft  noted that Office of E-Government and Information Technology officials  review existing requirements to identify potential changes, including  opportunities to streamline, when new government-wide IT initiatives are  introduced. For example, these officials reported that their office is  currently in the process of evaluating CIO and other reporting  requirements to determine how they align to OMB\u2019s strategic cross- agency priority goals associated with smarter IT delivery, cybersecurity,  and Open Data and whether there might be opportunities to further  streamline existing reporting requirements Regarding OMB\u2019s fourth concern that our report does not reflect steps it  has taken to solicit feedback and streamline requirements, the agency  commented that it holds quarterly review (feedback) sessions with agency  officials about IDC requirements. It added that these sessions have  resulted in streamlining OMB collection requirements. OMB also noted  that it meets with CIO council members (via a Federal Data Center  Consolidation Initiative task force) to, among other things, help develop  metric and data collection requirements that best support administration  goals in this area. According to OMB, it has changed reporting  requirements and its strategic approach with regard to the data center  initiative as a result of feedback from the task force. In addition, OMB  cited the annual capital planning and investment control guidance it  issues, which includes Exhibits 53 and 300 reporting requirements, as  another example of the agency soliciting feedback.", "The streamlining efforts described in OMB\u2019s comments are discussed in  our report, including the role OMB played in soliciting of feedback. For  this reason, we agree with and believe our draft is consistent with OMB\u2019s  comments as it relates to IDC requirements and the annual capital and  control guidance it issues. Regarding its data center consolidation efforts,  we are aware of this effort and have updated our report to show it as  another example of OMB\u2019s efforts to streamline and solicit feedback.  Nonetheless, OMB\u2019s comments provided no explanation or  documentation to show it was addressing the CIO-identified challenges in  our draft that are not currently being addressed by its streamlining efforts.", "The above efforts aside, agency CIOs suggested, as noted in our report,  that OMB\u2019s feedback process could nonetheless be improved. In  particular, while agency CIOs reported that OMB provided feedback to  them on the majority of the 36 reporting requirements, the majority of  CIOs reported that the feedback was moderately effective to not effective  for most reporting requirements. Six agency CIOs also reported that they  were specifically interested in receiving better feedback on two reporting  requirements\u2014namely, the major IT investment documentation and the  Open Government directive. Office of E-Government and Information  Technology officials stated that the information on the feedback,  particularly those requirements agency CIOs were interested in receiving  feedback on, was useful.", "Nevertheless, the officials acknowledged that they do not consistently  provide this level of feedback to the CIOs because, in part, they did not  know until now that the CIOs wanted feedback to this extent. Having a  process that consistently provides effective feedback is key to helping  agency CIOs better manage their IT resources and improve reporting; it is  also consistent with OMB\u2019s goals to improve federal IT management,  oversight, and transparency. Until an effective feedback process is in  place, there is a risk that agencies are managing their IT in a suboptimal  manner.", "We are sending copies of this report to interested congressional  committees, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the  secretaries and agency heads of the departments and agencies  addressed in this report, and other interested parties.

We focused on the  requirements that were in effect by the end of the second quarter in fiscal  year 2014 (i.e., March 2014) so that we could use these in our survey of   In addition, since  federal agency CIOs, which was issued in May 2014.there could be several requirements for information in multiple OMB  memorandums for one initiative, we grouped the requirements to report  information together by initiative and the frequency of reporting rather  than list each as its own separate requirement. Requirements related to  activities such as information collection and control of paperwork; records  management; privacy and compliance with the Privacy Act; and  information disclosure and compliance with the Freedom of Information  Act were not included because these activities are not directly related to  IT management responsibilities. Further, requirements directed to other  agency officials but to which the agency CIO contributes were not  included. Further, although OMB occasionally makes ad hoc requests to  agency CIOs to provide information, we did not include those items in our  list because they did not originate from issued guidance.", "We categorized the requirements based on their best fit in the following  areas that are typically identified as key CIO IT management  responsibilities: IT strategic planning; capital planning and investment  management; IT security; and system acquisition, development, and  integration. We also had the agencies in our review (the 24 Chief  Financial Officer (CFO) Act agenciesprovide feedback to help ensure it was complete and accurate. Based on  their feedback, we made the necessary changes to our list, including  adding several requirements and removing several requirements that  were no longer in effect.  ) and OMB review our list and  To evaluate the extent to which agency CIOs and OMB use the required  information to manage IT and to assess CIOs\u2019 views on the utility of the  requirements, we first obtained and analyzed OMB documentation and  interviewed OMB officials; we then compared it to OMB\u2019s goal of using  CIO-reported information to improve the management, oversight, and  transparency of federal IT. We also, in coordination with our survey  methodology expert, developed and administered a web-based survey  that we sent to the CIOs of the 24 CFO Act agencies. In meetings with  CIOs and selected senior officials from agencies in our review to discuss  our plans to survey the CIOs, we told them we expected the CIOs to  complete the survey. If this was not feasible, CIOs could delegate the  task to other staff, especially when agencies wanted staff that worked  directly on addressing the reporting requirements to complete the survey  because they were best qualified to respond to our questions. In these  cases, we nevertheless told the agencies the CIOs were ultimately  responsible for reviewing the accuracy of the survey results.", "Using the survey, we requested information on, among other things, the  usefulness of the reporting requirements in managing IT, the level of  effort required to meet them, and whether CIOs thought the requirements  should be changed. For our analysis and reporting of the questions on  usefulness and level of effort, we grouped the reported responses into  three categories (i.e., very great to great, moderate, and some to no  extent) and reported the category that had a majority response, or the  largest number of responses in cases where the total number of  respondents for a particular requirement was less than 24. In instances  where the number of responses was evenly, or close to evenly, divided  between the \u201cvery great to great\u201d and \u201csome to no extent\u201d categories, we  chose the moderate category, as it provided the best overall  representation of the views of the agency CIOs for that requirement. For  the question on proposed changes to the reporting requirements, we  provided six options of possible change for agency CIOs to choose from  for each reporting requirement (i.e., frequency, mechanism, information  provided, consolidation, elimination, or other). We determined that at least  eight responses or one third of respondents suggesting a particular  change represented a sufficient consensus of agency CIO views for  reporting purposes.", "In addition, for each requirement, we asked agency CIOs to estimate the  annual amount (in government and/or contractor dollars) that agencies  spent on meeting each reporting requirement. For each reporting  requirement, we provided four choices in the survey to choose from ($1- $99,000; $100,000-$299,000; $300,000-$1,000,000; and more than  $1,000,000). We decided not to offer more precise dollar amount options  to choose from because, among other things, agencies do not typically  keep track of funds spent on CIO reporting requirements because this is  not required by OMB and therefore the benefits of having more precise  amounts were outweighed by the time and effort agencies would have  had to expend to develop such precise estimates. For our analysis of how  much agencies spend annually on reporting requirements, since the  option \u201cmore than $1,000,000\u201d did not include an upper range, we worked  with a survey methodology expert to define the lower and upper range of  this choice to be the same, which is $1 million plus one dollar or  $1,000,001. See appendix III for the list of survey questions.", "To minimize errors that might occur from respondents interpreting our  questions differently from our intended purpose, we pretested the  questionnaire in person and by phone in three rounds of testing with  officials from the office of the CIO at seven agencies. The selection of  agencies for pretesting was based on agency availability to assist us with  pretesting, variation in size of agency, and variation in agency CIO  models (i.e., centralized or decentralized). During these pretests, we  asked agency officials to complete the questionnaire for one reporting  requirement as we listened to the process. We then interviewed the  respondents to check whether the questions were applicable, clear,  unambiguous, and easy to understand. All 24 CFO Act agencies  completed the final survey, although not all survey respondents answered  every question. We then reviewed all responses, and followed up by  phone and e-mail to clarify the responses as appropriate.", "The practical difficulties of conducting any survey may introduce non- sampling errors. For example, differences in how a particular question is  interpreted, the sources of information available to respondents, or the  types of respondents who do not respond to a question can introduce  errors into the survey results. We included steps in both the data  collection and data analysis stages to minimize such non-sampling errors.  We examined the survey results and performed computer analyses to  identify inconsistencies and other indications of error, and addressed  such issues as necessary. We analyzed responses to closed-ended  questions by counting the response for all agencies. For questions that  asked respondents to provide a narrative answer, we compiled the  answers in one document that was analyzed and used as examples in the  report.", "To assess any OMB efforts to streamline this reporting, we obtained and  analyzed OMB and Federal CIO Council documentation and interview  information to summarize OMB\u2019s current and future plans for streamlining  CIO reporting and compared these efforts with OMB\u2019s goal to reduce CIO  reporting burden. As part of this, we interviewed officials from OMB and  the Federal CIO\u2019s Capital Planning and Investment Control Community of  Practice key working group to identify current and future actions taken to  streamline CIO reporting requirements.", "We conducted this performance audit from December 2013 to April 2015  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
