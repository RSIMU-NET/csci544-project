Federal agencies have three principal sources of information: (1) routine formal data collection instruments sent to industry participants to report on operations and other industry-related activities, (2) third parties such as energy news services that package federally collected information as well as collect original information some of which reflects current market conditions, and (3) individual companies under investigation. Agencies use the information that they collect to carry out their respective missions--ranging from Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) monitoring of electricity markets to Energy Information Administration's dissemination of information about the electricity sector and Environmental Protection Agency's pollution monitoring. Agencies share electricity-related information through a variety of means, such as using the Internet to distribute published reports and access their databases, interagency meetings, and other means. In addition, most federally collected information is made publicly available, although it is sometimes subject to delayed release or released in aggregated form in order to protect business-sensitive information. Restructuring has substantially changed the collection, use, and sharing of electricity information at some agencies and has exposed gaps in the federal government's collection of this information. Restructuring has affected FERC dramatically by changing how FERC performs its mission of assuring just and reasonable prices and by shifting its focus from periodic review of cost information to monitoring current market conditions. To monitor these conditions, FERC needs to access market information on wholesale transactions; however, no federal agency, including FERC, has access to complete and timely information on electricity markets and market participants, exposing gaps in key information. Such information gaps exist primarily because FERC is limited in its authority to collect information for full and effective market oversight and it lacks specific authority to collect current information which may lead to market participants challenging these collection activities. For example, FERC authority does not generally extend to non-jurisdictional entities such as the power marketing administrations, other non-utilities, and North American Electric Reliability Council. As long as these information gaps persist, FERC will be unable to oversee electricity markets in a comprehensive manner. Restructuring's effects on the sharing of electricity information, coupled with recent national security concerns, have highlighted the sensitive nature of some information that federal agencies collect or need. Because of the importance of having timely, reliable, and complete information, we are recommending that FERC take action to resolve its information gaps. As part of this action, we are recommending that FERC present its findings to the Congress because information-related issues--raised by restructuring--may require Congressional action to ultimately resolve."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Industry experts have described the ongoing transition (or restructuring)  of electricity markets from regulated monopolies to competitive markets  as one of the largest single industrial reorganizations in the history of  the world. Proponents of restructuring expect it to lead to a range of  benefits for consumers, including lower prices and a wider array of  retail electricity services than had previously been available. However,  opponents have raised concerns about restructuring in light of recent  events, such as the extremely high electricity prices and market  manipulation during the electricity crisis in California in 2000 and 2001.", "In this changing and uncertain environment, accurate information on  electricity trading and pricing is becoming more critical for not only  evaluating the potential benefits and risks of restructuring, but also  monitoring market performance and enforcing market rules. Information  on the cost of electricity, for example, is critical in determining whether  restructuring is achieving lower prices. Information on existing and new  generating plants is critical in determining whether electricity supply will  be sufficient to ensure reliable supplies. In addition, information is critical  to monitor emissions and comply with air quality standards in the future.  While information is becoming more critical for understanding how well  restructuring is working, there are troubling indications that the quality of  some information may be suspect. For example, we recently reported  that participants at a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)  conference raised concerns about the quality of price information due to  the low volume of trading activity in some markets and to some market  participants making inaccurate information available to the public.", "In response to the growing importance of electricity information and  concerns about its quality, you asked us to describe (1) the electricity  information collected, used, and shared by key federal agencies in meeting  their primary responsibilities and (2) the effect of restructuring on these  federal agencies\u2019 collection, use, and sharing of this information. In  addressing these objectives, we primarily examined the information  activities of FERC and the Energy Information Administration (EIA)  within the Department of Energy (DOE). We focused on FERC because  it bears the main responsibility for monitoring electricity markets, is  undergoing major organizational changes caused by restructuring, and  has faced significant challenges in responding to restructuring, as we have  described in previous reports. We focused on EIA because it is the main  U.S. statistical agency with responsibility for providing data and analysis  covering the energy sector. In addition to FERC and EIA, we examined  electricity-related activities at the Office of Fossil Energy within DOE,  the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Rural Utilities Service  (RUS) at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Securities and Exchange  Commission (SEC), the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade  Commission, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Due to  limitations in the time frame for our review, we did not perform a detailed  evaluation of these agencies\u2019 missions to determine whether information  and data available to them was sufficient to meet their responsibilities."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The overall transition known as \u201crestructuring\u201d in the electricity industry  reflects a shift from a monopolistic to a more competitive industry. The  electric utility industry was considered one of the nation\u2019s most regulated  industries, with states regulating utilities\u2019 retail or intrastate activities  and the federal government regulating utilities wholesale or interstate  transactions. In the past, electricity service providers enjoyed a natural  monopoly, providing electricity generated by their plants, transmitted  over their power lines, and distributed to their customers. Two key factors  led that monopolistic structure to move toward a more competitive  marketplace. First, new technologies reduced the cost and size of  generating electricity effectively. Currently, there is a preference for  small-scale production facilities that can be brought on-line more quickly  and cheaply with fewer regulatory impediments. Second, federal changes  were made in the industry\u2019s regulation. Specifically, the enactment of  the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) of 1978 initiated the  process for a transition or restructuring to a freer electric power market  by requiring utilities to buy electricity produced by nonutility producers.  Then in 1992, the Energy Policy Act (EPACT) was enacted and removed  several regulatory barriers to entry into electricity generation and  promoted further competition.", "Restructuring is underway for wholesale markets, which involve the  sale of electricity for resale. It is also underway for some retail sales to  end users, which include residential, commercial, industrial, and other  consumers. Federally regulated wholesale power markets already provide  market-based prices. States, however, vary greatly in their response to  restructuring: some states have introduced competition to the retail  markets in their states, others have begun to restructure but then  delayed or suspended these efforts, and others still have taken no steps to  restructure their markets. As the industry adapts to restructuring, many  utilities are facing greater competition from nonutilities and other new  entities such as power marketers. The introduction of competition has  considerably expanded the number and types of business arrangements  involving generation and transmission of electricity. In addition, proposals  for new regulatory structures to oversee the new industry are emerging.", "FERC and EIA are the two leading entities for the collection, analysis,  and evaluation of electric power information. FERC collects information  to assure just and reasonable rates on the basis of costs. FERC also  collects and obtains information from other federal and nonfederal  sources to monitor and regulate competitive markets for wholesale  electricity to similarly determine if these prices are just and reasonable.  EIA is mandated to collect, assemble, evaluate, analyze, and disseminate  energy data and energy information for the Congress, the federal  government, the states, and the public.", "The Federal Power Act (FPA) of 1935, PURPA, and EPACT drive  FERC\u2019s information collection activities. FPA authorizes FERC to collect  and record information to the extent it deems necessary and to prescribe  rules and regulations concerning accounts, records, and memoranda.  In general, FPA provides for federal oversight of interstate transmission  and wholesale sales by public utilities. Forty-three years later, the  Congress enacted PURPA in response to the unstable energy climate of  the late 1970s. PURPA authorizes FERC to collect information on the basic  cost and quality of fuels at electric generating plants. FERC uses such  data to conduct fuel reviews and rate investigations and to track market  changes and trends. In addition, PURPA requires public utilities to  report on electric energy shortages and contingency plans to FERC  and appropriate state agencies. In 1992, the Congress enacted EPACT.  EPACT created a new category of power sellers called exempt wholesale  generators that are not subject to regulation under the Public Utility  Holding Company Act (PUHCA), which governs how utilities can  be legally organized. These power sellers must apply to FERC for  PUHCA exemption.", "Legislation created EIA and defined its information collection activities.  In 1974, the Congress enacted the Federal Energy Administration Act that  created the Federal Energy Administration. The act mandated the Federal  Energy Administration to collect, assemble, evaluate, and analyze energy  information for the federal government, state governments, and the public  and provided it with information collection enforcement authority for  gathering information from energy producing and consuming firms. Two  years later, the Energy Conservation and Production Act established the  Office of Energy Information and Analysis, mandating it to operate a  comprehensive National Energy Information System; possess expertise  in energy analysis and forecasting; coordinate information activities with  federal agencies; promptly provide upon request any energy information  to any duly established committee of the Congress; and make periodic  reports on the energy situation and trend to the Congress. In 1977, by  enacting the Department of Energy Organization Act, the Congress  established EIA as the federal authority for energy information. This  act gave EIA independence to collect energy data and report energy  information, including all the provisions of its predecessor, and  established an annual survey to gather and report detailed energy  industry financial data. In 1992, EPACT required EIA to expand its data  gathering and analysis in several areas, including energy consumption,  alternative-fueled vehicles, greenhouse gas emissions, fossil fuel  transportation rates and distribution patterns, electricity production from  renewable energy sources, and foreign purchase and imports of uranium.", "Federal agencies\u2019 information collection activities are subject to the  Paperwork Reduction Act. The purpose of the Paperwork Reduction  Act is to minimize the paperwork burden for all individuals and entities  that must report information to the federal government. The Office  of Management and Budget (OMB) oversees governmental initiatives  to reduce the paperwork burden and improve the management of  information resources. The Paperwork Reduction Act requires federal  agencies to submit their data collection tools to OMB for review. OMB is  also responsible for the implementation of the Government Paperwork  Elimination Act, which requires federal agencies, by October 21, 2003, to  allow individuals, or entities that interact with the agencies, the option of  submitting information to agencies electronically, whenever practicable.", "The North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) is one of the  most important nonfederal entities that collect data from the electricity  industry. NERC, formed as a result of a devastating outage in the northeast  during November 1965, was established to promote the reliability of the  interconnected electric power system. NERC membership is voluntary,  consists of representatives from utilities across North America, and  provides a forum for the electric utility industry to develop policies,  standards, and guidelines designed to ensure reliability. One of its key  functions is to collect information from its members, among other things,  on power plant operations and outages.

Some agencies such as FERC, EIA, RUS, SEC, and EPA collect  information on an ongoing, regular basis, using forms or form-like surveys.  However, there is a time differential between the reporting period, when  the information is collected and when an agency reports the information.  As a result, the information usually does not reflect current market  conditions. Restructuring has led to a greater need for a second type of  information, focusing on current activities, for purposes of monitoring by  FERC in particular. Third-party sources, such as Bloomberg\u2019s Professional  Services, provide current and historical information on regional electricity  and gas markets, including spot and future prices, market commentary,  plant outage information, and energy news. Investigations create a need  for a third type of information, when an agency such as the Department of  Justice gathers information mainly in conjunction with specific company  criminal investigations. To meet their missions, agencies collect a wide  variety of electricity-related information.

In responding to this mission, FERC stated that it chooses regulatory  approaches that foster competitive markets whenever possible, assures  access to reliable service at a reasonable price, and gives full and fair  consideration to environmental and community impacts in assessing the  public interest of energy projects. Among its other duties, it reviews the  rates set by the four federal power marketing administrations.

The emissions that must be reported include  sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and carbon dioxide. While not an  emission, the unit heat input (the caloric value of the fuel burned) must  also be reported. The program\u2019s overall goal is to achieve significant  environmental and public health benefits through reductions in emissions  of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, the primary causes of acid rain. In  most cases, utility units use a continuous emission monitoring system.  Units report hourly emissions information to EPA on a quarterly basis.  The information for the three types of emissions and the unit heat input  is then recorded in the Emissions Tracking System, which serves as a  repository of information on the utility industry. At the end of each  calendar year, EPA uses this information to compare the tons of actual  emissions reported with each company\u2019s authorized emissions.

This report and  collected data were used to call for additional monitoring of mercury  emissions so that a regulatory control strategy could be developed. Then,  in November 1998, the agency announced its decision to require coal-fired  electricity generating plants to collect and report such information for  1 year. The agency collected detailed information on mercury during 1999.  It obtained information on (1) every coal-fired boiler in the United States,  (2) mercury in samples of coal used by boilers, and (3) actual mercury  emissions from the stacks of a randomly selected group of coal-fired  boilers.

The official added that FERC has met with EIA to coordinate  and share information on information collection issues. Another FERC  official stated that FERC does not have formal protocols to interact with  other agencies such as SEC, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission,  and the Federal Bureau of Investigations; however, FERC also interacts  with these agencies on an ad hoc basis to assist them with their  information needs and use \u201cshared access letters\u201d to request information  from other agencies\u2019 files.

The Market Monitoring Center relies  on computers and various software packages to make large amounts of  information on electricity available in a usable format. The center uses  both commercial and proprietary information services to access current  market activities. Electricity market information provided by these  services includes prices on the spot market and futures contracts,  plant outage, and historical information for trend analysis. FERC also  subscribes to another new service provider that offers current information  on the status and output of some generating units. OMOI also uses the  historical information from the traditional FERC data collection activities  to assist in its work. For example, during investigations, FERC\u2019s forms for  routine information collection provide historical baseline information  that may be critical in determining possible market manipulations and/or  unjustified prices. Appendix II contains information on the commercial  and proprietary information services FERC uses and descriptions of the  types of information provided.", "In fiscal year 2002, FERC completed studies to take stock of the  agency\u2019s current and future market information needs. As a part of this  effort, FERC formed teams that were to identify information that FERC  currently collects and additional information that it might need. The study  on current information needs identified 19 active information collection  and reporting requirements for the electric energy sector and three that  relate to all three energy sectors (electric, natural gas, and oil pipeline).  The study on future information needs identified a core body of  information FERC must know to adequately understand how it might  exercise its oversight authority and information needs to accommodate  a range of regulatory approaches. The core body of information includes  eight categories and the specific data elements, descriptions, and potential  sources of this information. The categories are demand for electric power,  supply, operations and congestion management, market participants,  transmission transactional information, market design and rules, and  traditional regulatory functions.

First, the historical  information FERC collects has deteriorated in quality, in part, because  of declines in power plant information reporting. Specifically, FERC has  found that some of the data fields that companies are required to fill out  are left blank in some cases. To improve data quality, FERC officials stated  that FERC recently improved its error checking capability for one of its  recently developed electronic reports. In addition, some companies have  aggregated sales transactions data on the forms in a way that makes it  impossible to determine specific prices and quantities sold. Further,  FERC\u2019s coverage of power plant operational information has diminished  because some plants formerly owned by utilities are now owned by  nonutilities that are not required to report to FERC. Prior to restructuring,  FERC specifically used the information reported on power plant fuel costs  and quality as a factor to determine electricity rates. Under restructuring,  FERC uses power plant information to understand power production and  available capacity in specific markets, and to understand what is normal  or anomalous. According to FERC, power outages could be used as  strategies to reduce supply and thereby raise market prices. In June 2002,  we reported that California power supplier behavior described in other  studies we reviewed was consistent with the exercise of market power,  because the prices charged did not reflect the marginal costs of generating  additional megawatt-hours of electricity. Rather, the behavior reflected an  ability to charge higher prices by waiting to commit the generation to a  time when buyers were willing to pay more.", "Second, according to FERC and as we previously reported, FERC  generally has no jurisdiction over power sales by federally owned  entities, publicly owned utilities, and most cooperatively owned utilities.  These nonjurisdictional utilities own 27 percent of the U.S. electric  transmission system and are also smaller than investor-owned utilities;  however, they serve large areas of the country and provide service in  conjunction with about 25 percent of the nation\u2019s demand for electricity.  FERC officials note that they have little data and information on these  areas of the country. However, according to FERC officials, information  about the operations of these nonjurisdictional entities is important to  understand these entities\u2019 impact on generation and transmission activities  in a given market. For example, the Tennessee Valley Authority operates a  large power system and serves many nonjurisdictional entities covering a  large geographical area across the southeastern United States located  between several FERC jurisdictional entities. According to FERC, the  lack of detailed information about the operations of the Tennessee Valley  Authority system limits its ability to assess the performance of the markets  surrounding this network. Similarly, FERC officials noted that they also  need information on electricity imports from neighboring countries,  particularly Canada, because they participate in and affect prices of  electricity in U.S. markets.", "Third, according to FERC officials, they have limited up-to-the-minute  market information needed to monitor electricity markets. FERC does  not collect price information, for example, on up-to-the-minute electricity  prices, fuel costs, and spot and futures contract prices. In June 2002,  we reported that the Market Monitoring Center did not include detailed  information about energy prices on \u201cexempt\u201d commercial markets,  including the Intercontinental Exchange, a \u201cmultilateral\u201d electronic  trader, which invites and matches buy and sell orders for other customers.  According to FERC, it now has access to Intercontinental Exchange but  no longer has access to other Internet-based trading systems such as  UBS Warburg and Dynegydirect, both of which were \u201cbilateral\u201d  electronic traders because they have ceased operations. Such systems  have and continue to provide an important market for both physical  energy (electricity and gas products) as well as energy derivatives to be  bought and sold. In commenting on a draft of this report, FERC stated that  because its authority is ambiguous relative to the trade of electricity-based  derivatives, its ability to collect information on this part of the market  is limited. Additionally, FERC officials said that they have limited  operational information, such as power plant outages and availability  of capacity on transmission lines. Price and transaction information, as  well as operational information, is important in order for FERC to be  able to detect changes in the market, determine the legitimacy of market  outcomes, and if needed, take corrective action.", "Finally, FERC officials told us that FERC cannot access other nonfederal  information it needs to assess reliability of the power grid and monitor  overall electricity market performance. Specifically, NERC collects  current electricity market information such as operations of power plants,  flows on key transmission lines, transmission between two parties, and  system frequency (that is, a measure of how well the system is balancing  electricity demand and supply and other reliability information). FERC  officials pointed out that because market performance and electricity  system reliability are mutually dependent, such reliability information  would help them to determine whether market participants are behaving  in an anticompetitive manner. While NERC officials agreed that this  information might be valuable to FERC in determining whether power  plant outages are justifiable, they stated that NERC is prohibited from  disseminating such information without obtaining the companies\u2019  permission\u2014which companies are reluctant to grant due to the  business-sensitive nature of the information. Further, NERC officials  told us that their database is deteriorating in quality because companies  are increasingly concerned about sharing detailed information, for fear  that competitors may gain an undue advantage. In particular, many new  market entrants to the electricity generating industry have not joined  NERC or provided NERC with information about their plant operations.  In commenting on a draft of this report, FERC stated that language in  proposed legislation creating FERC jurisdiction over a designated electric  reliability organization should assist in addressing issues related to access  to NERC information.", "As we previously reported, FERC lacks authority to gather all the  information it needs from all segments of wholesale electricity markets  primarily because it derives much of its legislative authority from  mandates that were enacted over 75 years ago\u2014when the industry was  structured as regulated monopolies and rates were based on the cost of  service. Further, we reported, FERC lacks regulatory authority over all  entities in wholesale electricity markets and is therefore unable to gather  all of the information it needs to understand markets across the nation.  Specifically, section 309 of the Federal Power Act provides FERC with the  authority to prescribe the forms of all reports to be filed with it and the  information to be reported. This authority does not generally extend to  nonjurisdictional entities such as the power marketing administrations,  other nonutilities, and NERC. For example, FERC has identified problems  in getting data on individual power plant operations that it needs in order  to evaluate the functioning of the transmission system. Information on  nonjurisdictional entities is important because they also participate in the  same electricity markets as jurisdictional entities and directly influence  market activities, including prices. Senior FERC officials told us that, in  general, FERC\u2019s authority to collect information from nonjurisdictional  market participants is predicated on developing a specific legal argument  that the information supports a specific investigation, rather than for  more general monitoring of market performance. Furthermore, regarding  entities within FERC\u2019s jurisdiction, FERC does not have specific authority  to collect up-to-the-minute detailed information on market activities.  While long-standing general authority may enable FERC to collect the  information it needs, the lack of specific authority for obtaining this  information may lead to challenges from market participants. In this  same vein, FERC officials added that FERC also faces challenges  related to the Paperwork Reduction Act in terms of the long lead time  and the level of effort necessary to obtain OMB\u2019s approval for additional  information collections.", "Additionally, FERC\u2019s legislative framework does not allow it to levy  a meaningful range of penalties against companies that choose to  intentionally underreport or misreport required information. Although  the Federal Power Act allows FERC to levy criminal fines and civil  penalties against market participants, they are insufficient to discourage  underreporting or misreporting information. Thus, FERC\u2019s traditional  legislative authority may no longer be in sync with today\u2019s developing  competitive electricity markets. In competitive energy markets, adequate  and reliable information is important to FERC\u2019s ability to fulfill its  regulatory mandate and ensure the market participants are not engaging  in anticompetitive behavior. In commenting on a draft of this report,  FERC stated that market transparency provisions in proposed legislation  prohibits the filing of false information and increases FERC\u2019s criminal  penalty authority for noncompliance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FERC Increasingly Relies on Third-Party Information, but Gaps Remain and Some Information Is Suspect", "paragraphs": ["FERC increasingly relies on third-party information to help offset its  limited authority to collect all of the information it needs to monitor  electricity markets.

(See app. II for a complete listing and description  of information that third parties provide to FERC to assist its monitoring  of electricity markets.) While these third-party sources fill some of  FERC\u2019s information gaps, they do not have full or complete coverage  of the information FERC needs but lacks. For example, while Genscape  measures power plant operations for some power plants, it does not have  full coverage of the electricity system. Moreover, OMOI does not have  access to a third-party source for price or quantity information on most  bilateral transactions of wholesale electricity. In addition, FERC and  others have raised concerns about the quality of the published price  information these third parties provide. Specifically, FERC reported  that published prices are subject to manipulation and cannot be  independently validated. FERC surveyed reporting firms for both natural  gas and electricity and found that these firms lacked formal verification  or corroboration and sufficient internal controls to ensure information  reported to them was reliable. FERC also found that these entities relied  instead on traders or bid/ask prices reported by traders and other market  participants. As a result, FERC reported that this lack of verification  allowed an opportunity for entities to deliberately misreport information  in order to manipulate prices and/or volumes in electricity.", "In at least one recent instance, FERC used such third-party information  as a basis of a key decision regarding California\u2019s electricity market\u2014the  information, however, later turned out to be inaccurate. Specifically, in  2002, FERC instructed an administrative law judge, who was considering  a request for refunds related to the western electricity crisis, to use a  methodology that relied on third-party data for natural gas prices. The  methodology, developed by FERC staff, was intended to set a proxy for  market prices that would have been produced had the western market  been competitive. The methodology estimated the cost of producing  electricity for key generators based on operating cost, including fuel.  Using this methodology, the judge ordered refunds of about $1.8 billion  to the state of California. Subsequent to the order, FERC found, in  August 2002, that the natural gas prices underlying the methodology had  been subject to erroneous reporting and manipulation. In March 2003,  FERC presented an alternative methodology for determining refunds,  which is expected to substantially increase the previous award.", "In commenting on a draft of this report, FERC stated that it is working  on options--based on staff recommendations and through a docket  proceeding--to improve third-party data.

FERC officials stated that the market monitors have a  better ability to understand and observe market changes, can react more  quickly to changing market conditions, and can take stronger corrective  action than FERC. In addition, as part of the rules sanctioning these  entities, FERC officials said they expect to have access to all the data  collected by the market monitors, which FERC views as considerable.  According to FERC, it currently obtains timely information from some  existing RTO and ISO monitors to help support its market oversight  processes. However, FERC officials said that, relative to the Paperwork  Reduction Act, they are not sure whether the market monitors will be  able to collect information on FERC\u2019s behalf that FERC itself has not  been authorized to collect. In commenting on a draft of this report,  FERC stated that it is mindful of the potential burden imposed by  additional information collections. FERC added that it has been inventive  in developing ways to monitor markets, particularly restructured markets  with RTOs and ISOs, using data generated as an integral part of market  operations.", "Further, as we previously reported, several of the market monitors rely on  different methods to evaluate market power, there is a lack of uniformity  in what information is collected, how it is analyzed, and what is reported,  making potential cross-market comparisons difficult at this time. More  importantly, FERC\u2019s effort to expand the number and/or market coverage  of RTOs as well as standardize electricity market rules has met with  resistance from the Congress, state commissions, and others. At present,  according to FERC, two organizations have been approved as RTOs  while five others have been conditionally approved. Overall, even if these  additional RTOs are fully approved, FERC\u2019s coverage will not extend to  markets outside of its jurisdiction. Thus, FERC\u2019s reliance on RTOs to  help it diminish data gaps, particularly in the next several years, will likely  provide only limited help.

At EIA, restructuring has led to changes in the number of  entities from which EIA collects data, the volume of data collected on  electricity markets, and the way in which EIA uses the data to complete  its mission of examining the energy sector. EIA officials recognized that  restructuring could affect them and examined the potential implications in  two reports.", "According to a senior EIA official, the first, and most important effect of  restructuring on EIA was its revision of its forms to require the same  information from utilities and nonutilities. Historically, nonutilities were  exempt from many of EIA\u2019s reporting requirements. Adding these new  entities has expanded EIA\u2019s database by about 2,000 new sources of  information and has nearly doubled its database. The second effect of  restructuring on EIA is the increase in the volume of information that it  collects and provides because restructuring has significantly expanded the  role of wholesale markets in providing electricity. For example, EIA now  posts electricity prices for several of the largest markets on its Web site  and reports more detailed information about the aggregate activities of  these markets in its publications. The third effect of restructuring on EIA  is to significantly alter the way that EIA examines energy sectors and  electricity in particular. In order to meet one of its missions of examining  and forecasting energy consumption and use, EIA has had to revise its  energy models to accommodate restructuring because of changes in the  way that electricity is supplied and distributed. For example, in March  2003, EIA reported that it reviewed and revised how it collects, estimates,  and reports fuel use for facilities producing electricity. According to EIA,  the review addressed inconsistent reporting of fuels for electric power  by combined heat and power plants and changes in the electric power  marketplace that have been inconsistently represented in various EIA  survey forms and publications. EIA regards these efforts as complex and  substantial and expects them to continue as the electricity sector evolves.", "EIA also encountered problems such as maintaining the quality of  information. The Director of EIA\u2019s Electric Power Division said that the  Department of Energy\u2019s Secretary has made the quality of information  one of the department\u2019s top priorities. However, maintaining this quality  at EIA is a challenge because there has been a substantial increase in the  number of sources of information (especially the nonutilities) resulting  from restructuring while EIA has also experienced substantial budget cuts.  The Director estimated that there has been a 50 percent increase in the  overall volume of data. In addition, the Director said that, while omission  of information by companies responding to EIA\u2019s data collection efforts is  not a common problem, in the past, some companies failed to answer a  question about the delivered fuel price on EIA\u2019s Form 423. The Director  added that the companies\u2019 decision not to disclose information about fuel  prices could have been attributed to the sensitive nature of this  particular item.", "Restructuring has had little direct effect on SEC\u2019s overall information  collection activities. As such, according to SEC officials, the SEC  continues to carry out its oversight of securities laws and its  administration of PUHCA. However, the Congress is considering  repealing or modifying PUHCA because the emergence of nonutilities  reflects the fact that utilities are no longer the sole source of electricity  energy. FERC and SEC officials acknowledge that since nonutilities are  not covered by PUHCA, registered holding companies may engage in  nonutility activities that are not regulated by the act. SEC has stated that  it supports the repeal of PUHCA as long as repeal is accomplished in a  way that gives FERC and state regulators sufficient authority to protect  utility consumers. FERC has stated that PUHCA, as it currently exists,  may actually impede competitive markets and appropriate competitive  market structures.", "Recent events such as the collapse of Enron Corporation have accelerated  reforms affecting SEC that aim at improving the quality and reliability of  financial information. SEC plays a vital role in ensuring that meaningful  and intelligible information is disclosed to investors. Such disclosures are  particularly important as corporate structures of new and old electricity  market participants continue to change. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002  has established the legal framework to address some of the concerns  related to corporate disclosure, accountability, and transparency.", "Restructuring has not had significant effects on the collection of electricity  information by the other agencies included in our review. Some agencies,  such as the Federal Trade Commission and the Commodities Futures  Trading Commission, may become more involved in collecting electricity  information as competitive markets develop. For example, the number  of electricity entity mergers has slowed down, but should these mergers  increase, Justice may need to increase its information collections for  merger investigations accordingly. In addition, a Commodities Futures  Trading Commission official initially told us that electricity futures  trading had been discontinued because the market participants found that  electricity futures failed to provide an adequate hedge against intermittent  price volatility. However, since our initial discussion, the New York  Mercantile Exchange has introduced several new electricity contracts, and  the Commodities Futures Trading Commission has reinstated its practice  of collecting information on these trades.", "Despite the more limited impacts of electricity restructuring on many  of these agencies to date, some jurisdictional issues have been raised  about their respective roles in helping to oversee electricity markets more  generally. Events such as the collapse of Enron Corporation bring to light  the importance of clarifying jurisdiction across the federal government  as restructuring progresses. As noted in a recent Senate Governmental  Affairs report and memorandum, and other congressional hearings,  both FERC and SEC have been questioned about their lack of diligence  in following through on Enron\u2019s activities\u2014even though they had  indications of improper conduct. The report commented that effective  coordination between agencies prevents companies from exploiting  the lack of oversight in areas where neither agency may have taken  full responsibility\u2014as Enron did with FERC and SEC in the case of  its investments in wind farms. Officials at both FERC and SEC told us  that they had performed their jobs and had no reason to check with the  other agency about Enron\u2019s actions. However, Enron took advantage of  jurisdictional gaps between the two agencies that enabled it to earn tens  of millions of dollars above what it would have otherwise earned from its  wind farms.", "FERC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission provide a  second example of problems resulting from jurisdictional uncertainties.  The Senate memorandum (noted previously) on FERC pointed out  that FERC did not initially determine whether it had jurisdiction over  on-line trading platforms such as Enron Online, although it was FERC\u2019s  expectation that these electronic trading platforms would become a  dominant way to trade both electricity and gas. Furthermore, this  memorandum concluded that both FERC and the Commodity Futures  Trading Commission had some regulatory responsibility for on-line  trading. Until Enron\u2019s collapse, however, the two agencies did not  participate in meaningful discussions to identify and coordinate their  respective roles. Effective coordination would have helped to clarify the  jurisdictional boundaries between FERC and the Commodity Futures  Trading Commission regarding energy trading activities and products,  including on-line trading, and to define the two agencies\u2019 respective  monitoring responsibilities in these developing markets. Both agencies  have recently taken steps to improve their coordination.

This dilemma has led to controversy about the electricity information that  is to be made publicly available and shared with other federal agencies.  Both EIA and FERC have procedures regarding restrictions on access  to information and have modified these procedures, as appropriate. For  example, EIA faced considerable protest for its proposal to restrict access  to the information that it collects but updated its procedures to resolve  some of the concerns raised. By contrast, public disclosure laws and  confidentiality pledges to protect information also affect information  sharing and collection of other key information at both federal and  nonfederal levels. For example, NERC\u2019s information collected from  the electricity industry remains unavailable to FERC and other federal  agencies because of its sensitivity. In addition, the quality of the  information being submitted to NERC has declined as companies have  become increasingly concerned about providing it.

The controversy pitted certain  companies that feared potential competitive harm from the release of  sensitive information, against agency and public interest in maintaining  access to electricity data. Federal agencies and a private sector group  provided extensive comments on EIA\u2019s proposal to broaden the  information it considered confidential. EPA, for example, objected to  EIA\u2019s proposed confidential treatment of fuel consumption, fuel quality,  fuel type, thermal output, and retail sales. EPA officials noted that EPA  makes extensive use of these data elements in monitoring emissions. In  general, it maintained that EIA\u2019s proposal went far beyond what was  reasonably necessary to protect competitors from the release of sensitive  data. The American Public Power Association, which represents the  nation\u2019s 2,000 nonprofit, publicly owned electric utilities, described itself  as \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by EIA\u2019s proposal. It stated that EIA had provided  no evidence that the public availability of specific data items would  harm the filing companies and no evidence on how EIA balanced the  public\u2019s need for information against any potential harm to these  companies. By contrast, the Edison Electric Institute, which represents  shareholder-owned electric companies, cited potential harm to companies,  for example, information in the hands of a competitor that could allow the  competitor unfairly to undercut another company\u2019s bid strategy.", "In response to these disagreements over confidentiality, EIA issued a  policy statement that made two general changes to its procedures. First,  it reported that some data elements that were not considered confidential  in the past would now be treated as confidential. Second, it reported that  some data collected from unregulated companies that were formerly  treated as confidential would now be made publicly available. Discussing  the eventual resolution of the controversy, the Director of EIA\u2019s Electric  Power Division told us that EIA adopted two strategies to achieve this  balance.

The  act requires FERC to disclose information to the public unless specific  exemption categories are met, which FERC officials told us, is often  difficult to do. According to FERC officials, while FERC may be willing  to share exempted information with state regulatory bodies, states have  similar public disclosure laws that do not always guarantee their ability  to protect this information. FERC officials added that RTOs will also face  similar challenges in sharing commercially sensitive information. While  RTOs could benefit by sharing information about entrants from other  markets who are interested in entering their own markets, protecting the  confidentiality of this information will be an issue. In commenting on a  draft of this report, FERC stated that proposed legislative language  provides a clear confidentiality standard, exempting \u201cfrom disclosure  information FERC determines would, if disclosed, be detrimental to the  operation of an effective market or jeopardize system security.\u201d Finally,  FERC also faces challenges creating ways to obtain and share information  from Canada and Mexico, since they also affect U.S. electricity markets.", "NERC is hesitant to share information with FERC that its members  feel would cause them competitive harm if released in the public  domain. According to a NERC official, companies are increasingly  reluctant to provide commercially sensitive information, causing a  decline in information quality. Therefore, NERC has pledged not to  divulge information on a company-specific basis and will release it only  in aggregate form in hopes of getting the information it needs. NERC  collects current electric market information such as flows on key  transmission lines, transmission between two parties, and system  frequency (an indicator of how well the system is balanced) that  FERC is interested in obtaining from NERC, but, according to both  FERC and NERC officials, confidentiality pledges inhibit this sharing  this information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "National Security Concerns Affect Information Sharing", "paragraphs": ["Since September 11, 2001, the federal government has taken steps to  protect the nation\u2019s critical infrastructures, including the energy  infrastructure.

Specifically, it has removed information such as oversized maps that detail  the specifications of existing and proposed energy facilities that were  once publicly available from its Internet site, public reference rooms, and  databases. For example, FERC removed the information its collects from  the Form 715, Annual Transmission Planning and Evaluation Report,  from the public domain.

Consequently, FERC is currently missing  some of these key pieces of information or is relying on third parties  such as energy news services for related information to assist in meeting  its market monitoring and oversight responsibilities. Without access  to this key information, FERC will not be able to fully understand the  performance of specific electricity markets across the country. In addition,  FERC will be less prepared to identify potential market manipulation that  may affect competitive markets. FERC\u2019s existing authority is not adequate  to collect all the information it needs, resulting in these gaps of key  information. Moreover, legislation does not allow FERC to levy meaningful  criminal fines and civil penalties against market participants to ensure that  companies report accurate and reliable information, further diminishing  its ability to identify potential market manipulation.

We also identified third-party sources of information used  by federal agencies. These included the 13 companies identified in  appendix II. We analyzed this third-party information through a review  of Web-based materials and interviewed officials at Genscape, Edison  Electric Institute, and NERC. We also identified federal agencies that  collect, or have collected, electricity information for investigations and  interviewed officials at these agencies that included the Department of  Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Commodity Futures  Trading Commission.

Within  FERC, we met with officials from OMOI and from its Office of  Markets, Tariffs, and Rates. To understand the gaps in FERC\u2019s electricity  information resulting from restructuring, we interviewed officials at FERC  and NERC, reviewed information from third-party sources, and identified  federal authority contributing to these gaps. Although restructuring has  affected other federal agencies to a lesser extent, we identified the  relevant effects, if any, in these other agencies by interviewing officials  and reviewing pertinent documents. Among these other agencies, EIA has  been the most affected by restructuring. We examined specific impacts  at EIA that included increases in the number of entities from which EIA  collects data and the volume of information collected. We also examined  jurisdictional issues posed about FERC and SEC, and FERC and the  Commodity Futures Trading Commission. To understand how  restructuring has affected the way in which federal agencies share this  information, we examined concerns about confidentiality, particularly as  they related to EIA\u2019s development of its current confidentiality policy and  FERC\u2019s lack of access to NERC information because of NERC\u2019s concerns  about the potential sensitivity of the information.
