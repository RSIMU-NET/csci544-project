By prepositioning stocks ashore and afloat, DOD is able to  provide assets to U.S. forces during the initial phases of an operation until  follow-on capabilities are available and the supply chain has been  established. DOD primarily uses prepositioned stocks for warfighting  purposes, but they are also used for a variety of other needs including  security cooperation activities, multilateral training exercises abroad,  humanitarian assistance, and disaster relief.", "In the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for fiscal year 2014,  Congress required DOD to maintain a strategic policy regarding the  department\u2019s programs for prepositioned stocks that takes into account  national security threats, strategic mobility, service requirements, and the  requirements of the combatant commands. In addition, the act required  DOD, not later than 120 days after the enactment of the law, to develop  an implementation plan on its prepositioned stock programs. Both the  strategic policy and the implementation plan are to address required  elements in the law, such as describing the department\u2019s vision for  prepositioning programs. (See the table on page 5 and appendix I for a  complete list of the required elements for the strategic policy and the  implementation plan respectively.)", "We have previously reported on the long-term and ongoing challenges  related to DOD\u2019s management and oversight of its prepositioned stocks.  For the past 6 years in our annual reports on duplication, overlap, and  fragmentation, we have identified the potential for duplication in the  services\u2019 prepositioning stock programs. In May 2011, we recommended  that DOD develop a department-wide strategy and strengthen joint oversight to integrate and synchronize at a DOD-wide level the services\u2019  prepositioned stock programs, in order to maximize efficiency in  managing prepositioned stocks across the department and to reduce  potentially unnecessary duplication. DOD concurred with our  recommendation. In the NDAA for fiscal year 2014, Congress required  DOD to maintain a strategic policy and develop an implementation plan to  maximize efficiencies and reduce duplication of prepositioning stocks. In  April 2016, we reported that DOD had made limited progress in  developing a department-wide strategic policy and implementation plan  and recommended that DOD establish a timeline for completing the policy  and plan. DOD did not concur with this recommendation, stating that the  department had already communicated to Congress its plan regarding the  additional development of a strategic policy and implementation plan.  Subsequently, Senate Report 114-255, accompanying a bill for the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, contained a  provision directing DOD to establish a timeline for completing the  department-wide directive and implementation plan and identify the major  steps needed to implement the plan, including target dates for  accomplishing each major step that can be used to monitor progress and  report results. On March 7, 2017, DOD issued a strategic policy for the  management of its prepositioned stock programs. DOD stated in a  September 2016 letter to the defense committees that it would develop a  plan for implementing its strategic policy for its prepositioned stock  programs by the end of the third quarter of fiscal year 2017.", "Section 321 of the NDAA for fiscal year 2014 also includes a provision for  us to review DOD\u2019s strategic policy and implementation plan for  managing its prepositioned stock programs.

We performed a content analysis in which we compared  the information in DOD\u2019s strategic policy with the six required reporting  elements and assessed the extent to which the policy addressed each  required element. One GAO analyst coded the information and a different  analyst checked the initial coding for accuracy. Any initial disagreements  in the coding were discussed and reconciled by the analysts. The  analysts then tallied their responses to determine the extent to which the  reporting elements were addressed. We assessed an element as  addressed if DOD\u2019s report addressed all parts of the element. We  assessed an element as partially addressed if one or more\u2014but not all\u2014 parts of the required element were explicitly addressed. We assessed an  element as not addressed if the report did not explicitly address any part  of the required element. To determine the status of DOD\u2019s  implementation plan for its prepositioned stock programs, we reviewed  DOD documents, including correspondence to the defense committees  on milestones and actions regarding DOD\u2019s ongoing efforts to develop  the plan. We also interviewed officials from the Offices of the Under  Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, the  Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff to  determine the status of DOD\u2019s efforts.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2017 to July 2017 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Officials from the Office of the Under Secretary of  Defense for Policy stated that the strategic policy does not include this  information because it is intended to serve as a directive for developing  policies and assigning key responsibilities, which can be used as a  mechanism for addressing required elements at a later time.

DOD officials from the offices of the Under  Secretary of Defense for Policy and the Joint Staff acknowledged that  the strategic policy does not include a department-wide vision, desired  end state, and specific interim goals. However, the NDAA for fiscal  year 2014 requires a department vision, not a component vision.  Moreover, for the past 6 years in our annual reports on duplication,  overlap, and fragmentation and in our related reports, we have  identified the potential for duplication in the services\u2019 prepositioned  stock programs due to the absence of a department-wide strategic  policy and joint oversight. Such joint oversight is necessary to  articulate a single, department-wide vision and interim goals. By not  including the department\u2019s vision or interim goals in its strategic  policy, and instead, directing the Under Secretary of Defense for  Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics and the DOD Component  heads to provide guidance on the component\u2019s vision, DOD is  continuing its fragmented approach to managing its prepositioned  stock programs by further emphasizing individual visions rather than a  joint, department-wide view. Unless DOD revises its policy or includes  in other guidance a department-wide vision, desired end state, and  goals for its prepositioned stock programs, DOD risks being unable to  recognize potential efficiencies that could be gained by synchronizing  the services\u2019 prepositioning programs with each other.", "Element 4 (Description of the Strategic Environment and  Challenges): DOD\u2019s strategic policy does not include a description of  the strategic environment, or the requirements for and challenges  associated with prepositioned stocks as required by element 4.

We believe that if the Under Secretaries issue such guidance as  directed, DOD and the services will be able to have a shared  understanding of the strategic environment, requirements, and  challenges of managing their prepositioned stocks, which could  promote joint oversight and efficiencies across the department.", "Element 5 (Metrics): DOD\u2019s strategic policy does not include metrics  for evaluating the extent to which DOD prepositioned stocks are  achieving defense objectives as required by element 5. Rather, the  policy assigns the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff with the  responsibility for developing metrics. We believe that if the Chairman  develops such metrics as directed, DOD and the services will have  common criteria with which to measure their programs.
