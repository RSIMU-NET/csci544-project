Although the amount of WFO performed has remained relatively constant over the last 5 years overall, WFO as a percentage of the total work performed at the laboratories--measured in total laboratory costs incurred--has declined from 17 percent in fiscal year 2008 to about 13 percent in fiscal year 2012. In fiscal year 2012, the WFO program included more than 6,500 projects. About 88 percent of this work was for other federal agencies, with the majority of it performed for the Department of Defense. For example, one project for the Army applies a laboratory's expertise in laser decontamination of surfaces to develop a system that will remove chemical agent residues from equipment. The remaining WFO work was sponsored by nonfederal entities, including state and local governments, universities, private industry, and foreign entities.", "DOE officials have not ensured that WFO program requirements are consistently met. For example, a DOE official is required to determine whether a proposed WFO project has met DOE requirements for accepting work before approving, or certifying, the work and this responsibility may not be delegated to the laboratories. However, DOE officials from site offices at 8 of the 17 laboratories reported that these determinations were made by the laboratories and that the DOE officials did not take steps to independently verify the determinations prior to approving the work. DOE also cannot ensure that the full costs of materials and services for WFO projects are charged to sponsors because 12 of 17 laboratories have limited or no written procedures for developing WFO project budgets or charging costs to ongoing projects, two important steps for recovering the full costs of materials and services. A 2013 DOE Office of Inspector General report found that the costs of administering WFO projects at one laboratory were allocated to DOE projects, resulting in an estimated $400,000 in WFO project costs that were not reimbursed to the laboratory. DOE requires that its program offices annually review the WFO program at each of its laboratories. However, DOE requirements do not specify what the reviews should include, and DOE program offices varied in what they consider to be an annual review. DOE also requires the department's Chief Financial Officer to report annually on the activities conducted under the WFO program, but DOE officials told GAO that they no longer produce the report because the requirement is outdated, choosing instead to fulfill data requests on a case-by-case basis. As a result, DOE does not have data that are comparable across laboratories or over time.", "DOE has not measured the extent to which WFO program performance is measured against program objectives and has not established performance measures to do so. Some DOE site offices and laboratories have taken steps to evaluate the performance of the WFO program, but these steps are not consistent across the laboratories, do not incorporate key attributes of successful performance measures, and do not address the WFO program objectives. Recent internal and external reviews of the laboratories have recommended that DOE establish clear measures to evaluate laboratory WFO program performance against the WFO program objectives.

In fiscal  year 2012, from its appropriations DOE allocated nearly $11 billion to its  17 national laboratories. These laboratories house cutting-edge scientific  facilities and equipment, ranging from high-performance computers to  ultra-bright X-ray sources for investigating fundamental properties of  materials. The majority of the research and development funded by DOE  is carried out under the department\u2019s direction and overseen by scientists,  engineers, and others employed at the 17 national laboratories, 16 of  which are managed and operated by contractors under management and  operating (M&O) contracts, and 1 of which DOE directly manages and  operates.and nonprofit organizations.", "The M&O contractors include universities, private companies,  To allow non-DOE entities to benefit from the significant public investment  in DOE\u2019s laboratories and from the unique and highly specialized facilities  and scientific and technical expertise at these laboratories, DOE operates  the Work for Others (WFO) program. This program allows work to be  performed at the laboratories for both federal agencies and nonfederal  entities, provided that several requirements are met, including that WFO  projects do not hinder DOE\u2019s mission or compete with the private sector.  Several laws provide the foundation for DOE\u2019s WFO program.

In this context, you asked us to  review the WFO program at DOE\u2019s laboratories. Our objectives were to  determine (1) the amount and type of work conducted under DOE\u2019s WFO  program, (2) the extent to which DOE has ensured that WFO program  requirements are met, and (3) the extent to which DOE and the  laboratories have measured WFO program performance against WFO  program objectives.", "To determine the amount and type, or sponsors, of the work conducted  under DOE\u2019s WFO program, we reviewed DOE data on the amount of  work performed under the WFO program in total and by laboratory for  fiscal years 2008 through 2012, as measured by costs incurred for WFO  projects. We also obtained total costs incurred for each laboratory for  fiscal years 2008 through 2012. To assess the reliability of these data, we  interviewed DOE officials who oversee them for DOE\u2019s Office of the Chief  Financial Officer (CFO) to understand how the data are collected and  reported. We also reviewed recent external audits of DOE\u2019s financial  reporting system and financial data. We determined that the data were  sufficiently reliable to describe the amount of WFO activities performed at  the laboratories. To determine the amount of work conducted by federal  and nonfederal sponsors under the program, we gathered data on the  costs of WFO activities performed for federal versus nonfederal sponsors.  In addition, we interviewed DOE headquarters and site officials and  officials for the 17 laboratories to gather examples of projects performed  for federal and nonfederal sponsors. We visited 3 laboratories and  contacted the remaining 14 laboratories by telephone. To determine the  extent to which DOE has ensured that WFO program requirements are  met, we reviewed federal regulations; DOE requirements; and DOE and  laboratories\u2019 policies and procedures governing the WFO program,  including those for approval of WFO projects; cost recovery for WFO  projects (i.e., development of project budgets and charging of costs); and  reports of reviews of WFO programs. To determine the extent to which  DOE and the laboratories have measured WFO project performance  against program objectives, we reviewed DOE orders; performance  requirements for WFO projects, if any, in DOE contracts with laboratories;  DOE evaluations of laboratories\u2019 performance; and laboratories\u2019 strategic  plans and procedures for establishing and executing WFO projects.

We found that 6 of  the 16 reviews did not include steps to ensure that prices for WFO  projects conformed to DOE requirements. For example, in order to ensure  that adequate documentation exists for prices established for materials  and services charged to sponsors of WFO projects, reviewers need to  examine pricing documentation for a sample of WFO projects.

These generally consisted of a review of WFO program policy  and procedure documents at the site offices including flow charts, forms,  and correspondence. Each of the six reviews identified areas of concern  within the WFO programs. For example, one program office review  reported that the laboratory was dependent on funds from a single WFO  project to support a major DOE program. The review cautioned that if the  WFO project was discontinued, it could create a detrimental financial  burden on the laboratory in the future, which is not consistent with DOE\u2019s  requirement to avoid doing so. In addition, four of the reviews found  deficiencies related to WFO program documentation or procedures.

For example, while customer satisfaction surveys or other  qualitative measures, such as success stories gathered by the  laboratories, may provide some useful information and indicate areas for  improvement, customer satisfaction is not included in the WFO order as a  program goal. Furthermore, the performance measures do not directly  link with the WFO program goals or objectives such as providing access  to DOE laboratories to accomplish goals that may be otherwise  unattainable by federal agencies and nonfederal entities. Without such  linkage, DOE and decision makers may not have the needed information  to track the program\u2019s progress in meeting its objectives. Additionally,  some WFO qualitative measures such as customer satisfaction may lack  clarity and a measurable target, making it difficult to compare  performance across laboratories. These types of qualitative measures  also may not meet the key attribute of objectivity due to the potential for  bias or other manipulation, depending on how the information is gathered  and assessed. Other efforts to measure the performance of the  program\u2014specifically, the number of WFO agreements in place and  WFO agreement processing time\u2014both provide some helpful information  but do not include all key attributes of successful performance measures.  For example, tracking the number of agreements is clear and measurable  and provides some information about the number of WFO projects at a  laboratory. However, without linkage to the program\u2019s objectives,  measuring the number of agreements in place does not capture the  program\u2019s effectiveness in meeting the program\u2019s objectives laid out in  the WFO order, such as maintaining core competencies and enhancing  the science and technology base at the laboratories.", "As we have reported,the ability to track the progress they are making toward their mission and  objectives.

Similarly, in 2012, a working group set up by DOE  headquarters to oversee efforts at the laboratories to share technology  with non-DOE entities, reported concerns that measures did not exist to  evaluate the impact and success of WFO work activities in achieving  program objectives. DOE officials told us that, because WFO agreements  are unique to each laboratory, they do not believe it is appropriate to  develop one set of measures for all laboratories and that they have no  plans to do so.

DOE\u2019s WFO program has allowed  the department to share these capabilities with both other federal  agencies and nonfederal entities. DOE has established WFO program  requirements\u2014including for project approval, cost recovery, program  reporting, and program review\u2014that together are intended to help DOE  operate a successful WFO program and avoid adverse impacts on the  laboratories\u2019 missions and facilities and to avoid competition with the  private sector. DOE falls short, however, in ensuring that these  requirements are consistently met. For example, DOE has frequently  relied on the laboratories to determine whether WFO projects selected  meet the requirements of the WFO order, and DOE officials have  accepted the laboratories\u2019 determinations without taking steps to  independently verify these determinations. Ensuring that the WFO  projects selected meet DOE requirements is a governmental  responsibility and, according to the WFO order, a DOE contracting officer  or other authorized DOE designee is required to determine whether a  proposed WFO project has met all of these requirements before  approving the work. By relying instead on the laboratories to make these  determinations, DOE cannot ensure that all WFO projects meet  requirements. DOE may also not be able to ensure that the costs of WFO  projects are recovered according to its pricing order because it has not  required the laboratories to establish written procedures to guide  development of project budgets or charging of costs to projects, important  steps for determining and recovering the full costs of WFO projects\u2019  materials and services. The department\u2019s CFO also does not have  assurance that the full costs of WFO projects are charged to the projects\u2019  sponsors because field CFOs do not always conduct biennial pricing  reviews according to requirements.", "Furthermore, the WFO order does not specify what should be included in  the annual WFO program reviews required by the order. Without clear  and specific requirements, it may be difficult for DOE to identify WFO  program deficiencies, if any. In addition, DOE officials told us that the  requirement to prepare an annual summary report of WFO activities  performed at its laboratories is outdated and has not been followed for  several years, and that the department plans to eliminate this  requirement. However, members of Congress have directed DOE to  provide information on the status of WFO activities, and other DOE  programs regularly need and collect WFO project data that would be  available if DOE prepared the annual summary report.

While reminding staff of the  requirements of the WFO order would likely be beneficial, to improve its  management and oversight of the WFO program, DOE also needs to take  steps to ensure that these requirements are consistently being met by  periodically monitoring the processes for project approval, full cost  recovery of projects, and biennial pricing reviews.", "DOE also stated that it concurred in principle with the fourth  recommendation to specify in the WFO order what the required annual  program reviews should include. DOE added, however, that the current  WFO order appropriately provides discretion to DOE program offices in  determining the scope and extent of WFO program reviews. Again, DOE  states that it will issue a policy flash reminding the program offices of the  annual review requirement for the WFO program. DOE\u2019s planned action,  however, does not directly address our recommendation to update the  WFO order with specific requirements for these reviews. Likewise, DOE  stated that it concurred in principle with the fifth recommendation that it  ensure that annual summary reports of WFO activities are prepared so  that data on those activities are readily available for those who need this  information. However, rather than preparing annual summary reports,  DOE stated that the WFO order requires revision to reflect its current  practice of providing current WFO program summary information. As we  said in our report, choosing to report data on a case-by-case basis rather  than in an annual report may make it difficult for those providing  oversight, and for some users of the data, because the data are not  readily available and DOE will need to generate them, which is time- consuming, and they may not be comparable across laboratories or over  time. Finally, in response to the sixth recommendation to establish  performance measures that incorporate key attributes of successful  performance measures and that address the objectives of the WFO  program, DOE plans to issue a policy flash on the current requirements of  the WFO program related to program assessments. In our report, we  discussed that the WFO order, however, does not include specific  requirements for program assessments and a policy flash that repeats the  current requirements for program assessments would, therefore, not  address the recommendation.", "DOE also provided clarifying comments that we incorporated, as  appropriate.

We also requested and  obtained total costs incurred for each laboratory for these same fiscal  years. We selected costs incurred as the measure of the amount of WFO  projects performed for our purposes because WFO agreements can span  multiple years and these costs are similar to the costs presented in  reports by DOE and its Office of Inspector General. We used data for  fiscal years 2008 through 2012 because our last report on DOE WFO  projects reported data through fiscal year 2008. We interviewed DOE  officials who oversee and collect these cost data for DOE\u2019s Office of the  CFO and determined that these data were obtained from DOE\u2019s Standard  Accounting and Reporting System (STARS) financial reporting system.", "To assess the reliability of DOE\u2019s WFO project cost data and total  laboratory costs, we reviewed information about DOE\u2019s STARS financial  reporting system, as well as a recent external audit of the STARS system  and DOE\u2019s financial data. We also reviewed recent GAO assessments of  the STARS system. No material weaknesses were reported.

Based on our assessment, we concluded  that the data obtained from the DOE CFO were sufficiently reliable to  describe the dollar amount and percentage of WFO projects performed at  the laboratories. To determine the number of WFO projects that were  active during fiscal year 2012, we used information from the fiscal year  2012 WFO project lists provided by each laboratory, as the DOE CFO  does not have the capability to identify individual nonfederal projects. To  determine the type of WFO projects performed at DOE\u2019s laboratories, we  gathered data on the costs of WFO activities performed for federal versus  nonfederal sponsors.
