COVID-19 is only the latest communicable disease threat to raise public health concerns regarding the spread of contagion through air travel. Ensuring that the United States is prepared to respond to disease threats from air travel, as well as conducting the necessary research to reduce the risks of contagion, are two vital responsibilities of the federal government.", "This statement provides information on (1) the U.S. aviation system's preparedness to respond to communicable disease threats and (2) FAA's management of its R&D portfolio, including the extent to which disease transmission on aircraft and at airports has been the focus of FAA research.

In December 2015 during the Ebola epidemic, GAO recommended that the Department of Transportation (DOT) work with relevant stakeholders, such as the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), to develop a national aviation-preparedness plan for communicable disease outbreaks. GAO concluded that the absence of a national plan undermined the ability of the public-health and aviation sectors to coordinate on a response or to provide consistent guidance to airlines and airports. Moreover, Annex 9 to an international aviation treaty to which the United States is a signatory contains a standard that obligates member states to develop such a plan. DOT is now confronting an even more widespread public health crisis\u2014the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) global pandemic\u2014without having taken steps to implement this recommendation. Not only could such a plan provide a mechanism for the public-health and aviation sectors to coordinate to more effectively prevent and control a communicable disease threat, it could also help minimize unnecessary disruptions to the national aviation system, disruptions that to date have been significant. Some aviation stakeholders have publicly highlighted the resulting piecemeal approach to adopting standards during the response to COVID-19, such as various airline and airport policies regarding facemasks, as demonstrating the need for a more coordinated response. The existence of a national plan might have reduced some of the confusion among aviation stakeholders and passengers. While DOT agrees that a national aviation preparedness plan is needed, the agency continues to suggest that HHS and the Department of Homeland Security have responsibility for communicable disease response and preparedness planning. GAO continues to believe that DOT is in the best position to lead this effort given its oversight responsibilities and ties with relevant aviation stakeholders.", "The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has sponsored limited federal research into disease transmission onboard aircraft and in airports. FAA's research goals focus on areas like improving airport operations and air space management, and developing new technologies, which FAA has aligned to DOT's strategic goals related to safety, infrastructure, and innovation. Based on prior work and interviews with FAA officials, GAO found that FAA's research in cabin safety for crew and passengers does not focus on disease transmission. For example, according to FAA officials, ongoing research that most closely relates to disease contamination is research related to monitoring the quality of \u201cbleed air,\u201d which is outside air that is drawn through jet engines into an aircraft cabin. In 2017, GAO found that FAA could be more strategic in how it develops its research and development (R&D) portfolio, chiefly in identifying long-term research needs and explaining how FAA selects projects. Of the three recommendations GAO made in that report to improve FAA's management of its R&D portfolio, FAA fully addressed one, issuing guidance in 2018 on prioritizing and selecting R&D projects. While FAA has made some progress addressing GAO's recommendations on research portfolio development and reporting, further attention to these recommendations could help ensure that FAA strategically identifies research priorities across the agency."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO made several recommendations in its prior work, including that DOT develop a comprehensive national aviation-preparedness plan, and that FAA identify long-term R&D priorities, among other things.

The outbreak of  Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is having profound effects around  the world. Its global transmission was greatly aided and accelerated by air  travel, which totaled more than 4.5 billion passengers in 2019, mostly  before the widespread outbreak. In light of the resulting pandemic and  warnings about the risks of air travel, U.S. passenger airline traffic fell by  96 percent in April 2020, as compared to April 2019. COVID-19 is only  the latest communicable disease to raise concerns about the spread of  contagion through air travel. Since 2002, there have been six major public  health epidemic threats with global ramifications, including the severe  acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and the Ebola virus disease  in 2014. More than any other mode of transportation, air travel creates the  potential for infection to move quickly from one part of the world to  another. In December 2015, we recommended that the Secretary of  Transportation should work with relevant federal stakeholders to develop  a national aviation-preparedness plan for communicable disease  outbreaks.", "In order to identify technologies and solutions to improve the safety of the  civil aviation system, the federal government conducts research and  development (R&D) to advance U.S. technological leadership and foster  a dynamic aerospace industry. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)  within DOT, along with the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration (NASA), is responsible for the management of the federal  government\u2019s civil aviation R&D. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC)  within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) also  sponsors health-related research involving air transportation.", "My testimony today is based largely on reports we issued in 2015 on air  travel and communicable disease and in 2017 on FAA\u2019s management of  commercial aviation R&D. Specifically, this testimony describes: (1) the  U.S. aviation system\u2019s preparedness to respond to communicable  disease threats from abroad and (2) FAA\u2019s management of its R&D  portfolio, including the extent to which disease transmission on aircraft  and at airports has been the focus of FAA research.", "To conduct our prior work, we reviewed available documents and  interviewed officials from the key federal departments with responsibilities  for conducting aviation research and for preparing for communicable  disease threats from abroad and responding to them. In addition, we  interviewed a range of stakeholders to discuss aviation preparedness and  research, and potential opportunities to improve those areas. More  detailed information on our objectives, scope, and methodology can be  found in each of the reports.", "For this statement, we contacted DOT, Department of Homeland Security  (DHS), and HHS officials to determine the status of a national aviation- preparedness plan for the aviation system as recommended in our 2015  report. In addition, we interviewed FAA officials to learn about actions  FAA has taken to address the recommendations we made in our 2017  report to improve the development, tracking, and reporting of the federal  government\u2019s civil-aviation research and development portfolio. We also  reviewed aviation-related research on communicable disease from the  past 10 years, selected based on key word searches.", "We conducted the work on which this testimony is based in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Each federal agency has a different  mission, which affects its responsibilities for protecting against  communicable disease threats. The DHS and HHS are the lead agencies  for responding to a communicable disease threat. They focus on  protecting our borders at ports of entry, including airports, from threats  from abroad and protecting the nation from domestic and foreign health,  safety, and security threats, respectively. FAA is responsible for civil  aviation and commercial space transportation flight safety in the United  States and the safe and efficient movement of air traffic in the national  airspace system, as well as for the safety of U.S. airlines, other U.S.  operators, and FAA-certificated aircrews worldwide. As part of this  responsibility, FAA regulates and certificates airports, airlines, and airmen  and provides guidance.", "In the case of a communicable disease threat, numerous federal, state,  and local entities may be called upon to respond, depending on their legal  authority and whether the threat is identified before, during, or after the  flight. For example, before boarding, HHS and DHS may identify travelers  who are not allowed travel, based on public health threats. The CDC can  prohibit the introduction of nonresident foreign nationals into the United  States from designated countries or places, but only for such time as the  CDC deems necessary for public health. During a flight, CDC regulations  require pilots to immediately report to CDC any deaths or the occurrence  of any travelers with signs or symptoms that may indicate a  communicable disease infection during international flights coming to the  United States. And, once an aircraft with a suspected ill passenger  approaches an airport, federal or local public health officials, first  responders (e.g., fire or emergency medical technicians), airport  authorities, air traffic control personnel, or a combination of these  stakeholders may make decisions about and lead certain aspects of the  response based on the situation and available response protocols or  preparedness plans. In addition, some response-related roles and  responsibilities are established in law or by interagency agreements, and  others may be defined in FAA-required airport-emergency plans, although  those plans are not required to address communicable disease threats.", "In addition, FAA supports and coordinates a range of R&D activities for  the civil aviation system. The inventory of FAA\u2019s R&D activities is expressed in the National Aviation Research Plan (NARP) and in FAA\u2019s  Fiscal Year R&D Annual Review. FAA is required to submit both of these  documents annually to Congress. According to FAA\u2019s most recent  NARP, FAA\u2019s research budget from all accounts in FY 2017 was $422.3  million. FAA\u2019s research budget supports activities conducted by FAA as  well as a range of partners, including other government agencies,  universities, and private sector organizations.", "FAA\u2019s process for developing its commercial aviation research portfolio  spans the agency. To develop the NARP and its R&D portfolio, FAA\u2019s  program planning teams, which focus on specific research program  areas, identify R&D projects to meet one of DOT\u2019s three strategic goals  and FAA\u2019s five R&D goals. Further, an executive board in FAA provides  guidance and oversight over the agency\u2019s portfolio development process,  and a statutorily created advisory committee\u2014consisting of individuals  that represent corporations, universities, associations, and others\u2014 conducts external reviews of FAA\u2019s R&D programs for relevance, quality,  and performance. This advisory committee also makes recommendations  to FAA on the proposed R&D portfolios and budgets."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "In the Continued Absence of a Comprehensive National Plan, the U.S. Aviation System Remains Insufficiently Prepared to Respond to Communicable Disease Threats", "paragraphs": ["In 2015, we found that the United States lacked a comprehensive national  aviation-preparedness plan to limit the spread of communicable diseases  through air travel, though some individual airport and airline preparedness  plans did exist. Accordingly, we recommended that DOT work with  relevant stakeholders, such as HHS, to develop a national aviation- preparedness plan for communicable disease outbreaks. We emphasized  that a comprehensive national plan would provide a coordination  mechanism for the public-health and aviation sectors to more effectively  prevent and control a communicable disease threat while also minimizing  unnecessary disruptions to the national aviation system. Additionally, U.S.  airports and airlines are not required to have individual preparedness  plans for communicable disease threats and no federal agency tracks  which airports and airlines have them. As such, the extent to which U.S.  airports and airlines have such plans is unknown. However, all 14 airports  and 3 airlines we reviewed in 2015 had independently developed  preparedness plans for responding to communicable disease threats from  abroad. These plans generally addressed the high-level components that  we identified as common among applicable federal and international  guidance for emergency preparedness, such as establishment of an  incident command center and activation triggers for a response. While the  14 airports and 3 airlines had plans that address communicable diseases,  representatives from these airports and airlines reported facing multiple  challenges in responding to threats. Identified challenges that included  obtaining guidance; communication and coordination among responders;  and assuring employees have appropriate training, equipment, and  sanitary workplaces. As we stated in our 2015 report, a national aviation  preparedness plan to respond to communicable disease outbreaks could  help address these challenges.", "As of June 2020, DOT, DHS, and HHS stated that the federal government  still has not developed a national aviation-preparedness plan to respond  to communicable disease outbreaks. In making our recommendation in  2015, we pointed to Annex 9 to the Chicago Convention\u2014an international  aviation treaty to which the United States is a signatory\u2014which contains a  standard that obligates International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)  member states to develop a national aviation-preparedness plan for  communicable disease outbreaks. DOT and CDC officials in 2015  stated that some elements of a national aviation-preparedness plan  already exist, including plans at individual airports. However, as we  discussed in our 2015 report, individual airport plans are often contained  in multiple documents, and FAA reported that the plans are intended to  handle communicable disease threats posed by passengers on one or  two flights, rather than an epidemic\u2014which may require involvement from  multiple airports on a national level. Most importantly, a national aviation- preparedness plan would provide airports and airlines with an adaptable  and scalable framework with which to align their individual plans, to help  ensure that individual airport and airline plans work in concert with one  another.", "DOT and CDC officials agreed in 2015 and continue to agree today that a  national aviation-preparedness plan could add value. DOT, however,  maintains that those agencies that have both legal authority and expertise  for emergency response and public health\u2014namely DHS and HHS\u2014are  best positioned to take the lead role in developing such a plan within the  existing interagency framework for national-level all-hazards emergency  preparedness planning. We continue to believe that DOT would be in the  best position to lead the effort because FAA and DOT have stronger and  deeper ties to, as well as oversight responsibility for, the relevant  stakeholders that would be most involved in such a broad effort, namely  airlines, airports, and other aviation stakeholders. In addition, DOT\u2019s  Office of the Secretary is the liaison to ICAO for Annex 9 to the Chicago  Convention, in which the relevant ICAO standard is contained.", "In response to the current COVID-19 pandemic and in the absence of a  national aviation-preparedness plan, DOT officials pointed to ongoing  efforts to engage with interagency partners at DHS and HHS, as well as  industry stakeholders, to better collaborate on the aviation sector\u2019s  communicable disease response and preparedness. For example, DOT  told us that it has facilitated conference calls between federal and private  sector stakeholders and has collaborated with CDC to update interim guidance for airline crews related to communicable diseases, specifically  COVID-19. While these actions are helpful, some aviation stakeholders  have publicly highlighted piecemeal response efforts that may have led to  some of the confusion among stakeholders and chaos at certain airports  that occurred earlier this year following the COVID-19 travel bans and  increased screening efforts. For example, stakeholders described actions  taken by individual airlines in the absence of FAA guidance, such as to  cease operations to certain countries, and a piecemeal approach to  establishing standards for safely continuing or expanding service, such as  various airline and airport policies regarding facemasks. This piecemeal  approach points to the continued need for DOT to implement our 2015  recommendation to develop a coordinated effort to plan for and respond  to communicable disease threats. We have included this open  recommendation as one of 16 high priority recommendations to DOT."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FAA Has Taken Steps to Improve Its R&D Portfolio Management, but Has Conducted Limited Research on Disease Transmission in Aircraft and Airports FAA is Taking Steps to Improve the Formulation and Management of its R&D Portfolio Based on GAO Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["While a national aviation-preparedness plan can help better manage the  response to the next aviation pandemic, other efforts such as research  and development are also key. In 2017, we found that FAA\u2019s actions  related to the management of its R&D portfolio were not fully consistent  with statutory requirements, agency guidance, and leading practices. As  part of that work, we assessed FAA\u2019s actions to manage its R&D portfolio  in three key areas: (1) developing its portfolio of R&D projects, (2)  tracking and evaluating those projects, and (3) reporting on its portfolio.  We found that FAA could be more strategic in how it develops its R&D  portfolio, chiefly in identifying long-term research needs and in improving  disclosure of how projects are selected. As a result of these deficiencies,  we found that FAA management could not be assured that the highest  priority R&D was being conducted. We also found that while FAA tracks  and evaluates its research projects consistent with leading practices, it  did not fully address all statutory reporting requirements, such as  identifying long-term research resources in the National Aviation  Research Plan (NARP) or preparing the R&D Annual Review in  accordance with government performance-reporting requirements. These  reporting deficiencies can limit the usefulness of the reports to internal  and outside stakeholders. Accordingly, in 2017, we recommended that  DOT direct FAA to (1) take a more strategic approach to identifying long- term R&D research priorities across the agency, (2) disclose how  research projects are prioritized and selected, and (3) ensure that the  NARP and R&D Annual Reviews meet statutory requirements for content.  DOT agreed with all three recommendations.", "As of June 2020, FAA has fully addressed one of our recommendations  and taken partial action on two other recommendations. Specifically, FAA fully responded to our recommendation that FAA disclose the process it  uses for prioritizing and selecting research projects by updating in 2018  its internal guidance documents to allow better transparency over project  selection. In partially responding to our recommendation to take a more  strategic approach to identifying research priorities across the agency, in  June 2019, FAA issued a redesigned National Aviation Research Plan  (NARP) for 2017-2018. The redesigned plan is a good first step. Also as  part of an effort to be more strategic, FAA is beginning to take actions to  understand emerging aviation issues requiring FAA\u2019s research attention.  This recommendation has not been fully addressed as, according to FAA  officials, the agency is still developing guidance to ensure that future  NARPs take a strategic approach and incorporate emerging issues into  future plans. FAA officials told us they plan to finalize the guidance by the  end of 2020. Similarly, with respect to our recommendation aimed at  achieving compliance with statutory reporting requirements, the  redesigned 2017-2018 NARP included a list of agreements with federal  and nonfederal entities on research activities, resource allocation  decisions, and a description of technology transfer to government,  industry, and academia, among other items. Officials told us that they are  finalizing the 2019 R&D Annual Review, which has been redesigned to  address other statutory reporting requirements, and will develop guidance  to ensure that future documents meet those requirements."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Disease Transmission Research Has Received Limited FAA Focus in Recent Years", "paragraphs": ["FAA has sponsored limited federal research into disease transmission  onboard aircraft and in airports.

For  example, in 2015 the Transportation Research Board\u2019s Airports  Cooperative Research Program (ACRP), which is funded by FAA\u2019s  Airport Improvement Program (AIP), decided to hold a series of  workshops on topics that are of significance to airports and that are not  being addressed by other federal research programs. The decision to  hold the first ACRP workshop on communicable disease occurred toward  the end of the Ebola virus outbreak. ACRP has also issued reports on  reducing communicable disease transmission at airports and aircraft.  These reports have provided information and guidance to airports and  airlines on infectious disease mitigation onboard aircraft and ways to  respond to a communicable disease in airports. For example, a 2013  ACRP report recommends reducing the amount of time aircraft ventilation  systems are shutdown at the gate, so that an aircraft\u2019s high efficiency  particulate air (HEPA) systems, which can capture more than 99 percent  of the airborne microbes, continue to operate. ACRP also has a research  project currently under way for publication early next year on effective  collaboration to prevent, respond to, and mitigate disease threats.", "Prior to 2014, FAA also funded some research on disease transmission  on aircraft through its Centers of Excellence research consortium.  Specifically, in 2004, FAA established the Airliner Cabin Environment  Research (ACER) Center of Excellence, which conducts research on, among other things, the safety and health of passengers and crew inside  the cabin. In 2010 and 2012, ACER published research on air quality in  airline cabins and disease transmission in aircraft.

As  of 2014, ACER began operating independently as a consortium  academia, government, and others and is no longer being funded solely  by FAA.", "FAA and DOT principally look to HHS and the CDC for guidance on  passenger health issues. HHS has statutory responsibility for preventing  the introduction, transmission, and spread of communicable diseases into  the United States and among the states. Within HHS, CDC has defined  its mission as protecting America from health, safety and security threats,  both foreign and domestic. CDC alerts travelers about disease outbreaks  and steps they can take to protect themselves. CDC also has the  authority to quarantine passengers traveling from foreign countries, if  necessary, to prevent the introduction, transmission, or spread of  communicable disease. CDC\u2019s National Institute for Occupational Safety  and Health has conducted research and issued guidance in the past on  disease transmission in aircraft and cabin crew health and, as previously  noted, is funding current research through the ACER Center.
