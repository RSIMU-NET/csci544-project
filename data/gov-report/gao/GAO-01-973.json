In the United States, surveillance for foodborne disease is also used to identify outbreaks--two or more cases of a similar illness that result from ingestion of a common food--and their causes. CDC has 18 surveillance systems used to detect cases or outbreaks of foodborne disease, pinpoint their cause, recognize trends, and develop effective prevention and control measures. Four principal systems--the Foodborne Disease Outbreak Surveillance System, PulseNet, FoodNet, and the Surveillance Outbreak Detection Algorithm--focus on foodborne diseases and cover more than one pathogen. Although CDC's systems have contributed to food safety, the usefulness of several of these surveillance systems is impaired both by CDC's untimely release of surveillance data and by gaps in the data collection.

The effects of these diseases range from mild gastroenteritis to life-threatening damage to the kidneys, heart, and nervous system. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) estimates that five major foodborne diseases alone cost the nation at least $6.9 billion each year in medical treatments, productivity losses, and premature deaths.", "Surveillance is public health officials\u2019 most important tool for detecting and monitoring both existing and emerging foodborne diseases. Without adequate surveillance systems, local, state, and federal officials cannot gauge the impact of existing foodborne diseases and may not recognize new diseases until many people have been affected. These officials rely on surveillance data to focus their staff and financial resources on preventing and controlling the foodborne diseases that most threaten public health. Health officials also use surveillance data to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of prevention and control programs.", "In the United States, surveillance for foodborne disease is also used to identify outbreaks\u2014two or more cases of a similar illness that result from ingestion of a common food\u2014and their causes. Nearly all of CDC\u2019s surveillance systems are passive, which means they rely on physicians, laboratory and hospital staff, and others to take the initiative in reporting data to health departments. However, for FoodNet, one of CDC\u2019s principal foodborne disease surveillance systems, the reverse occurs. In this system\u2014referred to as an active system\u2014public health officials take the initiative to periodically contact laboratory officials to gather data instead of passively waiting to receive data from laboratories and others. Compared to a passive system, an active surveillance system produces more complete information but is more costly to use for data collection activities.", "Responsibility for surveillance of foodborne diseases rests primarily with local and state health departments, although the federal government also has an important role. At the local level, health care providers identify cases of foodborne disease. Typically, these local officials report cases of certain diseases to state health departments. Both local and state health departments investigate outbreaks. State health departments voluntarily report those individual cases and outbreaks to CDC, which is part of the Department of Health and Human Services.", "CDC, as the central control point for collection of such data at the national level, collects this data through two electronic information systems and other information sources, such as paper forms, in order to analyze and summarize foodborne disease information on a national basis. Surveillance information can be used to detect outbreaks and to confirm that the ensuing intervention is effective. For example, in 1996, public health officials used surveillance data to detect an outbreak associated with Escherichia coli (E. coli) O157:H7, which made 66 people ill and killed 1 after they drank unpasteurized apple juice. Surveillance triggered an outbreak investigation, and as a result, the juice responsible for the outbreak was recalled from all retail outlets.", "However, the capabilities of any foodborne disease surveillance system are limited. Surveillance systems can detect only a fraction of disease cases because not all people who contract foodborne diseases actually seek treatment, are properly diagnosed, have their diagnoses confirmed through laboratory analysis, and then have their cases reported through the surveillance systems.", "In this context, you asked us to (1) describe CDC\u2019s foodborne disease surveillance systems and (2) identify limitations of these systems, as well as any initiatives designed to address them. To accomplish these objectives, we examined CDC\u2019s surveillance systems and sent questionnaires to public health officials in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and New York City to determine their level of participation in and opinions about the systems. Appendix I contains the questionnaire, which addressed those surveillance systems that focus on foodborne disease and cover more than one pathogen. It also addressed CDC\u2019s two primary databases that support these systems."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Surveillance of foodborne diseases allows public health officials to recognize trends, detect outbreaks, pinpoint the causes of these outbreaks, and develop effective prevention and control measures. Such surveillance presents a complex challenge. Many foods today are imported, prepared and/or eaten outside the home, and widely distributed after processing. As a result, an outbreak of foodborne disease can involve people in different localities, states, and even countries. The number and diversity of foodborne diseases further complicate surveillance. Although many of the more well-known foodborne pathogens are bacteria, such as E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella, foodborne diseases are caused by a variety of other pathogens, including viruses, parasites, and toxins. Some of these diseases also can be transmitted by nonfood sources, such as through water or through person-to-person contact. Appendix II describes the major foodborne diseases currently under national surveillance.", "The surveillance process usually begins when a person with a foodborne disease seeks medical care. To help determine the cause of the patient\u2019s illness, a physician may rely on a laboratory test, which could be performed in the physician\u2019s own office, a hospital, an independent clinical laboratory, or a public health laboratory. If the test shows that the patient is ill with a disease (including a foodborne disease) that must be reported under state law, or if the physician diagnoses the disease without the use of a test, the cases are usually reported to the local health department. Health department staff collect these reports, check them for completeness, contact health-care professionals to obtain missing information or clarify unclear responses, and forward them to state health agencies. Staff resources devoted to disease reporting vary with the overall size and mission of the health department. Because nearly half of local health agencies have jurisdiction over a population of fewer than 25,000, many cannot support a large, specialized staff to work on disease reporting.", "The states have principal responsibility for protecting the public\u2019s health and therefore take the lead in conducting surveillance. In state health departments, epidemiologists analyze the data reported and decide when and how to supplement passive reporting with active surveillance methods, conduct outbreak and other disease investigations, and design and evaluate disease prevention and control efforts. They also transmit state data to CDC, providing routine reporting on selected diseases.", "Surveillance data are transmitted to CDC both electronically and using paper-based systems. Information about individual cases of disease is reported through two electronic systems. The National Electronic Telecommunications System for Surveillance collects data submitted by epidemiologists about patient demographics and residences, suspected or confirmed diagnoses, and the dates of disease onset. In contrast, the second system, the Public Health Laboratory Information System, collects more definitive data from public health laboratory officials on pathogens identified by laboratory tests. Both systems also offer disease-specific reporting options that states may use to report additional data to CDC. For some surveillance systems, such as the Viral Hepatitis Surveillance Program, data are submitted to CDC both electronically and using paper forms. For other surveillance systems, such as the Foodborne Disease Outbreak Surveillance System, the data are submitted primarily through paper reporting. CDC officials told us they have an ongoing effort to integrate public heath information collected through these and other systems. They estimate this effort will take several years to complete.", "Federal participation in the foodborne disease surveillance network focuses on CDC activities\u2014particularly those of the National Center for Infectious Diseases. CDC analyzes the data furnished by states to (1) monitor national health trends, (2) formulate and implement prevention strategies, (3) evaluate state and federal disease prevention efforts, and (4) identify outbreaks that affect multiple jurisdictions, such as more than one state. CDC routinely provides public health officials, medical personnel, and others information on disease trends and analyses of outbreaks.", "In fiscal year 2000, CDC\u2019s budget for foodborne disease surveillance through the Food Safety Initiative was $29 million. In order to maximize the effectiveness of its surveillance efforts, CDC works with the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, a professional association of public health epidemiologists from each U.S. state and territory. They are responsible for monitoring trends in health and health problems and devising prevention programs that promote the entire community\u2019s health. The council is currently in its eighth year of a cooperative agreement with the CDC and has approximately 15 separate activities on which they work collaboratively with the CDC. CDC also works with the Association of Public Health Laboratories, which links local, state, national, and global health leaders in order to promote the highest quality laboratory practices worldwide.", "However, regardless of the completeness and comprehensiveness of a surveillance system, it can generally detect only a fraction of disease cases\u2014the tip of the iceberg, at best, as shown in figure 1.", "Very few people who contract foodborne diseases actually seek treatment, are properly diagnosed, have their diagnoses confirmed through laboratory analysis, and then have their cases reported through the surveillance systems. For example, a recent CDC-sponsored study estimated that 340 million annual episodes of acute diarrheal illness occurred in the United States, but only 7 percent of people who were ill sought treatment. The study further estimated that physicians requested laboratory testing of a stool culture for only 22 percent of those patients who sought treatment, which produced about 6 million test results that could be reported.", "Although federal participation in foodborne disease surveillance focuses on CDC activities, two other federal agencies have a key role in the wider arena of food safety and use surveillance information in their programs. USDA\u2019s Food Safety and Inspection Service is responsible for ensuring that meat, poultry, and processed egg products moving in interstate and foreign commerce are safe. This agency primarily carries out its responsibilities through inspections at meat, poultry, and egg processing plants to ensure that these products are safe, wholesome, and accurately labeled. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration in the Department of Health and Human Services is responsible for ensuring that all other domestic and imported food products are safe. Unlike the USDA, the Food and Drug Administration, by and large, conducts post-market surveillance through domestic inspections and testing of products already in commerce to assure that foods are safe and comply with appropriate standards. This is especially true for imported foods where the surveillance program is primarily post-market testing, because the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act does not provide explicit inspection authority outside the United States. In addition to their other duties, these two agencies work to remove from the market foods that are implicated in foodborne disease outbreaks."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CDC Foodborne Disease Surveillance Systems Provide National Data Needed to Prevent and Control the Spread of Foodborne Disease", "paragraphs": ["CDC conducts surveillance of foodborne diseases through 20 systems. Four of these\u2014the Foodborne Disease Outbreak Surveillance System, FoodNet, PulseNet, and the Surveillance Outbreak Detection Algorithm\u2014 focus on foodborne diseases and cover multiple pathogens. The other 16 either collect data about a variety of diseases, only some of which are foodborne, or focus exclusively on a single foodborne disease. Collectively, these systems provide information to detect and control the spread of foodborne disease.", "The Foodborne Disease Outbreak Surveillance System collects nationwide information about the occurrence and causes of foodborne outbreaks. This system relies on local health officials to correctly identify, investigate, and report outbreaks to CDC through state public health officials. CDC uses the system to, among other things, compile and periodically report national outbreak data. In 1997, the latest year for which published data are available, states and U. S. territories reported 806 outbreaks to CDC through this system. Furthermore, information from this system can serve as a basis for regulatory and other changes to improve food safety. For example, data from the Foodborne Disease Outbreak Surveillance System has played an important role in documenting the importance of shell eggs as a source of human infection with Salmonella Enteritidis. In response to this data and other reports pointing out the dangers posed by improperly handled eggs, government agencies and the egg industry have taken steps to reduce Salmonella contamination of eggs. These steps include refrigerating eggs during transport from the producer to the consumer, identifying and removing infected laying flocks, diverting eggs from infected flocks to pasteurization facilities, and increasing on-farm quality assurance and sanitation measures. CDC has advised state health departments, hospitals, and nursing homes of specific measures to reduce Salmonella Enteritidis infection, and the USDA tests the breeder flocks that produce egg-laying chickens to ensure that they are free of Salmonella Enteritidis. The Food and Drug Administration has amended its regulations, which now require that all shell eggs in retail establishments be held at a temperature of 45 degrees Fahrenheit or lower and that all egg cartons carry safe-handling instructions to inform consumers about proper storage and cooking of eggs.", "FoodNet is a surveillance system operating in nine sites selected by CDC on the basis of their capability to conduct active surveillance and because of their geographic location. FoodNet produces a more stable and accurate national estimate than is otherwise available of the frequency and sources of nine foodborne pathogens, hemolytic uremic syndrome (a serious complication of E. coli O157:H7 infection), Guillain-Barre syndrome (a serious complication of Campylobacter infection), and toxoplasmosis. These improved estimates result from the use of active surveillance and additional studies that are not characteristic of CDC\u2019s other foodborne surveillance systems. Public health departments who participate in FoodNet receive funds from CDC to systematically contact laboratories in their geographical areas and solicit incidence data. In 1999, state officials participating in FoodNet contacted each of the more than 300 clinical labs within the FoodNet areas on a regular basis. FoodNet studies include various \u201ccase control\u201d studies, which are used to determine factors, such as food preparation or handling practices, that affect the risk of infection by pathogens covered by the system. The studies also examine the association between infections and specific foods. In addition, public health officials that participate in FoodNet conduct surveys to identify physician and lab practices that may limit the identification of foodborne diseases.", "PulseNet is a nationwide network of public health laboratories that perform DNA \u201cfingerprinting\u201d on four types of foodborne bacteria in order to identify and investigate potential outbreaks. The four bacteria fingerprinted by PulseNet\u2014Salmonella, E. coli O157:H7, Listeria, and Shigella\u2014were selected because of their public health importance and the availability of specific \u201cfingerprinting\u201d methods for the pathogens. These four bacteria are either common or have severe symptoms, or both. Public health officials in 46 state and 2 local public health laboratories as well as the food safety laboratories of the USDA and the Food and Drug Administration submit \u201cfingerprint\u201d patterns of bacteria isolated from patients and/or contaminated food to the PulseNet database. The PulseNet network permits rapid comparison of the patterns in the database. Matches may indicate an outbreak. Similar patterns in samples taken from different patients suggest that the bacteria come from a common source, for example, a widely distributed contaminated food product. In addition, strains isolated from food products can be compared with those isolated from ill persons to provide evidence that a specific food caused the disease. By identifying these connections, PulseNet provides critical data for identifying and controlling the source of an outbreak, thus reducing the burden of foodborne disease for the pathogens within the scope of this network. Thirty survey respondents told us that, in the last 3 years, PulseNet had identified a cluster of cases in their state that turned out to be a previously unknown outbreak. In addition, 42 respondents reported that PulseNet helped their state detect and investigate outbreaks of E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella, Listeria, and/or Shigella. Twenty-five of these said that PulseNet greatly helped in this area. In 2000, over 17,000 patterns were submitted to the PulseNet database, and 105 potential outbreaks were identified and investigated.", "Another system that CDC uses to detect potential foodborne outbreaks is the Surveillance Outbreak Detection Algorithm. In contrast to PulseNet, which uses advanced technology to compare bacterial DNA, the Surveillance Outbreak Detection Algorithm uses statistical analysis to compare currently reported incidence of two common pathogens, Salmonella and Shigella, to a historical baseline in order to detect unusual increases in a specific serotype, such as Salmonella Enteritidis. Such increases may indicate an outbreak. CDC selected Salmonella and Shigella because there are many different serotypes of these organisms, and tracking and comparing the frequency of each serotype was a task well suited for computer analysis. In addition, baseline data for these two pathogens were already available through the National Salmonella Surveillance System and the National Shigella Surveillance System, described below and in appendix III. Beginning in 2002, CDC plans to expand the system to include E. coli O157:H7. Twenty-five of the states that we surveyed told us that in their state, at least once in the last 3 years the Surveillance Outbreak Detection Algorithm had identified a cluster of cases in their state that turned out to be a previously unknown outbreak.", "In addition to these 4 systems, CDC also has the following 16 systems that either collect information about a number of diseases, only some of which are foodborne, or focus solely on one disease:   The Botulism Surveillance System is a national system designed to collect information about all types of botulism, including foodborne. Because every case of foodborne botulism is considered a public health emergency, CDC maintains intensive surveillance for botulism in the United States.", "The CaliciNet is a network of public health laboratories that perform genetic \u201cfingerprinting\u201d for foodborne viruses, allowing rapid identification and comparison of strains.", "The Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Surveillance Program monitors the occurrence of this disease through periodic review of national cause-of- death data. Surveillance for this disease was enhanced in 1996 to monitor for the possible occurrence of new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease after this new form of the disease was reported to have possibly resulted from consumption of cattle products contaminated with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (also known as \u201cmad cow\u201d disease).", "The Epidemic Information Exchange (Epi-X) is a secure Web-based communications network that allows local, state, and federal public health officials to share and discuss outbreak data on a real-time basis.

The system currently operates in 17 sites throughout the United States.", "The National Giardiasis Surveillance System includes data from participating states about reported cases of giardiasis\u2014a condition caused by a parasite found in contaminated water or food such as fruits and vegetables. This system began in 1992, when the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists assigned giardiasis a code that enabled states to begin voluntarily reporting surveillance data on this disease to CDC electronically.", "The National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System is a national system that collects information about 58 diseases, most of which are not considered foodborne, about which regular, frequent, and timely information is considered necessary for their prevention and control. Data from the system are used to analyze disease trends and determine relative disease burdens on a national basis.", "The National Salmonella Surveillance System is a national system that collects information on the isolates of Salmonella that are serotyped in state public health laboratories, as well as the isolates from food and animals. This system tracks the frequency of more than 500 specific serotypes to determine trends, detect outbreaks, and focus interventions. The system can detect outbreaks either locally or spread out over several jurisdictions.", "The National Shigella Surveillance System is a national system that collects information on the isolates of Shigella that are serotyped in state public health laboratories. This system tracks the frequency of more than 40 specific serotypes to determine trends, detect outbreaks, and focus interventions. The system can detect outbreaks either locally or spread out over several jurisdictions.", "The Salmonella Enteritidis Outbreak Surveillance System is a national system designed to track these outbreaks and to collect information on implicated food items and the results of traceback investigations conducted by local agencies and the Food and Drug Administration.", "The Sentinel Counties Study of Viral Hepatitis is carried out in six U.S. counties to elicit more detailed information on individual hepatitis cases and collect samples for further analyses.", "The Trichinellosis Surveillance System is a national surveillance system used to monitor long-term trends for this disease.", "The Typhoid Fever Surveillance System is a national surveillance system for monitoring long-term trends in the epidemiology of typhoid fever in the United States. The system provides information about risk factors that is used in making vaccine recommendations.", "The Vibrio Surveillance System is composed of two parts: a national system used for reporting cases of Vibrio cholerae (cholera), and another system, which is more geographically limited, that is used for reporting all Vibrio infections. All cases reported to this system are confirmed through laboratory tests by the relevant state or CDC. Surveillance data for this system are used to identify environmental risk factors, retail food outlets where high-risk exposures occur, and target groups that may benefit from consumer education.", "The Viral Hepatitis Surveillance Program is a national system designed to collect information about acute cases of viral hepatitis: hepatitis A; hepatitis B; and non-A, non-B hepatitis (including hepatitis C). States report basic demographic information for each case, as well as other factors, such as risk-factor information. These data are essential for monitoring trends in the characteristics of the various types of viral hepatitis.", "Collectively, these surveillance systems provide crucial national data needed to detect and control the spread of foodborne disease.

Some of these problems have resulted from staff shortages at CDC, while others have been caused by shortages of trained epidemiologists and laboratory personnel at state and local health departments. Another contributing factor is that each state decides which diseases it will track and which ones it will not. Therefore, the diseases that are reported to CDC vary from one state to another. In response to these problems, CDC has taken action to address its staff deficiencies and to assist state and local health officials to improve their data collection and reporting abilities. CDC\u2019s actions represent a good first step toward providing public health officials with more timely and complete surveillance data."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Delayed Reporting", "paragraphs": ["Delayed dissemination of information from CDC\u2019s foodborne disease surveillance systems has impaired the usefulness of the data. For example, for the Foodborne Disease Outbreak Surveillance System, CDC did not publish outbreak data for the years 1993\u20131997 until March 2000. CDC officials told us that the late publication of the March 2000 outbreak report was due in part to staff shortages. As of June 2001, data from 1997 was the most recent available from this system. Officials from both the Food and Drug Administration and USDA\u2019s Food Safety and Inspection Service told us that this delay limited the data\u2019s usefulness. In addition, of the 52 respondents to our survey, 26 said that the 3-year lag between the end of the reporting period and the publication of CDC\u2019s March 2000 report diminished the usefulness of the report to their state. Of the 43 survey respondents that used this report, nearly all said that the outbreak data was used as a source of information about foodborne disease trends or to determine associations between pathogens and food.", "Many survey respondents also told us that more rapid reporting or release of data from FoodNet, PulseNet, and the Surveillance Outbreak Detection Algorithm would improve the systems\u2019 usefulness. For FoodNet, CDC publishes surveillance results annually. However, as of June 2001, CDC had not published any detailed results from its case control studies about the proportion of foodborne disease caused by specific foods or food preparation and handling practices, even though FoodNet has been operational since 1995. CDC officials told us that they had submitted the results of these surveys and studies to professional journals, but the results were never published. For PulseNet, nearly half of the survey respondents said that more rapid analysis of data and more rapid reporting of identified clusters would make the system more useful. In addition, 33 of the respondents said that direct access to the PulseNet database would make the system more useful. For the Surveillance Outbreak Detection Algorithm, 25 of the respondents said that more rapid analysis of state, regional, and national data by CDC would make that system more useful. In addition, 20 respondents said more rapid reporting of clusters by CDC would make the system more useful.", "CDC officials told us that the late publication of the March 2000 outbreak report was due in part to staff shortages. CDC took action to address this problem when the agency hired four new staff between June 2000 and September 2000 to take on the responsibilities of collecting, verifying, coding, processing, and summarizing the outbreak data in addition to other duties. In the future, CDC plans to release outbreak data annually beginning with 1998 data, instead of aggregating these data over several years. CDC is currently compiling 2001 outbreak data and intends to publish it by the end of 2002. In addition, CDC is developing a system, called the Electronic Foodborne Outbreak Reporting System, which will allow states to electronically transmit reports of foodborne disease outbreaks. Thirty-six survey respondents indicated that this system would increase the timeliness of their initial outbreak reports to CDC. Finally, in November 2000 CDC introduced an electronic bulletin board, known as Epi-X, which allows local, state, and federal public health officials to share outbreak data on a real-time basis. This system can automatically notify health officials of urgent public health events so that they can take appropriate actions.", "CDC also has plans to provide more rapid reporting or release of data from FoodNet and PulseNet. For FoodNet, CDC officials said they plan to publish by the end of 2001 a number of case control study results that were previously unavailable. For PulseNet, CDC told us it has developed new software that, effective June 30, 2001, gives all participating certified laboratories direct access to the PulseNet database. This allows state officials to query the PulseNet database directly instead of waiting for CDC to send them notice of a new pattern.", "However, CDC\u2019s ability to disseminate surveillance data in a timely fashion also depends in part on the timeliness of state and local officials\u2019 submittal of the data. For example, for the Foodborne Disease Outbreak Surveillance System, 24 of the survey respondents said they did not report any outbreak data for 2000 until the end of the year or even later. Thus, data could be over a year old before it gets reported to CDC. Similarly, CDC officials also told us that for the Surveillance Outbreak Detection Algorithm, some states report information only quarterly, which is too late to allow CDC to provide early detection of an ongoing outbreak. Because responsibility for surveillance of foodborne diseases rests primarily with the states, states\u2019 reporting of data to CDC is voluntary. To assist in overcoming this problem, CDC is developing a new program known as the National Electronic Disease Surveillance System. This system is intended to facilitate the ready exchange of data between local and state health departments, among states, and among states and CDC. While this may not overcome delayed reporting by the states, it should make information more readily available. In addition, through their Epidemic Intelligence Service program, CDC is training medical doctors, researchers, and scientists, who serve in 2-year assignments, about the needs of both state health departments and CDC.

Moreover, for those outbreaks that were reported, 25 survey respondents said the responsible pathogen was identified in only half or fewer of their reports submitted to CDC. Further, as regards the contaminated food item that caused the outbreaks, 28 survey respondents said they identified and reported the responsible food item in half or fewer of their reports. According to FDA and FSIS officials, identifying the responsible pathogen and the contaminated food item is critical for understanding and controlling foodborne disease, and for tracing the cause of the contaminant to its original source.", "Survey respondents cited several reasons for the gaps in outbreak information sent to CDC. Table 1 summarizes some of the major reasons.", "As the table shows, the majority of the respondents said shortages of personnel and capacity in state and local health departments, among other things, hinder their ability to detect and investigate foodborne disease outbreaks. A complete listing of conditions that could hinder state and local public health officials is included in our questionnaire results, contained in appendix I.", "Another cause of incomplete data submissions to the Foodborne Disease Outbreak Surveillance System, as well as to other systems, is the lack of standard disease reporting requirements among states. Each state has a separate list of \u201creportable\u201d diseases that must be reported to the state health department. The lists vary greatly from state to state because of differences in the extent to which the diseases occur. For example, while 32 survey respondents indicated that health providers in their state are required to notify state or local health departments about cases of cyclosporiasis, 19 said notification was not required. (See app. I for more information on state reporting requirements for a number of foodborne pathogens.) Although states can forward data to CDC about diseases that are not reportable, overall data about such diseases are often incomplete because of deficiencies in reporting by physicians and labs.", "To improve local and state health officials\u2019 ability to respond to a broad range of public health issues relating to infectious diseases, which include foodborne outbreaks, CDC provides funding to state and local health departments through its Emerging Infections Programs and its Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity program. Funding for these two programs has increased from $900,000 in 1994 to approximately $50 million in 2001. These programs are designed to address staffing or technology shortages, or both, and will help the states provide CDC with more complete information. For example, states have received grants to significantly increase the capacity of their laboratories. According to CDC officials, now nearly every state has properly trained staff able to use PulseNet technology.", "To encourage more standardized reporting among the states, CDC consults annually with the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists to determine which infectious diseases, including foodborne diseases, are important enough to merit routine reporting to CDC.

As a result of our initial work, we then directed the remainder of our review effort to four surveillance systems that focus on foodborne disease and that cover more than one pathogen. These four systems were the Foodborne Disease Outbreak Surveillance System, FoodNet, PulseNet, and the Surveillance Outbreak Detection Algorithm. We reviewed extensive literature about each of these four systems and examined the systems\u2019 input and reporting documentation.", "To identify limitations of these surveillance systems, we sent mail-back questionnaires to officials in the 50 state health departments, as well as in the District of Columbia, and New York City. We pretested this survey in three states to ensure that our questions were clear, unbiased, and precise, and that responding to the survey did not place an undue burden on the health departments. We received completed questionnaires from 100 percent of those surveyed.
