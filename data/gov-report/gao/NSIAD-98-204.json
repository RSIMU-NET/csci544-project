DOD refers to this as migration of funds. According to DOD, the chronic erosion of procurement funding has three general sources: underestimated day-to-day operating costs, unrealized savings from initiatives such as outsourcing or business process reengineering, and new program demands. The QDR concluded that as much as $10 billion to $12 billion per year in future procurement funding could be redirected as a result of these three general sources. The QDR also identifies other areas of significant future cost risks.", "To address this financial instability, the QDR directed DOD to cut some force structure and personnel, eliminate additional excess facilities through more base closures and realignments, streamline infrastructure, and reduce quantities of some new weapon systems. By taking these actions, the Secretary of Defense intended that the 1999 budget and FYDP would be fiscally executable, modernization targets would be met, the overall defense program would be rebalanced, and the program would become more stable.", "During the QDR, DOD identified initiatives to reduce infrastructure costs and personnel. However, even as the QDR report was released, the Department acknowledged that more could be done. The Department\u2019s November 1997 Defense Reform Initiative Report provided a second set of initiatives to streamline and improve DOD\u2019s infrastructure and support activities.

Currently, cost growth in one program requires offsets from other programs, which in turn can disrupt the overall modernization program. DOD\u2019s plan is to distribute the reserve among programs for the budget year before a President\u2019s budget is submitted to Congress. The service acquisition executives centrally will manage the reserves, and the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology will provide oversight. These reserve funds total $2.4 billion for 2000-2003. Between 2000 and 2003, approximately $2.3 billion, or 97 percent, of the funding is programmed in procurement accounts for the Army, Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps. The remaining 3 percent is programmed in the defense-wide research, development, test, and evaluation account. Table 2 shows the allocation of these funds, by year.", "As stated in a recent report on weapon acquisitions, we have not evaluated the program stability reserve or the way DOD plans to implement it. Nonetheless, DOD\u2019s use of the reserve has the potential for communicating to program managers which practices will be encouraged and which ones will not. For example, if the reserve funds are used primarily to pay for problems that are revealed in late product development or early production, the fund could reinforce existing incentives for not dealing with problems until they occur. Conversely, if the fund is used to resolve and preclude problems, the fund could encourage problems to be revealed earlier in programs.", "The 1999 FYDP increased National Missile Defense System research, development, test, and evaluation funding by $1.4 billion, or 75 percent ($1.8 billion to $3.2 billion), from the 1998 FYDP.

The projected cuts and savings are as a result of the QDR and are in addition to those previously planned.", "The 1999 FYDP does not include all the personnel cuts directed by the QDR. With the exception of the Air Force, the services have plans that should enable them to achieve the majority of their active military cuts by the end of 1999. OSD determined that some of the Air Force\u2019s active military cuts announced in May 1997 to restructure fighter squadrons and consolidate bomber squadrons should not be included in the 1999 FYDP because the plans were not executable at this time.", "In addition, plans for some cuts included in the 1999 FYDP are still incomplete or based on optimistic assumptions. For example, there is no agreement within the Army on how 25,000 of the 45,000 reserve cuts will be allocated. This decision on how to allocate the reserve cuts will not be made before the next force structure review. Moreover, plans to achieve savings through outsourcing and reengineering may not be implemented by 2003 as originally anticipated. For example, the Army plans to compete 48,000 positions to achieve the majority of its civilian reductions. However, according to an Army official, those reductions cannot be completed by 2003. Although it announced studies covering about 14,000 positions, it has not identified the specific functions or location of the remaining positions to be studied. In addition, the Army\u2019s plan to eliminate about 5,300 civilian personnel in the Army Materiel Command through reengineering efforts involves risk because the Command does not have specific plans to achieve these reductions. Although outsourcing is only a small part of the Navy\u2019s QDR cuts, the Navy has an aggressive outsourcing program that involves risk. Specifically, the Navy has programmed savings of $2.5 billion in the 1999 FYDP based on plans to study 80,500 positions\u201410,000 military and 70,500 civilian\u2014by 2003. Moreover, the Navy has not identified the majority of the specific functions that will be studied to achieve the expected savings. According to a Navy acquisition official, the Navy\u2019s ambitious projected outsourcing savings may not materialize, thereby jeopardizing its long-term O&M and procurement plans.", "OSD recognizes that personnel cuts and the planned savings from those cuts have not always been achieved, which contribute to the migration of procurement funding. Therefore, OSD has established two principal mechanisms for monitoring the services\u2019 progress in reducing personnel positions. First, it expects to review the services\u2019 plans for reducing personnel positions during annual reviews of the services\u2019 budgets. Second, the Defense Management Council will monitor the services\u2019 progress in meeting outsourcing goals.", "DOD\u2019s plans are based on the assumption that Congress will modify the permanent statutory minimum end-strength levels. These personnel levels, or floors, require the services to collectively employ at least 1,414,590 active duty military personnel. This assumption risks the execution of DOD plans. If Congress does not lower the floors, costs for military personnel will be substantially higher. Currently, DOD plans to have 1,396,000 active duty military personnel in 1999, but if the services must retain about 19,000 personnel to meet the floors, they would need about $1.1 billion more in 1999 military personnel funds. Furthermore, costs to meet the floors in 2000-2003 would be higher because DOD projects lower end-strength levels than currently permitted by law. Notably, in 2003, DOD projects 1,366,000 personnel\u2014about 49,000 below current statutory floors. If DOD is precluded from implementing its planned personnel reductions, it would have to make other compensating adjustments to its overall program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Unprogrammed Bills Could Lead to Higher O&M Costs", "paragraphs": ["The QDR reported that unprogrammed expenses arise that displace funding previously planned for procurement. The most predictable of these expenses are underestimated costs in day-to-day operations, especially for depot maintenance, real property maintenance, and medical care. The least predictable are unplanned deployments and smaller-scale contingencies.", "The services and defense agencies plan to obligate $73 billion for depot maintenance between 1999 and 2003. This estimate, despite its magnitude, does not allow the defense agencies and services to achieve OSD\u2019s goal of funding 85 percent of their maintenance requirements during 1999-2003. According to DOD, the potential liability of unfunded depot maintenance in the 1999 FYDP is $300 million per year. For example, the Army\u2014which added $362 million between 1999 and 2003\u2014is projected to meet only 68 percent of its depot maintenance requirements in 1999 and 79 percent by 2003.", "Despite four base realignment and closure rounds, DOD still has excess, aging facilities and has not programmed sufficient funds for maintenance, repair, and upgrades. Each service has risk embedded in its real property maintenance program to the extent that validated real property needs are not met. For example, in the 1999 President\u2019s budget submission, the Air Force plans to fund real property maintenance at the preventive or preservation maintenance level in 1999, which allows only for day-to-day recurring maintenance. This results in risk because the physical plant is degraded and the backlog of maintenance and repair requirements increases. Also, while the Marine Corps added funds during 1999-2003, the Commandant of the Marine Corps determined that the planned funding would merely minimize deterioration of its facilities. Further, although the Army added approximately $1 billion for real property maintenance in the 1999 FYDP, it was not projected to meet its funding goal until 2002.", "According to a Defense Health Affairs official, the cumulative O&M funding increase of $1.6 billion over the 1998 FYDP adequately funds the core medical mission, which is comprised of 2 parts, direct care and managed care contracts. However, the 1999 FYDP funding is contingent on several assumptions that contain risk. First, the Defense Health Program assumes program-related personnel reductions due to outsourcing and privatization initiatives. Estimated savings for these efforts grow to $131 million by 2003. Second, the program assumes a 1-percent savings from utilization management, such as reducing the length of hospital stays from 4 days to 3 days. Third, population adjustments due to force structure reductions play a pivotal role. The projected program assumes that Congress will authorize QDR recommended reductions of 61,700 active military personnel and the reductions will be a mix of retirements and nonretirement attrition. If end-strength reductions are not authorized or a higher percentage of the reduction stems from retirements than originally planned, the program will experience higher costs than estimated. Without the authority to reduce active duty end strengths, the beneficiary population of service personnel and their dependents will not decrease. In addition, retirements do not reduce costs because retirees and their dependents remain part of the beneficiary population. According to a Defense Health Affairs official, the funded program does not include an allowance for the impact of advances in medical technology and the intensity of treatment that was identified in a previous GAO report as a risk factor.", "Our recent work raises questions about whether cost savings and efficiencies in defense health care will materialize. In August 1997, we reported that a key cost-saving initiative of TRICARE, DOD\u2019s new managed health care system, was returning substantially less savings than anticipated and the situation was not likely to improve. In our February 1998 testimony to Congress, we stated that implementation of TRICARE was proving complicated and difficult and that delays had occurred and may continue.", "Notwithstanding the historical costs of several, often overlapping contingency operations, the 1999 FYDP provides funds only for the projected \u201csteady state\u201d costs of Southwest Asia operations\u2014$800 million in 1999. According to OSD officials, by design the FYDP does not include funds for (1) the sustainment of increased operations in the Persian Gulf to counter Iraq\u2019s intransigence on United Nations inspections, (2) the President\u2019s extension of the mission in Bosnia, or (3) unknown contingency operations. DOD\u2019s position is that costs for the mission in Bosnia should be financed separately from planned DOD funding for 1999-2003. Further, the QDR concluded that contingency operations will likely occur frequently over the next 15 to 20 years and may require significant forces, given the national security strategy of engagement and the probable future international environment.

In the 1998 FYDP, the Air Force estimated net savings at $253 million, whereas in the 1999 FYDP it projects net savings at $85 million\u2014a difference of $167 million.

Compounding these funding difficulties is the fact that these projections are very conservative. The projections do not allow for real program cost growth, which historically has averaged at least 20 percent, nor do the projections allow for the procurement of additional systems. However, as a result of the QDR, the 1999 FYDP service aircraft procurement accounts have been moderated.

We continue to find programs with optimistic cost projections. For example, we reported in June 1997 that we were skeptical the Air Force could achieve planned production cost reductions of $13 billion in its F-22 fighter aircraft program.", "Other DOD programs have also experienced cost growth. For example, DOD estimated in December 1997 that the projected life-cycle cost of the Chemical Demilitarization Program had increased by 27 percent over the previous year\u2019s estimate. As stated earlier, DOD has established a reserve fund that can be used to help alleviate disruptions caused by cost growth in weapon systems and other programs due to technological problems. However, it remains to be seen whether the need will exceed available reserve funds.", "Policy decisions and new program demands can also cause perturbations in DOD\u2019s funding plans, according to the QDR report. DOD has programmed $1.4 billion more for the National Missile Defense System in the 1999 FYDP than the 1998 FYDP. Despite the increase, considerable risk remains with the program\u2019s funding. For example, technical and schedule risks are very high, according to the QDR, our analysis, and an independent panel. The panel noted that based on its experience, high technical risk is likely to cause increased costs and program delays and could cause program failure. In addition to the technical and schedule risks, the 1999 FYDP does not include funds to procure the missile system. If the decision is made in 2000 to deploy an initial missile system by 2003, billions of dollars of procurement funds would be required to augment the currently programmed research and development funds.", "As another example, the 1999 FYDP was predicated on the U.S. shifting to a Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) II nuclear force posture. START II calls for further reductions in aggregate force levels, the elimination of multiple-warhead intercontinental ballistic missile launchers, the elimination of heavy intercontinental ballistic missiles, and a limit on the number of submarine-launched ballistic missile warheads. START II was approved by the U.S. Senate in January 1996 but is pending enforcement until ratification by Russia\u2019s parliament. In the absence of START II enforcement, the United States may decide to sustain the option of continuing START I force levels. According to the Secretary of Defense\u2019s 1998 Annual Report to the President and the Congress, the 1999 budget request includes an additional $57 million beyond what otherwise would have been requested to sustain the START I level. However, maintaining this force beyond 1999 will result in additional unplanned costs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Recently, DOD has found itself in a counterproductive cycle. Past attempts at streamlining infrastructure and/or reengineering business practices have not produced the anticipated savings programmed in recent FYDPs. Money saved from these initiatives was to help fund modernization. For the past 5 years, projected procurement funding has slipped with each succeeding FYDP. Moreover, unanticipated contingency costs, higher day-to-day operating expenses, and new program demands also have caused the migration of funds from procurement to operating and support costs. In the QDR, DOD specified this problem, identified its causes, and directed measures to make the program more stable. In the 1999 FYDP, DOD has taken a step toward abating this chronic migration of funds. However, even with a rebalanced program, DOD faces substantial risk in its execution of this first, post-QDR plan. We found that several of DOD\u2019s projections are questionable and/or contain risk. Furthermore, as long as the national defense funding levels agreed to in the balanced budget agreement remain unaltered, solutions to DOD\u2019s funding issues must be found within its current and projected budget. Therefore, it is critical that DOD continues to strive for realistic assumptions and plans in its future budget cycles."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In commenting on a draft of this report, DOD took issue with some of our characterizations. DOD stated that the 1999 FYDP represents considerable progress toward the objectives of funding readiness-related O&M requirements, implementing plans to streamline and reduce infrastructure, and reducing the risk of migrating funds. DOD noted that our report does not acknowledge that the risks in achieving these objectives have been substantially reduced in the 1999 FYDP and the Department\u2019s program is on a sounder financial footing. Moreover, DOD acknowledges that all risks have not been eliminated and intends to pursue future initiatives to address the remaining risks. We agree, as stated in our report, that DOD made adjustments from the 1998 FYDP to the 1999 FYDP to increase O&M and decrease the risk that funds would migrate from procurement to operating expenses. Moreover, it has plans to reduce infrastructure. However, as explained in this report, we continue to see risks that DOD\u2019s program may not be executable as planned in part because the services\u2019 plans to reduce military and civilian personnel are incomplete or based on optimistic assumptions.", "DOD said that it has been able to reduce the proportion of resources devoted to infrastructure activities from 47 percent in 1994 to 45 percent in 1997, as a percent of total obligation authority. Moreover, DOD states that we are inaccurate in reporting that infrastructure in 1997 remains at 59 percent of DOD\u2019s total budget, the same percentage as in 1994. Our method of calculating the infrastructure in DOD\u2019s budget is based on the methodology prescribed by OSD\u2019s Office of Program Analysis and Evaluation (PA&E) in late 1995. We have consistently used this methodology since then to report on DOD\u2019s progress in reducing its infrastructure and DOD has agreed with our prior reports, findings, and analysis. The methodology includes both direct infrastructure (that which can be clearly identified in the FYDP) and a percentage of the defense working capital funds that represents the infrastructure portion of these funds.", "In discussing DOD\u2019s comments with PA&E officials, they stated that for a number of reasons, including the difficulty of estimating the infrastructure portion of defense working capital funds, PA&E is evaluating different methodologies to estimate infrastructure in its budget. One such measure, which DOD used to derive the percentages discussed in its letter, is to estimate only the direct infrastructure. However, there are important limitations in this methodology. While it is a simpler methodology, it excludes a significant part of the infrastructure, which PA&E previously considered important to capture. Moreover, DOD established an important baseline in its October 1993 bottom-up review report when it said that infrastructure activities in 1994 would account for approximately 59 percent of DOD\u2019s total obligational authority (including revolving funds) and that it needed to reduce that infrastructure. We strongly believe that it is important to maintain a consistent baseline to measure changes in infrastructure over time.", "DOD believes that its assumptions of the savings rates for outsourcing personnel are conservative. According to DOD, the estimated savings reflected in the 1999 FYDP assume that the Department successfully executes the currently projected schedule of competitions. Moreover, DOD emphasizes that it needs to closely monitor implementation of projected competition schedules through the programming and budgeting cycles. We believe DOD has taken a step in the right direction to monitor implementation of the outsourcing process. However, considerable risk remains in the services\u2019 plans to cut planned personnel by 2003 because the plans are still incomplete or based on optimistic assumptions. DOD suggested several technical changes for clarification and accuracy, which we incorporated in the report where appropriate.
