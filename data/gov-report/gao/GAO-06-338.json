Deployment of wireless E911 usually proceeds through two phases: Phase I provides general location information by identifying the cell tower or cell site that is receiving the wireless call. Phase II provides more precise caller-location information, within 50 to 300 meters in most cases. We reported in November 2003, that nearly 65 percent of the more than 6,000 public safety answering points nationwide were capable of receiving Phase I information with wireless 911 calls and 18 percent had implemented Phase II wireless E911 with at least one wireless carrier. Currently, according to the National Emergency Number Association (NENA), nearly 80 percent of public safety answering points are capable of receiving Phase I location information and 57 percent have implemented Phase II for at least one wireless carrier. However, based on our survey results, full implementation is still several years away in many states. In response to our survey, three state E911 contacts reported that it will take more than 5 years to have wireless E911 completely implemented in their states, and five others said that the technology might never be fully implemented in their states. Based on our survey results and NENA data, we found that nearly all states--48 states and the District of Columbia--require the wireless carriers to collect surcharges from their subscribers to cover the costs associated with implementing wireless E911. Responses to our survey showed the per-subscriber surcharges ranged from $0.20 to $3.00 per month. The two states that do not impose surcharges fund E911 through general revenue or the state's Universal Service Fund, which was established to support various telecommunications programs. States have the discretion to determine how they will manage and distribute the funds and we found the management of the funds and methods of disbursement varied. According to our survey results, many of the states that responded have written criteria on the allowable uses of E911 funds. Allowable uses of the E911 funds include purchasing equipment upgrades and software packages. Four state E911 contacts responded to our survey that their states did not use all of the funds collected for E911 on E911 implementation purposes during 2005. Six states, and the District of Columbia, did not respond to our survey so we do not know whether those states used E911 funds or made them available for other purposes. Four other states reported that they were unsure if all E911 funds were used solely for E911 purposes because the funds are collected and managed at the local level. The four states that reported that E911 funds were made available or used for purposes not related to E911 indicated that the E911 funds were transferred to their state's general fund. For example, one state told us that E911 funds were transferred to the general fund to help balance the state budget. Another state reported that some E911 funds were transferred to the state police since they answer emergency calls in some areas of the state."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["According to an industry association, 200 million 911 emergency calls are  placed annually. Another industry association estimates that nearly 82  million 911 calls are placed each year by callers using mobile (wireless)  phones. A capability known as \u201cenhanced 911\u201d (E911) provides emergency  responders with the location of, and a callback number for, a person calling  911. This information facilitates the quick and accurate dispatch of  emergency responders, especially in cases where the caller does not know  or cannot clearly state his or her location (e.g., the caller is suffering from a  heart attack).", "Most areas across the country now have E911 capabilities for traditional  wireline phones, where the caller\u2019s street address automatically appears  on-screen for the 911 call taker. As the use of mobile phones has increased,  Congress and others in the federal government and public safety  communities have grown more concerned that E911 location information  was not often available for those dialing 911 from a mobile phone.  Implementing E911 for mobile phones is inherently more challenging.  Unlike wireline phones, where the phone number is linked to a specific  street address, providing E911 call takers with location information for a  mobile phone involves technologies that must calculate the geographic  coordinates of the caller\u2019s location at the time of the call and display these  coordinates as a location the 911 call taker can understand. Moreover, a  wireless 911 call must be routed along the networks of both a wireless  telephone company and a wireline telephone company before terminating  at a facility where 911 calls are answered, known as a public safety  answering point (PSAP); there are more than 6,000 PSAPs nationwide,  often at a county or city level. All three entities\u2014wireless carriers, wireline  carriers, and PSAPs\u2014must be properly interconnected and have certain  equipment in place in order for location information to be captured, sent,  and displayed to 911 call takers. Deployment usually proceeds through two  phases: Phase I provides general location information by identifying the  cell tower or cell site that is receiving the wireless call and also provides  the phone number of the caller, while Phase II provides more precise caller- location information\u2014within 50 to 300 meters in most cases.", "The Wireless Communications and Public Safety Act of 1999 called on the  Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to encourage and support  efforts by the states to deploy wireless E911 services by working with state  and local officials, the telecommunications industry, consumer groups, and  those involved in public safety services. At the federal level, FCC and the  U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) have taken steps to promote the  deployment of E911 location technologies for mobile phones. According to  FCC, the Commission monitors the deployment of wireless E911 service by  larger carriers, enforces its wireless E911 requirements, and grants  appropriate waivers of its wireless E911 requirements when consistent  with the public interest. FCC further stated that it works with public safety  organizations, wireless carriers, and manufacturers to foster wireless E911  deployment. Also, DOT has recognized the relationship between wireless  E911 services and highway safety and is working with a key  nongovernmental organization, the National Emergency Number  Association (NENA), to develop a PSAP database that tracks E911  implementation. The only federally mandated timeframes for installation  of wireless E911 technologies are those placed on wireless carriers by FCC.  FCC has no authority to place timeframes on PSAPs, which are under state  and local jurisdiction. States and local jurisdictions establish timetables for  implementation by their PSAPs, which must have the necessary equipment  to receive and display location information that the 911 call taker can relay  to police, fire, and rescue services. States must also fund the equipment  upgrades needed by their PSAPs for E911 service.", "The pace of wireless E911 deployment has been a key concern for the  Congress. In our November 2003 report on wireless E911, we noted that the  implementation of wireless E911 was several years away in many states,  raising the prospect of piecemeal availability of this service across the  country for an indefinite number of years to come. We found that the  funding of equipment upgrades at PSAPs was a major issue for many states  and localities and was the largest factor affecting the progress of E911  implementation. Most states had put in place a surcharge on wireless  customers to pay for E911 upgrades to their PSAPs. We found, though, that  some states had redirected these funds to uses that were unrelated to E911.", "Recently, the ENHANCE 911 Act of 2004 authorized a federal grant  program to provide assistance to states, local governments, or tribal  organizations in implementing E911. Recognizing that some states had  used the funds raised for E911 for other purposes, the act (among other  things) stipulated that a state or local government would not be eligible for  a federal E911 grant if it had used its E911 taxes, fees, or charges for  unrelated purposes during the period beginning 180 days immediately  preceding the date of the application and continuing until the funds are  available to the applicant. Furthermore, if the grantee used state or local  E911 funds for unrelated purposes during the term of the grant, the grant  would have to be repaid. The act also called for us to study state and local  use of funds collected for the purpose of wireless E911 implementation.  Accordingly, we are reporting on (1) the progress made in implementing  wireless E911 services throughout the country, (2) the states and localities  that have established taxes, fees, or charges for wireless E911  implementation, and (3) the states or localities that have used funds  collected for the purposes of wireless E911 for unrelated purposes during  2005.", "To address these issues, we collected information from state-level E911  contacts from October 2005 to January 2006 using a Web-based survey. We  designed the survey to cover the collection, management, and use of  wireless E911 funds at the state and local level. Of the 51 state-level E911  contacts (including the District of Columbia) who were asked to  participate in our survey, we received 44 completed questionnaires. We did  not receive completed questionnaires from Alaska, Colorado, the District  of Columbia, Nevada, New York, Oklahoma, and South Dakota.

To assess the  reliability of NENA\u2019s data regarding the number of PSAPs receiving Phase II  data, we interviewed knowledgeable officials from NENA about their data  collection methods. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable  for the purposes of this report. We conducted our review between February  2005 and January 2006 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards.

With wireline E911 service, emergency calls are automatically routed to the appropriate PSAP and the call taker receives  the telephone number and street address of the caller. In 1996, FCC  responded to the rising number of mobile telephone subscribers and the  resulting increase in wireless 911 calls by adopting rules for wireless E911  that established a two-phase implementation approach for the wireless  carriers and set deadlines for wireless carriers regarding their part in E911  deployment. FCC required that (1) by April 1998, or within 6 months of a  request from a PSAP, wireless carriers be prepared to provide the PSAP  with the wireless phone number of the caller and the location of the cell  site receiving the 911 call (Phase I information); and (2) by October 2001, or  within 6 months of receiving a request from a PSAP, wireless carriers be  prepared to provide the PSAP with the geographic coordinates of the  caller\u2019s location with greater precision, generally within 50 to 300 meters  (Phase II information).", "As shown in figure 1, the wireless carriers, local exchange carriers (LECs),  and PSAPs must have appropriate equipment and interconnections for  wireless E911 calls to be sent to and received by PSAPs with the caller\u2019s  location information. For example, wireless carriers must finance the  implementation of a caller location solution and test their equipment to  verify its accuracy. Local exchange carriers are generally responsible for  ensuring that all the necessary connections between wireless carriers,  PSAPs, and databases have been installed and are operating correctly. The  original E911 system was designed to carry only the caller's telephone  number with the call, and the associated fixed address was obtained from  an established database. Wireless E911, however, requires more data items,  and the mobile caller's location must be obtained during the call and  delivered to the PSAP separately using additional data delivery capabilities.  In order to translate the latitude and longitude location information into a  street address, PSAPs usually must acquire and install mapping software.  PSAPs may also need to acquire new computers to receive and display this  information. Getting PSAPs the technology needed to receive wireless  E911 location information is primarily a state and local responsibility  because PSAPs serve an emergency response function that has  traditionally fallen under state or local jurisdiction. FCC has no authority to  set deadlines for the PSAPs\u2019 readiness.", "The ENHANCE 911 Act of 2004 was enacted to coordinate 911 and E911  services at the federal, state, and local level; and to ensure that the taxes,  fees, or charges imposed for enhancing 911 services are used only for the  purposes for which the funds are collected. The act called for the creation  of an E911 Implementation Coordination Office to improve E911  coordination and communication. This office will be operated jointly by the  National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the National  Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), and will be  housed at NHTSA. Although the office had not received an appropriation as  of January 2006, a DOT official told us that NHTSA and NTIA are working  together to delineate their respective responsibilities. The act also  authorized matching federal grants for eligible state, local, and tribal  entities for the deployment and operation of Phase II E911 services. The act  requires applicants for a matching federal grant to certify that no portion of  any designated state and local E911 funds are being obligated or expended  for any purpose other than the purposes for which the funds are  designated. The act authorized $250 million per year for matching grants  for fiscal years 2005 through 2009.

As noted earlier, FCC has  no authority to set deadlines for PSAPs to implement wireless E911  services. As a result, there is no federal requirement for full wireless E911  implementation and states may or may not have set their own deadlines for  implementation. In our survey of state E911 contacts, we asked  respondents to provide us with an estimate of when they believed their  state would have wireless Phase II service fully in place with at least one  wireless carrier per PSAP. We found that state E911 contacts offered a wide  range of estimated Phase II completion dates. As shown in figure 3, 10 of 44  state contacts who responded to our survey indicated that Phase II was  already in place throughout their state. Eight state contacts noted that they  would have Phase II in place for all of their PSAPs with at least one  wireless carrier within a year. Thirteen state contacts provided a range of 1  to 5 years for Phase II to be implemented, with three state contacts  responding that it would take more than 5 years. Furthermore, five state  contacts noted that their state might never be 100 percent complete for  Phase II service. For example, one state contact noted that four rural  counties opted not to apply for state funding to implement wireless E911  and two of these counties have only decided to implement wireline E911.

For these states, funds  are collected by wireless carriers from their subscribers. The other two  states do not impose surcharges on wireless subscribers, but still have a  wireless E911 funding mechanism in place. Specifically, the state E911  contact for Missouri told us that the state uses funds from the local general  revenue, local 911 taxes, and wireline funds for E911 implementation; and  the Vermont state E911 contact said the state uses funds from the state\u2019s  Universal Service Fund, which supports various telecommunications  programs. For states that impose surcharges, the surcharge amount is  usually established in state law. Responses to our survey indicated that  the per-subscriber surcharges varied from state to state and ranged from  $0.20 to $3.00 per month. We also found the surcharge amount could vary  within a state. For example, one state has a maximum monthly surcharge  amount of $1.50, and although most of the counties collect the maximum  amount, several counties collect less than the maximum.", "Based on the responses to our survey, several states indicated that  insufficient funding collected for wireless E911 was impeding the state\u2019s  ability to implement this service. We heard from one state that relies on  funds collected from both the wireline and wireless surcharges to fund  E911 that due to Hurricane Katrina, the state expected to see a drop in  wireline funding over the next 2 to 3 years. A county official from that state  said that because many residents and businesses impacted by the storm  have not reestablished telephone service, the state is not receiving  telephone fees from those residents. Another state reported that one of the  biggest issues in implementing wireless E911 is the inability to collect  funds from seasonal populations in many of the state\u2019s resort areas. Small  towns in the state experience a large influx of tourists during various times  of the year.

We found that various state-level entities can have authority to  manage the funds collected for wireless E911 implementation, including  the public utility commission, the treasury office, and state-level boards. In  one state, for example, a state-level board comprised of members from  municipal organizations, PSAPs, state and local law enforcement agencies,  local exchange service providers, and the wireless carriers industry  established the criteria and guidelines for administering the funds.

Some states use formulas based on  various criteria to determine the amount of funds distributed to different  localities. For example, a number of states allocate the funds to localities  based on criteria such as the volume of 911 calls made in the jurisdiction or  the number of wireless subscribers. Other states allocate funds based on  PSAP requests. One state reported that it reimburses county governments  and providers for the costs they have incurred to implement wireless E911  services.

To view selected results of the survey, go  to http://www.gao.gov/cgi-bin/getrpt?GAO-06-400sp.", "The practical difficulties of conducting surveys may introduce errors  commonly referred to as \u201cnonsampling error.\u201d For example, differences in  how a particular question is interpreted or the sources of information  available to respondents may introduce error. To minimize nonsampling  error, we worked with a social science survey specialist to develop the  questionnaire and conducted three pretests. In addition, steps were taken  during the data analysis to minimize error further, such as performing  computer analyses to identify inconsistencies and completing a review of  data analysis by an independent reviewer.", "We contacted state budget officials for the four states that reported using  funds collected for the purpose of E911 implementation for unrelated  purposes to verify the information we received in response to our survey.  Other than this, we did not independently verify the survey results. To  provide information on the progress made in deploying wireless E911, in  addition to the survey, we used NENA data current as of January 2006. To  assess the reliability of NENA\u2019s data regarding the number of public safety  answering points receiving Phase II data, we interviewed knowledgeable  officials from NENA about their data collection methods and reviewed any  existing documentation relating to the data sources. We determined that  the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report.", "We conducted our review between February 2005 and January 2006 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}], "fastfact": []}
