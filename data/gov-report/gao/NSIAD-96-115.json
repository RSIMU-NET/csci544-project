They include smaller-scale combat operations, peace operations, and other missions, such as humanitarian assistance. Contingency operations involving U.S. military forces have included (1) operations in support of U.N. peace operations in the former Yugoslavia, Haiti, Somalia, and Southwest Asia; (2) increased deployment of military capability to Southwest Asia and South Korea in response to heightened tensions; and (3) other key missions, including humanitarian and refugee assistance, such as support for Rwandan refugees."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DOD Reports Incremental Costs of Contingency Operations", "paragraphs": ["Two broad cost categories are associated with contingency operations\u2014incremental and total.

This is the same definition contained in the Omnibus Budget and Reconciliation Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-508) as well as in the fiscal year 1996 DOD Authorization Act. Examples of incremental costs are (1) special payments to participating military personnel, such as imminent danger pay; (2) transportation costs to deploy personnel to the area of operations; (3) contractor support for deployed forces; and (4) reconstitution of equipment used in the operation.", "In addition to incremental costs, DOD incurs costs to maintain a standing military force. These costs include (1) basic military pay; (2) fuel, spare parts, and maintenance to train and sustain military forces; and (3) procurement of military equipment, such as aircraft, ships, and tanks. These costs would be incurred regardless of whether military forces deployed to a contingency operation or remained at their home station, and they are not to be included in contingency cost reporting.", "The costs to participate in contingency operations have been substantial.

It has budgeted to be ready to conduct such operations. When the services have had to conduct contingency operations, they initially have had to shift funds within existing appropriations. This is done primarily by using funds appropriated for the same purpose but scheduled for obligation later in the fiscal year. Subsequently, DOD has often sought supplemental funding or reprogramming of appropriated funds to cover its costs.", "In fiscal year 1993, to pay for the cost of operations in Somalia, DOD asked for and received a supplemental appropriation that also rescinded $750 million from other areas within its budget. Congress provided no new funds. In fiscal year 1994, DOD received two supplementals to fund ongoing contingency operations: one for $1.2 billion in February 1994 and one for $299 million in September 1994. The February 1994 supplemental was funded with a mix of new budget authority and rescission of existing authority. The September 1994 supplemental provided funding through the Defense Emergency Relief Fund, which was designed to reimburse other appropriation accounts for costs incurred in responding to emergencies. In fiscal year 1995, DOD received a supplemental appropriation that included $2.2 billion intended for contingency operations. This supplemental also contained a mix of new budget authority and rescissions. For fiscal year 1996, the administration is seeking $620 million in supplemental funding and the reprogramming of $991 million in previously appropriated funds for DOD\u2019s incremental costs associated with the deployment of U.S. forces to implement the Bosnia peace agreement. The administration proposes to fully offset the supplemental with a corresponding rescission."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Cost Estimates Tend to Increase", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s estimate of supplemental funding needs is based on cost estimates developed before or during the operation. Developing the estimate involves (1) making assumptions about a number of factors, including the number of military personnel needed to conduct the operation, its expected duration, and the logistical requirements to support operations and (2) costing out the assumed force, using standard cost factors that are in turn based on historical costs and, where there are no cost factors, military judgment. For existing operations, DOD projects costs based on costs incurred in the previous year unless it expects an operation to change in size, scope, or duration. The estimate of required supplemental funding is prepared and reviewed within DOD and then reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The reviews can result in some parts of the request being deleted and other costs being added to the request. Overall, the cost estimates tend to increase as the estimates move through the review process.", "Within DOD, the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Comptroller reviews service submissions and prepares a program budget decision that serves as the basis for senior level DOD review. In the last 2 years, the estimates we have reviewed have tended to increase during final review within DOD and OMB. For example, in developing the cost estimate for fiscal year 1995 contingency operations, the overall estimate increased by $104 million. Within this amount, the OSD Comptroller reduced proposed funding for part of one operation, Cuba migrant operations, by $3 million and increased funding by $107 million for several other operations, including operations in Haiti. DOD\u2019s estimated costs as expressed in the approved program budget decision are also reviewed within OMB when the administration seeks supplemental funding. OMB, for example, increased the estimate of required fiscal year 1995 funding by $126 million over the amount proposed by DOD. OMB increased many of the estimates for required funding to support contingency operations. The biggest single increase was for operations in Cuba\u2014an increase of $16 million to cover additional operating and maintenance costs and personnel costs.", "In developing the cost estimate for operations in and around Bosnia for fiscal years 1996 and 1997, the estimated cost increased by $164 million between the preliminary program budget decision and the final one submitted to the Deputy Secretary of Defense. Within the total increase, some estimated costs increased while others decreased. For example, the estimate for support costs for personnel in Bosnia decreased by $20 million, and the estimate for contractor support increased by $32 million. In approving the final decision document, the Deputy Secretary added $96 million to the amount proposed in the final program budget decision to reflect December 1995 special pay for military personnel deployed in and around Bosnia and command and control augmentation initiatives, which had not been included in the estimate submitted to him. In developing the plan for financing the operation, DOD further increased the estimated cost by almost $82 million."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reported Costs Vary From Estimates", "paragraphs": ["Actual costs can vary from the estimate as changes occur to the operation. For example, DOD originally estimated that Vigilant Warrior, the deployment of military forces to Southwest Asia in response to Iraqi troop movements, would cost $462 million in fiscal year 1995. However, the operation ended in December 1994 and cost only $258 million. This was about $204 million below the estimate because the operation concluded sooner than expected as the Iraqis pulled their troops back. On the other hand, DOD estimated that the operation in Haiti would cost $465 million in fiscal year 1995, but through the end of fiscal year 1995, DOD had reported costs of $569 million.

The number, size, and scope of these operations have increased over the past several years as the United States has responded to events in a number of locations, including Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, Rwanda, and Iraq. The U.S. participation in implementing the Dayton Peace Accords, including deploying over 18,000 troops to Bosnia-Herzegovina, which began in December 1995, and the April 1996 evacuation of American civilians from Liberia are the latest examples of the kinds of operations in which the United States has become engaged. Contingency operations such as these begin when the President decides to commit U.S. military forces to respond to developing world conditions that he judges affect U.S. interests. For new operations, DOD develops cost estimates before the actual deployment of military forces or early in the deployment. These estimates are commonly used as the basis for requested additional funds to cover operation costs. As the operation progresses, the incremental costs that are incurred are reported.", "Contingency cost reports consequently are important for monitoring the adequacy of funding for such operations as well as for a variety of other purposes. They help DOD monitor the resources necessary to support contingency operations, which enables DOD to determine the implications for readiness when drawing from previously appropriated operation and maintenance funds to cover contingency costs. They also aid DOD in developing requests for supplemental appropriations and reprogrammings. DOD uses them to respond to congressional and public interest about the incremental cost of specific operations as well as all contingency operations. Also, they facilitate congressional oversight of the expenditure of appropriated funds and the assessment of the financial impact of contingency operations on DOD\u2019s spending plans.", "Cost reporting is also important for reimbursement.

The services record costs as they are incurred during the course of the mission. Therefore, unlike the estimates of costs developed before and during the mission, cost reporting is historical in nature.", "Some costs are initially recorded by the military unit that incurs the cost. For example, personnel in an Army unit that purchases spare parts to prepare equipment for deployment record the purchase against the financial management code assigned for the operation. Individual costs are consolidated at Army headquarters from the Army\u2019s financial management system. Other costs are determined centrally. For example, Air Force units report their flying hours, but Air Force headquarters translates those flying hours into costs.

We used auditor\u2019s judgment as prescribed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants to determine the materiality of reporting inaccuracies. We conducted our work at the OSD (Comptroller); all service headquarters; and major commands within each service that were heavily involved in determining incremental costs, including the U.S. Army Forces Command and U.S. Army, Europe, the Air Force\u2019s Air Combat Command, Air Mobility Command, and U.S. Air Forces in Europe, the Navy\u2019s Commanders in Chief, Atlantic and Pacific Fleet, the Commander, Marine Forces Atlantic, and the U.S. Transportation Command. We also conducted work at individual military units that participated in contingency operations in fiscal years 1994 and 1995. Individual units visited included the XVIII Airborne Corps in Fort Bragg, North Carolina; 101st Air Assault Division in Fort Campbell, Kentucky; 25th Infantry Division in Schofield Barracks, Hawaii; 48th Fighter Wing in Lakenheath, England; 1st Fighter Wing in Langley, Virginia; and the II Marine Expeditionary Force in Camp LeJeune, North Carolina. At the locations we visited we discussed how the incremental costs of contingency operations are captured and reviewed costs reported at that location. We also examined the guidance that the locations had received from higher command levels regarding contingency cost reporting and the views of cognizant officials at those locations regarding the adequacy of the available guidance.", "To assess the adequacy of DOD\u2019s accounting systems and internal controls, we drew from our past work and the work of the DOD Inspector General (IG) and the military audit agencies on the financial audits required under the Chief Financial Officers Act. We also examined DOD\u2019s annual Federal Managers\u2019 Financial Integrity Act (FMFIA) Statement of Assurance, which detail the significant internal control problems of DOD and the military services. We consulted with DOD\u2019s IG and the military audit agencies regarding planned work to assess the extent of audits of contingency cost reporting.

The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants states that a financial auditor must consider materiality in the scope of work to be performed and leaves the threshold of what constitutes a material weakness to the auditor\u2019s judgment. In our judgment, a 7 percent known error as well as potential errors in the unauditable amounts discussed below, constitutes a material weakness in the accounting systems. A material weakness raises questions about the reliability of reported costs. DOD reported incremental costs of about $4.1 billion for contingency operations that occurred in fiscal years 1994 and 1995. We identified about $104 million in overstated costs and about $171 million in understated costs between fiscal years 1994 and 1995. Table 2.1 summarizes these over- and understatements by appropriation. We also found instances where the accuracy of some reported costs could not be determined.

For example, Army Headquarters did not apply these offsets when calculating its incremental costs. In fiscal year 1995, the U.S. Army Forces Command, which was responsible for supporting most of the Army forces involved in contingency operations in that year, estimated that military units did not incur about $11 million in funded normal operating costs as a result of deploying to contingency operations. Therefore, these funds were recoverable. For example, U.S. Army Forces Command estimated that Fort Drum, home of the  10th Mountain Division (Light), had not incurred almost $3 million in base operations cost because a large part of the division was deployed to Haiti and so was not incurring some normal day-to-day costs. Although Forces Command officials made this information available to senior command officials, no action was taken to offset reported costs.", "In another instance, the 25th Infantry Division (Light), part of the U.S. Army, Pacific saved $1 million from normal operating costs while part of the division was deployed to Haiti because its operating costs during deployment were paid by another Army command. Thus, the division was able to use the $1 million it saved from normal operating costs not incurred to acquire equipment it could not otherwise afford within its annual budget. Neither the division nor higher command levels in the Army adjusted these reported contingency costs to reflect these savings. The Army chose to allow units that had savings to retain and use them for otherwise unfunded needs.", "In fiscal year 1996, at least one major command, U.S. Army, Europe, has identified offsets and adjusted its funding estimate accordingly. U.S. Army, Europe, which has the lead responsibility for tracking U.S. Army costs resulting from participation in implementing the Dayton Peace Accords in Bosnia, anticipates that it will not incur about $113 million in fiscal  year 1996 normal operating costs as a result of its participation in Bosnia.

In fiscal year 1995, the Army\u2019s 25th Infantry Division (Light) reported about $2 million in costs associated with deploying to Haiti. The division was scheduled to participate in a training exercise at the Joint Readiness Training Center. U.S. Army, Pacific, the command that funds the division, had budgeted more than $6 million for the cost of this exercise. Because elements of the division\u2019s brigades were deployed to Haiti, the division did not participate in this exercise. The 25th Infantry Division\u2019s (Light) cost to participate in the Haiti operation was not adjusted to reflect the savings from the missed training exercise. The Department of the Army directed the U.S. Army, Pacific to use $2 million of the $6 million to fund other Army requirements and allowed the command to retain the remaining $4 million, which it used to cover all of the 25th Infantry Division\u2019s (Light) $2 million cost associated with Haiti and to meet otherwise unfunded needs. Consequently, we believe that the division\u2019s $2 million in incremental costs were fully offset by the training costs that were not incurred and there were no incremental costs.", "Another example of reported incremental costs not offset by training not conducted was found in the Air Force. In fiscal year 1994, the 48th Fighter Wing had to cancel its participation in several training exercises because of contingency operations. U.S. Air Forces, Europe budgeted $1 million for this training. Although the training was canceled, the command made no adjustment to its reported incremental costs.", "In these examples, neither the Army nor the Air Force adjusted its reported costs to reflect the savings from canceled training. For the Army, this was because Army headquarters did not apply any offsets, including those related to canceled training, to its reported costs for fiscal year 1995.

For example, the Air Force overstated fiscal years 1994 and 1995 incremental flying hour costs by $67 million. The reasons for the overstatement were that it (1) did not use actual cost factors to report costs in fiscal years 1994 and 1995 and (2) did not offset its flying hour costs by the value of free fuel received from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in fiscal year 1994.", "According to Air Force officials, the Air Force calculated its incremental flying hour costs by applying budgeted cost factors for supplies, repair parts, maintenance, and fuel to the additional hours flown per aircraft above budgeted flying hours. These cost factors reflect the average historical costs, by aircraft type, to operate, not their actual costs. In fiscal year 1994, we determined that U.S. Air Forces, Europe actual costs of contingency flying hours were about $19 million below that funded by the Air Force.", "According to command officials, when actual costs are lower than the budgeted factors for an aircraft, the command is allowed to retain the excess. Conversely, when costs are above these factors, the command must absorb the increased cost within its budget. For example, we calculated that Air Combat Command had to absorb $4 million for fiscal year 1994 because its actual costs were higher than the budgeted factors. In the same year, Saudi Arabia provided the Air Force free fuel valued at $45 million to support contingency operations in Southwest Asia. The Air Force failed to deduct the value of this free fuel when computing its incremental flying hour costs for Operation Southern Watch, thereby overstating its costs.", "In fiscal year 1995, the Air Force headquarters revised its methodology for calculating incremental flying hour costs to reflect the receipt of free fuel. However, it continued to compute the flying hour costs by using the budgeted versus actual cost factors. Consequently, Air Force headquarters computed almost $74 million for Air Combat Command\u2019s incremental flying hour costs, while the command\u2019s actual costs were about $7 million lower because actual costs were less than the budgeted cost factors. We did not have comparable data to calculate U.S. Air Forces, Europe\u2019s costs.", "We also found that the Navy used either budgeted or actual cost factors when determining its incremental flying hour cost. The Navy Atlantic Fleet used budgeted rates reflecting average historical cost applied to its additional flying hours, while the Pacific Fleet applied actual rates for the most part when determining its costs. The Navy Pacific Fleet provided an example where the actual rates were higher than the budgeted costs allowed for fiscal year 1995. For its F/A-18A, F/A-18C, and P-3C aircraft involved in contingencies, the actual costs per hour for these aircraft were higher than the budgeted costs by $2,632, $126, and $41, respectively.", "Furthermore, Navy officials also stated that the Navy\u2019s fiscal year 1994 and 1995 flying costs were not adjusted for free aviation fuel. In fiscal year 1994, the Navy reported almost $6 million for aviation fuel used in Operation Southern Watch but did not adjust this amount by the $2 million of free fuel received. Therefore, the Navy overstated its reported costs by 33 percent. Similarly, in fiscal year 1995, the Navy did not adjust its reported costs to reflect $1 million of free fuel received for operations in Southwest Asia. Navy headquarter officials stated that the value of free fuel received for operations was accounted for in its flying hour costs factors, which were used to determine flying hour costs.

The cost of this material, over $23 million, was reported as an incremental cost of that contingency operation. In July of 1994, the Army Audit Agency found that $12 million of this equipment was excess to the command\u2019s needs and recommended that the command turn in the supplies to receive a credit. However, U.S. Army, Europe officials did not concur with this recommendation and retained the material. They believed that the equipment was necessary for immediate future contingency airdrop operations. Also, they did not want to turn in the inventory because they believed that it made little sense to turn in equipment, receive a limited credit for it, and then buy it back at full price for anticipated operations. Regardless of whether the material was returned, the reported incremental cost should have been adjusted by the $12 million of material not used in the contingency operation.
