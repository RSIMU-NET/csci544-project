The March 2010 update to GAO's state and local fiscal model updates simulations that state and local governments' long-term fiscal position will steadily decline through 2060 absent policy changes. The primary driver of the fiscal pressure confronting the state and local sector is the continued growth in health-related costs. Over the last 30 years, health care spending has increased as a share of state and local spending, growing from 12 percent of overall state and local expenditures in 1978 to 20 percent in 2008. While the temporary infusion of funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 helped cushion near-term revenue shortfalls, states will continue to be fiscally stressed. The rates of growth in expenditures and revenues varied among the states during the past 30 years, both overall and within specific categories. Current expenditures grew faster than own-source revenues in almost all states between 1977 and 2007. Average annual growth rates of state and local government expenditures and revenues varied substantially by category and among states. For example, public welfare (which includes Medicaid) was one of the fastest growing expenditure categories. In the aggregate, inflation-adjusted spending on public welfare grew at an average annual rate of 5.3 percent per year and growth rates in individual states ranged from 2.3 percent to 10.9 percent. The growth of intergovernmental revenue from the federal government (grants) also varied among the states. State and local current expenditures grew faster than federal grant revenues in more than half of the states. Despite these trends, the sector in the aggregate usually remained in surplus during this 30-year period. The sector avoided operating deficits, in part because of federal grant growth, and in part because, from 1995 to 2007, the sector increasingly financed capital purchases by issuing debt, rather than with revenues, which left more revenues available to pay for current expenditures. However, if the overall trend of state and local government expenditure growth in excess of revenue growth persists, this growth will put increasing pressure on state and local governments going forward. All levels of government face long-term fiscal challenges which could affect future federal funding of intergovernmental programs, as well as the potential capacity of state and local governments to help fund and implement these programs. The interconnectedness which defines intergovernmental programs requires that officials at all levels of government remain aware of and ready to respond to fiscal pressures. These pressures have implications for a wide range of federal, state, and local programs, policies, and activities, and include costs associated with health care, physical infrastructure, state and local employee pensions and retiree health benefits, and education, among other areas. Actions to address the nation's long-term fiscal outlook will be needed at all government levels in coming years and the challenges cannot be adequately met by shifting burdens from one level of government to another. GAO does not make recommendations in this report."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["State and local governments work in partnership with the federal  government to implement numerous intergovernmental programs.

To  describe long-term trends in state and local government revenues and  expenditures, we examined data from the National Income and Product  Accounts (NIPA) over the past 30 years. In addition, we reviewed our prior  reports and those of others to identify what is known about these trends  and factors that affect them. To examine state and local government  expenditure and revenue patterns among the states, we examined U.S.  Census Bureau data for the past 30 years. We also reviewed our prior  reports, as well as reports from the National Association of State Budget  Officers (NASBO), the National Conference of State Legislatures, and  others to understand state variation in fiscal pressures, revenue and  spending patterns, and factors that affect them, including any shifts  resulting from the recent recession. To identify what is known about the  implications of these long-term fiscal pressures for federal policies, we  reviewed our prior reports and reports by think tanks and associations  representing state and local government officials.

This  review of state and local governments\u2019 fiscal pressures is not necessarily  representative of all fiscal pressures facing state and local governments.  This review provides a perspective on the issues facing these governments  and how these pressures could affect federal programs and policies. States  and localities face fiscal pressures when, taken as a whole, spending is  expected to outpace revenues, based on current policies. Growth in  individual categories of spending, absent corresponding revenue growth or  decreases in other spending, can be a source of fiscal pressures. Similarly,  fiscal pressures may arise from revenue trends that do not keep pace with  overall spending. Growth in individual spending categories or a decline in  individual revenue categories alone does not constitute a fiscal pressure.", "Changes in the makeup of state and local government services and  revenues may be choices that reflect economic or demographic changes or  a change in public preferences. Fiscal pressures can result from spending  growth or revenue declines that are not the direct result of current state  and local policy choices, but instead reflect automatic spending growth  (for example in response to population shifts or an increase in the number  of people eligible for government programs) or declines in revenue due to  changes in the economy (e.g., increases in internet sales, which affect  states\u2019 ability to capture sales tax). Individual expenditure categories can  also face fiscal pressures; (e.g., employee pension funds experiencing  growth rates below the rates assumed in budget forecasts which then  become underfunded liabilities).", "This work is primarily focused on long-term pressures, but the state and  local government sector can also face short-term fiscal pressures that can  arise from unexpected developments\u2014such as a natural disaster or a  recession\u2014that cause substantial increases in spending or reductions in  revenue. The recession that began in December 2007 caused significant  immediate fiscal pressures in the form of reduced tax revenues and  increased demand for certain programs, including Medicaid and  unemployment benefits. Because this report focuses primarily on long- term pressures and some of the state and local data on government  spending were only available through 2007, the effects of this recession are  not included in the statistical analysis of variation among the states.", "To address fiscal pressures and comply with balanced budget  requirements, state and local governments may offset increased costs in  one program by making cuts to other programs, but they may have less  flexibility to adjust certain types of spending. For example, state and local  government employee pension benefits are often defined in state law or  local ordinances or charters and, in that sense, pension benefits for  current retirees are largely protected from states\u2019 or localities\u2019 responses  to fiscal pressures. On the other hand, retiree health benefits for those  employees may not have the same level of legal protection. Spending on  programs such as street paving may have no legal protection, but instead  be an implicit commitment grounded in the public\u2019s expectations for the  provision of government services. Flexibility to adjust revenues may also  be constrained explicitly (e.g., caps on tax increases), or implicitly, (e.g.,  tax increases can be politically unpopular). The obligation of state and  local governments to repay their long-term debt also varies, and a  substantial portion of that debt has limited claims on the assets and  revenues of state and local governments. About 60 percent of total state  and local long-term debt outstanding is in the category of revenue bonds  secured by a specific revenue-generating entity and provide no recourse to  any other governmental assets or revenues in the event of default. In  contrast to revenue bonds, general obligation bonds, which comprise  about 40 percent of total state and local long-term debt outstanding, have  payment of principal and interest secured by the full faith and credit of the  issuer."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State and Local Governments Face Increasing Fiscal Challenges in the Next 50 Years", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "State and Local Fiscal Model Simulations Show Sector Facing Long-Term Fiscal Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Our March 2010 state and local fiscal model updates simulations showing  that state and local governments\u2019 long-term fiscal position will steadily  decline through 2060 absent policy changes (see fig. 1).

These results confirm our recent finding that while states\u2019 near- term revenue shortfalls have been cushioned by the temporary infusion of  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act) funds,  as shown in the insert within figure 1, states will continue to be fiscally  stressed.", "These simulations suggest the fiscal pressures the sector faces and the  extent to which these governments will need to make substantial policy  changes to avoid growing imbalances. The size of these simulated deficits  and state and local government balanced budget requirements imply the  need for these governments to take action to reduce state and local  government current expenditures, increase revenues, or do both in order  to maintain balance. One way of measuring the long-term challenges faced  by the sector is through a measure known as the \u201cfiscal gap.\u201d The fiscal  gap is an estimate of the action needed today and maintained for each and  every year to achieve fiscal balance over a certain period. We measured  the gap as the amount of spending reduction or tax increase needed to  prevent operating deficits (or negative operating balances). Our  simulations showed the present value of the fiscal gap over the period  2009 to 2058 was $9.9 trillion, or 2 percent of gross domestic product  (GDP). We calculated that closing the fiscal gap over the next 50 years  would require action to be taken today and maintained for each and every  year going forward equivalent to a 12.3 percent reduction in state and local  government current expenditures. Closing the fiscal gap through revenue  increases would require action of a similar magnitude through increased  state and local revenues. It is important to note that these estimates do not  attempt to assume forthcoming policy actions by federal, state, or local  governments and are based on analysis of historical data. Actual amounts  will reflect policy actions taken by state and local governments to balance  their budgets.", "The primary driver of the fiscal pressure confronting the state and local  sector is the continued growth in health-related costs. State and local  expenditures on Medicaid and the cost of health insurance for state and  local retirees are expected to grow more than GDP. The health care cost  growth assumptions in our model\u2019s simulations do not include  adjustments in response to the March 2010 passage of the Patient  Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). Precisely how the act will  affect state costs is not yet clear and will likely vary among the states.  CMS estimates that while the federal government will be responsible for  the vast majority of increases in Medicaid expenditures over the next 10  years, state and local governments will also experience some increases.  Some analysts predict state costs will likely increase most where Medicaid  eligibility requirements provided less coverage than that required by  PPACA.

Trends in  expenditures for other non-health categories of state and local government  spending reflect some fluctuations in the federal role in some of these  functions. For example, shifts in social welfare spending reflect federal  policy changes to the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program  (TANF, previously known as Aid to Families with Dependent Children) in  the mid-1990s. With the creation of TANF, the number of families who  received cash assistance fell significantly, from an average of 4.8 million  just prior to the creation of TANF to 1.7 million in 2008. State and local  expenditures on income security programs, including welfare spending,  declined from 10 percent of overall state and local expenditures in 1978 to  7 percent in 2008. Education spending also declined as a share of all state  and local government spending, from 40 percent in 1978 to 36 percent in  2008. However, inflation-adjusted spending on education increased over  this time period, so this decline in education spending as a share of all  state and local government spending largely reflects shifts resulting from  faster growth in spending on health care.", "State and local government revenues increased from $786 billion in 1978 to  more than $2 trillion in 2008. About $1.4 trillion\u2014or 68 percent\u2014of the  sector\u2019s receipts are comprised of tax receipts, including personal income,  sales, and property taxes. Federal grants comprise the second largest  source of receipts for the sector, providing about $399 billion to the sector  in 2008. The sector had about $251 billion in other receipts in 2008,  including fees, income on assets, and contributions for government  insurance. Revenue streams from different sources (i.e., taxes, federal  grants, and other) have been relatively stable as a percent of GDP over the  past 30 years, with some short-term fluctuations and recent declines due  to the recession. States\u2019 current tax receipts held relatively steady and  ranged from 8 to 10 percent of GDP between 1978 and 2008. Total tax  receipts were 68 percent of aggregate state and local government revenues  in both 1978 and 2008 (see fig. 3).

State and local current  tax receipts declined for four consecutive quarters, starting in the third  quarter of 2008. State tax collections totaled $715.2 billion in fiscal year  2009, down 8.6 percent from the $782.1 billion collected in fiscal year 2008.  The National Governors Association (NGA) and NASBO reported in June  that the severe national recession has drastically reduced tax revenues due  to significant declines in sales, personal income, and corporate income tax  collections. NGA and NASBO also reported that as state revenue  collections historically lag behind any national economic recovery, state  revenues will likely remain sluggish throughout fiscal years 2011 and 2012.  In the first quarter of calendar year 2010, state tax revenues were higher  than in the same period in 2009. This positive news is tempered by the  small size of the projected growth rates in many states.", "Some of these revenue losses were offset by increased federal funding  provided by the infusion of Recovery Act funds discussed below.  However, states continued to take actions to address revenues in fiscal  years 2009 and 2010. Actions taken by state and local governments to close  their budget gaps included raising fees, laying off employees, across-the- board cuts to state programs, and drawing on states\u2019 rainy day or reserve  funds. States also reduced state aid to localities, a budget-balancing  strategy that shifts the fiscal pressure from the state to local governments.", "Federal grants were a relatively consistent proportion of the state and  local sector\u2019s total revenue over the past 30 years. Federal grants ranged  from 2 to 3 percent of GDP during this time, increasing from $179 billion in  1978 to $399 billion in 2008.

Actual federal outlays  to states and localities under the Recovery Act totaled approximately  $137.1 billion through July 9, 2010. Outlays in health and education and  training constituted 88 percent of total Recovery Act outlays to states and  localities in fiscal year 2009.

Variation also existed among states and categories.

We examined these  variations in selected categories of expenditures and revenues, which are  described in table 2.", "To examine these variations, we assessed selected categories of  expenditures, revenues, and debt using three measures.  1.  To get a sense of the relative proportion represented by each category  in each state, we calculated (a) selected expenditure categories as  shares of general current expenditures in 2007, (b) selected revenue  categories as shares of general revenues in 2007, and (c) long- and  short-term debt as shares of total revenues in 2007.  2.

We chose total personal  income as a proxy for each state\u2019s resources or fiscal capacity. For  example, when expenditures in a state are growing faster than  personal income, the share of the state\u2019s resources that are dedicated  to state and local government services is growing.

While more than two-thirds of the states experienced  growth in total taxes greater than the growth in personal income between  1977 and 2007, almost all states also experienced declines in total taxes as  a percent of general revenue because other revenue categories (i.e.,  federal grants and total charges and miscellaneous revenue) grew faster.  For the state and local government sector in the aggregate, total taxes  made up 54.8 percent of revenue in 2007. The share of revenue collected as  taxes in individual states ranged from about 37 to about 69 percent. For  the state and local government sector, property taxes as a share of  revenue declined between 1977 and 2007, while individual income taxes  increased and general sales taxes remained relatively stable.", "Individual income taxes: Individual income taxes emerged as the fastest  growing tax category, growing at an annual rate of 4.3 percent.

For the sector in the aggregate,  individual income tax revenues made up 12.4 percent of revenue in 2007.

Individual income taxes grew faster than personal  income in more than two-thirds of the states.", "Sales taxes: General sales taxes grew an average of 3.8 percent per year  for all states between 1977 and 2007. Sales tax growth ranged from -0.8  percent to 7.8 percent in individual states. Four states did not have a  general sales tax during the period of analysis and sales tax revenues  constituted more than 20 percent of state and local government revenues  in a few states. Sales tax revenues grew faster than personal income in  more than two-thirds of the states during this period.", "Property taxes: Of the three major categories of taxes, growth in property  tax revenues showed the least amount of variation among the states and  grew an average of 3.2 percent per year with growth rates ranging from 0.3  to 6.8 percent in individual states. For the sector in the aggregate, property  taxes made up 16.5 percent of revenue in 2007. Property taxes ranged from  6.2 to 34.1 percent of revenue collected in individual states in 2007. A  majority of states experienced property tax growth greater than the  growth in personal income.", "Total charges and miscellaneous revenue: This category emerged as the  fastest growing overall revenue category, with an aggregate annual growth  rate of 4.8 percent. All states experienced growth in this category while  almost all states experienced growth relative to personal income. These  growth rates indicate that, on the whole, state and local governments are  increasingly relying on charges and miscellaneous revenue to finance their  programs and services. For the state and local government sector in the  aggregate, total charges and miscellaneous revenue comprised 25.2  percent of revenues in 2007.", "Federal grants: In the aggregate, federal grant revenues also grew faster  than tax revenue, at an average annual rate of 3.9 percent. Growth rates of  federal grant revenue for individual states varied between 0.4 and 6.9  percent. Federal grants to the state and local government sector  represented 20.1 percent of revenues in 2007, slightly less than the 21.9  percent they contributed in 1977.

Because state  and local governments have historically funded retiree health benefits  when paid or provided rather than when the benefits are earned, much of  their OPEB liability is unfunded, raising concerns about the fiscal  pressures state and local governments face in the coming decades. In a  2009 review, we found that the total unfunded OPEB liability reported in  states and the largest local governments\u2019 comprehensive annual financial  reports (CAFR) exceeded $530 billion.

Because state and local governments are generally  prohibited from using debt to finance operating deficits, state and local  debt will not actually increase as shown in this figure.

The simulations suggest that federal debt could exceed  100 percent of GDP by 2019 and reach 200 percent of GDP by 2032.

To develop these long-run scenarios, we simulate  each major receipt and expenditure category of the state and local  government sector in future years using the Bureau of Economic  Analysis\u2019s National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) as our primary  data source. We simulate the growth in each category of receipts and  expenditures using the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s (CBO) economic  assumptions whenever possible. In several cases we were not able to  obtain existing projections and needed to develop our own assumptions  about the likely future growth path of certain receipts or expenditures. For  example, because 2009 data on total employment were not available from  NIPA at the time of our analysis, we used data from the Bureau of Labor  Statistic\u2019s Current Employment Statistics program to estimate the sector\u2019s  2009 employment level.", "To describe long-term trends in state and local government revenues and  expenditures, we examined NIPA data over the past 30 years. We analyzed  changes in the shares of state and local expenditure, revenue, and federal  grant categories as a percent of total expenditures, revenues, and federal  grants respectively from 1978 to 2008. We also examined inflation-adjusted  growth in expenditure and revenue categories as a percent of GDP. In  addition, we provide information on the effect of the recent recession on  state and local government tax revenues using NIPA data (2001 through  the first quarter of 2010) to show declines in recent years. We also  reviewed our prior reports and those of others to identify what is known  about these trends and factors that affect them.", "To examine trends in state and local government expenditure and revenue  patterns among the states, we used U.S. Census Bureau government  finance data and GDP price index data from NIPA to calculate inflation- adjusted values of selected expenditure and revenue categories for each  state (including the District of Columbia) and for the U.S. for 1977-2007,  excluding 2001 and 2003 because data were not available in those years.  Data for 1977, 1982, 1987, 1992, 1997, 2002, and 2007 are based on the U.S.  Census Bureau, Census of Governments, which surveys all state and local  governments in the United States. Data for the other years are based on  the Annual Survey of Government Finances. In these years, local  government finance statistics are based in part on a sample of local  governments in the United States. We determined that the U.S. Census  Bureau data were the best available data for the purpose of examining  variation in trends among the states. We previously reported that this data  comprises the most comprehensive and consistent set of data on this  subject. We assessed the reliability of the data we used for this review and  determined that they were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. However,  due in part to definitional differences among the states, such as those of  coverage (what constitutes a government entity) or measurement (cash vs.  accrual accounting) the data cannot be used as financial statements, to  measure a government\u2019s fiscal condition, or to calculate a surplus or  deficit.", "We examined patterns between state and local revenue growth and growth  in overall state and local spending using data from the U.S. Census Bureau.  For each state and the District of Columbia, we plotted the average annual  growth rate in real own-source revenues against the average annual  growth in real current expenditures from 1977 to 2007. We then counted  the number of states in which spending grew faster, slower, and at the  same rate as own-source revenues. We analyzed growth in current  expenditures against growth in federal grant revenues and total general  expenditures against total general revenues using the same approach. To  examine the extent to which federal grants supported selected categories  of state and local government spending, we compared average annual  growth in federal grants from 1977 to 2007 using U.S. Census Bureau data  for four expenditure categories\u2014health and hospitals, education, public  welfare, and housing and community development\u2014to the growth in  those expenditure categories over the same time period. We also tabulated  the number of states in which federal grant revenues grew faster than  current expenditures, and the number of states in which federal grants  grew slower than current expenditures.", "To identify categories of spending that could influence fiscal pressures, we  analyzed NIPA data on aggregate expenditures by category. Specifically,  we selected for further analysis spending categories for which there were  at least $100 billion in expenditures in 2008, and which, as a percent of  GDP, experienced a positive annual growth rate between 1978 and 2008.  We also included \u2018Corrections\u2019 because it had the highest growth rate of all  categories, and is identified in the literature as a growing expense for  some states. We then selected analogous categories in the U.S. Census  Bureau data to analyze expenditure trends by category and state. To  examine state and local government spending for personnel, we added  \u2018total salaries and wages\u2019 to our list of expenditure categories.", "To examine variation among the states, we examined the state and local  government finances using three measures:  To get a sense of the relative proportion represented by each category in  each state and for the United States, we calculated (a) selected  expenditure categories as shares of general current expenditures in 2007,  (b) selected revenue categories as shares of general revenues in 2007, and  (c) long- and short-term debt as shares of total revenues in 2007.", "To assess how fast each category grew between 1977 and 2007 in each  state, we calculated the average annual growth rate for each selected  expenditure, revenue, and debt category using regression analysis. For  each expenditure and revenue growth rate calculation, we identified the  U.S. average growth rate and the minimum and maximum growth rates  across the states.", "Because changes in the levels of expenditures and revenues can be  affected by changes in state fiscal capacity\u2014such as increased tax  revenues due to population growth\u2014we compared the average annual  growth rate for each category of spending, revenues, and debt to the  average annual growth rate in state personal income. To compare the  growth in these categories relative to growth in each state\u2019s resources, we  compared the growth rate for each selected expenditure, revenue, and  debt category to the growth rate in total state personal income between  1977 and 2007. We chose total personal income as a proxy for each state\u2019s  resources or fiscal capacity. When expenditures in a state are growing  faster than personal income, the share of the state\u2019s resources that are  dedicated to state and local government services is growing. Over the long  run, such growth could create a fiscal pressure. This analysis also  identified the number of states where growth in a category was (a) greater  than total personal income growth for that state or (b) less than total  personal income growth for that state.", "We used state personal income as a proxy for state fiscal capacity even  though we previously reported that personal income is an incomplete  measure of state resources because it excludes some sources of income  potentially subject to state taxation, such as corporate income produced  within the state, but not received by state residents. We recently reported  that total taxable resources, as reported by the Department of the  Treasury, is a more comprehensive measure of state financing ability than  personal income. We did not use total taxable resources as the measure of  state fiscal capacity in this analysis because the Department of the  Treasury only began calculating it in the 1980s and therefore it was not  available for the full period of our analysis. We also did not use GDP-by- state as the measure of states\u2019 fiscal capacity because the calculation of  GDP-by-state changed in 1997 such that the data before and after that year  are not comparable.", "To provide additional context for understanding the fiscal pressures facing  state and local governments and the potential implications for federal  programs and policies, we reviewed our prior reports and reports of think  tanks, including the Pew Center on the States and the Nelson A.
