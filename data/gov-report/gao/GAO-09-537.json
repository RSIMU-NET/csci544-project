The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)--the agency that administers the Medicare program--has taken steps to encourage home dialysis and is in the process of changing the way it pays for dialysis services. Effective 2011, CMS will pay for dialysis services using an expanded bundled payment. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 required GAO to report on the costs of home dialysis treatments and training. GAO examined (1) the extent to which the costs of home dialysis differ from the costs of dialysis received in a facility, and (2) CMS's plans to account for home dialysis costs in the expanded bundled payment. GAO obtained information from CMS, the U.S. Renal Data System, ESRD experts, and self-reported cost information from six dialysis providers."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The self-reported cost information GAO obtained from dialysis providers--including a large chain provider, small nonprofit providers, and a hospital-based provider--indicated variation in the costs to provide home dialysis when compared with costs to provide dialysis in their facility. The six dialysis providers reported lower costs per treatment to provide home dialysis than to provide dialysis at a facility, though the amount by which home dialysis costs were lower varied widely among the providers. Because patients who dialyze at home typically receive dialysis treatments more than three times per week, some providers' costs to provide home dialysis on a weekly basis can be higher than their costs to provide dialysis at a facility. However, other dialysis providers reported lower costs per week to provide home dialysis compared with dialysis provided in a facility. Additionally, several dialysis providers indicated that, for home dialysis patients, the costs of a dialysis treatment with a training session were significantly higher than the costs of a dialysis treatment without a training session. At the time of GAO's review CMS officials said they are considering factoring the costs of home dialysis treatments and training into the expanded bundled payment, but the details for the expanded bundled payment are still under development and subject to change. CMS officials told GAO that the expanded bundled payment would create incentives for providers to offer home dialysis instead of dialysis at a facility, because although some costs associated with home dialysis may be higher for providers, other efficiencies will offset those costs. For example, although supply costs may be higher for home dialysis, other costs of providing home dialysis--such as drugs, staff, and overhead--will be lower, and thus, in CMS's view, will encourage providers to offer home dialysis. However, concerns have been raised that the way that CMS is considering accounting for the costs of home dialysis in the expanded bundled payment might not encourage providers to offer home dialysis, as CMS expects. For example, some dialysis providers raised concerns that because home dialysis generally consists of more than three dialysis treatments per week--which may result in higher weekly costs to provide home dialysis compared with dialysis received in a facility--providers may not be encouraged to offer home dialysis. CMS officials indicated that CMS intends to assess the effect of the expanded bundled payment on home dialysis utilization rates, but CMS has not established formal plans to monitor this effect."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a chronic illness characterized by  permanent kidney failure. Regardless of age, most individuals with ESRD  are eligible for Medicare coverage. Individuals with ESRD can receive a  kidney transplant or undergo dialysis\u2014a process that removes wastes and  fluid from the body to replace kidney functioning. In 2006, about   70 percent of patients with ESRD underwent dialysis and Medicare was  the primary payer for approximately 84 percent of dialysis patients  nationwide. In 2005, Medicare spending on dialysis and dialysis-related  drugs totaled about $7.9 billion.", "Individuals with ESRD may receive dialysis treatments in a dialysis facility  or be trained to perform dialysis treatments at home. Patients who  receive dialysis at a facility receive hemodialysis, a process where blood is  allowed to flow, a few ounces at a time, through a special filter that  removes wastes and extra fluids and then returns the blood to the body.  Patients who conduct dialysis at home perform either home hemodialysis  or peritoneal dialysis\u2014which uses the individual\u2019s own peritoneal  membrane, located within the abdomen, as the filter for screening toxins  from the body. Figure 1 describes the two types of dialysis.", "According to the United States Renal Data System (USRDS)\u2014a national  data system that collects, analyzes, and distributes information about  ESRD in the United States\u2014use of peritoneal dialysis peaked in the mid- 1990s\u2014reaching about 14.4 percent of the dialysis population\u2014but has  since declined. Utilization of home hemodialysis declined steadily from  1985 to 2002, when the home hemodialysis population began to increase.  In 2006, of the 355,000 individuals with ESRD nationwide who received  dialysis treatments\u2014including both patients who were covered by  Medicare and patients who had other insurance coverage\u2014approximately  92 percent received dialysis in a facility, while about 7.4 percent   performed peritoneal dialysis at home, and 0.7 percent performed home  hemodialysis.", "The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)\u2014the agency that  administers the Medicare program\u2014has made an effort to promote home  dialysis, whenever clinically appropriate. In April 2008, CMS issued a final  rule establishing new conditions of coverage for Medicare dialysis  facilities. It requires such facilities to inform patients about the options of  home and facility dialysis treatments, and the patients\u2019 care team\u2014which  includes the patients, their physician, and nurses\u2014to identify a plan for  each patient\u2019s home dialysis treatments or explain why the patient is not a  candidate for home dialysis. According to CMS, one of the goals of the rule  is to foster patient independence by encouraging ESRD patients to receive  dialysis at home. Some medical experts and dialysis providers have  estimated that anywhere from less than 10 percent to up to 50 percent of  all patients who receive dialysis nationwide could be good candidates for  home dialysis.", "As CMS takes steps to promote home dialysis, the agency also is required  by law to change the way Medicare pays for dialysis and other ESRD  services. Currently, Medicare pays dialysis providers a prospective  payment\u2014known as a composite rate\u2014for three dialysis treatments per  week, whether the treatment is provided at home or in a facility. The  composite rate covers a partial bundle of dialysis services, including items  associated with dialysis treatments, such as certain tests, drugs, and  supplies that are frequently used during dialysis. In addition to the  composite rate, providers can also receive additional Medicare  reimbursements for separately billable ESRD services, which include  other injectable drugs (such as Epogen, vitamin D, and iron), laboratory  tests, supplies, and blood products that are often used during the course of  dialysis. Providers can also receive additional Medicare reimbursements  for training patients to dialyze at home.", "The Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008  (MIPPA) requires CMS to implement a new, expanded bundled payment  for dialysis services by January 1, 2011. MIPPA requires that the  expanded bundled payment for ESRD services include a payment for  providing both composite rate services and separately billable services.  This would include the costs of providing home dialysis.", "As we have previously reported, an expanded bundled payment for ESRD  services should promote efficient care delivery, as providers retain the  difference if Medicare\u2019s payment exceeds the costs they incur to provide  dialysis services. We also reported that an expanded bundled payment  would afford clinicians more flexibility in decision making because  incentives to provide a particular drug or treatment would be reduced.  According to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human  Services\u2019 (HHS) 2008 Report to Congress that outlined CMS\u2019s proposed  design for the expanded bundled payment for ESRD services, the new  payment is intended to eliminate incentives for providers to overutilize  certain services that are separately billable, to target higher payments to  providers that treat more costly patients, and to create incentives for  efficiencies.", "The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 required us to review and  report on the costs associated with providing home hemodialysis and  patient training for home hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Several  congressional committees also asked us to review the implications of the  expanded bundled payment for home dialysis. For our review, we  examined (1) the extent to which the costs of home dialysis differ from the  costs of dialysis provided in a facility, and (2) CMS\u2019s plans to account for  home dialysis costs in the expanded bundled payment for ESRD services.", "To examine the extent to which the costs of home dialysis differ from the  costs to provide dialysis in a facility, we conducted interviews with  officials from 12 dialysis providers, including large chain providers, small  nonprofit providers, and a hospital-based provider. Additionally, we  obtained self-reported cost information from 6 of the 12 dialysis providers  we interviewed that offered both home and facility dialysis. The 6  providers shared with us annual cost information (which ranged from  August 2006 to June 2008), including their average cost per treatment and  total annual costs for specific cost categories associated with providing  dialysis services (such as supplies, overhead, equipment, drugs,  laboratory, staff, and administrative costs). In total, we obtained cost  information from the providers on the costs for dialysis services provided  in nearly 1,600 facilities to approximately 130,000 dialysis patients,  including almost 11,000 peritoneal dialysis patients and over 850 home  hemodialysis patients. We reviewed the cost information each provider  sent to us if the provider had 20 or more patients on either home  hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis and calculated the percentage  difference in average self-reported costs between home dialysis and  dialysis provided in a facility (or chain of facilities). We also used the  cost information reported to us to calculate the providers\u2019 weekly costs providing home dialysis and dialysis in a facility. We regard the cost  information reported to us as testimonial and we did not independently  assess the accuracy of that information. We identify the cost information  as self-reported throughout this report, and we did not aggregate or  average the self-reported costs across different providers. We also  conducted interviews with representatives from the Medicare Payment  Advisory Commission (MedPAC) and professional organizations, and we  conducted site visits to two dialysis facilities that offered both home  dialysis and dialysis in a facility. In addition, to obtain information on the  costs of home dialysis, we examined over 30 articles about the costs of  home dialysis published between 2002 and 2008, obtained through a  MEDLINE literature search or recommended by representatives we  interviewed.", "To examine CMS\u2019s plans to account for the costs of home dialysis in the  expanded bundled payment, we reviewed the Secretary of HHS\u2019s 2008  Report to Congress on the Proposed Design for a Bundled ESRD  Prospective Payment System and conducted interviews with CMS officials.  We also conducted interviews with CMS\u2019s contractor, the University of  Michigan Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center (UM-KECC), dialysis  facilities, dialysis equipment suppliers, and medical experts on home  dialysis. We also interviewed dialysis providers to learn their views on  home dialysis issues that CMS should consider when developing the  expanded bundled payment for ESRD services. Appendix I provides more  detailed information on our methodology. We conducted our work from  October 2008 through May 2009, in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and  perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a  reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit  objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Individuals diagnosed with ESRD may be influenced by a variety of factors  when choosing the type of dialysis to receive. One factor that may  influence the individual\u2019s choice of dialysis is the individual\u2019s awareness  about the different types of dialysis available. For example, some  individuals may not be aware that peritoneal dialysis is an option to  replace kidney functioning and, as a result, would not choose to undergo  peritoneal dialysis. The individual\u2019s choice of which dialysis to perform  can also be influenced by the type of dialysis that the individual\u2019s  physician recommends and if the individual has a partner to assist with  dialysis treatments. Additionally, some individuals may have physical  conditions that prevent them from self-performing dialysis\u2014such as vision  problems or dexterity issues. The individual\u2019s choice may also be  influenced by how quickly the dialysis treatments need to begin\u2014as  individuals who need to urgently start dialysis may not have time to be  trained in conducting dialysis at home.", "Hemodialysis conducted in a facility typically consists of three dialysis  treatments per week. Peritoneal dialysis is conducted daily. Recent  technological changes in hemodialysis equipment have occurred, making it  easier for hemodialysis to be done more frequently. For example, a new  hemodialysis machine\u2014designed for use at home\u2014requires patients to  dialyze five to seven times per week and is reported by some dialysis  providers to be more user-friendly than traditional dialysis machines. As a  result, most home hemodialysis patients dialyze five to seven times per  week.", "Data from USRDS show that, compared to patients who dialyzed in a  facility, in 2006, home dialysis patients were more likely to be younger,  white, located in rural areas, employed, and have employer or group  health insurance coverage, and were less likely to be Hispanic. USRDS  data for 2006 also indicate that patients who received home dialysis may  be healthier than patients who dialyzed in a facility. Home dialysis patients  were more likely to be on the wait-list for a kidney transplant (which  requires a certain level of health status) and had lower rates of diabetes  and hypertension as the primary disease that caused their ESRD compared  with patients who received dialysis in a facility.", "Limited evidence suggests and several dialysis provider officials and  medical experts we interviewed believe that home dialysis results in better  clinical outcomes for individuals with ESRD. These better clinical  outcomes include better control over fluid levels, less need for dialysis  drugs, fewer hospitalizations, and better quality of life. Improved clinical  outcomes may be due to the features of home dialysis that its supporters  believe more closely mimic natural kidney functioning\u2014home dialysis can  be done more frequently with less time between treatments, for longer  periods of time than dialysis received in a facility, three times a week.  Perhaps as a result of this more frequent dialysis, USRDS reported that the  overall Medicare costs for peritoneal dialysis patients\u2014including  hospitalization costs as well as costs for dialysis services\u2014were about   26 percent less than the total Medicare costs for hemodialysis patients in  2006. Similarly, a Medicare health maintenance organization (HMO)  reported to us that moving some of its patients from facility hemodialysis  to home hemodialysis has substantially reduced hospitalizations, and  overall health costs, for those patients. That HMO has also published a  study documenting relatively low hospitalization rates for its home  hemodialysis patients.", "However, in general, it is challenging to determine the causes of  differences in clinical outcomes between patients who receive dialysis at  home versus in a facility because\u2014as we previously noted\u2014the  characteristics of patients who dialyze at home are different than those  who dialyze in a facility. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is  conducting randomized clinical trials that are intended to provide  information on the clinical outcomes associated with more frequent  dialysis received in a facility compared to dialysis received three times a  week in a facility, and with home nocturnal hemodialysis compared to  three times weekly home hemodialysis.

For peritoneal dialysis, dialysis providers  reported to us that their average costs per treatment were 48 to 68 percent  lower than the average costs per treatment for hemodialysis provided in a  facility.", "The average costs per treatment that the dialysis providers reported to us  include costs for certain items associated with providing dialysis services,  including supplies, equipment, drugs, overhead, and staff. Officials from  dialysis providers indicated to us that supply costs are higher for home  dialysis compared with dialysis provided in a facility. One reason that  supply costs for home dialysis patients are higher is because certain  supplies that can be reused for patients who receive dialysis in a facility  often cannot be reused by home patients. For example, patients who  receive dialysis in a facility can reuse their own dialyzer\u2014the artificial  kidney used to filter the blood during hemodialysis\u2014because the facility is  able to sterilize the dialyzer between dialysis treatments. Patients who  dialyze at home need to use dialyzers that are intended for one-time use,  which results in higher supply costs. In contrast, other cost items (such as  drugs and staff) were reported to be lower for home dialysis than for  dialysis provided in a facility. For example, after home dialysis patients  have been trained to conduct dialysis, there are lower staffing costs  associated with home dialysis because patients require less staffing  resources\u2014as the patients (or their caregiver) are performing the dialysis  treatments at home that are performed by staff for dialysis provided in a  facility. Table 1 provides one dialysis provider\u2019s self-reported average  costs per treatment in 2008 for hemodialysis provided in a facility  compared to hemodialysis provided at home, which indicates that the  supply costs are higher for home hemodialysis while the other items are  lower for home hemodialysis compared with hemodialysis provided in a  facility.", "Table 2 provides another dialysis provider\u2019s self-reported average costs  per treatment in 2006 for hemodialysis provided in a facility compared to  peritoneal dialysis provided at home.

Officials from these three dialysis providers indicated that the costs per  week for patients who dialyze at home were higher because these patients  typically dialyze more frequently than three times per week. Home  hemodialysis is often performed five to seven times per week. For  example, using one provider\u2019s self-reported average costs per treatment  from table 1, the average costs per treatment for home hemodialysis were  lower ($133 per treatment) compared with dialysis provided in a facility  ($243 per treatment); however, for patients who received six dialysis  treatments per week, the provider\u2019s weekly costs for home hemodialysis  were higher ($798 for six treatments during the week) compared with  dialysis provided in a facility ($729 for three treatments per week). The  other two providers reported lower costs per week for home hemodialysis  compared with dialysis provided in a facility.

Based on the officials\u2019  self-reported estimates, these dialysis providers offered dialysis services to  approximately 68 percent of all dialysis patients\u2014including an estimated  77 percent of peritoneal dialysis patients and roughly all home  hemodialysis patients.", "To examine the extent to which the costs of home dialysis differ from the  costs of dialysis provided in a facility, we obtained cost information from   six dialysis providers that we interviewed\u2014including average costs per  treatment reported in CMS\u2019s renal facility cost reports for home dialysis  and dialysis provided in a facility. Additionally, we requested that the  dialysis providers include annual cost information for specific categories  of costs associated with providing dialysis. The cost categories that we  requested were supplies, overhead, equipment and maintenance, drugs,  laboratory tests, staff, and administrative costs. We included descriptions  of what services should be included in each cost category, basing the  descriptions on CMS definitions from the renal facility cost reports. The  average costs per treatment reported to us by the dialysis providers did  not include the costs of training patients to dialyze at home. At our  request, the dialysis providers gave us separate information on the costs of  training patients to conduct home dialysis.", "Six of the 12 dialysis providers we interviewed shared with us cost  information for a 12-month period, which ranged from August 2006  through June 2008. In total, we obtained cost information from these 6  providers on the costs for dialysis services provided in nearly 1,600  facilities to approximately 130,000 dialysis patients, including almost  11,000 peritoneal dialysis patients and over 850 home hemodialysis  patients. We analyzed the cost information each provider sent to us if the  provider had 20 or more patients on either home hemodialysis or  peritoneal dialysis. Using this self-reported cost information from the  providers, we calculated the percentage difference in average costs per  treatment between dialysis provided at home and dialysis provided in a  facility (or chain of facilities). We also used the cost information reported  to us to calculate the providers\u2019 weekly costs for providing home dialysis  and dialysis in a facility. To calculate the weekly costs of home dialysis  and dialysis provided in a facility, we multiplied the average cost per  treatment by the frequency of the specific type of dialysis.", "We regard the cost information reported to us as testimonial and we did  not independently assess the accuracy of that information. We identify the  cost information as self-reported throughout the report, and we did not  aggregate or average the self-reported costs across providers.", "We also conducted interviews with representatives from the Medicare  Payment Advisory Commission and professional organizations, including  the National Kidney Foundation, the Renal Physicians Association, the  National Renal Administrators Association, and the American Association  of Kidney Patients. We also conducted site visits to two dialysis facilities  that offered both home dialysis and dialysis in a facility to obtain  additional information on how patients are trained to conduct home  dialysis as well as obtain patients\u2019 perspectives on factors associated with  performing home dialysis.", "Additionally, to obtain information on the extent to which the costs of  home dialysis are different than the costs of dialysis provided in a facility,  we examined over 30 articles about the costs of home dialysis published  between 2002 and 2008, obtained through a MEDLINE literature search or  recommended by representatives we interviewed. We also examined over  27 articles about the clinical outcomes associated with home dialysis  published between 2002 and 2008, obtained through a MEDLINE literature  search.", "To examine CMS\u2019s plans to account for the costs of home dialysis in the  expanded bundled payment, we reviewed CMS\u2019s proposed design for the  expanded bundled end-stage renal disease (ESRD) payment, outlined in  the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 2008  Report to Congress on the Proposed Design for a Bundled ESRD  Prospective Payment System. Additionally, to obtain information on how  the costs of home dialysis would be included in the expanded bundled  payment, we conducted interviews with CMS and CMS\u2019s contractor\u2014the  University of Michigan Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center. We also  conducted interviews with dialysis facilities\u2019 officials, dialysis equipment  suppliers, and medical experts on home dialysis to obtain their perspective  on the expanded bundled payment.", "We conducted our work from October 2008 through May 2009, in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Martin T.
