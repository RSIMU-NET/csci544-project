As a group, these ports primarily moved a mix of agricultural commodities (corn, soybeans, and rice); petroleum products; and crude materials (such as sand and gravel, among others). However, the ports varied individually, with some primarily moving agricultural commodities, and others moving a variety of commodities. These ports also varied in the quantity of goods transported through them, ranging from less than 1-million tons to more than 10-million tons per year. The amount of freight moved through each port tended to fluctuate each year due to various factors, such as weather, crop yields, and export markets.", "A majority of the stakeholders GAO interviewed, as well as U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) officials, stated that funding constraints limit the Corps' ability to fully dredge the 13 ports' harbors, which can affect freight movement. According to local Corps officials, they received about $13.1 million of the $20.6 million needed to fully dredge the 13 ports' harbors in fiscal year 2016. Some stakeholders told GAO that smaller ports are negatively affected by the Corps' emphasis on the amount of cargo moved (measured in tons) when making decisions about which harbors to dredge. Congress has directed the Corps to consider harbors' significance and to conduct an assessment of harbors' use and benefits\u2014considering factors beyond tonnage\u2014to inform its allocation of dredging funds. Corps officials said they have not conducted such an assessment due to funding constraints, and raised concerns about the cost-effectiveness of conducting such assessments. However, the Corps has developed some tools that may help it assess inland harbors' significance, use, and benefits. For example, Corps officials explained that they have a tool that allows them to track the amount and type of cargo moving through harbors and to estimate the value of cargo at risk if a harbor loses depth. However, a Corps official noted the cargo-at-risk metric was based on deep coastal harbors and would need to be adapted for inland harbors. A senior Corps official agreed that it could be useful to inform Congress of the Corps' existing tools and capabilities and the resources needed to adapt these tools and capabilities to address the statutory requirements related to allocating dredging funds.", "Many of the stakeholders GAO interviewed said that before considering alternative-funding options, the federal government should make more use of the current mechanism for funding dredging: the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund.

Inland waterway transportation allows  shippers to inexpensively transport large quantities of bulk commodities.  Nearly all of this freight is carried on barges, which are non-motorized  vessels that are pushed by towboats. One standard barge can carry  about 1,500 tons of freight, while one rail car can carry 100 tons of freight  and a semi-trailer can carry 26 tons of freight. The ports located on the  Mississippi River are commonly referred to as \u201cinland ports,\u201d and they are  part of a tributary system that moves U.S. agricultural products downriver  to be exported from the nation\u2019s coastal ports.

Shoaling can reduce the depth,  width, and length of these harbors, and can often make it difficult for  vessels to move in and out of the port. This situation is problematic for  ports located on the Mississippi River between St. Louis, Missouri, and  Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in part due to the high amounts of sediment  carried by the Mississippi River. Shoaling has presented problems in the  past for these ports.

There are over 900 federal harbors  and channels across the United States, and their dredging needs vary  greatly. Regular dredging is essential for harbors on the Mississippi River  because the river\u2019s depth can quickly and significantly fluctuate. Such  fluctuations can cause flooding and shoaling. To fund dredging of eligible  harbors and channels, Congress appropriates funds to the Corps through  certain Corps appropriation accounts, which are usually reimbursed from  the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund.

None of the 13  selected ports consistently experienced a year-to-year increase or  decrease throughout the 6-year time period. Stakeholders we interviewed  told us that some of the fluctuations in the total amount of tonnage moved  at individual ports is due to increases and declines in specific  commodities handled by the port. For example, at the Port of Pemiscot  County, total tons of freight increased by about 465 percent from 2012 to  2013, because of a large spike in crude petroleum shipments. The port\u2019s  total tonnage declined in later years as those shipments declined.  According to stakeholders, changes in individual commodities are also  sometimes related to changes in export market demand or crop yields, or  situations in which freight movement is impeded by harbor conditions  (discussed later in the report). For example, stakeholders told us that if  export market conditions improve for American agricultural commodities  due to a drought in another country, farmers may sell more of their  product, as opposed to storing it when prices are low. In addition, crop  yield per acre determines the amount of crop harvested, and can be  affected by weather, seed quality, and other factors.

Port stakeholders told us that their harbors  generally need annual dredging, particularly at the entrance to the harbor,  where sediment flowing down the river tends to accumulate. Corps  officials in one district agreed that the dredging needs for the ports are  fairly consistent, although weather events and river levels can affect the  amount of dredging needed. According to Corps officials, the Corps has  dredged most of the 13 selected ports\u2019 harbors most years from 2010  through 2016 (see table 3). However, port authorities we interviewed and  Corps officials noted that the Corps does not dredge all of the harbors to  their authorized dimensions (length, width, or depth) primarily due to  funding constraints. According to local Corps officials, the Corps needed approximately $20.6 million, and received approximately $13.1 million to  dredge all of the harbors and channels associated with the 13 selected  ports to their full dimensions in fiscal year 2016. While Congress provided  much more than this for the Corps to address operations and  maintenance needs, the Corps must allocate operation and maintenance  funds among hundreds of harbors and waterway projects. Nonetheless,  according to Corps officials in one district, the Corps has been able to  distribute the funds so that it can dredge enough of each harbor in that  district to keep barges moving. Some stakeholders echoed this sentiment,  stating that the Corps does a good job working with the funds that it  receives.", "As shown in table 3, the Corps has dredged most of the 13 selected  ports\u2019 harbors most years from 2010 through 2016. However, port  stakeholders provided some examples of how unmet dredging needs  have negatively affected freight movement at these ports, particularly with  respect to limiting the amount of freight moved per barge or creating  temporary harbor closures. Some of these stakeholders noted that these  situations can further lead to increased transportation costs and freight  congestion, which can have negative consequences for the industries  reliant on these ports, particularly agricultural industries.", "Light-loading: Light-loading refers to situations in which shippers  cannot load a barge to its full capacity (see figure 5). Shippers have to  light load a barge when a harbor is experiencing shoaling because a  fully loaded barge would not have enough clearance for the bottom of  the barge to pass over the shoaled areas of the harbor. Light-loading  may refer to loading a barge so that it sits anywhere from several  inches to a few feet higher above the water; but stakeholders  explained that every inch taken off the barge\u2019s draft corresponds to  about 15 to 18 fewer tons of cargo on the barge. Light loading was the  negative effect most commonly cited by port stakeholders when  discussing the effects of unmet dredging needs. Since light-loaded  barges carry less cargo than fully loaded barges, shippers must use  more barges to move the same amount of product, an outcome that  may lead to increased transportation costs. For example, one shipper  explained that its agreement with a barge company requires that the  shipper pay as if the barge is carrying a certain amount of tonnage,  regardless of the load size. Thus, during a period of light-loading, the  shipper would have to pay the barge company to move seven barges,  instead of six, and the shipper would be required to pay as if the  barges were carrying full loads. In addition to increased  transportation costs, stakeholders said that since light-loading  requires the use of more barges to move the same amount of freight;  barge shortages can occur if light-loading is widespread. One port  stakeholder told us that during periods of light-loading, it takes more  time to load the same amount of product onto barges (because of the  need to use multiple barges and the time it takes to switch each barge  out), which can lead to long lines of trucks waiting to unload their  cargo at the port.", "Harbor closures: Port stakeholders provided examples in which their  ports were shut down due to unmet dredging needs. Several  stakeholders, as well as the Corps, cited the 2012 drought as being  particularly problematic. Over the course of 15 months, the Mississippi  River fluctuated from historic flood stages in 2011 to record lows in  2012, dropping over 50 feet in some places. A significant amount of  sediment from the 2011 flood settled along the river and in harbors,  and as the water level fell, numerous harbors along the river were  shoaled in and needed dredging. In this case, the shoaling occurred  during the harvest season, which is the busiest time of year for the  agricultural ports. Representatives from two ports told us they were  shut down for 2 to 3 months, with barges full of grain stuck inside the  harbor. Stakeholders said that grain silos at ports filled because  barges could not get out of the harbors and farmers were at risk of  losing grain due to spoilage in the field. Corps officials told us that  initially, four of the ports\u2019 harbors in one district were closed during the  2012 drought; so the Corps worked to dredge two of those ports\u2019  harbors so that agricultural shippers could move cargo from some  ports. Harbor shutdowns led to increased costs as companies began  trucking product to other ports. (One company estimated it lost $5  million.) Some companies said that the increased costs led to  downward pressure on the prices paid to farmers for grain. Port  shutdowns affected non-agricultural stakeholders as well. For  example, one port representative said that the area surrounding the  port ran out of gas and diesel fuel three times because temporary  harbor closures made it difficult to bring in fuel by barge. The 2012  drought was an unusual event, but the experiences at ports during  that time provide useful insight into the critical nature of dredging at  inland harbors. Moreover, port and tenant representatives provided  other examples in which ports were temporarily shut down for a few  weeks to as much as a month in more typical years. For example, a  tenant told us that due to harbor shoaling at its port, the company  spent $98,000 to reroute 14 incoming barges to another location on  the river, unload the cargo at that location, and truck the cargo into its  port.", "Port and industry representatives explained that the increased  transportation costs created by light-loading and harbor closures are of  particular concern because the affected industries operate on very small  profit margins. In particular, agricultural companies and trade associations  noted that one of the main reasons that their exports can compete in the  global market is because of their low transportation costs. Some industry  representatives raised concerns about their ability to switch to shipping  cargo by truck or rail, explaining that shipping by barge is far more  economical.", "In addition, port stakeholders noted that funding constraints that limit the  Corps\u2019 ability to fully dredge their ports have led to increased costs for  them. Although port stakeholders varied in their financial ability to pay for  dredging, some stakeholders reported that they took their own steps to open their harbor by hiring a dredge or excavating part of the harbor  themselves. For example, one port representative said that his port  recently spent an additional $75,000 to further dredge the harbor because  the Corps did not have enough funding to fully dredge it. In addition,  another port used funds from other sources to pay to dredge its harbor in  2010, 2011, and 2013.", "Port and industry stakeholders also told us that the uncertainty related to  the annual decisions made in the federal budget process and whether the  Corps will have enough funding to dredge their harbors creates  challenges in attracting tenants. The Corps and the ports are not sure of  how much funding will be provided in a given year until Congress passes  the Corps\u2019 annual appropriation, as is the case with any activity funded  through the annual federal budget process. Once the funding amounts  and allocations are known, the Corps releases a work plan outlining  which harbors will be dredged and the amount of funding allocated to  each harbor. Port stakeholders stated that the funding uncertainty can  affect their ability to attract tenants, which need clarity about the reliability  of dredging when determining whether to spend millions of dollars to build  facilities, such as grain silos, that will last decades at the port. One port  provided an example in which a new tenant faced significantly increased  costs because the harbor was not dredged and the tenant had to light- load its cargo.

Based on interviews with Corps  officials and our reviews of budget guidance documents, when assessing  which projects to fund during the annual budget process, the Corps uses  a risk-based matrix that considers condition versus consequence, and  based on each value, assigns the project an overall risk score. With  respect to dredging inland harbors, the anticipated condition is based on  the expected level of shoaling, and the consequence is based on the  average annual tonnage moved by the port over the past 5 years, and  other factors, such as imminent life-safety impacts. Consequence is rated  on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being the most severe. For example, ports  that move less than 1-million tons of freight are ranked as \u201c4,\u201d or \u201clow  economic impact.\u201d In interviews, Corps officials identified other factors  that they consider when allocating funds for dredging, such as whether  nearby ports will be dredged, but several Corps officials pointed to  tonnage shipped as the primary factor they use to make dredging  decisions. In addition, Corps officials noted that funding for low- commercial use ports\u2014ports that on average ship less than 1-million tons  per year\u2014was reduced in the fiscal year 2012 budget and subsequent  budgets, in response to a 2010 Memorandum from the Office of  Management and Budget.", "Stakeholders, including representatives of smaller ports as well as a  barge operator and industry associations that we spoke to, raised  concerns about the Corps\u2019 emphasis on tonnage and its effects on which  ports are selected for dredging, with some stating that other factors  should be considered (such as economic impact or cargo value). Some  stakeholders and an expert stated that if ports do not receive dredging  and barges moving through that harbor have to light-load or temporarily  cannot move through the port, then industries may leave the port; the cost  of dredging may increase as sediment builds, and the port may face more  difficulties meeting the 1-million-ton threshold. Corps officials  acknowledged stakeholders\u2019 concerns related to the low-commercial use  ports\u2019 ability to compete in the prioritization process and stated that they  have worked to request more funding for these ports since funding was  cut in fiscal year 2012. However, a senior Corps official also noted that  the inland ports make up a very small percentage of the Corps\u2019 overall  national navigation project portfolio and therefore competition for  constrained resources is very keen.", "Congress has taken steps to try to address this issue, such as requiring  the Corps to allocate a minimum amount of the funds to be reimbursed  from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund on low tonnage ports. In  addition, Congress has emphasized the importance of considering factors beyond tonnage. For example, when allocating funds from the Harbor  Maintenance Trust Fund among eligible harbors and channels, the Corps  is directed by statute not to base its allocation of funds solely on the  amount of tonnage transiting through the harbors. In addition, in  determining an equitable allocation, the Secretary of the Army is required  to consider:  the national and regional significance of harbor operations and  maintenance; and a biennial assessment of the needs and uses of the harbors, which  should include, to the extent practicable, the national, regional, and  local benefits of such uses, including the use of harbors for:  commercial navigation and the movement of goods; domestic and  international trade; commercial fishing; subsistence; harbors of  refuge; transportation of persons; domestic energy production; use by  the Coast Guard or Navy; emergency response; recreation purposes;  and other authorized uses.", "When providing appropriations for the Corps, Congress has also  suggested the Corps consider issues beyond tonnage when allocating  funds for dredging. Based on our reviews of budget guidance  documents and interviews with Corps officials, the Corps does collect  data on many of the factors identified by Congress in law and in the  language accompanying the appropriations act. For example, the Corps  collects information on whether the harbor is used for some of the  purposes outlined in the statute (for example; commercial fishing,  transportation of persons, whether the harbor is used by the Coast  Guard); however, a senior Corps official noted that many of these factors  are more applicable to the coastal harbors and channels and are not as  applicable to the inland harbors. In addition, Corps officials told us they  may note specific circumstances about the regional importance of a port  when submitting a budget package to dredge its harbor (for example, if industries in the port lack access to other modes of transportation).  However, Corps officials told us that due to funding limitations, they have  not conducted the statutorily required assessments of the national and  regional significance of the harbor operations and maintenance, or of the  local, regional, and national benefits from the use of the harbors. A senior  Corps official noted that the cost to do an in-depth economic analysis of a  port may be equivalent to the cost of dredging some of these harbors,  and the results of the economic analyses may not change which harbors  are ultimately prioritized for dredging.", "However, the Corps has developed some internal tools that might help it  assess data related to some of the factors that Congress has required the  Corps to consider when allocating funds from the Harbor Maintenance  Trust Fund, such as the national and regional significance of harbor  operations and maintenance, and the use and benefit of the harbor for  domestic trade. For example, a Corps official from the Corps\u2019 Engineer  Research and Development Center (ERDC) explained that ERDC  developed a web-based \u201cchannel portfolio tool\u201d that collates, summarizes,  and visualizes detailed data from the Corps\u2019 Waterborne Commerce  Statistics Center to help district officials understand the direct role of  dredging on the movement of cargo through coastal ports and the inland  waterway system. The tool is scalable, meaning that users can view the  data for the entire river system, for specific combinations of harbors, or for  specific harbors. Corps officials using the tool can select specific harbors  and quickly access annualized data on how many tons of various  commodities moved through the location, the depths of loaded barges  (which can be compared to present shoaling conditions), and the origin  and destination of the cargo. Further, the official explained that the Corps  has also used the tool to generate metrics on the amount and the dollar  value of cargo at risk when harbors lose 5 feet of depth. The official  further added that these metrics capture the cargo most at risk during  periods of shoaling or low water conditions, thereby enabling objective  comparisons across harbors. In addition, according to a Corps official, the  Corps\u2019 Institute for Water Resources has a tool that provides a detailed  model that uses a variety of data about the coastal harbors, including  their ship depths and cargo value, to better inform budgetary decisions.  The official added that this tool potentially could be expanded to inland  harbors.", "The tools described above suggest that the Corps has tools already  available that may help it better assess the additional factors that  Congress required it by statute to consider when allocating dredging  funds. For example, information about vessel depths, barge traffic, cargo  value, and destination used in the channel portfolio tool could help the  Corps assess the needs, use, and significance of harbor operations and  maintenance by demonstrating the effects from unmet dredging needs  (e.g., the frequency and duration of light-loading and the estimated impact  on shipping costs), and comparing the relative effects among inland ports.  However, Corps officials told us that additional work would be needed to  develop useful metrics for inland ports, since the existing analyses have  focused on coastal ports. For example, as previously noted, one tool  estimates impacts from a loss of 5 feet of draft at a deep-draft coastal  harbor, but an official stated it would be rare for an inland harbor to lose  that much depth. Furthermore, the value of using the existing tools in this  new context would depend on the reliability and the costs of this new  approach, which are currently unknown. As noted above, Corps officials  stated that funding constraints have prevented them from conducting the  statutorily required assessments of the significance of harbor operations  and maintenance. However, we developed a framework for examining  agencies\u2019 efforts to manage declining resources, and a key sub-theme  within that framework is the importance of consulting with Congress to  consider how budget decisions align with congressional goals, constituent  needs, and industry concerns. A senior Corps official agreed that it may  be beneficial for the Corps to provide Congress with information on the  extent to which the Corps\u2019 existing tools could be adapted to allow it to  consider factors beyond tonnage when allocating dredging funds, the  limitations of using these tools, as well as the amount of additional  resources that may be needed to pursue such an approach."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Many Stakeholders Favored Continued Use of the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund and Identified Potential Challenges of Alternative-Funding Options", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Stakeholders Preferred the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund for Funding Dredging", "paragraphs": ["Many stakeholders and experts we interviewed said that the federal  government should make more use of the current mechanism for funding  dredging\u2014the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund\u2014before considering  alternative-funding options.

Stakeholders also noted that the fund has a balance that is  available for such projects. However, the money from this fund is only  available for these purposes if Congress makes an appropriation out of  the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund. Congress has taken steps to  increase spending from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund; however,  other factors may affect the use of the trust fund. For example, to  balance competing priorities among government programs and meet  budgetary spending caps, Congress may choose to appropriate more or  less funding from a trust fund than requested by an agency.

Additional  details on the challenges are below:  Financial effects on users and local governments: Stakeholders raised  concerns that a user fee or tax or a state and local contribution would  negatively affect users and those governments. For example,  stakeholders representing port tenants, shippers, and trade associations  stated that a user fee could raise waterborne transportation costs and  negatively affect shippers. State department of transportation officials  stated that there could be a shift to alternative transportation modes if  barge rates increased, which could lead to more congestion and surface  degradation on roads. However, experts noted that alternative modes are  more costly than water transportation, so any diversion to these modes  would depend on the extent of the increase in water transportation costs.  Stakeholders such as ports, port tenants, and state departments of  transportation officials also stated that many of the selected ports in our  review do not have the financial resources to provide a funding  contribution, and that it may be difficult to secure state or local funds from  rural, low income counties and states where a number of the inland ports  are located. More generally, we have reported that state and local  governments face long-term fiscal pressures, which may limit their ability  to contribute to dredging costs for harbors in their jurisdiction.", "Impact on Inland Waterways Trust Fund: Stakeholders representing  ports, port tenants, and state department of transportation officials stated  that the Inland Waterways Trust Fund has a backlog of lock and dam  projects that need funding, and any expanded use (absent an increase in  the fuel tax) of the fund\u2019s revenues on maintenance dredging would  reduce available funds for locks and dams. In addition, port tenants,  ports, and a state department of transportation official noted that directing  funds to locks and dams, many of which are decades old and in need of  repairs, may be a better use of funds than for dredging. For example, a  port tenant noted that a lock failure would have more significant effects to  more users than shoaling at one harbor.", "Alternative funding options may not result in more predictable funding for  dredging: Stakeholders and a state department of transportation official  stated that requiring a state or local contribution may not result in more  consistent funding given state and local budget processes and priorities.  A state department of transportation official noted that funds for dredging  could compete with other local needs, such as schools. When discussing  alternative options generally, a Corps official said that since there is an  existing mechanism that collects funds that can be appropriated for  dredging\u2014the Harbor Maintenance Tax\u2014other options may not be  feasible.

The Congressional Budget Office,  Congressional Research Service, and the Transportation Research Board  have also noted the benefits of maritime users paying more for their  infrastructure use. State department of transportation officials as well as  experts noted that a new user fee may be more appropriate than a tax as  it would mean one is paying for their use rather than paying a general tax.  However, experts and some of the state departments of transportation  officials cautioned that any alternative funding option imposed on just one  section of the inland waterways would likely raise equity concerns and  could put those inland ports at a competitive disadvantage. Thus, they  emphasized that any alternative funding option should be applied to all  U.S. inland waterways and not just those in the scope of this report.", "Use of state and local revenues for dredging: Some stakeholders,  including port tenants and shippers, believe that they already pay for  dredging through state, local, and port taxes and fees. Some of these  stakeholders gave reasons why a state or local contribution could be  warranted. First, one port tenant, one state department of transportation  official and two experts noted that state and local governments benefit  from operating ports, which contribute to their economies. In addition,  stakeholders representing port tenants and a state department of  transportation agency, as well as one expert, noted that state and local  governments and ports have provided funding for landside investments at  ports, and it is therefore in their interest to maintain port access to the  river. We have previously reported that investments being made in  maritime infrastructure should be considered as part of state and national  freight planning. In addition, some stakeholders noted that using state  and local revenues to fund dredging could be an option if it could be used  to match federal government funds. A Corps official noted that it is  currently possible for non-federal entities to provide \u201ccontributed funds\u201d to  the Corps for dredging, but none has done so yet for this particular  segment of the Mississippi River. However, Corps officials stated that  they have received contributed funds for dredging in other regions, and as  previously noted, some ports have paid for their own dredging in certain  cases and port tenants are already financially responsible for dredging  around their docks.", "Stakeholders representing shippers said that they might be more inclined  to consider an alternative-funding option if the benefits of a particular  option outweighed the costs.

Specifically, we analyzed the types and amount of freight  transported through these ports annually, as measured by weight, from  2010 through 2015. These data are referred to as annual tonnage data,  and include total waterborne tonnage, whether the tonnage was moving  into or out of the port, and the amount and types of commodities moved  through the port. We analyzed these data to determine whether we could  identify any trends in the movement of freight in these ports. To assess  the reliability of the data, we reviewed a 2009 GAO report that discussed  the reliability of Corps\u2019 tonnage data and then interviewed Corps officials  at the Waterborne Commerce Statistics Center about any changes that  had occurred in the data collection, receipt, handling, and storage  processes since that review, as well as their current processes for  ensuring the reliability of the data.

We also conducted site visits at 7 of the 13 selected ports to  interview port directors, harbor services companies, and tenants in  person, and to gain an in-depth understanding of how shoaling can affect  their harbors. To select the ports we interviewed and visited, we used  information provided by the Corps on relevant federal dredging projects  and the corresponding inland shallow-draft ports in this section of the  river. Through initial research and interviews, we determined which  factors may contribute to variations in ports\u2019 dredging needs, extent of  dredging received, and the effect of unmet dredging needs. Based on  those factors, we selected ports for site visits and interviews to ensure  diversity in total tonnage, the percentage of inbound and outbound freight  traffic at the port, the types of commodities most frequently handled,  geographic location (including which Corps District they were located in),  the funding source for dredging, and prior dredging history, based on  information provided by the Corps. In addition to interviewing port  directors and tenants, we also conducted interviews with industry  stakeholders such as barge companies, trade associations, and shippers  as well as academic experts. We also interviewed officials at the United  States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Marketing Service\u2019s  Transportation Services Division to discuss their research on agricultural  transportation.

We used these initial interviews to collect the stakeholders\u2019  general views on potential alternative-funding options, as well as the  benefits and challenges of those options. From these interviews and  literature searches, we identified the three types of options that were most  commonly discussed: a new user fee or tax, a state or local contribution,  and expanding the use of the Inland Waterways Trust Fund for  dredging. We then interviewed 33 stakeholders representing ports,  tenants, shippers, barge companies, and state transportation agencies to  collect their opinions on the benefits and challenges of each of the three  types of options. We selected stakeholders to interview based on a  review of related reports and suggestions from other interviewees, and  we included port tenants and representatives from the ports we  interviewed. In addition to these stakeholders, we interviewed five experts  on their views of the benefits and challenges of the alternative funding  options. The experts were identified through a literature search and our  prior, related reports on inland waterways and surface transportation  funding and financing.
