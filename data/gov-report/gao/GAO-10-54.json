Given these concerns, Government Accountability Office (GAO) was asked to examine the new requirements and determine whether Labor's new requirements will provide (1) clear and understandable guidance to plan sponsors and (2) useful information to Labor and others.

Specifically, they have questions regarding the distinction between eligible and ineligible indirect compensation, that is, which types of indirect compensation must be reported on the Form 5500 (compensation that qualifies as \"eligible\" does not have to be reported). Labor's guidance on its Web site thus far has been limited, and, according to sponsors and service providers GAO spoke with, has raised additional questions that remain unanswered. Specifically, Labor has not provided sufficient guidance for sponsors and providers to accurately determine what elements of compensation qualify as eligible indirect compensation (fees or expense reimbursements charged to investment funds and reflected in the value of the investment). Therefore, interpretations have been left up to sponsors and providers and may result in a range of reporting practices, causing Labor to receive inconsistent and incomplete data. In addition to the new Form 5500 requirements, Labor has proposed another regulation on service provider fee disclosure (its 408(b)(2) regulation), but it has not yet been finalized. Sponsors and service providers GAO talked with stressed the importance of coordinating this initiative with the new Form 5500 requirements. Doing so may reduce the burden and the cost to service providers of making changes to their data gathering and reporting systems and clarify for plan sponsors the information they need to understand and compare the fees charged by various service providers. In GAO's discussions with Labor officials, they agreed that there was a need to coordinate the two regulations, and said that although they are working to finalize the proposed 408(b)(2) regulation, it is uncertain when it will be published. Labor officials told GAO that they do not have specific plans for using the data received as a result of the new Form 5500 requirements and will wait to see what information is reported before deciding what to do with the data. Although Labor's new requirements are meant to ensure that plan sponsors obtain the information they need to assess the compensation paid to service providers for services rendered to the plan, the Form 5500 may not provide useful information to Labor and others. Because plan sponsors are likely to report indirect compensation in varying formats, it is unclear how Labor will be able to compare such data across plans. In addition, GAO previously reported that the information provided to Labor on the Form 5500 has limited use for effectively overseeing fees paid by 401(k) plans because it does not explicitly list all of the fees paid from plan assets, yet these types of fees comprise the majority of fees in 401(k) plans. For example, plan sponsors are not required to explicitly report asset-based fees that are netted from an investment fund's performance, even though they receive this information for each of the mutual funds they offer in the 401(k) plan. Thus, despite the changes to the Form 5500, the new information provided may not be very useful to Labor, plan sponsors, and others."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Labor (Labor) uses its Form 5500 as a tool to monitor  and enforce plan sponsors\u2019 responsibilities under the Employee  Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). By filing the Form 5500,  plan sponsors satisfy the requirement to file annual reports concerning,  among other things, the financial condition and operation of plans. In  2004, Labor\u2019s ERISA Advisory Council Working Group reported that the  Form 5500 Annual Return/Report (Form 5500), as it was then structured,  did not reflect the way that the defined contribution plan fee structure  works. At that time, only those fees that were billed explicitly and were  paid directly from plan assets were deemed reportable. The Advisory  Council concluded that Form 5500s filed by defined contribution plans  were of little use to policy makers, government enforcement personnel,  plan sponsors, and participants in terms of understanding the cost of a  plan, and recommended that Labor modify it so that all fees incurred  either directly or indirectly by these plans would be reported. As a part of  three regulatory initiatives to improve disclosures provided to various  parties, Labor issued final regulations in November 2007, making changes  to facilitate a transition to an electronic filing system and to update the  annual reporting forms, effective for the 2009 plan year. With these  regulations, Labor made changes to the reporting of service provider  compensation on the Schedule C of the Form 5500.

In addition, questions have been  raised by industry experts over whether the new changes impose  significant costs on service providers as they track and disclose the  additional information, and whether these costs will be passed on to plan  participants. Given these concerns, GAO was asked to examine the new  requirements in Labor\u2019s final regulations and form revision and to answer  the following questions:  1.  Do Labor\u2019s new requirements provide clear and understandable  guidance to plan sponsors? 2.  Will the new requirements provide useful information to Labor and  others?", "To determine whether Labor\u2019s new requirements provide clear and  understandable guidance to plan sponsors, we interviewed nine plan  sponsors. We randomly selected three plan sponsors from the Form 5500  database, and selected six plan sponsors referred by industry  associations, plan service providers, well-known industry experts,  industry associations, researchers, and Labor. We also reviewed related  documents from Labor, such as its compliance assistance and technical  guidance information, and frequently asked questions (FAQ) from its Web  site that are meant to aid employers in complying with the new regulations  and forms revision. In addition, we reviewed ERISA and relevant  regulations governing 401(k) plans, including Labor\u2019s proposed  regulations, to understand current and proposed annual reporting  requirements. We interviewed and collected documentation from those  affected by the new Schedule C requirements, to get their views on  whether these new requirements will provide useful information to Labor,  plan sponsors, and others. We also interviewed and collected  documentation from a variety of stakeholders, including plan sponsors,  service providers, industry and consumer associations, attorneys, and  Labor. We obtained these stakeholders\u2019 views on the new requirements  and identified any challenges sponsors might face. We also collected and  analyzed information on the Form 5500 from other sources, such as the  reports and testimonies from ERISA Advisory Council Working Groups.

Whether a plan sponsor receives the required  written disclosures is the key to whether indirect compensation is  reportable on the Schedule C.", "According to Labor, reporting indirect compensation as EIC is an option  that the sponsor may choose instead of reporting under the rules  applicable to other indirect compensation. Indirect compensation does not  qualify as EIC if a service provider does not provide the required  disclosures to the plan sponsor. In this case, the plan sponsor is required  to report the available information from the service provider on the  Schedule C, such as the identity of the service provider and nature of the  services provided. The plan sponsor is also required to list the service  provider for failing to or refusing to provide necessary information.  However, if the plan sponsor does receive information from the service  provider upon request, the plan sponsor has the option of reporting the  indirect compensation as EIC (i.e., reporting only that indirect  compensation was paid and who provided the disclosure).", "Many of the fees and expenses associated with mutual fund investments  are not explicitly reported on the Form 5500. According to a 2004 report  by Labor\u2019s ERISA Advisory Council Working Group on Plan Fees and  Reporting on Form 5500, many 401(k) and 403(b) plans have moved  toward using mutual funds as an investment option. With mutual funds,  the plan service provider takes the investment management fees and  expenses of managing the mutual fund directly from the mutual fund  earnings, and these fees are not explicitly reported to plan sponsors.  Without data on mutual funds, the largest component of most 401(k)  retirement plans, Labor is unable to fully assess the impact of service  provider fees on investment returns. In our November 2006 report, we  recommended that Congress consider a statutory change with explicit  disclosure requirements for service providers. Without such a change, we  concluded, Labor will continue to lack comprehensive information on all  fees being charged directly or indirectly to 401(k) plans.

Figure 2 illustrates the potential  difficulty. For example, a plan pays a recordkeeper direct compensation to  administer the plan, which includes sending new participants a welcome  packet about the plan. Part of the compensation that the recordkeeper  receives goes toward paying a fulfillment vendor to make the welcome  packets and send them to participants. The fulfillment vendor, in turn,  pays a printer to print and collate the packets. As a result, there are  multiple layers of payments involved, and sponsors and experts were  unsure of how much of the indirect compensation they should be required  to disclose.

Sponsors and service providers said that they were  uncertain about the new Schedule C requirement to report noncash  compensation, which is also a type of indirect compensation. Sixty-three  percent (12 of 19) of members who responded to the industry survey  reported insufficient guidance on this issue. For example, one plan  sponsor explained that he was not sure how he would handle, or whether  he would even report, the noncash compensation benefit (food,  entertainment, and making contacts) of attending a marketing event  designed to facilitate future sales of ERISA plans. Respondents (service  providers) in the industry survey were asked to imagine that their  organization sponsored a similar event for customers and potential  customers. Respondents were evenly split on how they would  communicate the value of the benefit to attendees for purposes of  Schedule C reporting.

Labor has requirements that govern the entering of a service agreement  between a sponsor and service provider, referred to as the 408(b)(2)  requirements, and has proposed changes to them that have not yet been  finalized. Consequently, the new Schedule C requirements, or \u201cafter-the- fact\u201d disclosures,\u201d were finalized before the 408(b)(2) regulation, which  governs \u201cup-front\u201d disclosures. Since plan sponsors report on the Schedule  C an after-the-fact summary of the fees and expenses paid by their plans  during the plan year, the information provided on this form is directly  related to information about fees and expenses that service providers will  be required to disclose to plan sponsors by the 408(b)(2) requirements \u201cup  front,\u201d at the beginning of a service relationship.

The officials told us that the move to require electronic filing for the 2009  plan year led them to finalize the Schedule C requirements first.

Service  providers had anticipated that the 408(b)(2) regulations would have  already been finalized to coordinate with the changes to the Form 5500 to  ensure they comply with both sets of rules at once. Without the  coordination, service providers are in the position of potentially having to  make expensive investments to update their data systems two separate  times.

According to Labor officials, the intent is  for plan sponsors to understand and then obtain the information they need  to determine the reasonableness of the fees they are paying. Since service  providers often prepare the Form 5500 on behalf of plan sponsors, the  regulatory changes are also designed to notify service providers that  compensation information should be provided to sponsors. Still, Labor and  others are concerned that some service providers, who may not feel bound  by Labor\u2019s reporting requirements, may neglect to list the indirect  compensation they may have received.", "Finally, the Form 5500 continues to have limited use for Labor, sponsors,  and participants.", "Labor. Despite Labor\u2019s efforts with the new Form 5500 requirements,  information on asset-based fees is still not explicitly required to be  reported on the form. As we have previously reported, the form does not  explicitly list all of the fees paid from plan assets. For example, plan  sponsors were not required to report mutual fund investment fees to  Labor, even though they received this information for each of the mutual  funds they offered in the 401(k) plan in the form of a prospectus. While  prospectuses are provided to SEC, on a fund-by-fund basis, neither SEC  nor Labor have readily available information to be able to link individual  fund information to the various 401(k) plans to which the funds may be  offered as investment options. Furthermore, prospectuses provide fees as  expense ratios, which are used as an intermediate step in calculating net  rates of return, and, as such, the dollar amount of deductions from plan  assets are not explicitly stated.", "Labor officials told us that asset-based fees are now required to be  reported on the Schedule C. However, even with the changes made to the  reporting of indirect compensation, plan sponsors may wind up only  reporting the presence of such fees on the Schedule C along with the  identity of the service provider. Because these fees are already reported to  SEC, the service provider must either (1) provide the plan sponsor with a  document that discloses the documents already sent to SEC, with  references to the pages or sections of the documents that contain the  required information, or (2) determine whether the amount of the fund\u2019s  investment management fee that is allocable to the specific 401(k) plan is  enough to be reportable, and then provide the dollar amount or a  description of the formula used to calculate the amount of the  compensation to the plan sponsor. The plan sponsor can then treat the  asset-based fee or compensation as EIC and only report the identity of the  service provider. Without information on all of the fees charged directly or  indirectly to 401(k) plans, Labor is limited in its ability to identify fees that  may be questionable.", "Labor officials told us that the changes to the Form 5500 were not meant  to result in a comprehensive database of plan fees, because Labor did not  want to put an undue burden on plan sponsors to comply with the new  Form 5500 requirements. Labor asserts the expansion of the Schedule C is  already significant. In addition, Labor officials told us that because the  Schedule C is only filled out by larger plans with more than 100  participants, the schedule is not a complete picture of the universe of plan  fees.", "Sponsors. The Form 5500 may also not be the best vehicle for sponsors to  assess service provider fee reasonableness or to understand business  arrangements between service providers, since the form is filed long after  the plan sponsor has already engaged the provider and selected the  investment options. For the most part, the form is filled out for plan  sponsors by service providers, who know the compensation arrangements  and how to calculate the fees charged. According to industry experts,  determining the dollar amounts to attach to ineligible indirect  compensation is a source of confusion, because although some indirect  compensation is straightforward, the calculation of other compensation is  left to the best judgment of the service provider. Also, service providers  may also choose to disclose only the formulas they use to determine  ineligible indirect compensation, making it difficult for sponsors to assess  fees or understand business arrangements.", "Participants. Participant groups told us that plan sponsors who use the  Form 5500 to inform participants are likely to overwhelm participants with  the volume and detail required as a result of Labor\u2019s new regulations.

However, the changes made seem unlikely to  resolve the issues surrounding service provider disclosure to plan  sponsors. Absent detailed guidance aimed at clarifying the indirect  compensation reporting requirements, Labor is at risk of receiving  inconsistent and incomparable information on the Schedule C. In addition,  the new requirements currently give plan sponsors the option of not  disclosing EIC on the Schedule C. If Labor allows certain indirect  compensation to be deemed EIC, and therefore not to be reported, Labor  will continue to have incomplete information on compensation received  by service providers, and will be no better informed.", "Similarly, as long as asset-based fees netted from an investment fund\u2019s  performance are not required to be reported on the Form 5500, sponsors,  participants, and Labor will not know the true costs of a plan.

In addition, it is unclear whether plan sponsors will  actually receive the information on service provider compensation that  Labor believes is important for them to have. Because of the option to  distinguish indirect compensation as either eligible or ineligible, service  providers may choose to qualify their compensation as EIC and not  provide their disclosures to plan sponsors.", "Meanwhile, Labor has also proposed regulatory changes that could  eliminate some of the confusion surrounding 408(b)(2) disclosure  requirements. However, it is unclear whether the final regulations will be  coordinated with the existing changes to the Form 5500 reporting  requirements. Coordinating these initiatives may reduce the burden and  the cost to service providers and clarify for plan sponsors the information  they need for the service provider selection and renewal processes.", "Finally, as we suggested in our November 2006 report, absent a statutory  change with explicit requirements for service providers, Labor will  continue to lack comprehensive information on all fees being charged  directly or indirectly to 401(k) plans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To minimize the possibility that inconsistent and incomparable  information will be reported on the Schedule C and to ensure that the data  collected results in meaningful information for Labor, sponsors, and  participants, we recommend that the Secretary of Labor take the following  action:    Provide additional guidance regarding the reporting of indirect  compensation and require that all indirect compensation be disclosed on  the Schedule C.", "Furthermore, consistent with our previous recommendation, to ensure  comparable disclosure among all types of service providers and ensure  that all investment products\u2019 fees are fairly disclosed, we recommend that  the Secretary of Labor take the following action:    Require asset-based fees that are netted from an investment fund\u2019s  performance (and, as such, are not paid with plan assets) be explicitly  reported on the Form 5500.", "To reduce the potential for additional costs and burden being placed on  service providers, we recommend that the Secretary of Labor take the  following action:    Coordinate the implementation of the Form 5500 revisions with the  publication of its final 408(b)(2) regulations, since the two initiatives are  closely related."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Department of Labor (Labor). We  received written comments from the Assistant Secretary for Employee  Benefits Security Administration, which we reproduced in appendix I.  Labor generally agreed with our recommendations. Labor also provided  technical comments, which we have incorporated in this report where  appropriate.", "Labor stated that it is committed to making the shift to the expanded  Schedule C reporting requirements as smooth as possible, and that it has  already engaged in substantial outreach on the new reporting  requirements. Specifically, regarding our recommendation that Labor  provide additional guidance on the reporting of indirect compensation,  Labor stated that it has plans to continue its outreach efforts, including  publishing additional Schedule C guidance. Regarding our  recommendation that all indirect compensation be disclosed on the  Schedule C and that asset-based fees be explicitly reported on the Form  5500, Labor explained that it had originally proposed that all indirect  compensation charged against a plan\u2019s investments be required to be  reported on the Schedule C, without providing an alternative reporting  option. However, Labor provided an alternative reporting option for  eligible indirect compensation to plan fiduciaries on the basis of  comments received on the proposed rule. Labor stated that the alternative  reporting option would provide the department with enough information  to engage in effective oversight activities. Labor also stated that once  Schedule C reporting begins (for most plans, July 2010 and later), it will be  able to evaluate the data it receives, taking into consideration our  recommendation. Although Labor stated in its comments that its eligible  indirect compensation reporting requirements are intended to help ensure  fiduciaries are collecting information and evaluating service provider  indirect compensation, we believe that it is also important for the indirect  compensation information to be reported to Labor. As we stated in our  report, we continue to believe that Labor will not receive enough  information to engage in effective oversight activities. Finally, Labor stated  that it agreed with our recommendation to coordinate the implementation  of the Form 5500 regulations with the publication of its final 408(b)(2)  regulation, and that it will continue to coordinate the two initiatives.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce its contents  earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days after the date of this  report.
