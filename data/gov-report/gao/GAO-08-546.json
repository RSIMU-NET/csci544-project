Medical readiness is essential to their performing needed duties, and an impairment that limits a soldier's capacities represents risk to the soldier, the unit, and the mission. Asked to review the Army's compliance with its guidance, GAO examined the extent to which the Army is (1) adhering to its medical and deployment requirements regarding decisions to send soldiers with medical conditions to Iraq and Afghanistan, and (2) deploying soldiers with medical conditions requiring duty limitations, and assigning them to duties suitable for their limitations. GAO reviewed Army guidance, and medical records for those preparing to deploy between April 2006 and March 2007; interviewed Army officials and commanders at Forts Benning, Stewart, and Drum, selected for their high deployment rates; and surveyed deployed soldiers with medical limitations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Army guidance allows commanders to deploy soldiers with medical conditions requiring duty limitations, subject to certain requirements, but the Army lacks enforcement mechanisms to ensure that all requirements are met, and medical record keeping problems obstruct the Army's visibility over these soldiers' conditions. A soldier diagnosed with an impairment must be given a physical profile form designating numerically the severity of the condition and, if designated 3 or higher (more severe), must be evaluated by a medical board. Commanders must then determine proper duty assignments based on soldiers' profile and commanders' staffing needs. From a random projectable sample, GAO estimates that 3 percent of soldiers from Forts Benning, Stewart, and Drum who had designations of 3 did not receive required board evaluations prior to being deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan for the period studied. In some cases, soldiers were not evaluated because commanders lacked timely access to profiles; in other cases, commanders did not take timely actions. The Army also had problems with retention and completeness of profiles; although guidance requires that approved profiles be retained in soldiers' medical records, 213 profiles were missing from the sample of 685 records reviewed. The Army was not consistent in assigning numerical designations reflecting soldiers' abilities to perform functional activities. GAO estimates from a random projectable sample that 7 percent of soldiers from these three installations had profiles indicating their inability to perform certain functional activities, yet carrying numerical designators below 3. While medical providers can \"upgrade\" numerical designations discretionarily based on knowledge of soldiers' conditions, the upgrades can mask limitations and cause commanders to deploy soldiers without needed board evaluations. While GAO found no evidence of widespread revision in profile designations, some soldiers interviewed or surveyed disagreed with their designations yet were reluctant to express concerns for fear of prejudicial treatment. The Army has instituted a program to provide ombudsmen to whom soldiers can bring medical concerns, but it is targeted at returning soldiers and is not well publicized as a resource for all soldiers with medical conditions. Without timely board evaluations and retention of profile information for deploying soldiers with medical conditions, the Army lacks full visibility and commanders must make medical readiness, deployment, and duty assignment decisions without being fully informed of soldiers' medical limitations. GAO estimates that about 10 percent of soldiers with medical conditions that could require duty limitations were deployed from the three installations, but survey response was too limited to enable GAO to project the extent to which they were assigned to suitable duties. Along with interviews, however, responses suggest that both soldiers and commanders believe soldiers are generally assigned to duties that accommodate their medical conditions. Occasional exceptions have occurred when a profile did not reflect all necessary medical information or a soldier's special skill was difficult to replace. Officials said soldiers sometimes understate their conditions to be deployed with their units, or overstate them to avoid deployment."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["From fiscal years 2004 through 2007, the average number of active and  reserve servicemembers deployed by the Department of Defense (DOD)  has increased about 19 percent, from 216,000 to 256,000 servicemembers,  in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and the Global War on Terrorism.  The Army has been the major source of servicemembers supporting  continued operations, and the increasing need for able warfighters has  meant longer and multiple deployments for its soldiers. Serving in the  armed forces requires the medical readiness necessary to plan and execute  duties to meet operational goals. Any medical or psychological condition  that limits the ability of a servicemember to execute his or her duties  represents a risk to the servicemember, the unit, and the accomplishment  of the mission. Military commanders, medical providers, and  servicemembers share the responsibility for medical readiness as an  integrated effort to ensure that servicemembers are ready to fight in  support of ongoing operations.", "Whenever a soldier is diagnosed with a medical condition, Army guidance  requires that medical providers document the soldier\u2019s limitations in his or  her medical record with a permanent or temporary physical profile,  describing the soldier\u2019s medical condition and physical capability. These  medical providers, who serve as the profiling officers, must also assign a  numerical designation reflecting the extent of any limitation on a scale  from 1 to 4, such that a designation of 1 indicates that a soldier has a high  level of medical fitness, while a designation of 4 signifies a drastically  limited ability to perform military duties due to one or more medical  conditions or defects. A designation of 3 indicates that a soldier has one  or more medical conditions that may require significant duty limitations,  and the soldier should receive duty assignments that are commensurate  with his or her limitations. Once soldiers receive a permanent profile  indicating that they have a permanent or chronic medical condition that  may require significant limitations in assignment, Army guidance generally  requires further evaluation of the soldiers\u2019 ability to perform duties in their  current job assignments. Moreover, DOD guidance requires soldiers to be  evaluated for medical readiness prior to deployment.", "In prior reports, we have highlighted long-standing issues with the medical  deployability of servicemembers. Specifically, we have found continuing  problems with the completion of pre- and post-deployment health  assessments. We also reported in October 2005 that we found reserve  component servicemembers were deploying with preexisting medical  conditions, and we provided various recommendations for more guidance  and better visibility over servicemembers with medical conditions in  theater. DOD has taken action based on these recommendations, such as  establishing tracking and reporting of key force health protection and  quality assurance elements such as immunizations and pre- and post- deployment health assessments.", "From March through October 2007, the Army Office of the Inspector  General conducted an inquiry at Fort Benning based on media allegations  that soldiers were deployed with significant medical limitations. Army  Inspector General officials interviewed the soldiers named in the news  articles, numerous medical providers, and unit leaders to obtain their  testimonies regarding their pre-deployment medical reviews. The  Inspector General officials reviewed the standards for completing physical  profiles, the compliance with these standards, commanders\u2019 decisions or  actions that were based on these profiles, and whether any reprisals may  have occurred against soldiers with regard to complaints and concluded  that the Army followed standards in all but one instance where a soldier\u2019s  profile was changed without proper authority and the soldier deployed.  The soldier was reevaluated in theater and redeployed to Fort Benning.  They found no instances of reprisal. According to an Inspector General  official, further investigation of one medical provider led to no findings of  wrongdoing. The report recommended that the Army direct (1) a special  inspection of medical fitness procedures, which is ongoing; (2) leaders and  soldiers to review and follow Army standards for documenting and  assessing medical limitations; and (3) the Army Surgeon General to revise  the physical profile form to include a Privacy Act statement, instructions  for using the physical profile form, and definitions of key terms.", "The Chairs of the House Armed Services Committee and the Military  Personnel Subcommittee requested that we review the Army\u2019s compliance  with guidance on the deployment of soldiers with medical conditions.

We selected three Army installations\u2014Fort  Benning and Fort Stewart in Georgia, and Fort Drum in New York\u2014that  met one or both of the following two factors: (1) these installations had a  large number of active component soldiers deployed from each  installation to Iraq or Afghanistan between April 1, 2006, and March 31,  2007; or (2) these installations had initial allegations of soldiers being  deployed with significant medical limitations from these installations. For  these locations, we prepared a random, projectable sample of active  component soldiers preparing for deployment who indicated that they may  be under a profile. We reviewed medical records of soldiers in this sample  and identified a subset of the soldiers who had received profiles  documenting medical conditions that may require significant duty  limitations prior to preparing to deployment. We interviewed medical  providers, personnel officials, Army commanders, and soldiers to identify  and evaluate the installation\u2019s procedures for documenting medical  limitations in physical profiles and the training provided at each  installation. We did not review documentation of medical limitations other  than the physical profiles. To determine the extent to which the Army is  deploying soldiers with medical conditions requiring duty limitations to  Iraq and Afghanistan, and whether it is assigning them to duties suitable to  their limitations, we compared the medical data on the subset of soldiers  who had significant medical limitations from April 2001 to March 2007  with the soldiers\u2019 deployment data from Forts Benning, Stewart, and  Drum. From this analysis, we identified the number of soldiers who had a  profile in effect at the time of their deployment from each installation. We  reviewed Army processes for tracking soldiers while deployed. We  interviewed Army officials and commanders about any procedures in  place to ensure that soldiers are assigned within their limitations. We also  surveyed 66 active component Army soldiers deployed with medical  conditions to Iraq and Afghanistan and received responses from 24 of  them, for a response rate of about 36 percent. While we cannot project the  results of the surveys to all soldiers with medical conditions across the  Army deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, we present the information we  obtained to illustrate these issues.", "For a complete discussion of our scope and methodology, see appendix I.

For  example, a service is required to obtain a waiver from the Combatant  Command Surgeon if the service wishes to deploy a servicemember who  does not meet deployment standards and can receive medical treatment at  deployed locations that will render them fit for duty.

A profiling officer creates a physical profile that  documents any limitations found during a medical examination, and  identifies whether the medical limitation is temporary, in which case a  short-term condition can be improved by further treatment, or permanent,  in which case a chronic condition will not improve with medical treatment  at that point in time. The profiling officer classifies the medical limitations  under six categories:    physical capacity    upper extremities  lower extremities  These categories are often abbreviated as the \u201cPULHES\u201d factors (see     app. III for further detail). The medical limitations in physical profiles are  also given a numerical designation from 1 to 4 to reflect the different levels  of functional capability and severity of impairment. Soldiers with physical  profiles designated by the number 1 are considered to have a high level of  medical fitness; a 2 indicates that a soldier has some medical condition or  physical defect that may require some activity limitations; a 3 under one or  more of the factors indicates that the soldier has a medical condition or  physical defect that may require significant limitations in duty assignment;  and soldiers designated by the number 4 must have their military duties  drastically limited. Profiling officers must also specify whether the  soldier can perform certain functional activities comprising the minimum  requirements needed in order to be medically qualified for worldwide  deployment.", "Profiling officers should evaluate a soldier who has a temporary profile at  least once every 3 months to determine whether the soldier\u2019s medical  condition has improved or, if not, whether an extension of up to 12 months  is needed. If an extension is needed beyond 12 months, a temporary  profile should be changed to a permanent profile. Permanent and  temporary profiles normally require the signature of only the profiling  officer. Both the signatures of the profiling officer and a higher level  medical provider, who is designated the approving authority, are required  when a permanent profile number is designated at 3 or 4, or when a  permanent profile designation has been changed from a 3 to a 2.", "According to profiling officers, during the preparation of the physical  profile and medical evaluation of the soldier, the profiling officer may  communicate with the commander of the soldier for the purpose of better  identifying the soldier\u2019s medical limitations.

When an MEB is referred by an approving authority, the  soldier\u2019s physical profile is distributed to the Physical Evaluation Board  liaison officer at the medical treatment facility, who is responsible for the  case management of the soldier. A medical provider reexamines the  servicemember and reviews his or her medical history, including prior test  results, diagnoses, and treatments.

The approving medical provider would then provide it to personnel  officials in order to initiate an MMRB or to the liaison officer to initiate an  MEB, if needed, and would also provide it to the medical administrative  office, to be retained in the medical record.

Medical and  command officials at Fort Drum stated that their process was also  informal and they did not strictly adhere to timeframes, but they retained  hard copies of all permanent physical profiles separate from the soldiers\u2019  medical records at the liaison officer\u2019s administrative office. Without a  systematic method for approving and distributing profiles, current  informal processes have led to inconsistencies in retention of the physical  profiles in the medical record.

As a result, communication to commanders about physical  limitations in many cases comes from the soldiers themselves, rather than  the medical record system or personnel system.", "Army officials intend to require that all physical profiles be processed and  retained in the AHLTA electronic medical system; however, steps have not  been taken to implement the system change. The system change will  require that physical profiles be approved and routed electronically to  commanders, medical providers, and the personnel offices to initiate MEB  and MMRB proceedings. This change is intended to correct the limited  visibility over profile information and inconsistencies in profile  procedures, similar to the issues we have found in this review at Forts  Benning, Stewart, and Drum. However, Army officials told us they have  not finalized plans for actions needed and associated milestones to  implement these changes. Moreover, current plans do not ensure that the  information will be entered and distributed in a timely manner, as officials  who convene the MMRB or MEB do not have authority to compel timely  system input by commanders and medical providers.", "Finally, the Army is not consistent in its use of numerical designations in  profiles to reflect a soldier\u2019s ability to perform certain functional activities.  Army guidance states that when soldiers are not able to meet certain  requirements they are given a numerical designation of at least 3, and this  designation should result, in most instances, in a review of their cases by  an MMRB or MEB. When profiling officers prepare physical profiles  carrying a designation of 2, these profiles do not generally receive further  review, until the soldier indicates he or she is under a physical profile at  the pre-deployment assessment. Based on our random projectable sample  of soldiers preparing to deploy between April 2006 and March 2007, we  estimate that about 7 percent of the soldiers who were preparing for  deployment at Forts Benning, Stewart, and Drum had physical profiles in  their medical record showing the inability to perform functional activities  yet were not designated with a score of at least 3. Figure 2 shows the  estimated percentage (and confidence intervals) of soldiers by Army  installation who had profiles that indicated that they were unable to  perform certain functional activities, yet the profiles had a designation  of 2.", "The physical profile form defines performance of functional activities  according to whether the soldier is: (1) able to carry and fire his or her  individually assigned weapon; (2) able to move a fighting load of 48  pounds for at least 2 miles; (3) able to wear his or her protective mask and  all chemical defense equipment; (4) able to construct an individual fighting  position; (5) able to perform 3-5 second rushes under direct or indirect  fire; and (6) healthy, without any medical condition that prevents  deployment. Army regulation 40-501 allows for some flexibility in the  medical provider\u2019s designation of numerical designation in a soldier\u2019s  profile, and according to medical providers, they may upgrade  designations based on their knowledge of the soldier\u2019s medical condition  and the soldier\u2019s capacity to handle medical limitations. However,  discretionary upgrades can mask a soldier\u2019s limitations such that a  commander might deploy the soldier without benefit of MMRB evaluation  and may place the soldier in duties unsuitable to his or her limitations.", "We did not find widespread revision of profiles by profiling officers or  approving authorities prior to deployment. Only 1 percent of the physical  profiles we reviewed were changed from a permanent 3 to 2 within a few  months prior to the soldier\u2019s deploying. Upgrades in numerical  designations are generally annotated by remarks in the descriptive text  included in a soldier\u2019s profile, and they must include a second approving  medical provider\u2019s signature. However, informal discussions between  soldier and medical provider can result in a change in the profile  designation that may not be noted in the profile. In one case, we found  that a soldier\u2019s profile was changed from a 3 to a 2 without meaningful  annotation, and lacking the requisite second approving signature. This  soldier reported to us that she had not undergone a new medical diagnosis  prior to the profile upgrade; however, she also had told her medical  provider that she did not want to go through an MMRB or MEB and  thereby risk being removed from the Army. According to Army officials,  soldiers\u2019 medical conditions may have improved for various reasons, such  as undergoing surgery or additional physical therapy.", "Although we found no evidence of widespread revision in numerical  designations, in our surveys to deployed soldiers or our interviews with  Army personnel officials and family members of deployed soldiers, some  soldiers or family members expressed concerns to us that they were  uninformed about how the Army was addressing their medical problems  prior to deployment, and they knew of no venue to resolve their  complaints. In surveys, two additional soldiers also stated that they did not  feel they had been correctly graded in their physical profile designations,  but were reluctant to discuss the matter with their commanding officers  for fear of prejudicial treatment. One soldier stated that her physical  profile had been changed without further physical examination. The other  soldier noted that her physical profile designation was upgraded even  though a medical provider had added more limitations after examining  her, and she did not agree that the profile expressed all the limitations  caused by her back, knee, and shoulder ailments. We reviewed the  documentation in the physical profiles of these soldiers and the profiles  contained requisite approving signatures, dates, and descriptions of  limitations. However, our analysis did not evaluate the medical providers\u2019  diagnoses of the medical conditions, because we are not qualified to  evaluate the providers\u2019 medical judgment. Moreover, we would not be able  to determine from the documentation if the soldier did not agree with the  profile, whether the profile was changed without further physical  examination, or whether the medical provider or the soldier fully  communicated all of the issues involved.", "Army personnel officials told us that they were unable to assist soldiers  bringing complaints about not being evaluated by a medical board when  the soldiers received a new permanent profile prior to their deployment,  because the officials do not have access to soldiers\u2019 medical information  and do not have the authority to enforce time frames. These officials had  also been contacted by soldiers\u2019 family members who were concerned that  the soldiers would be deployed and their conditions would worsen at  deployed locations. An Army personnel official told us that soldiers  sometimes questioned whether they were to be evaluated by a board prior  to deployment, but by the time this official received the physical profile to  initiate an MMRB, the soldiers had already been deployed. Because the  officials do not have access to all medical information, they would not be  able to verify whether soldiers\u2019 profiles were approved. These situations  may be occurring because physical profiles are not being distributed in a  timely manner. Also, because Army personnel officials do not have the  authority to enforce time frames, they could not compel commanders to  provide timely input for the approval of the profile or compel designated  approving authorities to distribute the approved profiles. Thus, although  Army personnel officials may believe that physical profiles are not being  delivered in a timely manner, they do not have the ability to resolve these  soldiers\u2019 complaints.", "Issues regarding proper medical evaluation of soldiers prior to deployment  could be resolved by having a designated point of contact to whom  soldiers and family members can bring their concerns. Such a point person  would require access to the soldier\u2019s medical information and the ability to  resolve any problems and questions about a soldier\u2019s medical readiness.  This person would also need to work independently of the operations  commander in order to prevent bias or coercion by the commander in  resolving soldier issues.", "In September 2007, the Army Medical Command created a program to  designate an ombudsman, or point of contact, available for each  installation to whom soldiers can bring concerns on issues such as health  care, pay, physical disability processing, and transition to the Veterans  Administration. The Army memorandum establishing this program states  that ombudsmen will resolve complaints, assist in obtaining accurate  information, and act as advocates specifically for soldiers assigned to the  Warrior Transition Unit and their families. According to ombudsmen at  Forts Benning, Stewart, and Drum, they may also provide support for any  soldier or family member of a soldier who needs assistance, through walk- ins or through the Army Wounded Soldier and Family Hotline. In  accordance with the memorandum, the ombudsman will be independent  from commanders at the installation, and will work closely with the  Medical Assistance Group, which is part of the Army Medical Command  under the Army Surgeon General\u2019s leadership at Fort Sam Houston, Texas.  However, the ombudsman program is not broadly publicized as a resource  for active duty soldiers with medical conditions or their family members.  We were not able to fully evaluate how effectively the ombudsman  program would be able to resolve the issues brought by deploying soldiers  as opposed to soldiers in the Warrior Transition Unit and their family  members, as the ombudsman program has only recently been  implemented. It was not fully implemented at the time of our review at  Forts Benning, Stewart, and Drum. Ensuring that soldiers who are not part  of the Warrior Transition Unit and their family members are aware of and  have access to the ombudsman program may help to alleviate some of  these concerns brought forth by deploying soldiers.", "As a result of the various medical record deficiencies and discretionary  profile revisions discussed, commanders\u2019 visibility over their soldiers\u2019  potential medical conditions cannot be ensured. Furthermore, without a  well-publicized ombudsman program, soldiers preparing for deployment  cannot be assured of having the opportunity to air and resolve their  medical concerns."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "One In 10 Soldiers in the Projectable Sample Who Has a Medical Condition Has Deployed, but We Were Unable to Determine Duty Suitability", "paragraphs": ["Based our review of medical records from Forts Benning, Stewart, and  Drum, we estimate that about 10 percent of active duty soldiers with  profiles indicating medical conditions that could require significant  limitations in duty assignments were deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan.  Although Army guidance allows for the deployment of soldiers with  medical conditions, it requires commanders to assign soldiers to duties  that are suitable to their limitations. Because of the low response rate to  our survey, we were unable to determine the extent to which these  soldiers were in fact assigned duties suitable to their medical conditions.

We  estimate that 14 percent of soldiers preparing to deploy from Forts  Benning, Stewart, and Drum had profiles indicating conditions that could  require significant limitations: specifically, soldiers with physical profile  designations of 3 or 4, or who indicated that they could not perform  certain functional activities. Figure 3 shows the total number of records  reviewed and the estimated percentage (and confidence intervals) of  soldiers who had medical impairments that could require significant  limitations by installation from Forts Benning, Stewart, and Drum.", "As shown in figure 4, of the estimated 14 percent of soldiers preparing to  deploy from Forts Benning, Stewart, and Drum who had medical  conditions that could require significant limitations in duty assignment,  approximately two-thirds\u2014about an estimated 10 percent of the total  number of soldiers\u2014were deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan. These  soldiers with medical conditions included soldiers having a physical  profile designation of at least a 3, or indicating that they could not perform  certain functional activities. The remaining estimated 4 percent of soldiers  with medical conditions that could require significant limitations did not  deploy.", "Soldiers in the sample who deployed with medical conditions that could  require significant limitations had conditions such as herniated discs, back  pain, chronic knee pain, type 2 diabetes, or mild asthma. A soldier might  have a physical profile that indicates multiple medical limitations that fall  under different categories. Table 2 shows that of the 66 deployed soldiers  who had medical conditions that could require significant limitations,       55 percent deployed with defects of the lower extremities (under the \u201cL\u201d  category). For example, one soldier\u2019s physical profile showed chronic hip  pain that restricted physical training pace and limited the soldier to lifting  no more than 48 pounds. Medical conditions of the eyes and psychiatric  conditions had the lowest rates of occurrence. While we did not review  documentation of medical limitations other than the soldiers\u2019 physical  profiles, according to Army medical officials, mental health conditions are  not generally documented in physical profiles unless the conditions  limited a soldier\u2019s ability to accomplish his or her duty.

While Army guidance requires commanders to assign soldiers  to duties that are suitable to their medical conditions, it does not require  that they track the assignments of their soldiers to duties that  accommodate their limitations. In order to determine the extent to which  they had been assigned to duties suitable for those conditions, we  surveyed by e-mail a sample of deployed soldiers with medical conditions.  In our survey, we asked these soldiers for information on their ability to  perform the duties to which they were assigned. However, we did not get a  sufficiently high response rate to enable us to project findings from the  survey respondents. We sent the survey to 66 soldiers, but received  responses from only 24. Of the 24 soldiers who responded, 19 reported  that they were able to complete most or all of their duties, and 22 of the 24  said they wanted to deploy with their units. None said that they could  perform only a few or none of their duties. However, 5 of the soldiers we  surveyed indicated that they were able to perform only some of their  duties.", "Survey responses indicated that some soldiers had experienced job  reassignments to accommodate the limitations of their medical conditions.  For example, one soldier had a shoulder injury that limited his ability to  wear all of his body armor. When his unit was deployed to Iraq, he was  assigned to duties in Kuwait so that he would not have to wear all of his  body armor. Another soldier with a hearing deficit had his occupational  category changed from infantry to supply specialist to protect him from  exposure to loud noise. One soldier had degenerative disc disease, with  lower back and leg pain, and his commander reassigned him from being  leader of his unit to base security to accommodate his medical condition  by limiting the time he had to wear his equipment. However, three of our  survey respondents reported that their duties or occupational categories  were not changed, although they believed they should have been. For  example, one soldier often fell asleep during guard duty because his sleep  apnea treatment was impaired by the irregularity of electric power  availability, which he needed to support his continuous positive airway  pressure machine.", "Although we were unable to speak with the commanders of the particular  soldiers surveyed in the sample, we spoke with other commanders at Forts  Benning, Stewart, and Drum to help explain these survey responses. These  commanders reported that they were aware of the medical conditions of  the soldiers with whom they had deployed and that they always  considered these conditions in their duty assignments. Army commanders  told us that soldiers with medical impairments may on occasion be  required to perform job duties exceeding their limitations because they  have special skills that are hard to replace using other personnel.  Commanders may also sometimes assign soldiers to duties exceeding their  limitations because they are unaware of the extent of the limitations, as  soldiers\u2019 physical profiles may not reflect all of their medical information.  Furthermore, according to both soldiers and senior medical officials  whom we interviewed, soldiers may conceal the extent of their medical  limitations or may negotiate with medical providers in order to remain  with their units or in the Army. For example, one soldier did not agree  with the upgrading of her physical profile designation, but also did not  want to fully disclose her medical condition for fear of not meeting Army  medical standards. Two soldiers stated that they agreed with their physical  profile designation, which masks the severity of their limitations, and they  were deployed although their medical condition was progressively  worsening while at deployed locations. In both these cases, the soldiers  stated that they were nearing retirement and did not want to be discharged  from the Army due to a medical board evaluation before they were eligible  to receive their full retirement pensions, and they confirmed that their  commanders accommodated their medical conditions.", "Conversely, Army officials have stated that soldiers may overstate their  medical conditions in order to avoid deployment and they must take into  account their other experiences with the soldiers\u2019 limitations when  evaluating their medical deployability. For example, one commander told  us that one soldier brought up a foot injury to delay her deployment,  although it was diagnosed by a medical provider outside the military and it  was not in her military medical record. The commander allowed the  soldier time to recuperate and allowed her to purchase a specific type of  boot to accommodate her injury. However, when the soldier did not  purchase the boots in a timely manner in order to further delay her  deployment, the commander found the boots at a nearby supply store and  deployed the soldier into theater.", "Although we were not able to determine the extent to which Army  commanders have assigned soldiers to duties that are suitable for their  limitations, there may be soldiers who had proper evaluations performed  prior to deployment yet still have concerns about the suitability of their  assigned duties. Soldiers should have access to a program at deployed  locations that is similar to the ombudsman program available at Army  installations. The soldiers who have medical conditions that develop or  worsen while at deployed locations and may not believe they are assigned  to appropriate duties should have access to a contact person who can  address their concerns. This person should have access to the soldier\u2019s  medical information and the authority to resolve any problems, and he or  she should work independently from the soldier\u2019s commander."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Long-standing issues regarding the medical deployability of  servicemembers have become increasingly important as the Global War on  Terrorism continues and large numbers of servicemembers are deployed.   The Army is hampered by its lack of an enforcement mechanism from  ensuring that soldiers\u2019 MMRB or MEB evaluations are conducted within  prescribed time frames and not delayed by the failure of commanders or  medical providers to provide required information on time. Of the   6 percent of soldiers from Forts Benning, Stewart, and Drum that we  estimate were deployed with medical conditions that required further  evaluation by a MMRB or MEB, we estimate that 3 percent of these  soldiers did not receive these needed evaluations prior to deployment.   Furthermore, the commanders and medical providers who must make  medical readiness and deployment decisions about soldiers do not always  have full visibility over the soldiers\u2019 medical limitations because physical  profile documentation is not always properly retained or complete. The  Army intends to establish centralized electronic documentation and  distribution of physical profiles to improve visibility, but it has not  finalized plans for needed actions, associated milestones, and timeliness of  the process. Without timely MMRB or MEB evaluations and the retention  of complete physical profile information for deploying soldiers with  medical conditions, commanders who assign duties can not be fully  informed of soldiers\u2019 medical limitations. We did not find widespread  cases of improper duty assignments for deployed soldiers with medical  conditions; however, the weaknesses in the Army procedures could permit  this to occur. Although the Army ombudsman program may help alleviate  concerns from soldiers and family members, they should be made aware  of the program and the program should be made available for soldiers  prior to and during deployment.

However, we note that the 17  soldiers who deployed without receiving proper board evaluations  represent a sizeable proportion of the 42 soldiers in our sample who  should have received such a review prior to deployment.  These 17  soldiers, furthermore, can be projected from our sample to represent  approximately 3 percent of the soldiers who were preparing for  deployment at the three installations; we are providing further clarification  regarding this figure in the body of this report. Furthermore, as we have  noted in our report, ad hoc measures to assign soldiers to suitable duties  are not as reliable as an enforcement mechanism for ensuring that soldiers  are so assigned.

Therefore, we reviewed more medical records than our target sample size  on the assumption we might not meet our desired precision. Specifically,  there were seven reasons identified for not being able to physically secure  soldiers\u2019 medical records for review:  1.  Charged to patient. When a patient visits a clinic (on-post or off- post), the medical record is physically given to the patient. The  procedure is that the medical record will be returned by the patient  following their clinic visit.  2.  Charged out to Medical Evaluation Board. Soldier is in the process  of a medical review board and their medical record is retained by the  board members.  3.  Charged out to Physical Evaluation Board. Soldier is in the  process of a physical review board and their medical record is retained  by the board members.  4.  Expired term of service. Soldier separates from the Army and their  medical record is sent to the Veterans Administration Records  Management Center St. Louis, Missouri.  5.  Record is missing and not accounted for by the medical records  department. No tracking sheet is in the file system to indicate the  patient has checked it out or otherwise.  6.  Permanent change of station. Soldier is still in the Army, but has  transferred to another installation.

Because we followed a probability procedure based  on random selections, the sample is only one of a large number of samples  that we might have drawn. Since each sample could have provided  different estimates, we express our confidence in the precision of our  particular sample\u2019s results as a 95 percent confidence interval (e.g., plus or  minus 5 percentage points). This is the interval that would contain the  actual population value for 5 percent of the samples we could have drawn.  As a result, we are 95 percent confident that each of the confidence  intervals will include the true values in the study population. At two of the  three installations we visited, we reviewed more records than needed to  meet our target sample size because medical officials made available more  medical records than our targeted sample amount. The number of soldiers  in the samples and the total records reviewed of soldiers at the  installations visited are shown in table 3.", "At each location, we examined medical documentation for evidence of  physical profiles (form DA 3349) that were created between April 2001  and March 2007. We selected this time frame because it would include any  profile in effect when a soldier in the sample deployed. We reviewed both  hard copy soldier medical records for evidence of physical profiles as well  as any profiles located in Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology  Application (AHLTA), the department of defense\u2019s electronic medical  record. In addition, we requested that installation medical personnel  provide any information on profiles from the Army\u2019s Medical Protection  System (MEDPROS) for each of the soldiers in the sample to ensure that  our review of medical records was complete and that we identified all  physical profiles. Even though MEDPROS is not an official medical record,  it is used in the determination of medical readiness in preparation for  deployment and contains medical limitation information and dates of  physical profiles. After gathering all physical profiles, we reviewed them  for completeness, and analyzed them to determine if they were completed  in accordance with Army guidance. From the soldiers that received a  physical profile between April 2001 and March 2007, we identified the  subset of soldiers with medical conditions that may require significant  medical limitations, specifically soldiers with permanent or temporary  profile designation of at least a 3, or a designation of 2 showing inability to  do certain functional activities. We did not review documentation of  medical limitations other than the physical profiles. According to Army  officials, mental health conditions are not generally documented in  physical profiles unless the conditions limited a soldier\u2019s ability to  accomplish his or her duty. Commanders were also notified of their  soldiers\u2019 mental conditions by medical providers if they requested a mental  health evaluation of the soldiers.", "Although we have taken many steps to ensure accurate data analysis of  active component soldiers with a physical profile, previous GAO reviews  have found that Army medical records do not contain all medical  documentation as required, thus, our review may not encompass the full  extent of soldiers with physical profiles.", "To determine the extent to which the Army is deploying soldiers to Iraq  and Afghanistan with medical conditions requiring duty limitations, and  whether it is assigning them to duties suitable to their limitations, we  requested deployment data on the subset of soldiers who we identified as  having a significant medical limitation from the time period of April 2001  to March 2007. We then compared data from our medical record review at  Forts Stewart, Benning, and Drum to deployment data for soldiers in the  sample provided by Army officials to identify soldiers with a medical  condition that may require significant limitations who had deployed to Iraq  or Afghanistan. We reviewed Army processes for tracking soldiers while  deployed. We interviewed Army officials including commanders and  medical providers about established procedures in place to ensure soldiers  are assigned within their limitations. We also surveyed by e-mail 66  soldiers we identified who had deployed with medical conditions to Iraq  and Afghanistan. We received responses from 24 of these soldiers, for a  response rate of about 36 percent.
