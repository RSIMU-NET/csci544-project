In 1985, NIH\u2019s National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) initiated the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP), which has undertaken a major effort to encourage individuals to measure, track, and reduce their cholesterol levels (notably total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholestrol) with the objective of reducing mortality and morbidity from coronary heart disease. The focus on cholesterol reduction has come at a time when increased emphasis has also been given to modifying other risk factors associated with heart disease such as cigarette smoking and hypertension.", "One aspect of the efforts to broaden awareness of cholesterol as a risk factor has been to encourage individuals to \u201cknow your cholesterol number.\u201d This advice has been heeded by the public. According to data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from 47 states and the District of Columbia, the percentage of adults who reported having had their total cholesterol checked in the past 5 years ranged from 56 percent in New Mexico to 71 percent in Connecticut (median across the states sampled: 64 percent). The percentage of persons who had been told their cholesterol is high by a health professional ranged from 14 percent in New Mexico to 21 percent in Michigan (median across the states sampled: 17 percent).", "For a widespread cholesterol-lowering campaign to be credible, however, test results must be accurate across the diverse devices and settings in which cholesterol is measured. This is because the guidelines for treating elevated cholesterol are predicated on test results that place an individual into different risk categories. In this report, we discuss what is known about the accuracy of cholesterol testing, including how it is measured, factors that hinder accurate measurements, and efforts to improve the accuracy of cholesterol tests."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Coronary heart disease is one of the leading causes of death for both men and women in the United States, accounting for 478,530 deaths in 1991, according to the American Heart Association (AHA). Of these deaths, 52 percent were men and 48 percent were women. Approximately 6.3 million people alive today in the United States have a history of heart attack, chest pain, or both; of this group, 44 percent are 60 years of age and older, 25 percent are 40 to 59 years old, and 31 percent are younger than 40.", "Further, 1.5 million Americans are expected to suffer a heart attack in 1994. The death rate from heart attack in the United States, however, declined 32 percent between 1981 and 1991. Reasons cited as contributing to this decline include improved medical care of patients and preventive measures in the population.", "AHA estimates that total costs associated with coronary heart disease are $56.3 billion per year. Of this figure, $37.2 billion is spent on hospital and nursing home services, $8.7 billion on physicians and nurses services, and $2.4 billion on drugs. Lost output associated with heart disease is valued at $8 billion.", "Because of the large sums being spent on treatment, to say nothing of the attendant psychological and social costs, prevention has been emphasized. NHLBI has established several education programs, such as NCEP, to inform the public about different risk factors associated with coronary heart disease and to provide guidelines for reducing risks that are modifiable. Other programs include the National High Blood Pressure Education Program, which began in 1972; the Smoking Education Program (1985); and the Obesity Education Initiative (1991)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NCEP Guidelines", "paragraphs": ["A consensus development conference of scientific experts brought together by NIH in 1984 concluded that the risk of coronary heart disease is positively related to increased levels of serum cholesterol and that lowering elevated cholesterol levels can reduce coronary heart disease risk for individuals. The conference experts based their conclusions on the accumulated evidence from a large body of epidemiological, animal, metabolic, and clinical studies. Of major importance was the results of the Lipid Research Clinics Coronary Primary Prevention Trial, a large randomized study completed in 1984 that provided evidence that treatment to lower high cholesterol levels in patients can reduce the risk of coronary heart disease. The conference experts further recommended plans for establishing the National Cholesterol Education Program, which began in 1985.", "NCEP has convened several expert panels and issued a series of guidelines, reports, and educational materials on the management and control of cholesterol for health care professionals and the general public. The program emphasizes two parallel approaches: (1) a clinical approach that attempts to identify and treat individuals who are at high risk and (2) a broader population approach that aims to reduce cholesterol levels for the entire population.", "Clinical guidelines for reducing elevated cholesterol levels in adults over 20 years of age were first issued by the Adult Treatment Panel in 1987 and were subsequently updated in a second expert panel report in 1993. These guidelines cover the classification of cholesterol, patient evaluation, and dietary and drug treatments. In 1990, NCEP outlined population strategies to lower total and LDL cholesterol by encouraging all Americans to be aware that elevated cholesterol is a potential risk factor for coronary heart disease, have their cholesterol measured at regular intervals, and modify their diet. NCEP published another report in 1991 that addressed cholesterol issues in children and adolescents. It emphasized strategies for encouraging the nation\u2019s youths to reduce their intake of saturated fat and cholesterol as well as identifying and treating those whose high serum cholesterol levels put them at increased risk for heart disease as adults.

As shown in figure 1.1, adults without evidence of existing coronary heart disease are classified initially into three levels based on total cholesterol levels\u2014desirable (below (<) 200 mg/dL), borderline high (200-239 mg/dL), and high (equal to or above (>) 240 mg/dL). An HDL cholesterol level of less than 35 mg/dL is considered low and a contributing risk factor for coronary heart disease. The cutpoints for total cholesterol are based largely on epidemiological data that have shown that the risk of heart disease increases as cholesterol levels rise. For example, in 361,000 men screened for the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial, those at or above the 90th percentile of total cholesterol, about 263 mg/dL, had a four times greater risk of death from coronary heart disease than those in the bottom 20 percent (< 182 mg/dL).", "As indicated in figure 1.1, individuals are recommended for a followup lipoprotein analysis depending on an assessment of their total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol levels in conjunction with the presence or absence of other coronary heart disease risk factors. Thus, those who would be candidates for a subsequent lipoprotein analysis include individuals with (1) high total cholesterol (\u2021 240 mg/dL), (2) borderline-high cholesterol (200-239 mg/dL) and low HDL cholesterol (<35 mg/dL), or (3) borderline-high cholesterol (200-239 mg/dL), higher HDL cholesterol (>35 mg/dL), and two or more risk factors.", "Lipoprotein analysis includes measurement of fasting levels of total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides and the calculation of LDL cholesterol, which is derived by a mathematical formula. The subsequent classification of adults based on LDL cholesterol levels is shown in figure 1.2. NCEP also classifies LDL cholesterol into three levels\u2014desirable (<130 mg/dL), borderline-high risk (130-159 mg/dL), and high risk (>160 mg/dL).", "Decisions for beginning diet or drug treatment are then based on these levels in combination with other risk factors (see table 1.1). Thus, candidates for diet therapy without known symptoms of coronary heart disease include those with high LDL cholesterol (>160 mg/dL) or those with borderline-high LDL cholesterol (130-159 mg/dL) plus two or more risk factors.", "NCEP recommends diet therapy as a first line of treatment for most patients except those at particularly high risk who may warrant drug intervention immediately, such as individuals with existing coronary heart disease. NCEP\u2019s recommended step I and step II diets are designed to reduce consumption of saturated fat and cholesterol and to promote weight loss in overweight patients. If diet therapy is ineffective at lowering LDL cholesterol levels, then drug treatment is advised. NCEP has developed a series of guidelines for administering different types of drugs that are available to lower cholesterol. It should be noted that initiating drug treatment commits patients to long-term therapy, which may be for the rest of their lives.", "Some perspective on what these treatment categories and recommendations mean for Americans can be seen in recently collected, nationally representative data from the first phase of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). These data indicate that the average total serum cholesterol level is 205 mg/dL for men 20 years old and older and 207 mg/dL for women 20 years old and older. As shown in figure 1.3, women tend to have lower total cholesterol levels compared to men up until the ages of 45 to 54, at which time it increases to levels above those of men. This difference may be attributed, in part, to menopause, which influences women\u2019s lipid and hormonal levels. Whether this increases women\u2019s coronary heart disease risk is not clear, according to some research. Overall, women appear to have higher HDL cholesterol levels then men do, which may also account for part of this difference.", "While trend data indicate that cholesterol levels have declined since the early 1960\u2019s, 52 million U.S. adults, or 29 percent, have an LDL cholesterol level that is classified as borderline-high or high according to the NCEP guidelines and that, when combined with other risk factors, makes them candidates for dietary therapy. Of the 52 million adults mentioned above, about 12.7 million have cholesterol levels sufficiently elevated that they might be candidates for drug therapy (about one third of this group would be patients with coronary heart disease)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cholesterol Measurement Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["NCEP\u2019s Laboratory Standardization Panel (LSP) has issued two reports on cholesterol measurement. The first report, issued in 1988, focused attention on the importance of accurate measurements.

The second report published in 1990 also contains a number of recommendations to improve laboratory testing systems. These include using only analytical systems whose standardization process is linked to the National Reference System for Cholesterol (NRS/CHOL, discussed in chapter 3), participating in external surveillance programs (proficiency testing), comparing results with other laboratories, and using quality controls to monitor analytical performance.", "Recognizing the problem of measurement variability in cholesterol testing, the Adult Treatment and Laboratory Standardization Panels recommended that total and LDL cholesterol be measured on two separate occasions and averaged together. If the cholesterol results differ by 30 mg/dL or more, then a third test should be conducted and the three tests averaged together to assess an individual\u2019s cholesterol level.", "NCEP/LSP established the goal that a single serum total cholesterol measurement should be accurate within +8.9 percent. This goal of +8.9 percent was effective in 1992, replacing the interim goal of +14.2 percent that had been established in 1988. NCEP has not previously issued goals for HDL and LDL cholesterol measurement; however, an expert panel convened by NCEP has recently developed such goals and they are expected to be published shortly.", "The Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (Public Law 100-578) also mandated that the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) establish performance standards such as quality control, quality assurance, and personnel regulations. HCFA testing requirements for total cholesterol, authored by CDC, stipulate a +10 percent criterion for acceptable performance for proficiency testing purposes. HCFA testing requirements for HDL cholesterol for acceptable performance on proficiency testing specimens is +30 percent of the established target value.", "Although the NCEP guidelines advocate multiple measurements, there has been concern by some researchers that, in practice, physicians may not take measurement variability into account when making treatment decisions about cholesterol. Given that the NCEP classification levels for cholesterol are relatively narrow and that the average cholesterol levels for the U.S. population are in the borderline-high category at about 205 mg/dL, there is potential that patients can be misclassified. That is, measurement errors can lead to individuals with \u201ctrue\u201d levels below the high cutpoint of 240 mg/dL for total cholesterol or 160 mg/dL for LDL cholesterol being put on treatment (termed a false positive) or conversely those with \u201ctrue\u201d levels above the cutpoints not being treated (a false negative)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["In discussions with the requester, we agreed to focus our review of cholesterol measurement on the following evaluation questions:1.

We also interviewed manufacturers of analyzers in private industry, university researchers, and representatives of organizations that conduct proficiency testing for laboratories. In order to have a better understanding of the testing process, we visited a major hospital laboratory facility to discuss quality control issues and challenges facing practitioners. We also visited a major manufacturer of analyzers to learn more about the production process (quality control procedures, analyzer calibration, potential sources of inaccuracy) as well as industry concerns about the accuracy and precision of cholesterol testing.

Triglyceride levels are also included in lipid profiles. Cholesterol is commonly tested in a variety of settings ranging from large health fairs to more specialized clinical laboratories. No national data are available on the number of laboratories that conduct cholesterol tests, the number of cholesterol testing devices in use in laboratories, or the number of such tests that are done each year. The universe of U.S. laboratories that conduct different types of medical tests is large, however, with some 154,403 having registered with HCFA by October 1993. While HCFA data indicate that physicians\u2019 offices predominate in the testing arena, the distribution of cholesterol tests is not ascertainable from these data. Test results may be less accurate from such settings because of the type of devices used and less staff expertise in conducting tests.", "In addition to the broad range of settings where measurements are conducted, a large number of analyzers on the market measure cholesterol (45 manufacturers make 166 test systems that measure total cholesterol). Because some of these analyzers are used with different chemical formulations to conduct cholesterol tests, standardizing measurements is a complex task (a topic taken up in chapter 3).

In addition, certain saturated fats raise the blood cholesterol level more than any other nutrient component in the diet. If you eat a \u201cstandard\u201d American diet, two thirds of the cholesterol in your body is manufactured by your cells\u2014the remainder is derived from your diet. Thus, an elevated cholesterol level may be the result of a diet heavy in saturated fat and cholesterol; it is also possible that the liver is manufacturing high levels of cholesterol and triglyceride or that cholesterol is being removed too slowly from the body.", "Cholesterol is transported in blood plasma through lipoproteins. The three major classes of lipoproteins include LDL (containing 60 to 70 percent of the total serum cholesterol), HDL (containing 20 to 30 percent of the total serum cholesterol), and VLDL (very low density lipoproteins, which are precursors of LDL and contain 10 to 15 percent of the total serum cholesterol). Triglycerides are also an important lipid in the blood and are usually measured in conjunction with cholesterol values. More recently, increased scientific attention has been given to the apolipoprotein \u201cfamilies,\u201d the subcomponents that make up these types of cholesterol, because they may be better predictors of certain risks associated with coronary heart disease such as degenerative changes in arterial walls.

HDL cholesterol is difficult to measure accurately, however, and current criteria under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 for acceptable laboratory performance are that a sample must be +30 percent of a test target value, a relatively broad range even with lower HDL values.

The formula cannot be used for individuals with extremely high triglyceride levels (400 mg/dL and above) and several rare lipid conditions.

In contrast, laboratories that have maintained a high-quality testing program believe the regulations represent minimum standards for running a quality testing program.

As of April 1994, there were 166 test systems (made by 45 different manufacturers) available to measure total cholesterol. For HDL cholesterol, 143 test systems, made by 41 manufacturers, have been identified. (Some manufacturers have as many as 11 \u201csystems\u201d that use the same technology.)", "FDA-cleared cholesterol analyzers encompass three types of devices: large stationary analyzers used in clinical laboratories, desk-top analyzers, and home test kit analyzers. Desk-top analyzers can be used in a variety of settings (medical and nonmedical) to provide relatively quick cholesterol test results, whereas large analyzers are capable of performing multiple tests on many analyses for hundreds of specimens a day. The latter are usually found in large independent laboratories, hospital laboratories, and the offices of major testing organizations that serve the medical community.", "The third type is a home test kit, designed for sale directly to consumers. Currently, one device, the AccuMeter (manufactured by ChemTrak) is being marketed in the United States. The approval of this device has been somewhat controversial in the clinical chemistry field because of concerns about the reliability of its measurements. Apart from possible technical problems is the related issue of whether a person may incorrectly interpret his or her cholesterol level after using the device or initiate a self-treatment program without proper medical feedback and monitoring.", "Cholesterol analyzers currently on the market primarily use enzymatic methods, high-technology equipment, and computerized data processing systems. Enzymatic methods offer advantages over older chemicals because they are safer and can be used in an automated laboratory environment, both distinct improvements. Nonetheless, enzymatic methods are also considered to be difficult to characterize chemically, thus adding to the uncertainty of tests done with them. FDA draft guidelines for approving cholesterol testing devices note that because enzymatic materials may deteriorate or vary, analyses done with them may be imprecise. A related concern noted by HCFA officials is that each analyzer and reagent combination has its own \u201cmethod\u201d for measuring cholesterol, making it difficult to assess accuracy using standardized testing materials.", "An additional perspective on these devices was provided by a hospital laboratory administrator who observed that the devices used in his laboratory are self-contained \u201cblack boxes\u201d that rely heavily on computer technology that must be regularly calibrated as part of a routine quality control process. Unlike the older instruments these have replaced, he noted, these newer devices are easier to use than the older systems.

HCFA established a similar total cholesterol goal (+10 percent) as well as the goal that HDL cholesterol tests should be within +30 percent of its correct value, when judged by quality control testing. To date, an LDL cholesterol measurement goal has not been established, although one is expected soon.", "Evaluating the extent to which laboratories across the country are providing medical personnel and patients with accurate total cholesterol test results is difficult. While an accepted national reference system exists, and network laboratories can provide traceability to an accuracy standard, participation by laboratories has been limited particularly to clinical and research settings. Additional information is collected through proficiency testing surveys that indicate that laboratory precision has improved over time but, again, the number of participating laboratories is small. The lack of information on accuracy in actual laboratory settings makes it impossible to know whether the goals established for total and HDL cholesterol measurement are being met and how well LDL cholesterol is being measured. Because these test results are key to making treatment decisions in NCEP guidelines, such data are arguably important.", "Two collaborative research efforts, one by the College of American Pathologists (CAP) and CDC and the other by Veterans Affairs (VA) and CDC, highlight weaknesses of the current system of monitoring cholesterol laboratory tests. The reliance on processed quality control materials for evaluating analyzer accuracy was found to be problematic because of what are termed matrix effects. Processed materials tend to act differently from fresh serum samples on many instrument reagent systems and produce different test results. The studies found that total cholesterol tests done on fresh serum samples in a select group of clinical settings met NCEP accuracy standards whereas with processed control materials, there was greater inaccuracy. Finding ways to address matrix problems is important because processed control materials are key to assessing accuracy across laboratories and serve as the basis for enforcing the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988.", "With regard to desk-top analyzers, there are sufficient concerns about the reported accuracy and precision of total, HDL, and LDL results provided by several devices, even when tested under optimal operating conditions, to warrant further scrutiny of their performance.

Total error is defined in terms of two main measurement components: bias and precision. Bias is the extent to which a series of test results deviate from the \u201ctrue\u201d value, within acceptable limits (<3 percent according to NCEP), whereas precision refers to the consistency and reliability of repeated results within acceptable limits (<3 percent according to NCEP). A cholesterol analyzer, for example, could be very precise yet inaccurate because of the poor calibration of an analyzer or the deterioration of the reagents being used. The difference between bias and precision can be illustrated with the following brief example. Suppose that a total cholesterol specimen whose \u201ctrue\u201d value is 200 mg/dL were tested 10 times on the same analyzer. If the analyzer gave a reading of 220 mg/dL each time it tested the specimen, the analysis would be biased\u2014that is, it would be 10 percent over the \u201ctrue\u201d value.

NRS/CHOL consists of a hierarchy of approved methods and materials used to assess cholesterol measurement accuracy. These include basic measurement units and definitive methods (NIST), primary reference materials (NIST), reference methods (CDC), secondary reference materials (NIST and CDC), field methods, and patients\u2019 results.

The definitive method assigns the \u201ctrue\u201d value to a specimen through a process in which all potential sources of inaccuracy and interference are evaluated. The definitive method uses an isotope dilution mass spectrometric technique. Because it requires special equipment and costly materials and is time-consuming, the definitive method is not considered transferable to clinical laboratories. This method is also used for the highly specialized purpose of developing and testing standard reference materials that are used by manufacturers and in other settings such as research lipid laboratories.", "CDC oversees another piece of NRS/CHOL: it uses what is termed the modified Abell, Levy, Brodie, and Kendall (abbreviated Abell-Kendall) reference method for total cholesterol measurement.

This can be done by splitting samples with a network laboratory and comparing results. Participation in the network is relatively low when one takes into consideration the number of laboratories in the United States. In 1991, for example, 170 laboratories applied for a certificate of traceability and 58 percent passed (if a laboratory fails, it can reapply for certification).

Day-to-day consistency in a laboratory requires rigorous quality controls that help ensure that an analyzer will perform as it is capable of performing. In other words, if an analyzer is not maintained properly, it will not provide results that are constantly accurate.", "Another way in which NRS/CHOL attempts to transfer accuracy to laboratories is through \u201cquality control\u201d substances called standard reference materials, which are the link between the definitive and reference methods and manufacturers of analyzers and reagent systems.

These findings suggest that variation in cholesterol levels is normal and, for some individuals, can be quite pronounced. The implication for testing, particularly for patients near a cutpoint (such as 240 mg/dL) is that repeated measurements may be necessary.

This may be partially related to the estimates that one third of an individual\u2019s cholesterol level is linked to diet while the body produces the remaining two thirds. The evidence regarding regular exercise points to the benefits associated with such activity, as measured by changes in lipid levels. While alcohol intake can have a positive effect on cholesterol levels, consumption must be balanced with the potential risks associated with it. The potential effect of diet on cholesterol levels was noted in the 1990 NCEP report on cholesterol measurement, which recommended that patients maintain their usual diet and that their weight be stable for at least 2 weeks before their cholesterol level is measured.", "Clinical factors such as disease, pregnancy, and some medications (diuretics, beta blockers, oral contraceptives) can also alter cholesterol levels.

One study found that previously sedentary women who walked an average of 155 minutes per week decreased their total cholesterol level by 6.5 percent compared with a decrease of 2.2 percent in control subjects, and the HDL level of walkers increased 27 percent, compared with a 2-percent increase in controls.

Indeed, lipid levels after a heart attack are affected to such a degree that it is recommended that blood specimens be obtained within 24 hours of the event; if they cannot be taken within 24 hours, then they should not be taken for 3 months because the test will not accurately reflect the patient\u2019s usual lipid level.

Here factors such as the knowledge and experience of the laboratory technician are important. For example, the length of time a person is sitting or standing prior to having the specimen taken has been demonstrated to influence cholesterol test results. Patients should remain seated for at least 15 minutes before a venous sample is taken, and if a tourniquet is used, it should be applied for less than 1 minute before the specimen used for a lipid analysis is taken.

Yet, despite the attention cholesterol has received, it continues to be difficult to measure with accuracy and consistency across the broad range of devices and settings in which it is analyzed. While several studies have found that accuracy with patient samples was good, problems with matrix effects from using processed quality control materials have occurred, thus making it difficult to adequately assess accuracy among laboratories. In addition, the lack of information on accuracy in many laboratory settings where patients are likely to be tested, such as commercial laboratories, physicians\u2019 offices, and mass screening locations, makes it impossible to know whether the accuracy goals established for total and HDL cholesterol are uniformly being met.", "Even if one could be certain that a laboratory could provide reasonably accurate and precise test results, biological and behavioral factors such as diet, excercise, or illness cause an individual\u2019s cholesterol level to vary. It has been estimated that such factors may account for up to 65 percent of the total variation in an individual\u2019s reported cholesterol measurement. Studies have documented that some individuals\u2019 cholesterol level can vary dramatically from week to week while others\u2019 remains relatively constant. Although some biological variation can be controlled for, by having patients maintain their weight and diet for a modest period prior to measurement, many factors cannot be controlled.", "Total error from both analytical and biological variability can be considerable, as shown in tables 5.1 and 5.2, where calculations are made for hypothetical total and HDL cholesterol test results at different specified levels. For the purposes of this analysis, which is intended to illustrate the potential range of variability around an actual or known cholesterol level, we used the current goals for total analytical error (+8.9 percent for total cholesterol according to NCEP and +30 percent for HDL according to HCFA) and what is currently known about biological variability from a synthesis of studies (6.1 percent for total cholesterol and 7.4 percent for HDL cholesterol). Both analytical and biological variability can of course be lower or higher than these figures, depending on a combination of factors.", "The results in tables 5.1 and 5.2 show that a single cholesterol measurement may be highly misleading with respect to an individual\u2019s actual cholesterol value. A total cholesterol value that is known to be 240 mg/dL, for example, may vary as much as 16 percent or range from 201 to 279 mg/dL, when using these error rate assumptions. Similar estimates for HDL cholesterol measurements are presented in table 5.2.", "The implication of these estimates is that cholesterol levels should be thought of in terms of ranges rather than absolute fixed numbers. Compensating for variation by using the average of at least two cholesterol measurements is in line with the current NCEP guidelines and recent literature on the subject. The most recent NCEP Adult Treatment Panel recommends that a second test be done when an initial measurement has found that total cholesterol exceeds 200 mg/dL and HDL is under 35 mg/dL. In terms of HDL and LDL cholesterol, which have been documented to have analytical and biological variation somewhat higher than total cholesterol, more variability can be expected.

Moreover, 29 percent of U.S. adults, 52 million people, have a cholesterol level that is classified as too high, making them candidates for dietary therapy. Of this group, an estimated 12.7 million adults, one third of whom have established coronary heart disease, might be considered candidates for drug therapy to lower their cholesterol level. Once drug therapy is initiated, it may need to be maintained for life.", "Although the NCEP guidelines recognize the problem of measurement variability and the guidelines stress the need for multiple measurements, important consequences can be associated with measurement error. The potential exists, for example, that physicians may not account for measurement problems and may base decisions about patients on incorrect test results. In a worst-case scenario, two types of diagnostic errors could occur: false-positive or false-negative screens. A false-positive screen could result in treating individuals who in fact have a desirable total, HDL, and LDL cholesterol level. A false-negative result would incorrectly reassure an individual that his or her cholesterol level is low. The risk of misclassification would be greatest for those whose measured cholesterol levels are closest to one of the cutpoints. There is less ambiguity when values are well above or below a cutpoint. The likelihood of such errors occurring, however, is greater if physicians rely on only a single cholesterol measurement in making treatment decisions.", "Continuing efforts are needed to improve the accuracy and precision of lipid measurements so that medical decisions to initiate and continue treatment to lower elevated cholesterol levels can be both effective and efficient.
