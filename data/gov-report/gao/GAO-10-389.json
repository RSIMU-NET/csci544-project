Further, there can be many sources of counterfeit parts as DOD draws from a large network of global suppliers. Based on a congressional request, GAO examined (1) DOD's knowledge of counterfeit parts in its supply chain, (2) DOD processes to detect and prevent counterfeit parts, and (3) commercial initiatives to mitigate the risk of counterfeit parts.

While some DOD entities have developed their own definitions, these can vary in scope. Further, two DOD databases that track deficient parts--those that do not conform to standards--are not designed to track counterfeit parts. A third governmentwide database can track suspected counterfeit parts, but according to officials, reporting is low due to the perceived legal implications of reporting prior to a full investigation. Nonetheless, officials we met with across DOD cited instances of counterfeit parts, as shown in the table below. A recent Department of Commerce study also identified the existence of counterfeit electronic parts within DOD and industry supply chains. DOD is in the early stages of developing a program to help mitigate the risks of counterfeit parts. DOD does not currently have a policy or specific processes for detecting and preventing counterfeit parts. Existing procurement and quality-control practices used to identify deficient parts are limited in their ability to prevent and detect counterfeit parts in DOD's supply chain. For example, several DOD weapon system program and logistics officials told us that staff responsible for assembling and repairing equipment are not trained to identify counterfeit parts. Some DOD components and prime defense contractors have taken initial steps to mitigate the risk of counterfeit parts, such as creating risk-assessment tools and implementing a new electronic parts standard. Also facing risks from counterfeit parts, individual commercial sector companies have developed a number of anticounterfeiting measures, including increased supplier visibility, detection, reporting, and disposal. Recent collaborative industry initiatives have focused on identifying and sharing methods to reduce the likelihood of counterfeit parts entering the supply chain. Because many of the commercial sector companies produce items similar to those used by DOD, agency officials have an opportunity to leverage knowledge and ongoing and planned initiatives to help mitigate the risk of counterfeit parts as DOD develops its anticounterfeiting strategy."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["DOD draws from a large network of global suppliers and manages over 4  million different parts at a cost of over $94 billion; therefore, counterfeit  parts can enter its supply chain.

Counterfeit parts have the potential to cause a serious disruption  to DOD supply chains, delay ongoing missions, and even affect the  integrity of weapon systems. Counterfeits are not limited to the DOD  supply chain and exist in other government entities, such as the National  Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Department of Energy, as  well as in many commercial settings as diverse as software, commercial  aviation, automotive parts, and consumer electronics and can threaten the  safety of consumers.", "On the basis of your interest in DOD\u2019s ability to detect and prevent  counterfeit parts, we examined (1) the extent of DOD\u2019s knowledge of  counterfeit parts in its supply chain, (2) DOD processes to detect and  prevent counterfeit parts, and (3) commercial initiatives to mitigate the  risk of counterfeit parts in their supply chains.", "To conduct our work, we reviewed regulations, guidelines, and databases  to determine how DOD defines and tracks counterfeit parts.

We also reviewed a Department of Commerce study of counterfeit  electronic parts and met with officials to discuss their findings. To identify  practices for preventing and detecting counterfeit parts, we selected and  reviewed a nongeneralizable sample of 16 weapon systems representing a  mix of aerospace, ground vehicle, and missile defense sectors with mature  technologies. We identified initiatives planned and practices used by DOD  and defense contractors to prevent and detect counterfeit parts. To  identify commercial practices used to mitigate the risk of procuring  counterfeit parts, we interviewed officials from selected companies and  associations within the automotive, aviation, and electronics industries\u2014 sectors that have experienced counterfeit parts in their supply chains or  produce items similar to those used by the DOD programs we reviewed.  For more on our scope and methodology, see appendix I. We performed  our review from January 2009 through March 2010, in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards.

As they draw from a  large network of suppliers in an increasingly global supply chain, there can  be limited visibility into these sources and greater risk of procuring  counterfeit parts. Also, as DOD weapon systems age, products required to  support it may no longer be available from the original manufacturers or  through franchised or authorized suppliers but could be available from  independent distributors, brokers, or aftermarket manufacturers.

In the absence of  a departmentwide definition of counterfeit parts, some DOD entities  have developed their own. Although there are similarities among these  definitions, the scope varies. For example, one DLA supply center  defined a part as counterfeit only when it misrepresented the part\u2019s  trademark. In contrast, a different DLA supply center defined  counterfeit parts more broadly to include misrepresentations of a part\u2019s  quality and performance. In August 2009, DOD endorsed an aerospace  standard created by SAE International that includes a definition of the  term counterfeit part. While this standard is available departmentwide,  it is left to the discretion of each DOD program as to whether it wants  to use the standard. Some DOD officials who support aviation  programs, such as the F-15, told us they were using or considering use  of the standard, while other DOD officials told us they were unaware of  it.

DOD considers products that do not  conform to quality or design specifications to be deficient. Both of these  systems allow users to enter a cause code for why a part is deficient, but  neither database has a code to capture the deficiency as counterfeit. As a  result, users are limited to reporting a suspected counterfeit part in  narrative descriptions. However, identifying instances of counterfeit parts  through searches of narrative descriptions is difficult due to a lack of  common terminology. For example, an Air Force official told us that when  he searched the JDRS system, he found 3 out of more than 94,000 entries  that discussed counterfeit parts. We performed similar searches and found  that the terms associated with counterfeit are rarely included in narrative  fields. In consultation with database managers from both PDREP and  JDRS, we developed a list of 11 terms associated with counterfeit parts  and searched the systems\u2019 narrative fields for these terms over a 5-year  period ranging from October 1, 2004, to September 30, 2009.

Specifically, a GIDEP user can submit information on a  suspected counterfeit part and GIDEP policy allows for up to 15 days for  the supplier to respond before posting this information to the database. A  1991 Office of Management and Budget policy letter instructs government  agencies to use GIDEP to report deficient parts. However, the GIDEP  Deputy Program Manager told us that GIDEP is not widely used to report  suspect counterfeits. He stated that the policy letter was intended as a  short-term requirement for government use of GIDEP until a Federal  Acquisition Regulation change was made, which never occurred. He  further stated that DOD had previously issued a military standard  requiring use of GIDEP, which was canceled during acquisition reform in  1996.

Limitations in  the areas of obtaining supplier visibility, investigating part deficiencies,  and reporting and disposal may reduce DOD\u2019s ability to mitigate risks  posed by counterfeit parts.", "Obtaining supplier visibility: DOD and its prime contractors rely on  suppliers across a global supply chain for parts and materials. Federal  acquisition regulations require that agency contracting officers consider  whether a supplier is responsible before awarding a contract and note that  the award of a contract to a supplier based on the lowest price alone can  result in additional costs if there is subsequent default, late deliveries, or  other unsatisfactory performance. While cost or price is always a  consideration when purchasing goods, an abnormally low price, especially  from an unfamiliar source, can be an indication that there is a need to  assess the supplier\u2019s ability to meet the requirements of the contract. For  example, a DLA contracting official described an instance in which a  supplier new to DLA was awarded a contract based on a low price and a  performance score of 100 percent. However, the score was misleading as  the supplier had no past performance to measure. Ultimately, the supplier  was unable to meet the requirements of the contract. Further, DOD parts  can be purchased through the use of automated systems that have limited  visibility on suppliers and can increase the risk of purchasing counterfeit  parts. To address the risks of using automated source selection, DLA has a  pilot project to create a list of qualified distributors for the supply of two  electronic items\u2014semiconductors and microcircuits. Of the 53  distributors that applied, 13 were selected based on their qualifications.  DLA plans to review other parts to determine if the pilot can be expanded.  In addition, DOD has a number of weapons systems that have remained in  service longer than expected\u2014such as the B-52 bomber\u2014and require  parts that are no longer available from the original manufacturer or its  authorized distributors. When parts are needed for these systems, they are  often provided by brokers or independent distributors. As buying from  these sources reduces DOD\u2019s visibility into a part\u2019s pedigree, additional  steps are required in assuring that the part is reliable or authentic.", "Detecting Part Deficiencies: DOD can have a part\u2019s quality and authenticity  tested through destructive and nondestructive methods prior to awarding  a contract. However, several DOD officials told us that staff responsible  for assembling and repairing systems and equipment may not have the  expertise to identify suspect counterfeit parts outside of those that  demonstrate performance failures because they are not trained to identify  counterfeit parts and have limited awareness of the issue. In addition,  DOD contracting officials told us that the cost and time associated with  testing may be prohibitive, especially for lower-cost parts such as a 50-cent  fastener. Other factors were cited by DOD officials at several testing  centers as limitations such as the barriers to testing parts that are only  available in limited quantities or are expensive. For instance, the F-15  program was in need of two spare parts, but only two of these parts were  available in the supply chain, so the preferred destructive testing could not  be performed.", "Reporting and disposal: Generally, DOD has processes in place for  reporting and disposal of deficient parts. Reporting of a deficient part that  is suspected to be counterfeit enables further investigation to confirm that  a part is counterfeit. As described above, DOD uses JDRS and PDREP to  report deficient parts, but does not have a specific field in these databases  to report counterfeit parts. Some DOD officials stated that they report  suspect counterfeits to internal fraud teams, others indicated that they  would contact local law enforcement or the Federal Bureau of  Investigation in similar cases. DOD officials told us that when they found  counterfeit parts they have shared this information through informal  methods such as e-mails or phone calls. Others, such as MDA, use formal  methods to convey this information such as bulletins that alert MDA staff  of counterfeiting techniques and how to detect them as well as advisories  on confirmed counterfeit parts found in MDA programs. MDA officials  stated that these methods are an effective way to immediately alert their  staff of counterfeit parts.", "Further, depending on the condition of a noncounterfeit, deficient part and  its related demilitarization code, it can be refurbished, resold, or  destroyed. The disposal of counterfeit and scrapped parts is an area of  vulnerability as they could reenter the supply chain. According to officials  from the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service\u2014the agency  responsible for destroying and disposing of DOD\u2019s excess and surplus  parts\u2014it is critical that a part and its related demilitarization code be  identified as counterfeit when it is sent for disposal to prevent it from  reentering DOD\u2019s supply chain. However, DOD does not have a consistent  method to identify parts as counterfeit when they are sent for disposal.  Some parts designated for disposal have made their way back into the  supply chain. For example, DOD program officials described a helicopter  part that had the same serial number as a defective one that had been  destroyed. An X-ray test revealed the destroyed part had been welded  back together and put back in DOD\u2019s inventory."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some DOD Components and Contractors Have Taken Initial Steps to Address Counterfeit Parts", "paragraphs": ["In the absence of a departmentwide policy, some DOD components and  their contractors have supplemented existing procurement and quality- control practices to help mitigate the risk of counterfeit parts in the DOD  supply chain. For example, MDA has established a 12-person organization  that leverages subject-matter expertise at two DOD laboratories to  identify, evaluate, and track the effects of counterfeit parts on all MDA  hardware. MDA policies to address counterfeits are part of its Parts,  Materials, and Processes Mission Assurance Plan which includes  instructions on part selection, procurement, receipt, testing, and use of  parts. This plan specifically identifies three steps to offset the presence of  counterfeit parts and materials in the market: (1) preventing counterfeit  parts and materials by using only authorized distributors, with associated  certifying paperwork; (2) detecting and containing counterfeit parts and  materials through appropriate inspection and test methods; and   (3) notifying the user community of potential counterfeit concerns and  assisting in prosecution. The plan also instructs programs to impound  suspect counterfeit parts and all items from the same lot and to not return  suspected counterfeit parts to suppliers, preventing them from being sold  to others. According to MDA officials, all new contracts include adherence  to the plan\u2019s section on counterfeit parts and materials, and MDA has  developed policies that can be applied to existing contracts. MDA further  has applied DOD\u2019s item-unique identification technology that provides for  the marking of individual items\u2014whose unit acquisition cost is $5,000 or  more\u2014with a set of globally unique data elements. This technology is  designed to help DOD value and track items throughout their life cycle by  requiring equipment manufacturers to assign unique identification  numbers to parts acquired under DOD contracts, thus enabling better  traceability of a part to a specific manufacturer. MDA also has an ongoing  effort to develop tools to identify, quantify, and manage the risk of  counterfeit parts in the supply chain as counterfeits or suspect  counterfeits are detected. DLA\u2019s Supply Center in Columbus, Ohio, has an  established team that investigates suspect counterfeit parts under the  broader scope of fraud. The team is composed of members from DLA\u2019s  product verification, contracting, and legal offices as well as the Defense  Criminal Investigative Service and handles cases ranging from part  deficiencies to contractor misconduct.

Several prime contractors told us that they are using a recently adopted  industry standard to develop counterfeit protection plans. The standard  provides strategies to mitigate the risks of procuring counterfeit products  and standardizes practices to maximize availability of authentic parts and  procure parts from reliable sources. Additionally, it standardizes practices  to assure the authenticity of parts, control parts that are identified as  counterfeit, and report counterfeit parts to other potential users and  government investigative authorities. Prime contractors using this  standard are also focusing on ensuring traceability within their supply  chains through flow-down requirements to subcontractors. For example,  one contractor includes a clause in its contracts that states that its  suppliers shall ensure that they do not deliver counterfeits but if this  occurs, the supplier would immediately notify the defense contractor and  assume responsibility for the cost of replacing the counterfeit parts.

Some companies also include markings on products and  packaging that, when absent or altered, could alert investigators or  consumers to potential counterfeits. One company allows customers to  report suspected counterfeits on its Web site and posts pictures of  markings and security features for customers and investigators to use in  distinguishing genuine from counterfeit products.

The project team has  provided its recommendations to its association members and expects  final recommendations to be available in the fall of 2010.", "The Semiconductor Industry Association established an Anti- Counterfeiting Task Force in June 2006, which aims to stop counterfeit  semiconductors from entering the marketplace. According to the task  force Chairman, its work with U.S. Customs and Border Protection led to  the seizure of 1.6 million counterfeit semiconductors over the past 2 years.", "Other industry associations are also focusing their efforts on mitigating the  risk of counterfeit parts. Business Action to Stop Counterfeiting and  Piracy has developed a clearinghouse for information about counterfeiting  and piracy to facilitate information exchange. The Electronic Industry  Citizenship Coalition developed a risk-assessment tool for technology- industry companies to help determine the appropriate level of intensity of  supplier audits and also asks suppliers about how they manage their  subtier suppliers. The International Anti-Counterfeiting Coalition has  helped the auto industry bring 10 global manufacturers together to discuss  common global counterfeiting problems, and also provides opportunities  to its members to participate in training programs.", "The recent Department of Commerce report provided practices for  managing electronic counterfeits industrywide, as well as  recommendations for the U.S. government to mitigate the risk of  electronic counterfeit parts. The practices for managing counterfeits  included (1) provide clear, written guidance to employees on what steps to  take if they suspect a part is counterfeit, (2) remove and quarantine  suspected and confirmed parts from regular inventory, (3) maintain an  internal database to track all suspected and confirmed counterfeit  components, and (4) report suspected and confirmed counterfeit parts to  industry associations and databases and to law enforcement. The  department\u2019s report also stated that there is little information collected on  malfunctioning and nonoperational electronic parts, which gives a false  impression of supply-chain security. According to the report\u2019s findings,  personnel that use parts need to file Product Quality Deficiency Reports in  a timely manner to report nonworking electronic components, and if this  proves to be impractical for the field units, then another system of  reporting needs to be developed to facilitate information sharing.

DOD needs a departmentwide definition and consistently used means for  detecting, reporting, and disposing of counterfeit parts. Collaboration with  government agencies, industry associations, and commercial-sector  companies that produce items similar to those used by DOD and have  reported taking actions to mitigate the risks of counterfeit parts in their  supply chains offers DOD the opportunity to leverage ongoing and planned  initiatives in this area. Some of these initiatives, such as MDA practices  and industry detection and disposal processes, can be considered for  DOD\u2019s immediate use. However, as DOD collects data and acquires  knowledge about the nature and extent of counterfeit parts in its supply  chain, additional actions may be needed to help better focus its risk- mitigation strategies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of Defense take the following three  actions as DOD develops its anticounterfeit program:  1. leverage existing anticounterfeiting initiatives and practices currently  used by DOD components and industry to establish guidance that  includes a consistent and clear definition of counterfeit parts and  consistent practices for preventing, detecting, reporting, and disposing  of counterfeit parts;  2.  disseminate this guidance to all DOD components and defense  3.  analyze the knowledge and data collected to best target and refine  counterfeit-part risk-mitigation strategies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on a draft of this report, DOD concurred with the  recommendations and identified a number of actions that it will take to  address them.

We selected commercial supply chains and companies in those supply  chains based on one or more of several criteria: industries in which  instances of counterfeiting have taken place; companies that make  products similar to DOD weapons systems in terms of complexity; and  companies that make or buy products similar to those bought by DOD. We  met with company officials from functions including Quality, Legal,  Security, Brand Protection, and Sourcing and Supplier Management, to  discuss their experiences with counterfeits (both incoming parts and  counterfeit versions of their products) and processes in place to protect  against counterfeits.
