BJA and VAWO, together with OJP's Office of the Comptroller, are responsible for monitoring these grants to ensure they are implemented as intended, are responsive to grant goals and objectives, and comply with statutory regulations and policy guidelines. OJP's monitoring requirements include the development of monitoring plans that articulate who will conduct monitoring, the manner in which it will be done, and when and what type of monitoring activities are planned. Grant managers are to maintain documentation in grant files using such techniques as written reports of on-site reviews and telephone interview write-ups. GAO's review of 46 Byrne and 84 VAWO discretionary grants indicated that only 29 percent of Byrne and 11 percent of VAWO award files contained monitoring plans. In addition, for awards covering the most recent 12-month period, grant managers were not consistently documenting their monitoring activities. BJA and VAWO cannot systematically oversee grant managers' compliance with monitoring requirements because documentation is not readily available. Both BJA and VAWO rely on staff meetings and discussions to identify grant problems or monitoring issues, and neither have management information systems to compile and analyze data on monitoring activities.

VAWO\u2019s mission is to lead the national effort to end violence against women, including domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking. VAWO programs seek to improve criminal justice system responses to these crimes by providing support for law enforcement, prosecution, courts, and victim advocacy programs across the country. In addition, programs are to enhance direct services for victims, including victim advocacy, emergency shelter, and legal services.

Unless otherwise noted, all confidence intervals are less than or equal to plus or minus 10 percentage points.", "In regard to grantee financial and progress reports, we reviewed all available reports for the BJA and VAWO discretionary grants included in our sample from the initiation of the grant through December 31, 2000. We determined timeliness using dates recorded on reports compared with the specified intervals when they were supposed to be received. Also, to determine whether BJA and VAWO closeout procedures were implemented in accordance with OJP policy, we reviewed those grant files in our sample when the grant end date was between September 30, 1999, and August 31, 2000. For our review, we focused on required closeout documentation, such as precloseout contacts, closeout checklists, and final financial and progress reports.", "To address our third objective, regarding how BJA and VAWO determine compliance with OJP monitoring requirements, we requested information on any existing oversight and review processes relating to grant monitoring at BJA and VAWO and gathered and reviewed documentation that BJA and VAWO officials provided concerning their oversight processes.

The level of monitoring is to be based on the stated monitoring plan in the grant manager\u2019s memorandum. The plan is to contain information on who will conduct the monitoring, how it will be done, and when and what type of monitoring activities are planned. Monitoring information is to be collected using such techniques as on-site visits, telephone calls, and desk reviews, which are reviews to ensure that the grant files are complete and the grantee is in compliance with the program guidelines.", "In addition, grant managers are to review grantee program and financial progress reports.

During fiscal year 2000, BJA had approximately 20 program managers responsible for the monitoring activities for most nonformula BJA grants. Generally, each BJA program manager had responsibility for monitoring 25 to 40 discretionary grants, including those under the Byrne program.

The Monitoring Division is to review various program and financial documents contained in the official grant files to ensure that they are complete and the documents are properly executed. For discretionary grants, the Monitoring Division conducted 36 desk reviews for Byrne and 38 for VAWO discretionary grants in fiscal year 1999 and 6 desk reviews for Byrne and 16 for VAWO discretionary grants in fiscal year 2000. In addition, the Control Desk is to maintain the official grant files and is responsible for tracking the receipt of all grantee documents. The Control Desk is to receive grantee progress and financial reports, log the date of receipt into a tracking system, file the original in the official grant file, and forward a copy to the cognizant program office.

When the file contained a plan that outlined the type of monitoring and its frequency, our review showed that the documentation in the files was inadequate to demonstrate whether or not BJA and VAWO grant managers were consistently following the monitoring plans. For Byrne files, there were not enough monitoring plans with specific planned activities to ensure that our assessment was representative of all the awards. However, our limited comparisons of planned to actual documentation regarding phone contacts, site visits, and desk reviews revealed the following:   Phone Contacts. 13 of 46 Byrne files contained monitoring plans that specified the planned number and frequency (e.g., monthly or quarterly) of telephone contacts to be made. Of those 13 files, none contained documentation to show that all of the planned number of telephone contacts occurred.

Progress reports are to supply information on the activities and accomplishments of the grantee during the previous reporting period. Financial reports are to show the actual expenditures and unliquidated obligations for the reporting period (calendar quarter) and cumulative for the award. We found Byrne and VAWO grant files in which progress reports and financial reports did not cover the entire period of the grant and a few files with no evidence of progress reports. We also found that progress and financial reports were often late. Combined, these factors resulted in unaccounted periods of time, where OJP had either no information or no up-to-date information about grantee progress or financial activities.", "For example, we compared the time periods progress and financial reports were supposed to cover with the time periods they actually covered for each of the Byrne and VAWO grant files we reviewed. Based on our analysis of the grant files, we estimate that 70 percent of the Byrne grantshad periods of time during the grant period not covered by progress reports, and 41 percent of the Byrne grants had periods of time not covered by financial reports. Likewise, we estimate that 66 percent of the VAWO grants had periods of time during the grant period not covered by progress reports and 36 percent of the VAWO grants had periods of time not covered by financial reports. These gaps, cumulative over the life of the grant, ranged from as little as 2 weeks to over 3 years for progress reports and from 1 month to 1\u00bd years for financial reports. With regard to progress reports, we estimate that 30 percent of Byrne grants and 18 percent of VAWO grants had more than 12 months that were not covered. With regard to financial reports, we estimate that only 4 percent of grants at both BJA and VAWO had more than 12 months that were not covered.", "Our analysis also showed that a few grant files did not contain any progress reports. For the files we reviewed, seven\u2014three Byrne and four VAWO\u2014contained no progress reports. We noted that OJP awarded one VAWO grantee two supplemental awards over the course of a 3-year period, even though there were no progress reports in the file. In total, these seven grant files without progress reports represent over $2 million in grantee funds awarded over a 5-year period. Finally, we noted examples of progress reports covering more than the required 6-month period and noted that one VAWO progress report that was submitted to cover a 2\u00bd- year period was a half-page long. Given OJP\u2019s requirement that progress reports are to be submitted for each 6-month period of the grant, the fact that reports covered periods well beyond the required 6 months raises questions about whether a grant manager has sufficient information to monitor progress and identify any potential grantee problems.", "We asked BJA and VAWO officials why these seven grant files did not contain any progress reports. BJA\u2019s Acting Director at the time of our review said that reorganizations in BJA over the last 2 years have contributed to difficulty in ensuring complete and accurate grant files. VAWO officials explained that one of the four grant files involved a grantee that had some grant implementation problems that have since been corrected and said that problems aside, the grantee had been unaware that progress reports were required for periods of grant inactivity. They said that another of the four grantees had been accustomed to the reporting requirements for formula grants, but unaware of different reporting requirements for discretionary grants. According to VAWO officials, this situation has since been corrected and the files have been made current. VAWO officials were unclear about why another grantee had not submitted progress reports. However, they said that the one grantee that had been awarded two supplemental grants is now scheduled for closeout because of the extended period of time the grantee has been delinquent in submitting progress reports. In addition, VAWO officials said that it was unacceptable for a grantee to submit a half-page progress report covering 2\u00bd years.", "Our review of grant files also showed that late reports were common.OJP has specific guidance that spells out when progress and financial reports are to be filed by grantees. Progress reports are due 30 days after the close of each previous 6-month period, and financial reports are to be turned in 45 days after the end of the calendar quarter. We compared the dates progress and financial reports were supposed to be filed by grantees with the dates they were actually received by OJP\u2019s Office of the Comptroller. We estimate that 68 percent of Byrne and 85 percent of VAWO progress reports were late. However, for both Byrne and VAWO, we estimate that about 40 percent of all reports were late by only about a month. Table 1 shows our estimates of the timeliness of Byrne and VAWO progress reports.", "Similarly, in the case of financial reports, our review showed an estimated 53 percent of Byrne and 54 percent of VAWO financial reports were submitted late. Similar to progress reports, about one-third of all reports were late by 30 days or less. Table 2 shows our estimates of timeliness of Byrne and VAWO financial reports.", "OJP\u2019s Office of the Comptroller also found problems similar to those we identified regarding financial reports. As mentioned earlier, the Office of the Comptroller does periodic financial reviews of the official grant file. We examined Comptroller records for 22 grants also covered in our review and found they identified 8 Byrne and 9 VAWO files that were missing some financial reports and 5 Byrne and 8 VAWO files in which financial reports were late. We did not determine what was done to follow up on the late or missing financial reports found during these financial reviews.

In addition, VAWO officials said that since VAWO\u2019s inception, VAWO grant managers have had the responsibility to not only monitor an increasing volume of grants, but also to develop and implement several new grant programs. In commenting on a draft of this report, the Assistant Attorney General stated BJA grant managers have had similar responsibilities. The Assistant Attorney General also commented that one reason for VAWO\u2019s lack of documentation regarding site visits might be a past practice by which all VAWO grant managers memorandums included a standard monitoring plan that was developed in fiscal year 1995, when VAWO was responsible for monitoring one formula and one small discretionary grant program.", "Regardless, officials from both BJA and VAWO stated that the monitoring activities may still be taking place, even though they are not documented consistently. When asked how one would know whether a desk review had been done, one BJA official told us that desk reviews were not a specific process, rather they were the type of activities that grant managers did on a day-to-day basis. He added that since BJA had no formalized process for conducting desk reviews, no documentation was required of the grant managers upon completion. Nonetheless, OJP\u2019s guidance for the period covered by our review stated that a desk review form is to be prepared periodically to note, among other things, all contacts, reports, and product reviews. The form is also to include issues, accomplishments, and problems, noting recommended solutions.", "BJA\u2019s Acting Director at the time of our review told us that oversight of grants can and has suffered through changes at BJA, including reorganizations within BJA and the increased number of grants and greater workload for BJA grant managers. He said that there is no question that, as mentioned earlier, reorganizations contributed to the difficulty in ensuring complete and accurate grant files and cited transfers of grant files among grant managers as one reason why files were inaccurate or incomplete. He pointed out that BJA has made some changes, including the drafting of new policies and procedures, that are designed to assist grant managers in their grant responsibilities. For example, BJA\u2019s draft procedures called for desk reviews to be performed by grant managers every 6 months or when files were transferred among grant managers. These reviews were to require that each grant manager fill out a checklist\u2014covering such things as the completeness of grant paperwork and the timeliness of progress and financial reports\u2014that upon completion, was to be reviewed by a branch chief. According to the Acting Director at the time of our review, BJA\u2019s guidance, which was undated, had been drafted sometime before July 2000, but had since been subsumed into OJP\u2019s January 2001 update to its grant monitoring procedures. At the time of our review, it was unclear whether BJA had put any of these procedures into practice. In commenting on a draft of this report, the Assistant Attorney General noted that BJA has indicated that it expects to put these procedures into practice in fiscal year 2002.", "In those same comments, the Assistant Attorney General also stated that like BJA, VAWO has been working on developing policies and procedures for monitoring grantees more effectively. For example, she stated that a VAWO Monitoring Working Group was formed in spring 2001. The group is working to develop a risk-based assessment tool to develop more realistic monitoring plans; pre-, post-, and on-site protocols for site visits; a standard site visit report form; and a comprehensive training program on monitoring for new employees. Also, according to the Assistant Attorney General, VAWO has developed a desk review checklist that will begin to be used in fiscal year 2002.", "OJP requires documentation of grant monitoring activities to provide assurance to OJP grant managers and supervisors that appropriate oversight of grant activities is taking place. It is possible that grant managers are conducting grant monitoring activities even if no documentation exists. However, without documentation, neither OJP, BJA, VAWO, nor we are positioned to tell with any certainty whether such monitoring occurred. The Comptroller General\u2019s internal control standards require that all transactions and other significant events be clearly documented and that the documentation be readily available for examination.

In 1996, an OJP- wide working group, established at the request of the Assistant Attorney General, issued a report on various aspects of the grant process, including grant administration and monitoring.

He said that currently, OJP runs the risk of losing or misplacing key documentation, especially since documents are kept in two files physically maintained by two organizations in different locations\u2014one, the official file maintained by the Office of the Comptroller, and the other, the grant manager\u2019s file maintained by the program office. He said that the new system currently covers grants for some OJP organizations up to the award stage, but that OJP\u2019s goal is to include tracking information about all stages of the grant process from preaward through closeout.", "Although GMS may ultimately help OJP better manage the grant administration process, DOJ\u2019s Fiscal Year 2000 Performance Report and Fiscal Year 2002 Performance Plan does not state when GMS will be expanded\u2014either to all of the OJP components or to include the full range and scope of monitoring activities. Regarding the latter, OJP\u2019s Director of Office of Budget and Management Services indicated that it is unlikely that GMS will cover the full range of monitoring activities; instead, OJP would be more likely to develop a monitoring management information system to capture monitoring data that would link to GMS. The Director said that OJP has formed an OJP-wide working group to further study data issues related to monitoring activities, but the group is in its preliminary stages and has yet to develop a charter to define its activities.", "OJP has also been working on two key efforts to enhance its ability to better control grant administration. One of these initiatives, \u201cOperation Closeout,\u201d was a pilot project announced in February 2000 by OJP\u2019s Working Group on Grant Administration that was to, among other things, accelerate the grant closeout process through revised closeout guidelines and elevate the importance of the closeout function as a required procedure in the administration of grants. In November 2000, the working group announced that it had realized several of the Operation\u2019s objectives and, working with the Office of the Comptroller, was able to reduce the backlog of grants, including some managed by BJA and VAWO, that were eligible to be closed but had not been closed. According to the Chairman of the working group, this operation closed out 4,136 outstanding grants over a 6-month period, resulting in over $30 million in deobligated funds. In September 2001, the Chairman said that OJP was going to initiate another closeout operation based on the success of the pilot.", "Another OJP initiative involved the development and issuance of new OJP- wide guidance for grant administration, including grant monitoring. As mentioned earlier, in January 2001, OJP released Grant Management Policies and Procedures Manual to update and codify OJP\u2019s current policies and procedures regarding its business practices. According to OJP officials, the new guidance was developed at the direction of the former Assistant Attorney General to address overall concerns about weaknesses in the 1992 version. The guidance was developed over a period of about two years, with the goal of reengineering the grant management process based on the best practices of bureaus and offices throughout OJP. For example, the changes include some provisions pertaining to some of the aforementioned closeout activities--grantees are now given 120 days to submit final financial reports (instead of 90 days). Also, grant managers are given greater latitude to close out a grant if they have been unsuccessful in obtaining the final financial report from the grantee.", "OJP trained over 300 grant managers during summer 2001 and, according to the Chairman of the working group, intends to train supervisors about the new guidance in fall 2001. OJP also has drafted and plans to send a questionnaire to recently trained grant managers to identify any issues or problems with using the online manual and to identify potential training interest and topics. OJP plans to develop and send a similar questionnaire to supervisors once they are trained.

Furthermore, BJA and VAWO do not have readily available data on most monitoring activities that would help them determine grant managers\u2019 compliance with OJP guidelines, and even when data are available, it is not clear that supervisors use the data to ensure that monitoring activities occurred. The lack of systematic data, combined with poor documentation, limits BJA and VAWO\u2019s ability to manage the grant monitoring process so that they can determine whether grant managers are monitoring grantees, and if not, why not, or if so, why are they not documenting their activities. It also hinders BJA and VAWO\u2019s ability to measure their performance consistent with GPRA, especially given that DOJ is relying on data collected through grant monitoring to measure the Department\u2019s performance for many of its grant programs.

As we stated in the report (see p. 2), financial monitoring was not within the scope of our work. It is important to note that the scope of our work was based on agreements with our requesters and was not influenced by whether or not financial monitoring information is included in OJP\u2019s annual financial statement audit. 4.  According to the OJP Handbook: Policies and Procedures for the Administration of OJP Grants (Feb. 1992), official grant files kept by the Office of Comptroller Control Desk are to contain documents relating to each grantee, including progress and financial reports and site visit reports. In addition, for documentation to be readily available for examination, as required by the Comptroller General\u2019s internal control standards, keeping them in the official grant files seems appropriate. 5.

As we stated, it is possible that grant managers are conducting grant monitoring activities even if no documentation exists.
