Concerns have been raised about whether GI benefits adequately cover educational costs and whether the receipt of GI benefits affects other federal financial assistance available to postsecondary students under Title IV of the Higher Education Act and the Internal Revenue Code. Under Title IV, GI benefits do not affect the amount of aid veterans receive under the Pell grant and subsidized Stafford loan programs but may affect the amount they receive in unsubsidized loans and through campus-based aid programs. Depending on the program, GI benefits may be considered as another source of financial assistance for students, which may decrease a veteran student's financial need and thus the amount of need-based aid provided. With regard to available federal tax incentives, the receipt of GI benefits does not preclude veterans from claiming such benefits but may affect the amount they would be eligible to claim. On average, veterans and nonveterans with comparable characteristics are awarded similar amounts of federal Title IV aid. When GI benefits are included, the total amount of federal assistance is greater for veterans than it is for nonveterans. Moreover, veterans' total aid, including Pell Grants, Stafford loans, and GI benefits has a lower proportion of loans compared with nonveterans' packages.

Title 38 Chapter 30), a benefit  program that provides a monthly stipend to pay for postsecondary  education expenses for veterans and eligible service members. Recently,  concerns have been raised about whether GI benefits adequately cover  educational costs and whether the receipt of GI benefits affects the  amount of other federal financial assistance available to postsecondary  students under Title IV of the Higher Education Act (HEA) and the  Internal Revenue Code. Through Title IV, about $46 billion was awarded to  students in the form of grants, loans, and work-study programs in the 1999- 2000 academic year. The primary Title IV programs consist of (1) Pell  grants; (2) subsidized and unsubsidized Stafford loans; and (3)  Supplemental Educational Opportunity grants (SEOG), Perkins loans, and  work study aid funded by the federal government and administered by  participating higher education institutions, commonly known as campus- based aid. Under the Internal Revenue Code, a variety of provisions are  available that are designed to help families pay for college. For example, in  1999, taxpayers claimed an estimated $5.2 billion in HOPE and Lifetime  Learning tax credits, which allow taxpayers to reduce the amount of taxes  owed by receiving a credit for tuition and fees paid.", "Given the broad range of federal postsecondary financial aid available to  students, you asked us to (1) determine whether receiving GI benefits  affects veterans\u2019 eligibility for other federal financial aid and (2) compare  the typical amount of federal financial aid awarded to veteran and  nonveteran students based on various student and family characteristics  that affect their eligibility for financial aid, including income and whether  students were dependent or independent of their parents. For our first  objective, we reviewed the HEA of 1965, as amended, and related  regulations to identify the type of federal aid available under Title IV  programs to all students, the methodology used to determine students\u2019  eligibility for this aid, and how GI benefits are treated in federal  methodology. For our second objective, we used data from two U.S.  Department of Education databases for academic year 1999-2000 to  determine the amount of Title IV aid awarded to all students. We asked  Education to estimate the amount of Title IV aid awarded to the following  populations: (1) veteran students; (2) nonveteran independent students;  and (3) nonveteran dependent students who were in their first year of  enrollment on a full-time basis at a public 2-year, public 4-year, and private  4-year institution. Over 90 percent of veteran and nonveteran students are  enrolled in such institutions. For each of these populations, we identified  the 25th, 50th, and 75th family income percentiles and the amount of Pell  grant and Stafford loans awarded to students at these income levels, based  on the average cost of attendance for each type of institution. We also  asked Education to calculate the average campus-based aid award made  to each student population at each type of institution. We did not  independently verify data collected or analyzed by Education, however  this is the only source of data available. We did verify Education\u2019s  calculations of estimated Pell grant and Stafford loan aid awarded. Since  tax forms do not collect information on a taxpayer\u2019s veteran status, there  is no data on the exact amount of HOPE and Lifetime Learning tax credits  claimed by veteran and nonveteran students. Therefore, we calculated the  amount of tax credits for which students or families may be eligible based  on a variety of factors, such as family income and amount of grant aid  received. We did not include data on the amount of financial aid a student  may receive from a state or an institution.

Under the GI bill program (Title 38 United  States Code Chapter 30), veterans who have met their duty obligation and  were honorably discharged are eligible to receive GI benefits. Active-duty  personnel are also eligible to use GI benefits. In fiscal year 2000,  approximately $923 million was paid to veterans through the GI bill  program. The GI bill program is a contributory program, which requires  service members, upon enlistment, to contribute $100 per month for their  first 12 months of service. Although service members have the option to  decline participation at enlistment, almost all are enrolling in the GI bill  program. In fiscal year 1999, 96 percent of all active-duty eligible enlistees  enrolled in the GI bill program. GI benefits end 10 years from last  discharge, and if veterans do not use their GI benefit within that time  period, the amount is not refunded to them.", "Veterans may use GI benefits for a variety of postsecondary education  programs, including an undergraduate or graduate degree; courses that  lead to a certificate or diploma from a business, technical, or vocational  school; correspondence training; on-the-job training or apprenticeships;  and vocational flight training. The monthly benefit amount will vary  depending on the type of coursework in which the veteran enrolls and  whether the student attends part-time or full-time. For veterans who enroll  full-time in an undergraduate degree program in academic year 2001-02,  the monthly GI benefit is $672 per month for a maximum of 36 months\u2014a  total of $6,048 for each of 4 academic years.  The Veterans Education and  Benefits Expansion Act of 2001 (P.L. 107-103) increases the monthly GI  benefit to $800 per month as of January 1, 2002.  Additionally, the law  increases the GI benefit to $900 per month on October 1, 2002 and to $985  per month beginning on October 1, 2003\u2014a total of $8,100 in 2002-03 and  $8,865 in 2003-04.

The  Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-34) created several provisions to  help families pay for postsecondary education, such as the HOPE tax  credit, Lifetime Learning tax credit, and the student loan interest  deduction. The act also created tax-exempt savings accounts, called  education individual retirement accounts (IRA), to help families save for  college. See table 1 for further detail about the tax provisions created  under the Taxpayer Relief Act. The act also made changes to the tax  treatment of state tuition savings plans, extended the exclusion for  educational assistance provided by employers from students\u2019 taxable  incomes, and exempted IRA distributions for qualified higher education  expenses from early withdrawal penalties.", "In 2001, the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act (P.L. 107- 16) expanded and modified several of the tax provisions previously  mentioned.

Information from  the FAFSA is used to determine the amount of money\u2014called the  expected family contribution (EFC)\u2014that a student, or student\u2019s family, is  expected to contribute to the student\u2019s education. A student is classified as  either financially dependent on his or her parents or independent in the  financial aid process. This classification is important because it affects the  factors used to determine a student\u2019s EFC. For dependent students, the  EFC is based on both the student and parent\u2019s income and assets, as well  as whether the family has other children enrolled in college. For  independent students, the EFC is based on the student\u2019s and, if married,  spouse\u2019s income and assets and whether the student has any dependents  other than a spouse. By law, veteran students are automatically classified  as independent students, and GI benefits are not included as veterans\u2019  income for purposes of calculating EFC.", "Once EFC is established, this information is compared to the cost of the  institution at which the student will attend to determine a student\u2019s  financial need. In the federal financial aid process, an institution\u2019s cost of  attendance includes tuition and fees, room and board, books, supplies,  transportation, and miscellaneous personal expenses. The type of  institution that a student attends will affect the cost of attendance.  Typically, public 2-year institutions cost significantly less than public 4- year institutions or private 4-year institutions. For example, on average,  the annual cost to attend a public 2-year college as a commuter student  was $7,024 compared with $11,338 for resident students at public 4-year  institutions and $24,946 for resident students at private 4-year institutions.", "If the EFC is equal to or greater than the cost of attendance, then the  student is not considered to have financial need for federal aid programs.  If the EFC is less than cost of attendance, then the student is considered to  have financial need. Financial aid administrators at the school the student  is attending then create a federal financial aid package that could include  grants, loans, and work-study. The basic premise for awarding need-based  aid is that a student\u2019s \u201ctotal financial aid package must not exceed a  student\u2019s need.\u201d Veterans are an exception to this rule, and in some cases,  those who receive GI benefits may receive a combined federal aid package  of GI benefits and need-based aid, such as Pell grants and subsidized  Stafford loans, that is greater than their financial need. Figure 2 highlights  these key steps in determining a student\u2019s financial need for Title IV  programs.", "Most students, whether receiving a GI benefit or not, enroll in a public 2- population and 89 percent of GI bill students enroll in a public institution,  while 19 percent of all students and 11 percent of GI bill students enroll in  a private institution.

Veterans can apply for federal  Title IV aid; however, receiving GI benefits may affect their eligibility for  some Title IV aid. Pell grant aid is awarded to students based mainly on  income.  The amount awarded to students is the difference between the  maximum Pell grant award for that academic year and the student\u2019s EFC.  GI benefits are not included in the formula used to calculate EFC and  therefore receiving them does not affect veterans\u2019 eligibility for Pell grants.  For all other Title IV aid, EFC and the amount of other financial assistance  students receive is subtracted from the cost of attendance to determine  financial need. Depending on the aid program, GI benefits may or may not  be considered as another source of financial assistance for veteran  students, thus affecting veterans\u2019 eligibility for these programs. By law, GI  benefits are specifically excluded as another source of assistance for  veteran students when awarding subsidized Stafford loans. Since GI  benefits are excluded from the calculations used to award subsidized  Stafford loans, veterans and nonveterans are equally eligible for these  loans. On the other hand, when determining eligibility for unsubsidized  Stafford loans and campus-based aid, GI benefits are considered another  source of assistance. Regulations issued in 1999 allow financial aid  administrators some flexibility to exclude the value of GI benefits in the  calculations for campus-based aid, but only if the GI bill student also  receives a subsidized Stafford loan. If this flexibility is used, veteran  students\u2019 eligibility for campus-based aid may not be affected by receipt of  GI benefits.
