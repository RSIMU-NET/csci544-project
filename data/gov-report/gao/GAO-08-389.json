College students may have access to student insurance plans offered by their colleges. GAO was asked to report on uninsured college students, student insurance plans, and efforts to increase the number of insured students. GAO reviewed (1) college students' insurance status, (2) uninsured college students' characteristics, (3) the extent to which colleges offered student insurance plans and the characteristics of available plans, and (4) efforts to increase the number of insured students. GAO analyzed data from a national survey on college students' insurance status and uninsured college students' characteristics. GAO collected data from 340 colleges on the availability of student insurance plans and the characteristics of available plans, and also gathered detailed plan information from case studies of 10 colleges and interviews with experts and insurance industry officials.

While 67 percent of college students were covered through employer-sponsored plans, 7 percent were covered through other private health insurance plans, such as student insurance plans, and 6 percent were covered by public programs, such as Medicaid. Most insured students were covered, for example, as a dependent, on a policy under another person's name. About 20 percent of college students aged 18 through 23 (1.7 million) were uninsured in 2006, and certain groups of students--such as part-time students, nonwhite students, and students from families with lower incomes--were more likely than others to be uninsured. The characteristics of uninsured students are consistent with those of the uninsured found in the general U.S. population. Over half of colleges nationwide offered student insurance plans in the 2007-2008 academic year, and plans' benefits varied. Colleges customized their plans to reflect their priorities in making premiums affordable for students while providing coverage that meets students' needs. The plans GAO reviewed varied in the services they covered and how they paid for covered services. Specifically, some plans excluded preventive services from coverage and some plans limited payment for benefits such as prescription drugs. In addition, plans also varied in terms of premiums and maximum benefits, with annual premiums ranging from $30 to $2,400 and maximum benefits ranging from $2,500 for each illness or injury to unlimited lifetime coverage. Colleges and states have taken a variety of steps to increase the number of insured college students. For example, GAO estimated that about 30 percent of colleges nationwide required students to have health insurance in academic year 2007-2008, and some states also have health insurance requirements for college students. Finally, some states have expanded dependents' eligibility for private health insurance, which makes insurance more available to college students who obtain coverage as dependents. Officials from the American College Health Association (ACHA)--an advocacy and leadership organization for college and university health--provided a technical comment, which we incorporated."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["College students face challenges obtaining health insurance.

To  describe the characteristics of uninsured college students, we analyzed  CPS data on the demographic characteristics of insured and uninsured  college students aged 18 through 23 in 2006. To describe the financial  impact of the uninsured college student population on health care  systems, we estimated the amount of uncompensated care uninsured  students incurred.

Under these plans, employers typically  subsidize a share of employees\u2019 premiums for health insurance, and  premiums are calculated based on the risk characteristics of the entire  group. To offer health insurance, employers either purchase coverage  from an insurance carrier or fund their own plans. All plans purchased  from insurance carriers must meet state requirements, which vary by state.  For example, some states require employer-sponsored plans purchased  from insurance carriers to offer coverage to dependents. Although  requirements for dependent coverage vary by state, plans have  traditionally offered health insurance coverage for dependents through  age 18, and have generally continued coverage for dependents through age  22 only if they attend college full-time.", "Under federal law, college students who have lost eligibility for dependent  coverage under a parent\u2019s employer-sponsored insurance plan may be able  to use provisions in COBRA to continue their health insurance for a  limited period of time. Specifically, COBRA allows individuals such as  college students who have lost eligibility for dependent coverage the  option of purchasing up to 36 months of continuation coverage under the  employer-sponsored plan. COBRA does not require employers to pay for  or subsidize this continuation coverage, which can appear expensive in  contrast to the subsidized premiums that employees and their dependents  may be accustomed to paying for employer-sponsored coverage. COBRA  permits employers to charge 100 percent of the premium, plus an  additional 2 percent administrative fee.", "College students may obtain health insurance through health insurance  plans offered by other groups such as their college. Colleges offer health  insurance plans to students because they have an interest in maintaining  the health of their students and helping them achieve their educational  objectives. These plans also can help students avoid high medical bills. To  offer a health insurance plan, colleges either contract with an insurance  carrier or fund their own plans. Unlike enrollees of employer-sponsored  plans, those enrolled in student insurance plans typically pay the full  premium for coverage. To make decisions about the plan\u2019s eligibility  criteria, benefits, and premiums, colleges typically convene a student  health insurance committee, which generally includes college  administrators, student health center administrators, and student  representatives. These committees decide how the student insurance plan  will coordinate with a college\u2019s student health center, if one exists. College  student health centers vary greatly in the services they provide\u2014some  offer limited services from one nurse, and others offer extensive services  from multiple specialists. The committees may also consider college  student insurance program standards issued by ACHA. Among other  things, these standards suggest that colleges require students to have  health insurance as a condition of enrollment, and that student insurance  plans provide an appropriate level of benefits, including coverage of  preventive services and mental health services and coverage for  catastrophic illnesses or injuries.", "College students may also obtain health insurance through individual  market plans, which are plans sold by insurance carriers to individuals  who do not receive coverage through an employer, college, or other group.  Because these plans are offered by insurance carriers, the plans must meet  state requirements, including those regarding eligibility for dependent  coverage. Individuals purchasing a health insurance plan in the individual  market typically pay the full cost of their health care premium. Insurance  carriers who sell plans in the individual market are typically allowed to  review the health status of each individual applying for insurance. Unlike  the employer-sponsored group market where premiums are based on the  risk characteristics of the entire group, premiums for individual market  coverage are based on factors associated with differences in each  applicant\u2019s expected health care costs, such as health status, age, and  gender. Furthermore, applicants for individual market coverage may be  rejected.", "Some college students may be able to obtain health insurance in the  individual market as a result of protections established by HIPAA.  Specifically, HIPAA protects eligible individuals, including college  students who have exhausted COBRA continuation coverage, by requiring  insurance carriers to offer individual market plans without a waiting  period for coverage of preexisting conditions. HIPAA also protects  eligible college students who were previously and continuously covered by  a group market plan and are seeking coverage under a different group  market plan. For these individuals, HIPAA requires insurance carriers to  limit the use of waiting periods for coverage of preexisting conditions to  no more than 12 months.", "In addition to private sources of health insurance, college students may  obtain health insurance coverage through public health insurance  programs, such as Medicaid or SCHIP. Some college students may have  coverage through Medicaid, a joint federal-state program that finances  health care coverage for certain low-income families, children, pregnant  women, and individuals who are aged or disabled. Federal law requires  states to extend Medicaid eligibility to children aged 6 through 18 in  families with incomes at or below the federal poverty level.

College administrators also  told us that they want to provide coverage that meets the needs of their  students so their students could avoid high medical bills and complete  their college education. When designing their plans, college administrators  vary in the extent to which they prioritize premium affordability over plan  benefits.

Some plans offered by colleges we reviewed in  our case studies limited coverage within the categories by excluding  treatment for specific services, and according to college administrators we  interviewed, this effort helps to keep premiums affordable. For example,  some other plans we reviewed excluded coverage for services such as  testing and treatment for allergies or treatment for injuries sustained as a  result of attempted suicide or while under the influence of drugs or  alcohol. Furthermore, according to our review of plans offered by colleges  in our case studies, plans also varied in the extent to which they covered  preventive services.

Some plans we reviewed  established limits (known as internal benefit limits) on the maximum  amount the plan would pay for a particular service or set of services. For  example, one plan we reviewed limited coverage for ambulance services  to $150 per condition per lifetime and another plan limited coverage of all  outpatient benefits (including doctor visits, emergency room visits, X-rays,  laboratory fees, radiation, and chemotherapy) to $1,200 per condition per  lifetime. Some plans we reviewed also used internal benefit limits to  constrain the number of visits covered for a particular service. For  example, we reviewed plans that limited coverage for outpatient doctor\u2019s  visits to 10 visits per year or less. Some plans we reviewed set both  internal benefit limits and required enrollees to share in the cost of  covered services.", "Low internal benefit limits can make it highly unlikely for enrollees\u2019  coverage to meet the plan\u2019s maximum benefit amount. For example, one  plan we reviewed in our case studies had a maximum benefit of $50,000  per condition per lifetime and an internal benefit limit of $1,200 per  condition per lifetime for all outpatient benefits, including coverage for  emergency services, diagnostic services, radiation, and chemotherapy.  Under this plan, students who require extensive outpatient services to  treat one condition (such as a chronic condition or serious illness like  cancer) would be unlikely to ever meet the $50,000 per condition per  lifetime maximum benefit amount."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Colleges and States Have Taken a Variety of Steps to Increase the Number of Insured College Students", "paragraphs": ["To increase the number of insured college students, colleges and states  have taken a variety of steps, such as requiring students to have health  insurance.

Specifically, insurance industry officials we interviewed told us that from  15 to 40 percent of students enroll in student insurance plans offered by  colleges that have a health insurance requirement, whereas less than   10 percent of students enroll in plans that are offered by colleges without  such a requirement. In addition, students who enroll in plans offered by  colleges with health insurance requirements generally are healthier than  those who voluntarily enroll in plans offered by colleges without a  requirement. Because larger and healthier populations typically enroll in  student insurance plans offered by colleges with an insurance  requirement, these colleges are generally able to offer plans with more  comprehensive benefits or more affordable premiums than they would  otherwise have been able to offer if they did not have such a requirement.

According to college administrators and insurance industry officials,  college administrators face challenges implementing a requirement  because doing so adds a fee to the total cost of attending college at a time  when many are concerned with the rising cost of attending college.  Administrators of public colleges are especially concerned about adding a  new fee because, as one insurance industry representative noted, public  colleges have lower annual tuition than private colleges, so the addition of  a health insurance premium to student fees results in a larger percentage  increase in the cost of attendance. According to college administrators we  interviewed, some colleges compete for students based on cost of  attendance and administrators of these colleges are concerned that  implementing a health insurance requirement would give them a  disadvantage in attracting students. Because of challenges in  implementing a requirement at the college level, some college  administrators and insurance industry officials would prefer to see such  requirements established by a higher authority, such as a state or higher  education governing board, or by a group of peer institutions in order to  \u201clevel the playing field\u201d for colleges.", "Some states and higher education governing boards have implemented  health insurance requirements for college students. For example,  Massachusetts and New Jersey require students attending college in their  states to have health insurance as a condition of enrollment.  Massachusetts, which implemented its requirement in 1989, requires all  students enrolled in college for at least three-quarters of full-time status to  either purchase a student insurance plan offered by their colleges or  present proof of comparable coverage. In 1991, New Jersey also began  requiring all full-time students attending college in the state to have health  insurance.
