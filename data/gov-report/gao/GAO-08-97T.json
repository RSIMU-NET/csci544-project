GAO's analysis of the 2006 general election data from Sarasota County did not identify any particular voting machines or machine characteristics that could have caused the large undervote in the FL-13 race. The undervotes in Sarasota County were generally distributed across all machines and precincts. GAO's analysis found that some of the prior tests and reviews conducted by the State of Florida and Sarasota County provide assurance that certain components of the voting systems in Sarasota County functioned correctly, but they are not enough to provide reasonable assurance that the iVotronic DREs did not contribute to the undervote. Specifically, GAO found that assurance is lacking in three areas, and proposes that tests be conducted to address those areas. First, because there is insufficient assurance that the firmware in all the iVotronic DREs used in the election matched the certified version held by the Florida Division of Elections, GAO proposes that a firmware verification test be conducted on a representative sample of 115 (of the 1,499) machines that were used in the general election. Second, because an insufficient number of ways to select a candidate in the FL-13 race were tested, GAO proposes that a test be conducted to verify all 112 ways that GAO identified to select a candidate. Third, because no prior tests were identified that address the effect of a miscalibrated iVotronic DRE on the undervote, GAO proposes that an iVotronic DRE be deliberately miscalibrated to verify the accurate recording of ballots under these conditions. GAO expects these three tests would take 2 weeks, once the necessary arrangements are made. Should the task force ask GAO to conduct the proposed tests, several matters would need to be addressed before testing could begin, including obtaining access to the iVotronic DREs that have been subject to a sequestration order, arranging for a test site, obtaining some commercially available test tools, developing test protocols and detailed test procedures, and arranging for the video recording of the tests. Sarasota County election officials have indicated that they can help GAO access the machines and provide a test site between November 26 and December 7, 2007. Although the proposed tests could help provide increased assurance, they would not provide absolute assurance that the iVotronic DREs did not cause the large undervote in Sarasota County. The successful conduct of the proposed tests could reduce the possibility that the voting systems caused the undervote and shift attention to the possibilities that the undervote was the result of intentional actions by voters or voters that did not properly cast their votes on the voting system."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to appear before the task force today to present the findings  on our review of voting equipment used in Florida\u2019s 13th Congressional  District (Florida-13), which we are conducting in response to your request  of May 25, 2007.", "In November 2006, about 18,000 undervotes were reported in Sarasota  County in the race for Florida\u2019s 13th Congressional District.

We note that casting 112 ballots on a single machine is more than  that cast on over 99 percent of the 1,415 machines used on election day.", "We estimate the ballot testing would take about 2 to 3 days and require the  equivalent of 2 people, once the necessary arrangements have been made."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Deliberately Miscalibrate an iVotronic DRE to Understand the Effect on the Undervote", "paragraphs": ["Because little is known about the effect of a miscalibrated machine on the  behavior of an iVotronic DRE, we propose to deliberately miscalibrate an  iVotronic DREs and verify the functioning of the machine. We propose to  identify different ways to miscalibrate a ballot and to test ballots on the  miscalibrated iVotronic DRE to verify that it still properly records votes.  With this test we would confirm whether (1) the review screen displays  the same selection in the Florida-13 race as was highlighted in the  selection screen, and (2) that the vote is recorded as it was displayed on  the review screen. Again, we would plan to use the write-in candidate  option to verify the proper recording of the ballot. This test would  demonstrate whether the system correctly records a vote for the race and  hence whether it contributed to the undervote. We estimate that the  calibration test could be completed in about 1 day by 2 people, once the  necessary arrangements have been made."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Several Matters Remain to Be Addressed to Conduct Further Testing", "paragraphs": ["Should the task force ask us to conduct the proposed testing, we want to  make the task force aware of several other matters that would need to be  addressed before we could begin testing. These activities would require  some time and resources to complete before testing could commence.", "First, we would need to gain access to iVotronic DREs that have been  subject to a sequestration order in the state court system of Florida. If we  do not have access to the needed machines, we would be unable to obtain  reasonable assurance that the machines used on election day were using  certified software, and without this assurance, the results from prior tests  and any results of our ballot and calibration tests would be less  meaningful because we would be unable to apply the results to all  1,499 iVotronic DREs used during the election. Second, we would need to  agree upon an appropriate facility for the tests. Sarasota County  Supervisor of Elections has indicated that we can use its warehouse space,  but because of upcoming elections in November and January, the only  time the election officials would be able to provide us this space and the  necessary support is between November 26 and December 7, 2007. If  testing cannot be completed during this time period, Sarasota County  officials stated that they would not be able to assist us until February 2008.  Third, some tests may require commercially available specialized software,  hardware, or other tools to conduct the tests. We would need to make  arrangements to either borrow or to purchase such testing tools before  commencing testing. Fourth, in order to conduct any tests, we would need  to develop test protocols and detailed test procedures and steps. We also  anticipate that we would need to conduct a dry run, or dress rehearsal, of  our test procedures to ensure that our test tools function properly and that  our time estimates are reasonable. Finally, we would need to make  arrangements for video recording of our testing. It would be our  preference to have a visual record of the tests to document the actual test  conduct and to facilitate certain types of test analysis."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Other Observations on Touch Screen Voting Systems", "paragraphs": ["We recognize that human interaction with the ballot layout could be a  potential cause of the undervote. Although we have not explored this issue  in our review, we note that there is an ongoing academic study that is  exploring this issue using voting machines obtained from ES&S. We  believe that such experiments could be useful and could provide insight  into the ballot layout issue.", "During our review, we noted that several suggestions have been offered as  possible ways to establish that voters are intentionally undervoting and to  provide some assurance that the voting systems did not cause the  undervote. First, a voter-verified paper trail could provide an independent  confirmation that the touch screen voting systems did not malfunction in  recording and counting the votes from the election. The paper trail would  reflect the voter\u2019s selections and, if necessary, could be used in the  counting or recounting of votes. This issue is recognized in the Florida  State University SAIT source code review as well as the 2005 and draft  2007 Voluntary Voting Systems Guidelines prepared for the Election  Assistance Commission. We have previously reported on the need to  implement such a function properly. Second, explicit feedback to voters  that a race has been undervoted and a prompt for voters to affirm their  intent to undervote might help prevent many voters from unintentionally  undervoting a race. On the iVotronic DREs, such feedback and prompts  are provided only when the voter attempts to cast a completely blank  ballot, but not when a voter undervotes in individual races. Third, offering  a \u201cnone of the above\u201d option in a race would provide voters with the  opportunity to indicate that they are intentionally undervoting. The State  of Nevada provides this option in certain races in its elections. Decisions  about these or other suggestions about ballot layout or voting system  functions should be informed by human factors studies that assess their  effectiveness in accurately recording voters\u2019 preferences, making voting  systems easier to use, and preventing unintentional undervotes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The high undervote encountered in Sarasota County in the 2006 election  for Florida\u2019s 13th Congressional District has raised questions about  whether the voting systems accurately recorded and counted the votes  cast by eligible voters. Other possible reasons for the undervote could be  that voters intentionally undervoted or voters did not properly cast their  ballots on the voting systems, potentially because of issues relating to the  interaction between voters and the ballot. The focus of our review has  been to determine whether the voting systems\u2014the iVotronic DREs, in  particular\u2014contributed to the undervote. We found that the prior reviews  of Sarasota County\u2019s 2006 general election have provided valuable  information about the voting systems. Our review found that in some cases  we were able to rely on this information to eliminate areas of concern.  This allowed us to identify the areas where increased assurances were  needed to answer the questions being raised. Accordingly, the primary  focus of the tests we are proposing is to obtain increased assurance that  the results of the prior reviews and our proposed testing can be applied to  all the iVotronic DREs used in the election. Our proposed tests involving  the firmware comparison, ballot testing, and calibration testing could help  reduce the possibility that the undervote was caused by the iVotronic  DREs. However, even after completing the tests, we would not have  absolute assurance that the iVotronic DREs did not play any role in the  large undervote. Absolute assurance is impossible to achieve because we  are unable to recreate the conditions of the election in which the  undervote occurred. By successfully conducting the proposed tests, we  could reduce the possibility that the iVotronic DREs were the cause of the  undervote and shift attention to the possibilities that the undervote was  the result of intentional actions by the voter or voters that did not properly  cast their votes on the voting system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided draft copies of this statement to the Secretary of State of  Florida, the Supervisor of Elections of Sarasota County, and ES&S for  review and comment. The Florida Department of State provided technical  comments, which we incorporated. The Sarasota County Supervisor of  Elections appreciated the opportunity to review the draft, but provided us  no comments.", "In its comments, ES&S stated that it believes that the collective results of  testing already conducted on the Sarasota County voting systems have  demonstrated that they performed properly and as they were designed to  function and that all votes were accurately captured and counted as cast  in Florida\u2019s 13th Congressional District race. Further, ES&S asserts that  tests and analyses should be conducted to examine the effect of the ballot  display on the undervote, which it believes is the most probable cause of  the undervote.", "We disagree that the collective results of testing already conducted on the  Sarasota County voting systems adequately demonstrate that the voting  systems could not have contributed to the undervote in the Florida-13  race. First, as we have cited, we do not have adequate assurance that all  the iVotronic DREs used in Sarasota County used the firmware certified by  the Florida Division of Elections. Without this assurance, it is difficult for  us to apply the results from the other tests to all 1,499 machines that  recorded votes during the election because we are uncertain that all  machines would have behaved in a similar manner. Further, we believe  that expected forms of voter behavior to select a candidate in the  Florida-13 race were not thoroughly tested. While ES&S asserts that such  processes would have no effect on the iVotronic DRE\u2019s ability to capture  and record a voter\u2019s selection, we did not identify testing that verified this.  Further, while ES&S states that the testing of a deliberately miscalibrated  iVotronic DRE would result in a clearly visible indication of which  candidate was selected, we could not identify any testing that  demonstrated this.", "We acknowledge that the large undervote in Florida\u2019s 13th Congressional  District race could have been caused by voters who intentionally  undervoted or voters who did not properly cast their ballots, potentially  because of issues related to the human interaction with the ballot.  However, the focus of our review, as agreed with the task force, was to  review whether the voting systems could have contributed to the large  undervote.
