This is the second of two GAO reports on government support for bank holding companies. The first study focused on actual government support during the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recent statutory and regulatory changes related to government support for these firms. This report examines how financial reforms have altered market expectations of government rescues and the existence or size of funding advantages the largest bank holding companies may have received due to perceived government support.", "GAO reviewed relevant statutes and rules and interviewed regulators, rating agencies, investment firms, and corporate customers of banks. GAO also reviewed relevant studies and interviewed authors of these studies. Finally, GAO conducted quantitative analyses to assess potential \u201ctoo-big-to-fail\u201d funding cost advantages.", "In its comments, the Department of the Treasury generally agreed with GAO's analysis. GAO incorporated technical comments from the financial regulators, as appropriate."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["While views varied among market participants with whom GAO spoke, many believed that recent regulatory reforms have reduced but not eliminated the likelihood the federal government would prevent the failure of one of the largest bank holding companies. Recent reforms provide regulators with new authority to resolve a large failing bank holding company in an orderly process and require the largest bank holding companies to meet stricter capital and other standards, increasing costs and reducing risks for these firms. In response to reforms, two of three major rating agencies reduced or removed the assumed government support they incorporated into some large bank holding companies' overall credit ratings. Credit rating agencies and large investors cited the new Orderly Liquidation Authority as a key factor influencing their views. While several large investors viewed the resolution process as credible, others cited potential challenges, such as the risk that multiple failures of large firms could destabilize markets. Remaining market expectations of government support can benefit large bank holding companies if they affect investors' and customers' decisions.", "GAO analyzed the relationship between a bank holding company's size and its funding costs, taking into account a broad set of other factors that can influence funding costs. To inform this analysis and to understand the breadth of methodological approaches and results, GAO reviewed selected studies that estimated funding cost differences between large and small financial institutions that could be associated with the perception that some institutions are too big to fail. Studies GAO reviewed generally found that the largest financial institutions had lower funding costs during the 2007-2009 financial crisis but that the difference between the funding costs of the largest and smaller institutions has since declined. However, these empirical analyses contain a number of limitations that could reduce their validity or applicability to U.S. bank holding companies. For example, some studies used credit ratings which provide only an indirect measure of funding costs.", "GAO's analysis, which addresses some limitations of these studies, suggests that large bank holding companies had lower funding costs than smaller ones during the financial crisis but provides mixed evidence of such advantages in recent years. However, most models suggest that such advantages may have declined or reversed. GAO developed a series of statistical models that estimate the relationship between bank holding companies' bond funding costs and their size or systemic importance, controlling for other drivers of bond funding costs, such as bank holding company credit risk. Key features of GAO's approach include the following:", "U.S. Bank Holding Companies: The models focused on U.S. bank holding companies to better understand the relationship between funding costs and size in the context of the U.S. economic and regulatory environment.", "Bond Funding Costs: The models used bond yield spreads\u2014the difference between the yield or rate of return on a bond and the yield on a Treasury bond of comparable maturity\u2014to measure funding costs because they are a risk-sensitive measure of what investors charge bank holding companies to borrow.", "Extensive Controls : The models controlled for credit risk, bond liquidity, and other variables to account for factors other than size that could affect funding costs.", "Multiple Models : GAO used 42 models for each year from 2006 through 2013 to assess the impact of using alternative measures of credit risk, bond liquidity, and size and to allow the relationship between size and bond funding costs to vary over time with changes in the economic and regulatory environment.", "Credit Risk Levels : GAO compared bond funding costs for bank holding companies of different sizes at the average level of credit risk for each year, at low and high levels of credit risk for each year, and at the average level of credit risk during the financial crisis.", "The figure below shows the differences between model-estimated bond funding costs for bank holding companies with $1 trillion in assets and bank holding companies with $10 billion in assets, with average levels of credit risk in each year. Circles represent statistically significant model-estimated differences.", "Estimates from 42 Models of Average Bond Funding Cost Differences between Bank Holding Companies with $1 Trillion and $10 Billion in Assets, 2006-2013", "Notes: GAO estimated econometric models of the relationship between BHC size and funding costs using data for U.S. BHCs and their outstanding senior unsecured bonds for the first quarter of 2006 through the fourth quarter of 2013. The models used bond yield spreads to measure funding costs and controlled for credit risk factors such as capital adequacy, asset quality, earnings, maturity mismatch, and volatility, as well as bond liquidity and other characteristics of bonds and BHCs that can affect funding costs. GAO estimated 42 models for each year from 2006 through 2013 to assess the sensitivity of estimated funding cost differences to using alternative measures of capital adequacy, volatility, bond liquidity, and size or systemic importance. GAO used the models to compare bond funding costs for BHCs of different sizes but the same levels of credit risk, bond liquidity, and other characteristics. This figure compares bond funding costs for BHCs with $1 trillion and $10 billion in assets, for each model and for each year, with average levels of credit risk. Each circle and dash shows the comparison for a different model, where circles and dashes below zero suggest BHCs with $1 trillion in assets have lower bond funding costs than BHCs with $10 billion in assets, and vice versa.", "All 42 models found that larger bank holding companies had lower bond funding costs than smaller ones in 2008 and 2009, while more than half of the models found that larger bank holding companies had higher bond funding costs than smaller ones in 2011 through 2013, given the average level of credit risk each year (see figure). However, the models' comparisons of bond funding costs for bank holding companies of different sizes varied depending on the level of credit risk. For example, in hypothetical scenarios where levels of credit risk in every year from 2010 to 2013 are assumed to be as high as they were during the financial crisis, GAO's analysis suggests that large bank holding companies might have had lower funding costs than smaller ones in recent years. However, reforms in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, such as enhanced standards for capital and liquidity, could enhance the stability of the financial system and make such a credit risk scenario less likely.", "This analysis builds on certain aspects of prior studies, but important limitations remain and these results should be interpreted with caution. GAO's estimates of differences in funding costs reflect a combination of several factors, including investors' beliefs about the likelihood a bank holding company will fail and the likelihood it will be rescued by the government if it fails, and cannot precisely identify the influence of each factor. In addition, these estimates may reflect factors other than investors' beliefs about the likelihood of government support and may also reflect differences in the characteristics of bank holding companies that do and do not issue bonds. Finally, GAO's estimates, like all past estimates, are not indicative of future trends."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["\u201cToo big to fail\u201d refers to a market notion that the federal government  would intervene to prevent the failure of a large, interconnected financial  institution to avoid harm to the economy. Events during the 2007-2009  financial crisis heightened concerns that market participants had come to  view several of the largest U.S. financial institutions as too big to fail.  Most notably, the U.S. government intervened to provide tens of billions  of dollars of capital and other support to a few large troubled financial  institutions out of concern that allowing these firms to go into bankruptcy  would have further disrupted troubled credit markets and damaged  confidence in the U.S. financial system. Market expectations of  government rescues can distort the incentives of investors and  counterparties to properly price and restrain the risks of firms they believe  to be too big to fail, potentially giving rise to funding cost and other  advantages for these firms relative to smaller competitors. For example,  creditors may be willing to accept lower interest rates on debt issued by  these firms if they believe the possibility of a government rescue reduces  the likelihood that they could suffer losses. If creditors and other  counterparties do not fully charge a firm for the risks it is taking, that firm  may have incentives to take on greater risks in the pursuit of higher  returns. Excessive risk-taking in response to such incentives can increase  the likelihood that such a firm could become distressed and disrupt  financial markets.", "The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd- Frank Act) prohibits rescues of individual failing financial institutions and  provides new tools and authorities for the Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation (FDIC) to resolve a large failing financial institution in a  manner that imposes losses on the firm\u2019s creditors and other investors  while minimizing adverse impacts to the economy.

Where available and relevant,  we reviewed some public statements, reports, and other analyses by  these groups. For example, to obtain information about credit rating  agencies\u2019 assessments of the likelihood and level of government support  for large bank holding companies, we reviewed relevant publications by  the three largest credit rating agencies: Fitch Ratings (Fitch), Moody\u2019s  Investors Service (Moody\u2019s), and Standard & Poor\u2019s (S&P).

In selecting investment firms and  large corporations for interviews, we selected nonrepresentative samples  of firms. As a result, the views we present from these firms are not  generalizable to the broader community of bank investors and customers  and do not indicate which views are most prevalent. We selected  investment firms with experience investing in debt or equity securities of  banks and bank holding companies and selected different types of  investment firms to obtain perspectives reflecting a range of investing  strategies. Specifically, we selected three large asset management firms  (each with more than $1 trillion in assets under management); three  public pension funds (each with more than $50 billion in assets under  management); three hedge funds; and one large insurance company. We  selected U.S. corporations from different industry sectors and with a  range of banking needs. We identified four of these firms and contacted  them with the assistance of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which  reached out to its members on our behalf, and selected two additional  firms to achieve additional diversity across industry sectors. The  corporations we interviewed included four multinational corporations (a  chemical company, a delivery and logistics company, an energy  company, and a technology company) and two corporations with all or  close to all of their operations in the United States (a regional electric  utility company and a national retail services company).", "To obtain additional information and perspectives on how financial  reforms or credit ratings could impact the relative advantages or  disadvantages of being a large bank holding company, we reviewed  relevant publicly available information in the financial statements of bank  holding companies and conducted interviews with bank holding  companies of various sizes, bank industry associations, public interest  groups, academics, and other experts. For example, we reviewed bank  holding companies\u2019 financial disclosures about how Dodd-Frank reforms  could increase certain fees and how a credit rating downgrade could  impact the amount of collateral required of them under certain financial  contracts.

To inform our econometric approach and understand  the breadth of results and methodological approaches, we reviewed  studies that estimated the funding cost difference between large and  small financial institutions that could be associated with the perception  that some institutions are too big to fail. We evaluated studies that met  the following criteria: (1) used a comparative empirical approach that  attempted to account for differences across financial institutions that  could influence funding costs, (2) included U.S. bank holding companies,  and (3) included analysis of data from 2002 or later. We chose these  criteria to identify the most relevant and rigorous studies related to our  research objective. To identify studies that met these criteria, we sought  input from individuals, agencies, and groups that we interviewed,  identified studies cited in an initial set of studies we had already identified,  and conducted a systematic search of research databases (including  Google Scholar and SSRN).", "Our criteria excluded studies that used option-pricing approaches\u2014that  is, techniques that use tools for pricing stock options to estimate the value  associated with possible government interventions to assist distressed  banks\u2014because these studies assume a too-big-to-fail funding cost  advantage exists and only estimate its magnitude. We also excluded two  studies that otherwise met our criteria, but did not attempt to control for  important differences between financial institutions. We were aware of  potential conflicts of interest associated with a number of studies in our  review. For example, one study was conducted by researchers at a large  bank holding company and two others were sponsored by a trade group  representing large commercial banks. We considered the potential impact  these conflicts of interest might have on their methods and results. We  ultimately included 16 studies in our review that we determined were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report.", "In reviewing these studies, we assessed what they identified as the level  of funding cost differences and how that level has changed over time and  we identified the strengths and limitations of the studies\u2019 approaches.  Because of limitations of the methodologies of these studies, their results,  while suggestive of general trends, are not definitive and thus should be  interpreted with caution. We interviewed authors of selected studies,  federal financial regulators, and other experts to obtain perspectives on  the strengths and limitations of relevant quantitative approaches that have  been used.", "Taking into consideration the strengths and limitations of different  methodologies, we developed our own econometric approach to evaluate  the extent to which the largest bank holding companies may have  received funding cost advantages as a result of perceptions that the  government would not allow them to fail. In addition, we selected three  experts with relevant expertise to review our econometric approach and  assess its strengths and limitations. These experts reviewed our  approach before we implemented it and provided comments on our  methodology. In many instances, we made changes or additions to our  models to address their comments, and in other instances, we disclosed  additional limitations of the models.

The parameter \ud835\udeff captures the indirect  relationship between a bank holding company\u2019s funding cost and its size  that exists if the size of a bank holding company affects the relationship  between its funding cost and credit risk. If investors view larger bank  holding companies as less risky than smaller bank holding companies  due to beliefs that the government is more likely to rescue larger bank  holding companies in distress, then either \ud835\udefd is less than zero, \ud835\udeff is less than zero, or both.

We used bond yield spreads\u2014the difference between the  yield on a bond and the yield on a Treasury bond of comparable  maturity\u2014to measure a bank holding company\u2019s cost of bond funding.  Treasury securities are widely viewed as a risk-free asset, so the yield  spread measures the price that investors charge a bank holding company  to borrow to compensate them for credit risk and other factors. We  focused on bond yield spreads because they are a measure of funding  costs that is available for bank holding companies of a range of sizes,  including bank holding companies with less than $10 billion in assets.

A key factor giving rise to the  too-big-to-fail dilemma has been the emergence of financial institutions of  such size, interconnectedness, and market importance that their failure  could threaten to severely disrupt the financial system and damage the  economy. Although the federal government\u2019s policy responses to failing  financial institutions in recent decades have not formed a clear pattern in  terms of the availability or structure of government support, these  responses may have influenced market views on the likelihood of  government support. Several observers trace too-big-to-fail concerns  back to 1984 when FDIC provided support to Continental Illinois National  Bank, then the sixth largest U.S. bank in terms of total assets, to prevent  its failure and losses to its depositors and creditors. The Federal  Reserve Board\u2019s response to the near failure of a large U.S. hedge fund,  Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM), in 1998 was another significant  event that may have contributed to too-big-to-fail perceptions. While  LTCM was not itself a large bank, the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s  intervention in helping to facilitate private-sector assistance to LTCM may  have signaled the willingness of federal government authorities to  intervene to avoid potential systemic consequences from a large,  interconnected financial firm\u2019s failure. Other factors may have contributed  to some ambiguity surrounding the likely recipients and circumstances of  government support in the years leading up to the 2007-2009 financial  crisis. For example, failures and near-failures of large financial firms had  been infrequent and occurred under varying circumstances, making it  difficult to discern a clear pattern of government support.", "During the 2007-2009 crisis, the federal government took actions to  stabilize the financial system by creating new emergency programs with  broad-based eligibility and providing firm-specific assistance to prevent  the failures of large financial institutions. Notably, however, U.S. government authorities\u2019 initial responses to impending failures of large  financial institutions did not send a clear signal about the availability of  government support. In March 2008, the Federal Reserve Board  authorized emergency assistance to prevent the failure of one large  investment bank (Bear Stearns Companies, Inc.), but 6 months later,  Federal Reserve Board officials determined that they could not assist  another large failing investment bank, Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc.  (Lehman Brothers). Following Lehman Brothers\u2019 bankruptcy  announcement on September 15, 2008, which triggered an intensification  of the financial crisis, U.S. government authorities took actions that  signaled a stronger near-term commitment to prevent the failure of  systemically important financial institutions. On the day after Lehman  Brothers\u2019 bankruptcy announcement, the Federal Reserve Board  authorized up to $85 billion of credit assistance for American International  Group, Inc. (AIG) to prevent its failure. In addition, on September 29,  2008, the Secretary of the Treasury invoked the systemic risk exception  for the first time since the enactment of the FDIC Improvement Act of  1991(FDICIA) to authorize FDIC to provide assistance to avert the failure  of Wachovia Corporation\u2014then the fourth-largest banking organization in  terms of assets in the United States\u2014by facilitating Citigroup Inc.\u2019s  acquisition of its banking operations.", "The G7 is an informal forum of coordination among Canada, France, Germany, Italy,  Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. also took steps to prevent the failures of large financial institutions.  Examples of large foreign financial institutions that received firm-specific  assistance from their governments include Royal Bank of Scotland Group  PLC (United Kingdom) and UBS (Switzerland).", "Since the onset of the financial crisis, the largest banks have grown  bigger in many major advanced economies, even as the financial sector  has shrunk, and U.S. and foreign policymakers have acknowledged that  crisis policy interventions raised moral hazard concerns. As discussed  earlier, market perceptions that some firms are too big to fail can distort  market participants\u2019 incentives to properly price and restrain risk-taking by  these firms. U.S. regulators have coordinated with foreign counterparts  through the G20 and the Financial Stability Board to develop a policy  framework for addressing the risks posed by large, complex financial  institutions. In November 2010, G20 leaders endorsed the Financial  Stability Board\u2019s framework for addressing too-big-to-fail concerns. The  framework aims to reduce the probability and impact of the failure of  systemically important firms.

According to Treasury officials, several key areas require continued  progress:  International regulatory reform. In its 2013 annual report, FSOC  writes that international coordination of financial regulation is essential  to mitigate threats to financial stability. FDIC officials said they  continue to work with foreign regulators to address issues related to  creating a viable process for effecting the orderly resolution of a failing  financial institution with significant cross-border activities. For  example, FDIC is working with foreign counterparts on changes  needed to ensure that derivatives contracts under other countries\u2019  laws include a stay similar to that which applies to U.S. contracts  under Dodd-Frank to prevent termination of these contracts by  counterparties of a firm pulled into resolution. Federal Reserve Board  staff said U.S. regulators are considering steps that may be needed to  help ensure that foreign regulators do not take disruptive actions with  respect to foreign operations of a U.S. firm pulled into resolution. They  noted that global U.S. SIFIs may need to create intragroup loss  absorbency arrangements that provide clarity and assurance to  foreign regulators about how loss absorbency from the U.S. holding  company will be made available to support foreign operations during a  resolution.", "The Federal Reserve\u2019s long-term debt requirement.

Treasury  officials identified the education of market participants as a key area  for progress.

We present the variety of  methodological decisions along two key dimensions\u2014which source of  funding is analyzed (e.g., deposits, bonds) and time period of analysis\u2014in  table 2 below. The source of funding that is analyzed is an important  methodological decision because investors may have differing  expectations regarding the likelihood that various sources of funding  might receive government support, and these expectations could differ by  the size of the financial institution. Results could differ across studies  because of differences in creditor priority (subordinated debt versus  senior debt) or maturity (bonds that mature several years in the future  versus deposits that can be demanded at any time).

For example, one study  estimated that large U.S. financial institutions had roughly 100 basis  points lower bond funding costs than smaller ones in 2009, but this  difference had declined to around 40 basis points by 2011. Similarly, a  study of U.S. bank credit default swaps found that large U.S. bank holding  companies had roughly 100 basis points lower funding costs in 2009, but   In some  this difference had declined to around 15 basis points in 2013.cases these differences could be interpreted as evidence of funding cost  advantages driven by too-big-to-fail perceptions.

Therefore, most results may not  reflect recent changes in the regulatory environment and market  expectations discussed earlier in the report.", "Studies also varied in their approach to identifying financial institutions  that might be perceived as too big to fail, using a variety of size and other  thresholds. For example, some studies measured too-big-to-fail status by  a bank\u2019s assets; however, the threshold between too-big-to-fail and other  banks varied from $50 billion to $500 billion. Several papers estimated  too-big-to-fail status by size relative to industry, such as the largest 20  banks or top 10 percent by assets.

Most studies we reviewed adopted a regression  methodology in which some measure of funding costs was explained  by a variety of control variables, such as risk, liquidity, and maturity, to  attempt to account for differences across financial institutions. These  models are standard empirical tools and are flexible in terms of the  information about financial institutions and markets that they can  incorporate. In some instances these models rely on a small number  of indicators that may only imperfectly measure underlying default  risks. As a result, some analyses may not correctly estimate the size  of any too-big-to-fail advantages because they omit important factors  that influence funding costs. In other studies that account for a more  thorough set of factors that influence funding costs, results may be  sensitive to alternative measurements of these factors.", "For example,  default risk is an underlying driver of funding costs, and studies may  produce different results by using a bank\u2019s earnings volatility as an  indicator for default risk as opposed to other indicators such as the  quality of a bank\u2019s assets. In addition, liquidity is another important  factor to account for when attempting to explain funding cost  differences\u2014investors charge banks more for less liquid sources of  funding\u2014and some studies do not adequately control for the liquidity  of the funding source. Challenges similar to those involved in  accurately capturing default risk arise in finding appropriate indicators  for a bond\u2019s liquidity.", "Equity-based. Three papers we reviewed measured the difference  between observed credit default swap spreads (which approximate  bond funding costs) and hypothetical credit default swap spreads  (which are estimated based on information implied by equity prices).  This approach estimates hypothetical spreads with a standard  theoretical model used in finance that uses the risk of a firm\u2019s equity  to estimate the risk of a firm\u2019s debt. In doing so, the approach  assumes that hypothetical spreads derived from equity prices are not  influenced by any expectations of government support, but that  observed credit default swap spreads are influenced by such  expectations. By comparing the two spreads the approach can  estimate the magnitude of expectations of government support. While  this approach has some advantages, it relies on critical assumptions  about how a limited number of factors influence the risk of default.", "As a result, these analyses may also omit important factors that  influence funding costs, such as earnings.", "Ratings-based. Two papers used Fitch credit ratings to estimate the  funding cost difference that could be associated with potential  government support. Models based on credit ratings offer a  convenient way to incorporate all the factors the rating agency  considers relevant to default risk and take advantage of the rating  agency\u2019s explicit separation of the impact of expected government  support through, for example, the assignment of a standalone credit  rating (assuming no government support) and a higher credit rating  assuming government support. However, this approach assumes  that all information about market expectations of default risk and  government support are incorporated into credit ratings, which is a  potentially weak assumption. Credit ratings had a limited impact on  the views of large investors we interviewed, as previously discussed.  Moreover, funding costs vary for firms within a particular rating. As a  result, these studies may estimate funding costs with considerable  error. Finally, results of these studies are sensitive to the credit rating  agency used\u2014for example, results based on Moody\u2019s ratings could  be quite different than other rating agencies because Moody\u2019s  removed expectations of government support for U.S. bank holding  companies in 2013.", "In addition to the approach-specific limitations, a number of general  limitations related to implementation of the various approaches exist  across studies we reviewed that could reduce their validity or applicability  to U.S. bank holding companies.

Studies that pooled a large number of countries in their  analysis have results that may not be applicable to U.S. bank holding  companies. For example, studies that included Switzerland and Iceland in  their analyses may not apply to the United States because banking  sectors in those countries are much larger relative to the economy.

Like the  methodologies used in the literature we reviewed, our methodology does  not allow us to precisely identify the influence of each of these factors. As  a result, changes over time in our estimates of the relationship between  bond funding costs and size may reflect changes in one or more of these  components, but we cannot identify which with certainty. For example, if  bond funding costs for a bank holding company with $1 trillion are less  than those for a bank holding company with $10 billion but the difference  decreases over time, this trend may indicate that investors believe that  the larger bank holding company is relatively less likely to fail, which  could be the case if the level of credit risk is falling over time, either due to  market pressure, regulatory requirements, or other reasons. This trend  could also indicate that investors believe that the government has  become less likely to rescue the larger bank holding company if it fails or  more likely to impose losses on investors in a rescue.", "In addition, our estimates of differences in bond funding costs for bank  holding companies of different sizes may reflect factors other than  investors\u2019 beliefs about the likelihood of government support.

However, we may not have taken into  account all possible factors. If a factor that we have not taken into  account is associated with size, then our results may reflect the  relationship between bond funding costs and this omitted factor instead  of, or in addition to, the relationship between bond funding costs and bank  holding company size.", "Our estimates of differences in bond funding costs for bank holding  companies of different sizes may also reflect differences in the  characteristics of bank holding companies that choose to issue bonds.  Bank holding companies that issue bonds may differ from those that do  not in ways that may or may not be observable. If such differences exist  and are unobservable, then our models\u2019 comparisons are likely to be  consistently either too high or too low depending on the relationship  between size and the relevant unobservable characteristic. However, if  bank holding companies that issue bonds differ from those that do not in  ways that are observable in our model, then our models\u2019 comparisons of  bond funding cost differences for bank holding companies of different  sizes are unlikely to be consistently either too high or too low. We found  some evidence that this may be the case. Investors with whom we spoke  told us that larger bank holding companies are generally more likely to  issue bonds than smaller ones because they can issue a large enough  quantity of debt to satisfy investors\u2019 demand for liquidity and to allow  investors to make a large enough investment to cover their transaction  costs. Thus, size, which is observable, may be an important difference  between bank holding companies that issue bonds and those that do not.  Importantly, bank holding company size matters in this case because it is  associated with bond issue size, which we control for, not because it is  associated with investors\u2019 beliefs about government rescues.", "In general, our estimates of the impact of size on bond funding costs may  reflect a relationship between size, credit risk, or other explanatory  variables and the part of bond funding costs that is not explained by our  model (endogeneity). This could occur if any of our control variables are  influenced by bond funding costs. In this case, our estimates of the  magnitude of the association between size and bond funding costs will be  imperfect and our ability to infer a causal relationship between size and  bond funding costs will be limited.", "Historical estimates of differences in bond funding costs for bank holding  companies of different sizes are not indicative of future differences. As we  have discussed, our estimates of the historical relationship between bank  holding company size and bond funding costs vary from year to year.  Thus, it is likely that the relationship between bond funding costs and  bank holding company size may change in the future. As we have noted,  the Dodd-Frank Act imposes new and higher fees on large bank holding  companies and requires the Federal Reserve Board to subject large bank  holding companies to enhanced regulatory standards for capital, liquidity,  and risk management. These enhanced standards may help to reduce  the likelihood that a large bank holding company will fail, which may in  turn alter investors\u2019 beliefs about the likelihood of government support  and thus affect the size of any differences in yield spreads on bonds  issued by large and small bank holding companies. Improvements in  economic conditions, such as faster economic growth and lower  unemployment, may have a similar effect. Finally, changes in the  structure of financial markets, such as an increase in the share of credit  provided by nonbank financial companies that reduces the systemic  importance of large bank holding companies, could also lead investors to  change their beliefs about government rescues in future episodes of  individual or system-wide distress.", "Finally, our estimates of the differences in bond funding costs for bank  holding companies of different sizes do not necessarily reflect the harm  that the failure of a large bank holding company could do to the economy.  Bond funding costs reflect the risk that a bank holding company might fail  and not be able to fully repay its investors. However, parties other than  investors may be harmed if a bank holding company fails. For example,  the customers of a failed bank holding company may be harmed if they  have less access to credit or to specialized services provided by the bank  holding company, which could be the case if the bank holding company  has a large enough share of the market."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We made copies of the draft report available to FDIC, the Federal  Reserve Board, FSOC, OCC and Treasury for their review and comment.

With respect to the  statistical robustness of these results, we note that the draft report  contained clear information about the statistical significance of our  results. Importantly, we note that whether one considers the  estimates from all 42 models for 2013 or only the 10 models with  statistically significant results, higher credit risk substantially  increases (1) the number of models that suggest bond funding  costs would have been lower for the largest bank holding  companies than for smaller bank holding companies and (2) the  size of funding cost differences in 2013.

Finally, while  statistically insignificant estimates may be viewed as weaker  evidence than statistically significant estimates and may influence  how our results are interpreted, we note that statistical  significance is not the only relevant characteristic of an  econometric estimate and that by presenting the full range of  results one can better assess their magnitude and economic  significance.", "Treasury and the Federal Reserve Board also commented that in  comparing bond funding costs for large and small bank holding  companies, a bank holding company with $10 billion in assets is  too small to make a meaningful comparison to a bank holding  company with $1 trillion in assets. They commented that a bank  holding company with at least $50 billion in assets would provide a  more relevant comparison for this analysis. While we agree that  bank holding companies with $50 billion in assets may be more  similar to $1 trillion bank holding companies than bank holding  companies with $10 billion in assets, we used a smaller size for  small bank holding companies because bank holding companies  with $50 billion or more in assets may be viewed by investors as  \u201clarge\u201d and systemically important, in part because $50 billion in  assets is the size threshold for Dodd-Frank Act requirements  related to enhanced regulatory standards. While we agree that  bank holding companies of different sizes have different  characteristics, we compared estimated funding costs for bank  holding companies assuming their credit risk and other  characteristics are identical. Finally, increasing the size of the  small bank holding company in our comparisons would not have a  substantive impact on the sign or statistical significance of our  estimated differences in funding costs, nor would it change the  trends in estimated differences in funding costs over time.", "The Federal Reserve Board and OCC commented that few of the  estimated coefficients on the variables measuring size and size  interacted with credit risk reported in table 5 were individually  statistically significant, suggesting that there is little statistical  evidence of a relationship between bond funding costs and size.

The results of these hypothesis tests suggest  that the coefficients on the size and size-credit risk interaction  terms are jointly significant at the 5 percent level, suggesting that  there is statistical evidence of a relationship between bond funding  costs and size. We report the results of our joint hypothesis tests  in table 5 on pages 74 and 76 of the report.

Methodology for Analysis of Funding Cost Differences between Large and Small Bank Holding Companies", "paragraphs": ["To assess the extent to which the largest bank holding companies have  received funding cost advantages as a result of perceptions that the  government would not allow them to fail, we conducted an econometric  analysis of the relationship between a bank holding company\u2019s size or  systemic importance and its funding costs. Bank holding companies  obtain funds from investors\u2014such as depositors, creditors, or  shareholders\u2014which they use to finance assets, such as various types of  credit. The prices that bank holding companies pay to obtain these funds  are influenced by several factors, including credit risk\u2014the likelihood that  bank holding companies will repay the funds they borrowed as agreed\u2014 and other factors. Funding cost advantages may arise if investors believe  that the government is more likely to support larger bank holding  companies in distress than smaller bank holding companies in distress.  This belief may lead investors to view larger bank holding companies as  having less credit risk than smaller bank holding companies and thus  charge larger bank holding companies a lower price to borrow than  smaller bank holding companies.", "We used a multivariate regression model to estimate the relationship  between bank holding companies\u2019 funding costs and their size while  controlling for factors other than size that may also influence funding  costs. Our general regression model is the following:  In this model, \ud835\udc4f denotes the bank holding company, \ud835\udc5e denotes the  quarter, \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc54 \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5e is the bank holding company\u2019s cost of funding in  a quarter, \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5e is a measure of the bank holding company\u2019s size at the  beginning of the quarter, \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5e is a list of proxies for the bank  holding company\u2019s credit risk, \ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5e is a list of other variables that may  influence funding costs, \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5e is an idiosyncratic error term, and \ud835\udefc,\ud835\udefd,\ud835\udefe,\ud835\udeff,  and \u0398 are parameters to be estimated. The parameter \ud835\udefd captures the  size. The parameter \ud835\udeff captures the indirect relationship between a bank  direct relationship between a bank holding company\u2019s funding cost and its  holding company\u2019s funding cost and its size that exists if the size of a  bank holding company affects the relationship between its funding cost  and credit risk. If greater values of the size measure are associated with  larger bank holding companies, if greater values of the credit risk proxies  are associated with greater credit risk, and if investors view larger bank  holding companies as less risky than smaller bank holding companies  due to beliefs that the government is more likely to rescue larger bank  holding companies in distress, then either \ud835\udefd is less than zero, \ud835\udeff is less  than zero, or both. However, the parameters \ud835\udefd and \ud835\udeff may also reflect  factors other than these beliefs.", "We used a measure of funding costs based on bonds issued by bank  holding companies that is available for bank holding companies with a  wide variety of sizes. Bank holding companies use a variety of funding  types from different sources, including various types of deposits, bonds,  and equity. We used bond yield spreads\u2014the difference between the rate  of return on a bond and the rate of return on a Treasury bond of  comparable maturity to measure a bank holding company\u2019s cost of bond  funding. Treasury securities are widely viewed as a risk-free asset, so the  yield spread measures the price that investors charge a bank holding  company to borrow to compensate them for credit risk and other factors.  We focused on bond funding costs for several reasons. First, bonds are  traded in secondary markets, so timely information about changes in their  yield spreads, which reflect investors\u2019 perceptions of the credit risk of the  bond\u2019s issuing bank holding company, is easily observable. In contrast,  some uninsured deposit products are not traded in secondary markets, so  changes in the prices of those deposits, which may reflect depositors\u2019  perceptions of the riskiness of the bank holding company, may be less  easy to observe. Second, bond yield spreads are a direct measure of  bank holding companies\u2019 funding costs. In contrast, credit ratings are  indirect measures of bank holding companies\u2019 funding costs because  funding costs can vary for firms with the same rating. Similarly, total  interest expense as reported on a bank holding company\u2019s balance sheet  is an imperfect measure of funding costs because total interest expense  may aggregate the prices of liabilities with many important differences,  including term and creditor priority. Third, bonds generally rank higher in a  bank holding company\u2019s capital structure than equity, so bondholders are  less likely to suffer losses and more likely to be repaid if a bank holding  company becomes distressed. Bondholders are thus more likely to  benefit if a distressed bank holding company is rescued by the  government. In contrast, equity holders generally rank lowest in a bank  holding company\u2019s capital structure and are the first to suffer losses if a  bank holding company becomes distressed. Shareholders are thus the  least likely to benefit if a distressed bank holding company is rescued by  the government. It follows that the cost of bond funding is more likely to  reflect investors\u2019 beliefs about the likelihood of government support than  the cost of equity funding. Fourth, bank holding companies with a wide  variety of sizes issue bonds, including some with less than $10 billion in  assets. In contrast, credit default swaps\u2014the prices of which likely reflect  perceptions of a bank holding company\u2019s credit risk\u2014are available for  only a small number of large bank holding companies.", "We used Bloomberg to identify U.S. bank holding companies with more  than $500 million in assets that were active in one or more years from  2006 to 2013, and to identify all plain vanilla, fixed-rate, senior unsecured  bonds issued by these bank holding companies, excluding bonds with a  government guarantee. companies and bonds we analyzed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of the Treasury", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments:", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Karen Tremba (Assistant  Director), John Fisher (Analyst in Charge), Bethany Benitez, Michael  Hoffman, Risto Laboski, Courtney LaFountain, Rob Letzler, Marc Molino,  Jason Wildhagen, and Jennifer Schwartz made significant contributions to  this report.
