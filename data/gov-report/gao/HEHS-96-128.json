TRICARE, DOD\u2019s new nationwide managed health care program, will significantly alter health care delivery for DOD\u2019s 8.3 million beneficiaries. As we testified on March 7, 1996, before the House Committee on National Security\u2019s Subcommittee on Military Personnel, TRICARE\u2019s implementation is occurring in a rapidly changing military environment. Post-cold war contingency planning scenarios, efforts to reduce the overall size of the nation\u2019s military forces, federal budget-reduction initiatives, and base closures and realignments have all heightened scrutiny of the size and makeup of DOD\u2019s health care system. How well DOD implements and operates TRICARE may define and shape military medicine for years to come.", "Because of TRICARE\u2019s complexity, large scale, and impact on beneficiaries, you requested that we review the program, focusing on (1) whether DOD\u2019s experiences with early implementation produced the expected results, (2) how early outcomes may affect costs, and (3) whether DOD has defined and is capturing data needed to manage and assess TRICARE\u2019s performance.", "To assess DOD\u2019s experiences with early implementation, we visited four TRICARE regional administrators and eight military medical facilities within those regions. We also met with TRICARE contractors who provide health care support to the DOD medical facilities. These officials described their experiences with the beneficiary education, marketing, and enrollment phases of TRICARE implementation. They also described their efforts to identify and disseminate information about the problems they encountered and the solutions they found in order to facilitate TRICARE implementation in other regions. To analyze cost implications, we reviewed studies projecting TRICARE costs and discussed these studies with Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs staff, their TRICARE cost consultant, and representatives of the Congressional Budget Office. We discussed management data needs with DOD officials at the headquarters and regional levels, focusing on those unmet needs that emerged during early TRICARE implementation.", "We did our review between June 1995 and March 1996 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s primary military medical mission is to maintain the health of 1.7 million active duty service personnel and to be prepared to deliver health care during times of war. Also, as an employer, DOD offers health care services to 6.6 million non-active duty beneficiaries such as dependents of active duty personnel and military retirees. The bulk of the health care is provided at more than 600 military hospitals and clinics worldwide, which are operated by the Army, Navy, and Air Force. DOD\u2019s direct health care system is supplemented by a DOD-administered insurance-like program called the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS). In fiscal year 1996, DOD expects to spend about $11.8 billion providing care directly to its beneficiaries and about $3.6 billion for CHAMPUS.", "In response to such challenges as increasing health care costs and uneven access to care, in the late 1980s DOD initiated, under congressional authority, a series of demonstration programs to evaluate alternative health care delivery approaches. In the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 (P.L. 103-160), the Congress directed DOD to prescribe and implement, to the maximum extent practicable, a nationwide managed health care benefit program modeled on health maintenance organization (HMO) plans. The Congress specifically required that this new program could not incur costs greater than DOD would incur in the program\u2019s absence and that beneficiaries enrolling in the managed care program would have reduced out-of-pocket costs. Drawing from its experience with the demonstration projects, DOD designed TRICARE as its managed health care program.", "TRICARE is designed to give beneficiaries a choice among TRICARE Prime, which is similar to an HMO; TRICARE Extra, which is similar to a preferred provider organization; and TRICARE Standard, which is the current CHAMPUS fee-for-service-type benefit. Beneficiaries who select TRICARE Prime must enroll to receive care under this option. The program uses regional managed care support contracts to augment the capabilities of military hospitals by having contractors perform some managed care functions as well as arrange for care in the civilian sector. There will be seven managed care support contracts covering the 12 TRICARE regions. To coordinate the services and the contractors and monitor health care delivery, each region is headed by a joint-service administrative organization called a lead agent. DOD has estimated that the managed care support contracts will cost about $17 billion over the 5-year contract period. DOD has awarded four contracts and plans to have all contracts awarded and the TRICARE program fully implemented by September 1997. Background on the TRICARE program is in appendix I.", "The Northwest Region was the first region to begin enrolling beneficiaries in March 1995. Three regions, the Golden Gate Region, the Hawaii-Pacific Region, and Region Nine, began enrolling beneficiaries in October 1995, followed by the Southwest Region in November 1995. While the contract has been awarded for the Southeast and Gulf South Regions, they are not scheduled to begin health care delivery under TRICARE until July 1996. Figure 1 shows the DOD regions covered by the seven managed care support contracts. The shaded areas are the regions where TRICARE has been implemented in various stages as of March 1996.", "DOD has experienced difficulties in awarding its managed care support contracts. Each of the contracts awarded thus far has been protested. The protest of the first contract, encompassing the Golden Gate Region, Hawaii-Pacific Region, and Region Nine, was sustained, and DOD was required to recompete the contract. The protests for the Northwest Region\u2019s and Southwest Region\u2019s contracts and the contract including both the Southeast and Gulf South Regions were denied.", "Last year, in response to congressional concerns about DOD\u2019s difficulties with an early contract award covering California and Hawaii for which GAOsustained a protest, we reviewed problems identified by the bid protest experience. We reported that while DOD had taken steps to improve future contract awards, several areas of concern remained. Among our recommendations\u2014which DOD agreed to adopt\u2014were that DOD consider the potential effects on competition of such large TRICARE contracts and weigh alternative award approaches to help ensure competition during the next procurement round. We also urged that DOD try to simplify the next round\u2019s solicitation requirements and seek to incorporate best-practice, managed care techniques in the contracts. We further recommended that DOD establish general qualification requirements for its board members who evaluate contractors\u2019 proposals. We plan to follow up on these issues and begin a study of how well DOD\u2019s contractors are performing under the current contracts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Despite Setbacks, Early Implementation Is Under Way", "paragraphs": ["Despite unanticipated obstacles, DOD\u2019s early implementation of TRICARE is progressing in line with DOD expectations.

It has also succeeded in encouraging TRICARE Prime enrollees to select military health care providers\u2014the source of care that DOD believes is more cost-effective than civilian-provided care.

In the Northwest Region, about two-thirds of active duty dependents have chosen this option, as shown in figure 2.", "Also, in those regions under way, the bulk of beneficiaries choosing TRICARE Prime have enrolled with military, rather than civilian, health care providers. This enhances DOD\u2019s goal of fully utilizing its military medical facilities and providing care in the less expensive military setting.

A delay in the TRICARE benefits package and higher than expected early enrollment together led to initial beneficiary confusion. Also, computer system problems have hindered DOD\u2019s ability to manage the enrollment process.", "One early setback was the delay in the approval of the TRICARE benefits package, which details the beneficiaries\u2019 fees and copayments for health care services. DOD did not approve the benefits package until just 2 months before the Northwest Region began enrolling beneficiaries. Military facilities had already begun their marketing and education efforts with the proposed benefits; however, the approved benefits package changed the enrollment fees. Because of this, people became confused, and DOD and the contractor had to explain the changes. This confusion did not occur in other regions, because the TRICARE benefits package was in place before marketing and education began.", "Despite the benefits package delay, the Northwest Region had more people wanting to enroll than it anticipated. Although the contractor had projected that 28,000 beneficiaries would enroll during the first year, approximately 58,000 beneficiaries enrolled during the first 4 months. The contractor responsible for managing the enrollment process was understaffed and had to hire temporary employees. The temporary employees were not adequately trained and could not sufficiently address beneficiaries\u2019 questions about TRICARE, which further confused beneficiaries. Later, DOD and the Northwest Region shared their experiences through an extensive lessons-learned effort with other regions. Thus, the Southwest Region contractor hired temporary employees and trained them with its regular employees before enrollment began. Although the Southwest Region also experienced higher enrollment than anticipated, DOD and the contractor avoided much of the beneficiary confusion that the Northwest Region experienced.", "During the enrollment process, DOD has also encountered problems stemming from the inability of its medical information system to interact with the contractors\u2019 systems. Because of their configurations, the systems cannot communicate, meaning that data cannot be transferred from one system to another. As a result, according to lead agent officials, DOD does not have a complete database of all beneficiaries enrolled in TRICARE Prime, and regional officials must rely on the contractor to provide enrollment data. However, DOD is addressing the problem by having the Northwest contractor provide special reports from its system and, in the Southwest Region, having the contractor put beneficiary enrollment data in both the DOD and contractor systems. DOD plans to address this problem by amending the contracts to require contractors\u2019 medical information systems to exchange information with DOD\u2019s system."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Implementation Issues May Affect TRICARE Costs", "paragraphs": ["The degree to which cost savings can be achieved under TRICARE remains uncertain and depends on DOD\u2019s ability to operate the system as it is designed to work.

This lack of understanding continues to impede implementation of resource sharing under TRICARE, and the effectiveness of the program remains uncertain.", "Resource sharing is a feature of the TRICARE contracts that allows the contractor, through agreements with DOD, to provide personnel, equipment, and/or supplies to a military facility to improve its capability to provide care. DOD officials believe that providing health care to military beneficiaries in military facilities is less expensive than comparable care in the civilian sector, so maximizing the use of military facilities results in savings to both DOD and the contractor. For example, the contractor might provide an anesthesiologist to a military hospital so that more surgeries could be performed there rather than at a more costly private facility at DOD expense, thereby reducing overall costs. Similarly, contractor costs for the service provided are reduced by using the military facility and supporting resources.", "Evaluating the cost-effectiveness of resource-sharing agreements is very difficult and complex. Each agreement must be analyzed to determine whether the savings from providing care in the military facility offset increased facility costs under the agreement, such as the cost of supplies, staff, or support services that would not have been used if the agreement had not been established. Also, the extent of resource-sharing savings will be a factor in future regional contract price adjustments, which further adds to the complexity of these agreements.", "DOD has given regional officials, military facility commanders, and contractors a financial analysis worksheet to help determine the cost-effectiveness of the agreements. DOD has also provided some training sessions in the regions. Despite these efforts, DOD and contractor officials remain confused about making appropriate decisions regarding the financial implications of these agreements. According to lead agent officials, they are uncertain about how individual agreements may affect future contract price adjustments. Because of this, some regions have been slow to enter into agreements, and the anticipated savings may not be achieved.", "DOD officials told us that they recognize this deficiency and plan to address it. They said that DOD is currently developing a formal training program for resource sharing and that they also plan to provide military treatment facility commanders with a new computer-based analytical tool to enable them to determine the potential effects of resource-sharing agreements.", "There is, however, a more direct, less confusing means to accomplish contractor support of direct care in military facilities. Using a different program called task order resource support, military facility commanders can contract separately with the managed care support contractor for particular resources to augment their direct care capabilities. DOD officials told us that, in the past, very little resource support has taken place because hospital commanders did not have the level of control over CHAMPUS funds they needed to enter into these agreements. Now, however, DOD has proposed an alternative financing mechanism for the managed care support contracts. If adopted, this financing method would give facility commanders more control of CHAMPUS funds along with their direct care funds and, therefore, more flexibility to enter into resource support agreements. With this flexibility, DOD managers would be able to directly buy the services they need to avoid sending some patients out of their hospitals for needed care. This may have the effect of reducing the need to negotiate the more complex resource-sharing agreements while still making the most of contractor support of military facility capabilities. DOD\u2019s alternative financing approach is still being developed, however, so its eventual impact on contractor support of military direct care capabilities is still unclear."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Implementation of Utilization Management Delayed", "paragraphs": ["DOD estimated that utilization management in its facilities could save over $480 million nationwide over 5 years. However, DOD and the contractor were not ready to perform this function at the start of health care delivery in the Northwest and Southwest Regions as planned. Therefore, the full extent of TRICARE savings from utilization management may not be realized.", "Utilization management is intended to ensure that beneficiaries receive necessary and appropriate care in the most cost-effective manner. For example, utilization management reviews would verify that hospital admissions are medically necessary before patients check in or that lengths of hospital stays are not excessive. Utilization management also includes case management, which involves assigning health care providers to manage care for patients with high-cost, chronic conditions (such as diabetes or asthma) to try to avoid costly and disruptive crises that lead to emergency room visits or unscheduled hospital admissions.", "Utilization management can be done internally by the military facilities, or the contract can be written so that the contractor is required to perform this function. In the Southwest Region, where the contractor is responsible for utilization management, regional officials have expressed dissatisfaction with the contractor\u2019s performance of utilization management activities and have withheld partial contract payments until the contractor\u2019s performance improves. Because the contractor has hired additional utilization management staff, both DOD and the contractor believe the situation will be resolved soon.

Thus, the regions have begun creating their own sets of measures to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of the delivery of health care services in the region. These measures will be used in an ongoing evaluation of customer services, including patient satisfaction, and clinical services, including inpatient and outpatient care, disease prevention and health screening, disease management, enrollee health, and population health management.", "DOD is separately developing a set of performance measures to be used at the headquarters level to monitor various aspects of health care delivery across the regions, such as TRICARE Prime enrollment and preventable admissions.

Timely access to military health care has long been a major source of beneficiary dissatisfaction. To improve performance in this area, DOD established primary care access standards in their 1994 TRICARE Policy Guidelines.

DOD could collect the access data needed to measure its performance at the time beneficiaries schedule their primary care appointments. According to lead agent and Health Affairs officials, they are currently not doing so because DOD\u2019s patient appointment and scheduling system, as configured, does not capture this information.

However, DOD has not yet developed a definition that will enable it to identify these enrollees. DOD officials at both the national and regional levels told us that defining the various types of former nonusers, though necessary, is difficult because beneficiaries rely on the military health care system in varying degrees. For example, some beneficiaries have other health insurance but continue to use the military pharmacies.
