However, concerns have emerged about the adequacy of consumer protections for this product. Most reverse mortgages are made under the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) program. HUD insures the mortgages, which are made by private lenders, and oversees the agencies that provide mandatory counseling to prospective HECM borrowers. GAO was asked to examine issues and federal activities related to (1) the potential benefits and costs of HECMs to borrowers, (2) misleading HECM marketing, (3) the sale of potentially unsuitable products in conjunction with HECMs, and (4) oversight of HECM counseling providers. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed program rules; examined HECM advertisements; analyzed consumer complaint data; performed limited tests of HUD's internal controls; and interviewed HECM borrowers and agency, industry, and nonprofit officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["HECMs can provide borrowers with multiple benefits, but they also have substantial costs and are relatively complex. HECMs allow seniors to convert their home equity into flexible cash advances while living in their homes. Additionally, the borrowers or their heirs can fully pay off the HECM by selling the home, even if the amount owed exceeds the current home value. However, HECMs also have large insurance and origination costs. Furthermore, the long-term financial implications of a HECM can be difficult to assess because the borrower's remaining home equity depends on the amount of cash advances and interest rate and house price trends. Various federal agencies have responsibilities for protecting consumers from the misleading marketing of mortgages. Although these agencies have reported few HECM marketing complaints, GAO's limited review of selected marketing materials for reverse mortgages found some examples of claims that were potentially misleading because they were inaccurate, incomplete, or employed questionable sales tactics. Federal agency officials indicated that some of these claims raised concerns. For example, the claim of \"lifetime income\" is potentially misleading because there are a number of circumstances in which the borrower would no longer receive cash advances. Federal agencies have had a limited role in addressing concerns about the sale of potentially unsuitable financial products in conjunction with HECMs (\"inappropriate cross-selling\"). For example, an annuity that defers payments for a number of years may be unsuitable for an elderly person. HUD is responsible for implementing a provision in the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 that is intended to restrict inappropriate cross-selling, but the agency is still in the preliminary stages of developing regulations. Some of the states GAO contacted reported cases of inappropriate cross-selling involving violations of state laws governing the sale of insurance and annuities. HUD's internal controls do not provide reasonable assurance that counseling providers are complying with HECM counseling requirements. GAO's undercover participation in 15 HECM counseling sessions found that while the counselors generally conveyed accurate and useful information, none of the counselors covered all of the topics required by HUD, and some overstated the length of the sessions in HUD records. For example, 7 of the 15 counselors did not discuss required information about alternatives to HECMs. HUD has several internal controls designed to ensure that counselors convey the required information to prospective HECM borrowers, but the department has not tested the effectiveness of these controls and lacks procedures to ensure that records of counseling sessions are accurate. Because of these weaknesses, some prospective borrowers may not be receiving the information necessary to make informed decisions about obtaining a HECM."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["A reverse mortgage is a loan that converts the borrower\u2019s home equity into  payments from a lender and, typically, does not require any repayments as  long as the borrower continues to live in the home. Available to  homeowners aged 62 and older, these loans have become an increasingly  popular financial tool for seniors, but concerns have emerged about the  adequacy of consumer protections for reverse mortgage borrowers. The  potential for rapid and continued growth of the industry has added to  these concerns. By 2020, nearly 55 million people in the United States will  be at least 65 years old, many of whom will own their homes. Furthermore,  many senior homeowners rely only on Social Security payments to meet  their financial needs, making reverse mortgages a potentially attractive  source of additional income.", "According to industry sources, almost all reverse mortgages are currently  made under the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) program,  which is administered by the Department of Housing and Urban  Development (HUD). The HECM program began in 1988, when Congress  authorized HUD to insure reverse mortgages to meet the financial needs of  elderly homeowners by reducing the effect of economic hardship at a time  of reduced income for seniors, while protecting reverse mortgage lenders  and borrowers from financial losses. The volume of HECMs made  annually has grown from 157 loans in fiscal year 1990 to more than 112,000  loans in fiscal year 2008. In addition, recent years have seen a rapid  increase in the number of lenders participating in the HECM program,  with more than 1,500 lenders originating their first HECM in 2008, bringing  the total number of HECM lenders to over 2,700.", "The complicated nature of the product and the concern that older  consumers can be more vulnerable to unscrupulous sales practices have  brought reverse mortgages to the attention of consumer advocates,  regulators, and policymakers. Since the inception of the HECM program,  Congress has required prospective borrowers to obtain adequate  counseling by an independent third party so that they could make  informed decisions about whether to obtain a HECM. Borrowers must  complete counseling with a HUD-approved housing counseling agency  before obtaining the loan. Nevertheless, concerns about consumer  protections persist. For example, some consumer advocates have  expressed concern about misleading marketing and inappropriate cross- selling\u2014the practice of encouraging borrowers to use reverse mortgage  funds to purchase insurance or other products that may be unsuitable to  the borrower\u2019s financial situation. The Housing and Economic Recovery  Act of 2008 (HERA) acknowledged some of these concerns by putting in  place additional consumer protection measures.", "In light of concerns about potentially misleading marketing practices and  the adequacy of relevant consumer protections, as agreed with your  offices, we examine in this report (1) the potential benefits and costs of  HECMs to borrowers, (2) federal agency responsibilities for protecting  consumers from misleading HECM marketing, (3) federal agency efforts to  protect HECM borrowers from inappropriate cross-selling, and (4) HUD\u2019s  oversight of HECM counseling providers.", "To address these objectives, we spoke with agency, industry, and  nonprofit officials, including those at HUD; federal and state banking  regulators; AARP; and the National Reverse Mortgage Lenders Association  (NRMLA). In addition, to examine the potential benefits and costs of  HECMs to borrowers, we reviewed HUD\u2019s regulations, guidance, and  consumer materials related to the program. We also spoke with 18  randomly selected HECM borrowers and constructed scenarios to  determine how various borrower decisions and economic conditions  could affect home equity over the long term. To examine federal agency  responsibilities to protect consumers from misleading HECM marketing,  we identified authorities, standards, and processes that HUD, the Federal  Trade Commission (FTC), and four federal banking regulators use to  identify and address misleading marketing practices. In addition, we  obtained agency information on complaints related to HECM marketing.  We also conducted our own review of HECM marketing materials, which  included a review of the Internet marketing materials for the 12 HECM  lenders that originated at least 1,000 HECMs in fiscal year 2008, mailed  materials from 11 of these 12 lenders, as well as DVDs and other materials  from HECM lenders that advertise on television. We also conducted  Internet searches for materials with potentially misleading statements and  collected materials from seven reverse mortgage information seminars.  We attended seminars in Florida and California\u2014states with among the  largest number of HECMs\u2014and seminars in Maryland and Michigan, for  purposes of geographic diversity. To examine the steps federal agencies  have taken to protect HECM borrowers from inappropriate cross-selling,  we reviewed the HERA provisions on cross-selling, HUD\u2019s actions to  implement the provisions, and other HUD and federal regulator activities  related to these practices. In addition, we compiled examples from state  insurance regulators of cross-selling that violated state insurance laws. To  examine HUD\u2019s oversight of HECM counseling providers, we identified the  internal controls that HUD currently has in place to ensure compliance  with HUD counseling requirements and tested the effectiveness of these  controls by conducting 15 undercover counseling sessions with HUD- approved counselors. For each session, we determined whether  counselors covered the required topics and met other requirements, such  as accurately recording the length of the counseling session. We  interviewed HUD field and headquarters staff about the procedures they  use to evaluate counseling agency performance. Finally, we reviewed and  conducted limited testing of HUD\u2019s controls over the process that HECM  providers are required to follow for referring potential borrowers to  counseling agencies.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2008 through June 2009,  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

These conditions, among others, require the borrower to live in  the home, pay property taxes and homeowners\u2019 insurance, maintain the  property, and retain the title in his or her name. Reverse mortgages  typically are \u201crising debt, falling equity\u201d loans, in which the loan balance  increases and the home equity decreases over time. As the borrower  receives payments from the lender, the lender adds the principal and  interest to the loan balance, reducing the homeowner\u2019s equity. This is the  opposite of what happens in forward mortgages, which are characterized  as \u201cfalling debt, rising equity\u201d loans. With forward mortgages, monthly loan  payments made to the lender add to the borrower\u2019s home equity and  the borrower\u2019s home equity and  decrease the loan balance. (See fig. 1).  decrease the loan balance. (See fig. 1).", "The Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 (Pub. L. No. 100- 242) authorized HECMs as a demonstration program in HUD. It was the  first nationwide reverse mortgage program\u2014available in all 50 states, the  District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico\u2014that offered the possibility of  lifetime home occupancy to elderly homeowners. Homeowners aged 62 or  over with a significant amount of home equity are eligible, as long as they  live in the house as the principal residence, are not delinquent on any  federal debt, and live in a single-family residence. If the borrower has any  remaining balance on a forward mortgage, this generally must be paid off  first (typically, taken up-front from the reverse mortgage). In addition, the  condition of the house must meet HUD\u2019s minimum property standards, but  a portion of the HECM can be set aside for required repairs. The borrower  makes no monthly payments, and there are no income or credit  requirements to qualify for the mortgage.", "The amount of money that a lender can advance to a HECM borrower  (loan amount) depends on three main factors. First, the loan amount is  based on the \u201cmaximum claim amount,\u201d which is defined as the lesser of  the appraised value of the house or the Federal Housing Administration  (FHA) loan limit (the highest mortgage value HUD will insure). In the past  year, Congress has raised the FHA loan limit for HECMs twice, to the  current limit of $625,500 nationwide. Second, the age of the borrower  affects the borrower\u2019s loan amount\u2014the older the borrower, the higher  the loan amount. However, if there is more than one homeowner, the loan  amount is based on the age of the youngest borrower. Third, the interest  rate also affects the loan amount. Typically, the lower the interest rate, the  higher the loan amount.", "Since the inception of the HECM program, Congress has mandated that  borrowers receive information about the financial implications of these  loans, allowing consumers to make informed decisions. In response, HUD  developed a counseling program, working with nonprofits, such as the  AARP Foundation, to develop training courses and with a network of  qualified counselors. Counselors may conduct counseling sessions face-to- face or by telephone. HUD has stated that upon the completion of HECM  counseling, prospective borrowers should be able to make an  independent, informed decision on whether this product would meet their  needs. While a lender may order a preliminary title search before the  prospective borrower receives counseling, the lender may not process a  loan application until the counseling has been completed. Furthermore,  HUD requires lenders to provide prospective borrowers with a list of HUD- approved counseling agencies from which to choose.", "A number of federal and state agencies have roles in overseeing the  reverse mortgage market. FHA administers the HECM program and issues  mortgagee letters to HECM lenders to communicate or clarify HUD  requirements. HUD\u2019s four Home Ownership Centers (HOC) perform a  number of insurance processing and quality control functions and conduct  evaluations of HECM counseling providers.

Consistent  with this goal, HECMs allow senior homeowners to convert their home  equity into cash advances, while maintaining ownership of their homes.  HECM borrowers have indicated that the mortgages have helped them to  meet their financial needs. According to a 2006 AARP survey of reverse  mortgage borrowers, including HECM borrowers, 83 percent of  respondents said their loans had completely or mostly met their financials  needs, and another 12 percent said the loans partly met their needs. In  addition, we interviewed 18 randomly selected HECM borrowers, 11 of  whom said their loans completely met their financial needs and 6 of whom  said the loans partly met their financial needs.", "The money that borrowers receive from a HECM can be used for any  purpose, and the loan does not have to be repaid until the borrower dies,  sells the house, moves, or violates other conditions of the mortgage.  Because there are no restrictions on how the money received from a  HECM can be used, borrowers can choose to use the funds for necessities,  such as housing, medication, or groceries, or for other purposes, such as  vacations. Borrowers surveyed by AARP cited \u201cpaying off an existing  mortgage,\u201d \u201chome repairs/improvements,\u201d and \u201cimproved quality of life\u201d as  the most common \u201cmain uses\u201d of reverse mortgage funds. In our  interviews with HECM borrowers, borrowers cited additional reasons for  looking into a reverse mortgage, including making insurance payments,  providing money to children and grandchildren, paying off nonmortgage  loans, and supplementing limited retirement income. Furthermore, some  borrowers also may use HECM money to address issues associated with  failing health. For example, a National Council on Aging report discusses  the use of reverse mortgages to fund in-home services to allow seniors to  age in place. In addition to unrestricted use of the money, HECM  borrowers are not required to make monthly interest or principal  payments to the lender as long as the borrower lives in the house.  However, borrowers must continue to pay property taxes and  homeowners\u2019 insurance, and they must maintain the condition of the  house.", "Borrowers also can choose different ways to receive money from a  HECM\u2014as monthly payments, a line of credit, or a combination of both.  Monthly payments can be received for a fixed period (term payments) or  for as long as the borrower has the loan (tenure payments), and lines of  credit can be accessed at any rate the borrower chooses (including  receiving all of the money up front). Borrowers who obtained HECMs in  fiscal year 2008 mostly chose the line-of-credit payment option. According  to HUD data, 89 percent of these borrowers chose to receive their money  solely as a line of credit, and an additional 6 percent chose to receive a line  of credit in combination with term or tenure monthly payments. Generally,  those choosing a line of credit withdraw about 60 percent of their funds at  the loan\u2019s inception.", "Another benefit of HECMs is the potential growth over time in the amount  of funds available to the borrower under each of the payment plans. For  example, for borrowers who choose a line of credit but do not draw down  all of the funds up front, any remaining line of credit grows by the same  rate as the interest rate on the mortgage, plus 0.5 percent. To illustrate this  HECM feature, consider a borrower who receives a line of credit of  $100,000, withdraws $20,000 up front, and keeps the remaining $80,000 in  the line of credit. If the borrower does not draw down any additional funds  during the next year, and the interest rate plus 0.5 percent mortgage  insurance premium were equal to 3 percent, the borrower\u2019s credit line  would grow to $82,400 at the end of 1 year.", "FHA mortgage insurance benefits borrowers in several ways. First, lenders  can provide borrowers with higher loan amounts than they could without  the insurance. Second, the insurance guarantees that HECM borrowers  will have access to the full amount of promised loan funds, regardless of  how long the borrower lives in the house, of changes in the home value, or  of changes in the circumstances of the lender. For example, the lender  may assign the loan to FHA once the loan balance reaches 98 percent of  the maximum claim amount, and FHA will continue making payments to  the borrower if the borrower has remaining funds in a line of credit or still  is receiving monthly payments. According to HUD, program experience  thus far suggests that lenders assign to FHA about 25 percent of HECMs  made in any given year. Similarly, if a lender goes out of business, the  lender can assign the HECM to FHA, protecting the borrower from any  risk of losing promised loan funds. Finally, FHA insurance protects  borrowers from owing more than the value of the house when the loan  becomes due. When a HECM becomes due, the borrower or heir to the  borrower can retain ownership of the home and repay the loan in full,  including all accumulated principal and interest charges. However, if the  borrower or heir sells the home, he or she will not be responsible for any  loan amount above the value of the house.", "Finally, HERA authorized a \u201cHECM for Purchase\u201d program for seniors who  want to use a HECM to buy a new home. Unlike a traditional HECM, a  HECM for purchase is made against the value of the home to be  purchased, rather than against the value of a home the borrower already  owns. Before the HECM for purchase program was available, seniors  wanting both to buy a new home and obtain a HECM would have had to  conduct two transactions\u2014first to buy the home with a forward mortgage,  then to obtain a HECM to pay off the balance of that forward mortgage.  The HECM for purchase program allows a senior to simultaneously buy a  new home and obtain a HECM in a single transaction with a single set of  closing costs, thereby reducing the cost to the senior. For example, with  the HECM for purchase program, a senior who wants to buy a $300,000  home could use a HECM to partially finance this purchase. In this  example, the senior qualifies for an $180,000 HECM on the basis of his age,  the interest rate, and the value of the home to be purchased\u2014the same  factors used to determine the amount of a traditional HECM. The senior  would combine the $180,000 in loan funds with $120,000 of his own\u2014for  example, from personal savings or money from the sale of his current  home\u2014to fully purchase the new home. He then would have no monthly  mortgage payments and would avoid the closing costs of first obtaining a  forward mortgage. As with a traditional HECM, the loan would become  due when the senior died, sold the house, or permanently moved out of the  house."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HECM Costs Can Be Substantial", "paragraphs": ["While HECMs can provide many benefits, the up-front insurance  premiums and origination fees of HECMs can be substantial.

The maximum claim amount is always higher  than the amount a borrower can receive in HECM payments from the  lender. However, because the HECM loan balance (with accumulated  interest and fees) will exceed the amount a borrower receives in payments  and potentially reach the maximum claim amount, FHA charges the  mortgage insurance premium on the basis of the maximum claim amount.", "Origination fee: At the time of closing, lenders can charge an origination  fee equal to the greater of $2,500 or 2 percent of the maximum claim  amount, up to $200,000 plus 1 percent of any portion of the claim amount  greater than $200,000, with the total origination fee not to exceed $6,000.", "To illustrate these up-front costs, consider a HECM borrower with a home  value of $300,000.

To finance this fee with the loan, FHA requires lenders to  determine a prescribed dollar amount and deduct that amount, called the  servicing fee set-aside, from the amount of loan funds available to the  borrower. Each month, the lender deducts the servicing fee from this set- aside and adds it to the borrower\u2019s loan balance.", "Interest charges: Monthly interest charges are also added to the  borrower\u2019s loan balance. Most HECMs have adjustable interest rates.", "Monthly mortgage insurance premium: Finally, in addition to the up- front mortgage insurance premium that we have previously described,  FHA charges a monthly mortgage insurance premium based on the loan  balance.

FTC has defined \u201cdeceptive\u201d to mean any  material representation or omission of information, or practice that is  likely to mislead consumers who are acting reasonably under the  circumstances. Misleading information is \u201cmaterial\u201d to consumers if it is  likely to affect the consumer\u2019s decision to purchase a product or service.  For some products, including forward mortgage products, FTC officials  stated that they have conducted systematic searches of all forms of media,  including Internet, print, and television advertisements for potential  violations of the FTC Act. Violators of the FTC Act could be subject to  actions ranging from warning letters to cease-and-desist orders. For  example, in 2007, FTC sent warning letters to 200 forward mortgage  lenders identifying potentially deceptive advertisements that the lenders  had run and advising the lenders to review their marketing practices to  ensure they complied with the law.", "FTC officials said they have not systematically searched for potentially  misleading reverse mortgage marketing, and have not brought any law  enforcement actions related to reverse mortgage marketing. However,  FTC officials did note that they are maintaining an awareness of the  potential risks associated with reverse mortgage marketing. For example,  FTC staff said that they monitor their consumer complaint database for  complaints about reverse mortgage marketing. In addition, FTC formed a  task force of state and federal regulators and law enforcement agencies, in  part to learn about complaints related to reverse mortgages that may not  be captured by FTC\u2019s database. The FTC officials said the task force will  allow them to take early action if problems related to reverse mortgages  begin to surface. In addition, FTC has developed educational materials for  reverse mortgage counselors, which include information on identifying  deceptive claims related to reverse mortgages. The FTC officials noted  that because counselors are informed about the product, they may be well- positioned to help consumers identify questionable marketing claims and  practices.

We reviewed Internet marketing  material from the 12 HECM lenders that originated at least 1,000 loans in  fiscal year 2008, and reviewed mailed material from 11 of these 12  lenders. In addition, we reviewed mailed, Internet, information seminar,  and DVD materials from other entities that advertised HECMs, for certain  potentially misleading claims (discussed in the following paragraphs). We  found few such claims among the materials from the top 12 HECM  lenders, and some examples in the materials from the other entities.", "Some of the potentially misleading marketing claims we found raised  concern among officials at FTC, HUD, and the federal banking regulators.  Among the materials we reviewed, we found 26 different entities that  made potentially misleading claims in their HECM marketing materials.  This group includes entities regulated by each of the federal banking  regulators with whom we spoke, as well as FTC and state regulators; it  also includes both members and nonmembers of NRMLA. NRMLA  members are expected to adhere to the association\u2019s Code of Ethics,  which contains specific rules on ethical advertising. We selected seven  advertisements that represented these claims and submitted them to FTC,  HUD, the Federal Reserve, OCC, FDIC, and OTS for review. We asked  officials at each of these agencies for their views on these claims and  whether they would take any action if such advertisements were the  subject of a complaint or surfaced as part of an examination. In general,  the officials with whom we spoke agreed that the claims in six of the seven  advertisements raised some degree of concern and might prompt further  investigation. In commenting on the advertisements, the officials  indicated that the claims ranged from being confusing to false. Several of  the officials noted that they would need to consider the fuller context of  the advertisement to determine if the claims were misleading and the level  of action they would take if these six advertisements were the subject of  complaints or compliance examinations. For example, an official at FTC  said that if its staff were to follow typical investigative procedures, they  would request more information from the advertisers, such as data on the  number of consumers who responded to the advertisement. Similarly,  officials at OTS noted that an assessment of consumer reactions to the  advertisements might be needed to determine if the advertisements  violated the FTC Act. An FTC official also said that the counseling  requirement for HECMs would factor into their assessment of HECM  marketing. He said that the counseling requirement would not, as a matter  of law, prevent FTC from taking law enforcement action against a HECM  lender for deceptive marketing. However, FTC would consider the  likelihood that counseling would mitigate the effect of the potentially  misleading information. In addition to the regulators, we spoke with the  president of NRMLA to obtain his views on these seven advertisements. He  generally agreed with the regulators\u2019 assessment that these claims raised  concerns.", "The six potentially misleading claims that we identified and agency  officials generally agreed raised concerns were as follows:  \u201cNever owe more than the value of your home\u201d: The claim is potentially  misleading because a borrower or heirs of a borrower would owe the full  loan balance\u2014even if it were greater than the value of the house\u2014if the  borrower or heirs chose to keep the house when the loan became due.  This claim was made by HUD itself in its instructions to approved HECM  lenders; however, in December 2008, HUD issued a mortgagee letter to  HECM lenders explaining the inaccuracy of this claim. This was the most  common of the potentially misleading statements we found in the  marketing materials we reviewed. Of the potentially misleading statements  found among the top 12 HECM lenders, variations of this statement were  the most prevalent.", "Implications that the reverse mortgage is a \u201cgovernment benefit\u201d or  otherwise not a loan: While HECMs are government-insured, the product  is a loan that borrowers or their heirs must repay, not a benefit. Examples  of this type of claim include the following: \u201cYou may be qualified for this  government-sponsored benefit program\u201d and \u201cAccess the equity in your  home without having to sell, move, or take out a loan.\u201d An FDIC official  noted that consumers might be confused about the reverse mortgage being  a loan because there are no monthly payments, and this claim plays on this  confusion.  \u201cLifetime income\u201d or \u201cCan\u2019t outlive loan\u201d: Although borrowers can  choose to receive HECM funds as monthly tenure payments, even under  this option, payments will not continue once the loan comes due (e.g.,  when the borrower moves out of the house or violates other conditions of  the mortgage). HUD officials noted that this claim could be particularly  harmful when paired with the claim that the reverse mortgage is a  government benefit. In addition, claims that a HECM borrower cannot  outlive the loan are inaccurate because a line of credit can be exhausted  during the borrower\u2019s lifetime, and term monthly payments do not  continue once the specified term has ended.  \u201cNever lose your home\u201d: This claim is potentially misleading because a  lender could foreclose on a HECM borrower\u2019s home if the borrower did  not pay property taxes and hazard insurance or did not maintain the  house. HUD officials told us that they were aware of cases in which  borrowers obtained a reverse mortgage without understanding these  requirements and did not have the means to meet these obligations.", "Misrepresenting government affiliation: Figure 3 illustrates an example  of this type of claim, including the use of government symbols or logos  and claims implying that the lender is a government agency. HUD officials  said that among the advertisements we asked them to review, this would  be the only one they would refer to the Mortgagee Review Board. Officials  at FDIC and OTS noted that in 2007, the federal banking regulators jointly  issued an alert to warn consumers about similar advertisements that  suggested that consumers could receive cash grants from a \u201cCommunity  Reinvestment Act Program\u201d endorsed by the federal banking regulators. In  addition, as we have previously noted, FTC has received consumer  complaints about advertisements for reverse mortgages that appear to be  from a government agency.", "Claims of time and geographic limits: These claims falsely imply that  HECM loans are limited to a certain geographic area, or that the consumer  must respond within a certain time to qualify for the loan. Examples  include \u201cmust call within 72 hours\u201d and \u201cdeadline extended,\u201d as well as the  claim that a consumer\u2019s residence is \u201clocated in a Federal Housing  Authority qualifying area.\u201d An OCC official said that he would consider  these to be high-pressure tactics against which he would caution banks,  even if they do not rise to the level of unfair or deceptive practices.", "As we discuss in this report, federal agencies have mechanisms to identify  and address specific cases of misleading marketing. They also have  various means, such as conferences and educational materials, for  communicating more generally with mortgage industry participants and  the public about consumer protection issues. However, our research  showed that potentially misleading claims exist in the marketplace, which  suggests that some HECM providers may not be sufficiently considering  federal marketing standards in designing their marketing materials.

According  to an AARP survey of reverse mortgage borrowers, 4 percent of  respondents said they used a reverse mortgage to make investments or  purchase an annuity or long-term care insurance. Some consumer  advocates, including representatives of AARP and the National  Association of Consumer Advocates, have expressed concern that these  products are sometimes sold inappropriately to reverse mortgage  borrowers.", "In particular, consumer advocates worry that reverse mortgage borrowers  could be sold some annuity products that may be inappropriate to the  borrower\u2019s circumstances. For example, there is concern that elderly  reverse mortgage borrowers may be sold deferred annuities, where  payments may not begin for many years and high fees may be charged for  early access to the money. Inappropriate cross-selling could take different  forms. For example, an individual who has financial incentive to sell an  elderly client a reverse mortgage as well as another product, such as a  deferred annuity, could sell both products to a senior without informing  the client of the costs and potential implications. Multiple parties, such as  HECM originators and insurance agents, also could work together for their  financial gain. For example, an insurance agent could compensate a  HECM originator for referring HECM borrowers to him, even if using the  HECM money for an insurance product is not in the borrower\u2019s best  interest.", "While certain annuity products may be suitable for some HECM  borrowers, such as those who want to receive payments for life regardless  of where they live, HUD has noted that HECM borrowers should be fully  informed of the advantages and disadvantages of using HECM funds to  purchase these products. HECM counselors are instructed to inform  prospective borrowers who are also interested in purchasing annuities  that HECMs also offer monthly payment options, and while these monthly  payments only last for a specified time or as long as the borrower lives in  the house, they may be more suitable to the HECM borrower\u2019s needs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Role in Regulating Cross-Selling Has Been Limited, but Regulations to Be Developed Would Create HECM-Specific Federal Protections", "paragraphs": ["Because cross-selling typically involves the sale of insurance products  generally regulated at the state level, the role of federal agencies in  addressing the issue of cross-selling in conjunction with HECMs has been  limited and largely has been focused on consumer education and  disclosures. For example, federal agencies have had some role in  informing HECM borrowers about the risks and costs of purchasing other  financial products using HECM funds. As we discuss later in this report,  HUD\u2019s HECM counseling protocol requires the provision of certain  consumer education materials to counselees interested in purchasing an  annuity with their HECM funds. Additionally, pursuant to Truth in Lending  Act provisions, the Federal Reserve developed a disclosure, known as the  total annual loan cost (TALC) to illustrate the short- and long-term costs of  reverse mortgages. Lenders must provide reverse mortgage borrowers  with this disclosure, and if the lender is aware that the consumer is  purchasing an annuity with reverse mortgage funds, these costs must be  accounted for in the TALC as part of the total mortgage costs.", "In addition, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is the federal  regulator for variable annuity products\u2014annuities that are tied to the  stock market or other investments\u2014and so has responsibility for ensuring  the appropriate sale of these products. In May 2006, the three following  entities began an initiative to protect seniors from the sale of unsuitable  securities: SEC; FINRA, which is a nongovernmental regulator for  securities firms; and the North American Securities Administrators  Association. As part of this effort, SEC and other regulators conducted a  review of 110 information seminars, many of which were targeted to  seniors, where attendees were offered a free meal. These officials found  that products sold at these seminars included annuities and reverse  mortgages, and, in some instances, those holding the seminars  recommended products that did not appear to be suitable for the  consumers. In addition, in September 2007, SEC approved a FINRA rule,  which includes suitability standards for deferred variable annuities. As  with the state suitability laws we discuss in the following text, these  standards may limit the sale of unsuitable deferred variable annuities to  seniors, whether purchased with HECM funds or not.", "As we have previously noted, Congress passed HERA in 2008, which  includes provisions intended to curb the sale of unsuitable financial  products to consumers using HECM funds. According to the provisions of  the act, a borrower cannot be required by the lender or any other party to  purchase an insurance, annuity, or similar product as a condition of  obtaining a HECM. In addition, the lender either must not be associated  with any other financial or insurance product or must maintain firewalls  and other safeguards to ensure that its employees originating the HECMs  do not also sell other financial or insurance products. Finally, HUD must  conduct a study to determine appropriate consumer protections and  underwriting standards to ensure that the purchase of other financial  products is appropriate for the consumer.", "HUD has responsibility for enforcing the cross-selling provisions in HERA,  but the department is in the preliminary stages of developing regulations  to implement them. According to HUD officials, HUD is drafting a Federal  Register notification to solicit feedback on this issue. HUD officials noted  that the draft notification poses a number of questions concerning several  issues, including HUD\u2019s ability to monitor and enforce the provision; the  usefulness of disclosures, education, and counseling in preventing  inappropriate cross-selling; what would constitute \u201cappropriate\u201d firewalls;  and what types of financial products should be covered. To further inform  development of the new regulations, HUD also met with HECM lenders,  some of which already have cross-selling policies. For example, one large  HECM lender requires that loan officers follow up with HECM borrowers  before and after closing to confirm that the borrower has not been sold  any insurance products. Meanwhile, HUD has issued a mortgagee letter  instructing HECM lenders that until HUD issues more definitive guidance,  lenders must not condition a HECM on the purchase of any other financial  or insurance product, and should strive to establish firewalls and other  safeguards to ensure there is no undue pressure or appearance of pressure  for a HECM borrower to purchase another product.", "While HUD is considering regulations to implement the HERA cross- selling provisions, the reverse mortgage industry is also discussing the  implications of these provisions. NRMLA representatives have noted that  while HERA could prevent inappropriate cross-selling, it also could  prevent seniors from purchasing beneficial products. In particular, the  president of NRMLA noted that although some seniors who obtain reverse  mortgages do so to cover everyday living expenses, others are financially  sophisticated individuals who may desire to use their reverse mortgages as  part of long-term financial and insurance strategies. He said that for the  latter group of borrowers, purchasing other products in conjunction with a  reverse mortgage may be beneficial. For example, some insurance  products may be suitable if they still allow seniors some access to the  funds when needed. NRMLA has submitted its legislative interpretation to  HUD. According to the NRMLA General Counsel, this interpretation allows  companies to sell multiple products to reverse mortgage borrowers, as  long as (1) the company has separate sales forces for reverse mortgages  and other products, and there is no compensation for referrals between  the sales forces; or (2) the reverse mortgage transaction is separate from  the sale of other products, and the sale of the reverse mortgage and other  products is separated in time.

The NAIC model regulation states that in recommending to a  consumer the purchase of an annuity, the insurance producer shall have  reasonable grounds for believing that the recommendation is suitable for  the consumer on the basis of the facts disclosed by the consumer. In  addition, a few states allow citizens to cancel policies of individual life  insurance or individual annuity contracts within a certain period from the  date of purchase, regardless of whether these products were purchased  with reverse mortgage funds.

Of those 8  regulators, 4 said their states took formal or informal action against the  companies that sold these products. Cross-selling cases that involved  actual or potential violations of state insurance laws included the  following:    An official at the Insurance Division of the Hawaii Department of  Commerce and Consumer Affairs described a case in which an  independent mortgage broker was prosecuted for misrepresentation of an  annuity product. The broker, who also owned his own insurance company,  deceived 15 clients by including paperwork for an annuity in their HECM  closing documents without their knowledge. The clients did not realize  they were signing to purchase an annuity in addition to a reverse  mortgage, and the broker collected fees from the HECM sale and  commission from the annuity.", "A sales manager of an insurance company violated the Maine Insurance  Code by allowing transactions that were not in the best interest of the  customer.

One particular client, an  81-year old widow, was contacted continually until she obtained her  reverse mortgage funds, and was then sold a deferred annuity.

The California Department of Insurance is currently  investigating this case.", "While state insurance laws have captured some cases of inappropriate  cross-selling to HECM borrowers, regulators may not always be aware  when suitability violations involve inappropriate cross-selling. For  example, a FINRA representative noted that the source of funds used to  purchase an unsuitable annuity may not be relevant for determining a  violation of FINRA\u2019s suitability standards, so examiners may not always  know if HECM funds were used. Consumer complaints also could indicate  the potential extent of inappropriate cross-selling; however, federal and  state agencies do not specifically track complaints related to this practice.

For example, in discussing  the financial implications of the loan, most counselors provided  information on the growth in the HECM line of credit and explained that  the loan balance would increase over time. In addition, most counselors  also explained that the loan would become due and payable when no  borrower lives in the property, and that borrowers must pay taxes and  insurance. Counselors also often supplemented their discussions with  useful information, such as a description of factors that affect available  interest rates and the fact that borrowers would receive monthly  statements from the lender, even though this information is not  specifically referred to on the counseling certificate. When our undercover  counselees specifically asked for help in finding a lender, or asked directly  for a recommendation, the counselors appropriately explained that they  were not permitted to do so and some referred the counselees to the HUD  Web site for a listing of lenders. At the end of the sessions, all of the  counselors informed the undercover counselees that they could call back  with additional questions.", "However, despite certifying on the counseling certificate that they had  covered, in detail, all of the information HUD requires, all of the  counselors omitted at least some required information (see fig. 4).", "The required information that counselors most frequently omitted  included the following:    Other housing, social service, health, and financial options: Seven of the  15 counselors did not discuss options, other than a HECM, that might be  available to a homeowner, such as considering other living arrangements,  meal programs, or health services that local social service agencies might  provide. Our findings are consistent with findings in AARP and HUD  Office of Inspector General reports suggesting that counselors may not  always be discussing alternatives to a reverse mortgage with clients.  Although the other 8 counselors did present options, most did so broadly,  referring our undercover counselees to a nationwide, toll-free telephone  number for the National Association of Area Agencies on Aging for more  information, rather than providing specific information about local  resources. However, 1 counselor did provide our agents with specific  telephone numbers or Web sites for specific programs, such as those  sponsored by a state\u2019s department of aging and organizations that assist  senior citizens with meeting home energy needs and obtaining  prescription drugs. Although HUD guidance on this point is not explicit,  HUD officials told us that they expect counselors to be knowledgeable  about local resources, even if the counseling sessions were conducted by  telephone.", "Other home equity conversion options: The same 7 counselors likewise  did not discuss other types of (and potentially lower-cost) reverse  mortgages that state or local governments might sponsor for specific  purposes. For example, some state governments provide reverse  mortgages for payment of taxes or for making major repairs that do not  need to be repaid until the house is sold. These loans, which also could be  contingent on the income of the applicant, may be appropriate for  borrowers who need to cover specific types of costs.", "The financial implications of entering into a HECM: Fourteen  counselors only partially met this requirement, and 1 did not, because they  omitted information that HUD directs counselors to convey. For  example, 6 of the counselors did not provide estimates (using computer  software) of the maximum amount of funds that might be available to the  counselee under the HECM payment plan options. According to a HUD  official, the purpose of providing these estimates is to help prospective  borrowers understand how reverse mortgages would address their  financial situations. For example, if a potential borrower needs to pay off  an existing mortgage, receiving HECM funds in monthly payments might  not be appropriate. Additionally, 14 counselors did not tell counselees that  they could elect to have the loan provider withhold funds to pay property  taxes and insurance, and 9 counselors omitted basic information about the  advantages and disadvantages of each payment plan (i.e., they usually did  not address the term plan).", "A disclosure that a HECM may affect eligibility for assistance under  other federal and state programs: While most counselors discussed the  tax consequences of a HECM, 6 of 15 did not indicate that eligibility for  some federal and state programs could be affected if borrowers had more  money in their bank accounts than allowed under such programs\u2019 terms.  For example, eligibility for a means-tested program, such as the federal  government\u2019s Supplemental Security Income (SSI), could be affected if  borrowers deposited in their bank accounts an amount of money that  exceeded the program\u2019s threshold for countable resources by the end of  the month.", "Asking if a homeowner had signed a contract or agreement with an  estate planning service: HUD implemented this requirement on the basis  of a statutory provision intended to protect HECM borrowers from paying  excessive fees for third-party services that are of little or no value. To  illustrate, an estate planning service might charge a fee, unauthorized by  HUD, because it \u201carranged\u201d for borrowers to obtain a HECM. However, 14  of the 15 counselors did not ask this question, although of the 14, 4  cautioned the undercover counselees that such services were unnecessary  to obtain a HECM. If a counselee responds affirmatively to this question,  HUD requires the counselor to discuss the extent to which services under  the contract may not be needed or may be available from other sources at  no or nominal costs.", "The results of our review indicate that signed counseling certificates are  not a reliable indicator that the counselors complied with HUD  requirements. Nevertheless, HOC staff (consistent with their procedures  for reviewing counseling agencies) consider the presence of a signed  certificate in a counseling agency\u2019s files to be a key compliance indicator.", "Additionally, HUD requires a signed certificate as a condition of insuring a  HECM and performs checks to ensure compliance with this requirement.  Thus, the fact that we observed a substantial amount of noncompliance  despite the existence of a signed counseling certificate for each  undercover session raises questions about the effectiveness of HUD  internal controls that rely on the validity of the certificate.", "In addition, HUD considers having a network of examination-certified  counselors as an internal control that helps ensure compliance with  counseling requirements. HUD expects to issue regulations in 2009 that  will require all HECM counselors to pass a written examination, establish  a roster of eligible HECM counselors, require counselors to meet  continuing education requirements, and allow HUD to remove counselors  for cause. HUD believes that this proposed rule will help improve the  quality of HECM counseling. However, all but 1 of the counselors who  conducted our counseling sessions were examination-certified, and they  all omitted required information but still signed the counseling certificate.

HUD does not prescribe how long a  counseling session should last, but the department uses this as a factor in  monitoring the performance of counseling providers and awarding  counseling grant funds. For example, HUD officials told us that HOC  staff responsible for overseeing HECM counseling providers examine the  times on the counseling certificates to identify those sessions that are  unreasonably short, to help identify potential performance problems. Staff  from two of the HOCs noted that unusually short counseling times or  discrepancies between actual and recorded times would prompt follow-up  actions. AARP\u2019s 2007 study indicated that counseling provided by  examination-qualified counselors, who were obligated to follow the HECM  counseling protocol in effect at the time, typically lasted over 1.5 hours.", "Six of the 15 counselors for our undercover sessions overstated the length  of the counseling sessions on the counseling certificates. All 6 worked for  counseling agencies that received or were eligible to receive HUD HECM  counseling grant funds in 2008. In 3 of these cases, the sessions ranged  from 22 to 30 minutes, but the recorded times ranged from 45 minutes to   1 hour. In a 4th instance, the session lasted about 20 minutes, but the  counselor recorded 30 minutes. These 4 sessions, for which our  undercover counselees were charged customary fees of $75 to $125, were  the shortest we observed and omitted much of the required information,  particularly the discussion of options and various aspects of the financial  implications of a HECM. An intake staff person from 1 of the counseling  agencies told us that the agency\u2019s counselors generally conducted 3 to 4  HECM counseling sessions every 2 hours, and a counselor from this  agency indicated that a session likely would last no more than 10 minutes.  The counselors for the remaining 2 sessions (1 of which was more  comprehensive than many others) also overstated the time on the  certificate, recording the sessions as lasting 2 hours, when 1 lasted   45 minutes and the other 57 minutes.", "For the other 9 sessions, which typically lasted anywhere from about   30 minutes to about 1 hour (see fig. 4), the counselors recorded the entire  length of the session on the counseling certificate and did so in a generally  accurate manner. However, the times they recorded included the amounts  of time they took to obtain and process credit card information and, in  some cases, to read a disclosure statement describing the agency\u2019s  counseling policies. The amounts of time differed by agency, but in one  instance, the noncounseling time totaled about 13 minutes (out of a   39-minute session).

The instructions also stress that the  client should be informed of the fee before receiving counseling, and that  no client should be turned away due to an inability to pay. These  requirements are particularly significant because federal resources  dedicated to fund HECM counseling have been limited and lenders are  prohibited from paying for counseling services. As a result, prospective  HECM borrowers are more likely to pay for the counseling themselves,  either up front or by financing the fee in the mortgage.", "Consistent with HUD requirements, 12 of the 15 counseling agency staff  responsible for charging the fee, whether intake staff or counselors,  informed our undercover counselees of the fee in advance of the session  and charged $125 or less. However, staff at most of the agencies did not  collect the minimum amount of information that HUD requires to perform  the means test. More specifically:    For 4 of the 15 sessions, agency intake staff took the counselee\u2019s credit  card information up front, without obtaining any information about  income and debt obligations, although counselors for 3 of these sessions  later asked for the person\u2019s income but not their debt.

The counselors also indicated  that they could waive the fee if the counselee did not have the ability to  pay. MMI confirmed that this approach was consistent with their screening  policies and noted that should a counselee feel unable to afford the fee,  qualification for a fee waiver would be determined by completion of a debt  and income analysis during the counseling session.

HUD expects to issue  regulations in 2009 that will make compliance with a revised protocol  mandatory for all HECM counselors. The revised protocol, currently in  draft, expands on some of these requirements and requires counselors to  ask a series of questions to determine whether the counselees understand  the essential features of a reverse mortgage.", "The counselors for all of our 15 undercover counseling sessions were  required to follow the protocol because they were HUD Network  Counselors. However, we found significant noncompliance with the  protocol requirements that we previously cited.", "The protocol requires that the information package on financial  implications be sent to the client before or after the counseling session.  Among other things, the package should contain customized information,  including estimates of cash advances that would be available to the  counselee under the different payment options, an estimated TALC  disclosure and estimates of projected loan costs, and a loan amortization  table. However, only 1 of the 15 counselors sent an information package  containing all of the required information (see fig. 5). Additionally, 8  counselors sent our undercover counselees a package that did not contain  any customized information, and 3 others sent only some of the  customized information. Furthermore, although the protocol requires  counseling agencies to offer the client the option of receiving the  information package before the counseling session, our undercover  counselees received no such offer in 13 cases. Of the 2 counseling  agencies that offered to send the package, only 1 actually did so. NFCC  officials told us that sending an information package beforehand is  important, especially before telephone counseling, so that the counselor  and counselee can reference the same documents during the session. Our  evaluation of the packages we received also suggests that the ability to  refer to written material during the counseling session can enhance  counselees\u2019 understanding of HECMs (see fig. 5 and app. III for additional  information).", "The protocol requires that HECM counselors discuss an estimated TALC  disclosure that HECM borrowers must sign at loan closing, but 8  counselors did not describe the disclosure or its implications during the  sessions. The estimated TALC, which shows the average annual costs of a  reverse mortgage at different points in time, is important because it  illustrates that from a cost perspective, reverse mortgages are generally  not a good choice for borrowers who plan on having the loan for only a  few years. However, because the TALC is fairly complex, borrowers could  have difficulty understanding it without assistance. Furthermore, Federal  Reserve officials indicated that this disclosure also allows borrowers to  compare costs across lenders and should be explained at the time of  counseling.", "The protocol also directs counselors to collect specific information about  the client\u2019s needs and goals\u2014such as why the client would like to obtain a  HECM, their financial situation, the condition of their home, and how long  they plan to stay in the home\u2014because these factors can affect the  suitability of a reverse mortgage. While almost all of the counselors asked  why the undercover counselees wanted a reverse mortgage, none asked  for all of the financial information (income, assets, liabilities, and debt)  prescribed in the protocol. Furthermore, although the protocol instructs  counselors to ask if the counselee has any unpaid federal debt (which  would render a person ineligible for a HECM until the debt was paid), 13  did not ask this question. Six counselors did not ask how long the  undercover counselees planned to stay in their homes or if the homes  needed repairs.", "Finally, if counselees indicate that they are considering purchasing an  annuity with their HECM funds, the protocol requires counselors to send  them specific information, including comparisons of the costs and benefits  of HECMs to those for different types of annuities. For 3 different  counseling sessions, our undercover counselees indicated that they were  considering such a purchase. Consistent with the protocol, the  counselors provided information and observations about taking this step,  and 2 of the 3 counselors also sent the required information.

At the time of our fieldwork, HUD\u2019s written instructions  required that the list contain six references, including no fewer than five  HUD-approved counseling agencies in the local area or state (except in  cases in which fewer than five agencies serve a particular state). One of  those agencies had to be located within reasonable driving distance so that  the prospective borrower had the option of receiving face-to-face  counseling. In addition, the list was to include a toll-free telephone number  to reach a network of counselors approved to conduct telephone  counseling nationwide. In March 2009, HUD increased the required  number of references from 6 to 10 and restated the importance of lenders  providing prospective borrowers with such a list.", "Despite HUD\u2019s renewed emphasis on the requirement, HUD officials told  us that they do not have internal control procedures in place to check  lenders\u2019 compliance.

In that situation, HUD would have no  way of knowing what the first lender provided the borrower because there  would be no loan case file from that lender for HUD to examine. However,  the frequency of this situation is unknown, and without a control  procedure, HUD lacks assurance that its referral requirements are being  followed. Furthermore, while some HECM borrowers may obtain a list of  counselors from one lender and get the loan from another, this scenario  does not rule out taking reasonable steps to assess the compliance of the  lender ultimately selected.

Third, HUD lacks  assurance that counseling agencies are consistently applying the means  test for counseling fees, if at all; as a result, financially distressed  individuals who are eligible for fee waivers may be paying for counseling  that they could obtain without a fee. Additionally, HUD lacks detailed  guidance on how to record counseling times and apply the means test,  which may be contributing to counseling providers\u2019 noncompliance in  these areas.

To more specifically identify borrower experiences with HECMs,  we analyzed AARP\u2019s 2006 survey, which included HECM borrowers, and  interviewed 18 borrowers selected at random from among the  approximately 19,000 borrowers who obtained HECMs from fiscal years  2001 through 2003. We selected borrowers from these years to ensure that  borrowers had sufficient experience with the costs and benefits of their  loans. For 16 of the 18 HECM borrowers, we also reviewed information  about the terms of their loans from files that HUD provided to us. (HUD  was not able to locate the other 2 files.) The results of our interviews  cannot be generalized to all HECM borrowers. To obtain additional  viewpoints on the benefits and costs of HECMs, including their risks, we  interviewed representatives from HUD and the HUD Office of Inspector  General; consumer advocates, including AARP, the National Consumer  Law Center, and the National Council on Aging; and an industry group, the  National Reverse Mortgage Lenders Association. To understand how  borrower choices and economic conditions could affect the amount of  home equity that a HECM borrower might have after 10 years, we  constructed scenarios for a hypothetical HECM borrower illustrating  changes in the borrower\u2019s loan balance, house value, and net equity under  different circumstances. Using 2008 as our baseline year, we obtained  information from HUD on the average age of HECM borrowers and the  value of their homes. We used HUD HECM computer software to  determine a HECM loan amount for a borrower with these characteristics.  To illustrate how changing interest and house appreciation rates could  affect the borrower\u2019s remaining home equity over time, we constructed  several scenarios using different assumptions. For example, using data on  historical 1-year Treasury yields and the Federal Housing Finance  Agency\u2019s house price index, we determined the borrower\u2019s remaining  home equity after 10 years if interest and house appreciation rate  assumptions repeated the patterns seen from 1998 through 2007. In  another scenario, we determined how much equity would remain for the  same borrower if interest and house appreciation rates followed IHS  Global Insight\u2019s projections for 2008 through 2017.

We also interviewed officials from these agencies and  obtained information about complaints they received about reverse  mortgages from calendar years 2005 through 2008. These four banking  regulators oversee and examine at least 1 of the 12 largest HECM lenders,  which we define as lenders that originated more than 1,000 HECM loans in  fiscal year 2008, based on HUD data. We also asked these regulators to  provide information about any marketing violations found through  compliance examinations. Finally, through the Conference of State Bank  Supervisors, we sent a set of standardized questions to all of the state  banking regulators, asking if they examine reverse mortgage marketing  materials, have received any complaints about or come across any  misleading reverse mortgage marketing materials, or have taken any  actions against banks or other entities as a result of their reverse mortgage  marketing.

To  understand how the provisions of the HECM protocol might apply, we  interviewed HUD officials and representatives from the two national  intermediaries\u2014MMI and NFCC\u2014that received HECM grant funding from  fiscal years 2006 through 2008.

As a basis for  identifying activities that qualify as internal controls, we consulted GAO\u2019s  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government. To identify  the types of internal controls that HUD applies to the HECM counseling  program, we interviewed HUD headquarters and field staff and obtained  relevant documentation. HUD headquarters staff have responsibility for  general oversight of the grant agreements with the national intermediaries,  and HUD field staff are responsible for conducting on-site performance  reviews of counseling agencies. We interviewed HUD field staff at all four  HUD Home Ownership Centers (HOC), which are located in Atlanta,  Georgia; Denver, Colorado; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and Santa Ana,  California, about the procedures they use to evaluate counseling agency  performance, and obtained relevant documentation. We also interviewed  MMI and NFCC staff to identify what internal controls they have to  maintain the quality of their HECM counseling. To better understand the  nature of these performance evaluations, we reviewed performance  reviews conducted by each HOC for counseling agencies, including those  that conduct high numbers of HECM counseling sessions.", "Third, to determine whether HUD\u2019s internal controls provide reasonable  assurance that counselors comply with HECM counseling requirements,  GAO staff posing as potential HECM borrowers participated in   15 counseling sessions with 11 different counseling agencies during  January and February 2009. For each session, the counselor sent our  undercover counselee a signed counseling certificate that certified  compliance with HUD requirements and recorded the length of the  session. Because HUD estimated that about 90 percent of counseling takes  place by telephone, we conducted the sessions by telephone. While our  findings from the 15 counseling sessions cannot be generalized to all  HECM counseling, the sessions allowed us to test compliance with HECM  counseling requirements. For these sessions, which we recorded to  facilitate our review of counselors\u2019 performance and the length of the  calls, we determined whether counselors covered key topics, particularly  those referenced on the counseling certificate. Our assessment primarily  focused on whether counselors conveyed basic information on these  topics, not whether they covered them exhaustively. We also compared  the time each counselor recorded on the counseling certificate with (1) the  actual length of the session and (2) the amount of time they spent  specifically on counseling.", "These sessions took place with counseling agencies that provided some of  the highest numbers of HECM counseling. Of the counselors we contacted    4 were employed by MMI,    5 were employed by five different agencies affiliated with NFCC, and    6 were employed by five other agencies (three of these agencies also  received HUD grant funding for HECM counseling).", "Since all of the counselors for our undercover sessions had been certified  as HUD Network Counselors and passed the HECM examination, or were  associated with MMI or NFCC, they were all required to comply with  HUD\u2019s 2006 HECM counseling protocol. Accordingly, we also determined  whether the counselors complied with selected elements of the protocol,  such as sending information packages to counselees and discussing an  estimated total annual loan cost disclosure.", "To evaluate how counselors might adapt their presentations on the basis  of the unique situation of prospective borrowers, we created five different  borrower profiles, including borrowers who intended to stay in their house  indefinitely and those who intended to move within a few years. Each  borrower profile included a set of predetermined responses to questions a  counselee might be asked, such as home value, existing debt on home, and  length of time the person planned to stay in the home. The undercover  agents were instructed to indicate that they had little preexisting  knowledge of reverse mortgages, to provide counselors with the  opportunity to speak comprehensively about the program.", "We also evaluated selected aspects of the counselor\u2019s presentation,  including the clarity of terminology, delivery (e.g., the rate of speed at  which the counselors presented the information), and the use of visual  aids (i.e., any information that counselors might have sent prior to the  session). For this purpose, individuals from our Learning Center listened  to the recordings of the sessions and independently evaluated the portion  of the counseling sessions in which counselors presented information on  HECM costs.

We compared the number and type of referrals we received with  HUD\u2019s requirements in effect at the time of our fieldwork. For example,  we identified whether the list of referrals included at least five agencies  that were located in the local area or state. The results of our work cannot  be generalized to all HECM providers.
