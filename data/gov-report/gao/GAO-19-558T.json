For example, GAO recommended that IRS consider comparing individuals' tax returns with the information educational institutions report to verify taxpayers' education tax benefits claims and suggested that Congress require brokers to report to both taxpayers and IRS the adjusted cost of the securities sold by taxpayers.

The federal tax system contains complex rules that may be necessary to appropriately target tax policy goals; however, this can engender errors and lead to underpaid taxes.", "GAO's work has demonstrated that no single approach will fully and cost-effectively address noncompliance since the problem has multiple causes and spans different types of taxes and taxpayers. In light of these challenges, GAO has made numerous recommendations to IRS\u2014some of which have not yet been implemented\u2014such as developing and documenting a strategy that outlines how IRS will use data to update compliance approaches to help address the tax gap.

The most recent data available show that, in  2016, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) estimated an average annual  gross tax gap of $458 billion for tax years 2008 to 2010. IRS estimated  that through late payments and enforcement actions, it will collect an  additional $52 billion annually for tax years 2008 to 2010, resulting in an  average annual net tax gap of $406 billion.", "The tax gap has been a persistent problem for decades, and enforcement  of tax laws has been on our High Risk List since its inception in 1990.  We have previously reported that there are no easy fixes to this problem,  and given persistent levels of noncompliance, reducing the tax gap will  not likely be achieved through a single solution. Rather, the tax gap must  be attacked on multiple fronts with multiple strategies over a sustained  period of time.", "Even modest reductions to the tax gap would yield significant financial  benefits and help improve the government\u2019s fiscal position. For example,  just a 1 percent reduction of the 2008-2010 average annual net tax gap  would have resulted in about $4 billion more in annual revenue for those  years. For illustrative purposes, for fiscal year 2019, this amount of  revenue could fund about 82 percent of IRS\u2019s enforcement budget; the  entire operation of the U.S. Census Bureau; or the combined federal  budgets of the national park system Operations account, Smithsonian  Institution, and the National Archives and Records Administration.", "My testimony today discusses (1) factors contributing to the tax gap and  (2) strategies for reducing the tax gap.

The products cited throughout this  statement include detailed explanations of the methods used to conduct  our work. We conducted the work on which this statement is based in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

Of this amount, IRS  estimated that taxpayers voluntarily and timely paid about 81.7 percent,  or $2.04 trillion, leaving $458 billion in unpaid taxes per year, as shown in  figure 1.", "The tax gap estimate is an aggregate estimate of the five types of taxes  that IRS administers\u2014individual income, corporation income,  employment, estate, and excise taxes. For each tax type, IRS attempts  to estimate the tax gap based on three types of noncompliance:              (1) underreporting of tax liabilities on timely-filed tax returns;                   (2) underpayment of taxes due from timely-filed returns; and (3) nonfiling,  when a taxpayer fails to file a required tax return altogether or on time.", "Underreporting of tax liabilities accounted for most of the tax gap estimate  for tax years 2008 to 2010, making up 84 percent of the entire estimated  gross tax gap, as shown in figure 2.", "Individual income taxes made up the largest portion ($264 billion) of  underreporting. Underreporting of business income accounted for nearly  half ($125 billion) of that amount, as shown in table 1. Business income  underreporting includes income from sole proprietors, which accounted  for the largest share ($78 billion) of individual income tax underreporting.", "IRS uses various approaches to estimate the different components of the  tax gap. A primary source of information IRS uses is its National  Research Program (NRP) study of individual tax returns. Through NRP,  IRS examines a stratified, random sample of tax returns, and uses  statistical modeling to produce estimates of noncompliance for the  population of individual income tax return filers. Other areas of the tax  gap are estimated using payment data or other statistical models. In  2016, IRS completed examinations for an NRP study on employment tax  returns filed from tax years 2008 to 2010. IRS employees reported that  they plan to start analyzing the results by June 2019. However, IRS has  not provided plans for how it will use the results to update the current  state of the employment tax gap estimate, as we previously  recommended. The tax gap includes unintentional errors as well as  intentional evasion, such as intentionally underreporting income,  intentionally overreporting expenses, and engaging in abusive tax  shelters or frivolous tax schemes.", "As we have previously reported, completely closing the tax gap is not  feasible, as it would entail more intrusive enforcement and more  burdensome recordkeeping or reporting than the public is willing to  accept, and more resources than IRS is able to commit. However, even  modest reductions would yield significant financial benefits and help  improve the government\u2019s fiscal position.", "Tax noncompliance, even when unintentional, could discourage compliant  taxpayers and undermines the integrity of the tax system and the public\u2019s  confidence in it. For example, consider two groups of taxpayers with  similar tax situations\u2014those who pay the full amount of tax due and those  who do not. Those who do not pay taxes are not meeting their obligation  to fund government services, which, in effect, shifts the fiscal burden to  those who do pay. Further, IRS devotes resources to attempt to collect  taxes due from noncompliant taxpayers\u2014resources that could be used  for other purposes.", "In addition, noncompliance can create an unfair competitive advantage  among businesses because those that do not pay tax debts are avoiding  costs that tax-compliant businesses are incurring. For example, our past  investigations identified instances in which federal contractors with tax  debts won awards based on price differentials over tax compliant  contractors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Key Factors Contributing to the Tax Gap Include Limited Third-party Information Reporting, Resource Trade-offs, and Complexities in the Tax Code Limited Third-Party Information Reporting", "paragraphs": ["Our past work has found that three important factors contributing to the  tax gap are the extent to which income is reported to IRS by third parties,  IRS\u2019s resource trade-offs, and tax code complexity.", "As we have previously reported, the extent to which individual income tax  taxpayers accurately report their income is closely aligned with the  amount of income that third parties report to them and to IRS. For  example, according to 2008\u20132010 IRS data, taxpayers misreported more  than half of the types of income for which there is little or no third-party  information reporting, such as business income (see figure 3). In contrast,  when employers both withheld taxes from, and reported information on,  wages and salaries to employees and IRS (through Form W-2, Wage and  Tax Statement), taxpayers misreported on only 1 percent of such income.  Similarly, taxpayers misreported less than 10 percent of investment  income that banks and other financial institutions reported to account  holders and IRS (through Forms 1099).", "For items subject to substantial third-party information reporting, IRS is  able to use automated processes to address noncompliance. The  automated underreporter program, through which IRS matches amounts  reported on tax returns with amounts reported on information returns  submitted by third parties, is one such process. This computer matching  program allows IRS to identify discrepancies between tax returns and  information returns, and propose automatic changes to taxpayers. For  items with little to no third-party information reporting, IRS must rely on  more resource-intensive methods, such as correspondence or face-to- face examinations, to address noncompliance. While these examinations  may be started by reviewing specific tax return line items, they may also  be expanded to cover other areas of the tax returns if there are  indications of misreporting in areas of the return not previously identified.  However, it is harder for IRS to detect noncompliance in areas with little  third-party information reporting."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "IRS Resource Trade-offs", "paragraphs": ["IRS\u2019s budget declined by about $2.6 billion (18.8 percent) from fiscal  years 2011 through 2019, and IRS\u2019s budget for fiscal year 2019 is less  than its fiscal year 2000 budget, after adjusting for inflation (see figure  4).", "Since fiscal year 2011, IRS staffing has fallen from 95,544 full-time  equivalent employees to an estimated 75,676 in fiscal year 2019, a 20.8  percent reduction. At the same time, IRS faces increasing responsibilities,  such as implementing relevant aspects of Public Law 115-97, which  included significant changes to corporate and individual tax law. IRS  also faces ever-evolving and significant challenges protecting taxpayer  information, preventing identity theft and fraud, and modernizing an aging  technology infrastructure.", "We previously reported that available staff has been a key factor in IRS  decisions to scale back a number of program activities, such as  examining tax returns, according to IRS officials. Our analysis of IRS  data shows the rate of individual returns audited has declined between  fiscal years 2011 and 2018 (see figure 5).

However, this complexity imposes a wide range of  recordkeeping, planning, computing, and filing requirements upon  taxpayers. For example, taxpayers who receive income from rents, self- employment, and other sources may be required to make complicated  calculations and keep detailed records. This complexity can lead to errors  and underpaid or overpaid taxes. Complexity, and the lack of  transparency that it can create, can also exacerbate doubts about the tax  system\u2019s integrity.", "Tax expenditures\u2014tax credits, deductions, exclusions, exemptions,  deferrals, and preferential tax rates estimated by the Department of the  Treasury to reduce tax revenue by about $1.38 trillion in fiscal year  2018\u2014can add to tax code complexity. In part, this is because taxpayers  must learn about, determine their eligibility for, and choose between tax  expenditures that may have similar purposes. For example, as we  reported in 2012, about 14 percent of filers in 2009 (1.5 million of almost  11 million eligible returns) did not claim an education credit or deduction  for which they appeared eligible.", "The complexity involved with tax expenditures may be acceptable if they  achieve their intended purposes. However, in many cases, their  effectiveness is questionable or unknown. With some exceptions, tax  expenditures generally are not subject to reauthorization and the annual  congressional budget processes. We have recommended greater scrutiny  of tax expenditures since 1994, as periodic reviews could help determine  how well specific tax expenditures achieve their goals, and how their  benefits and costs (including complexity) compare to those of other  programs with similar goals. Such actions would help facilitate oversight  and accountability of tax expenditures more in line with the performance  management and reporting requirements of other federal programs.", "Paid tax return preparers and tax software developers help taxpayers  navigate the complexities of the tax code. However, some paid preparers  may introduce their own mistakes. For example, in a limited study in  2014, we found that seven of 19 preparers who completed returns for our  undercover investigators made errors with substantial tax consequences  while, only two preparers calculated the correct refund amount.

A long-term, quantitative goal for  improving voluntary compliance may provide IRS with a concrete  target the agency can use in fulfilling its mission.
