This process can be subject to human error; consequently, the  OIG is at higher risk of not being able to ensure that employees\u2019 identities  will be protected.", "During fiscal year 2013, according to OIG data provided to us, about 50  percent of the complaints received by the OIG came through the Joint  Intake Center run by CBP and ICE and another 6 percent were received  from other DHS components. The rest of the complaints were received  directly from complainants through the OIG\u2019s website or by e-mail, fax, or  phone. Complaints received through the website (about 15 percent) are  automatically recorded into the OIG\u2019s complaint database, the  Enforcement Data System, while complaints received through all other  means, including those from the Joint Intake Center, must be manually  recorded in the Enforcement Data System.", "Although the transfer of complaint information from the OIG\u2019s website into  the Enforcement Data System is more automated than complaints from  other sources, the website lacks certain controls that could result in the  inadvertent disclosure of employees\u2019 identities. For example, when filing a  complaint on the website, if an employee does not want to allow full  disclosure of his or her identity, an employee can choose to be   (1) anonymous or (2) confidential. However, the website lacks certain  controls over these two categories. For example, see the following:", "The anonymous category is intended to mean that the complainant  does not have to supply any identifying information. To select  anonymous, a complainant can check a box on the website. However,  after complainants make this selection, the website still allows  complainants to provide their names and other personal information,  which could potentially be disclosed.", "The confidential category is intended to mean the employee provides  identifying information but does not want it released outside of the  OIG. If an employee wants confidentiality rather than anonymity, the  employee must write in the request for confidentiality on the website  form because the website does not have a box to check for this type  of complaint. As a result, even though the Enforcement Data System  includes a \u201ccomplaint confidential\u201d box, a request for confidentiality on  the website does not automatically record this request in the  Enforcement Data System. Therefore, requests for confidentiality  depend on the analyst who subsequently reviews the complaint  manually marking the correct box in the system.", "Regardless of how a complaint is received, when a complaint is recorded  in the Enforcement Data System, it is initially reviewed by a complaint  intake analyst who determines if the complaint should be forwarded to a  field office of the OIG Office of Investigations in the complainant\u2019s  jurisdiction. If it is forwarded, an OIG investigator in that office reviews the  complaint and decides whether to open an investigation on it. If the OIG  decides not to investigate the complaint, and the complaint was received  through the Joint Intake Center or another DHS component, a complaint  intake analyst will usually send it back to the component without first  notifying the complainant since the component has already had access to  the complaint information. However, if the complaint was received directly  from an employee rather than through a DHS component (e.g., OIG  website, e-mail, fax, or phone), the intake analyst will send an e-mail to  the employee requesting his or her consent to forward the complaint to  the DHS component. If the employee provides consent, the analyst  forwards the complaint to the component via e-mail. If an employee does  not provide consent, the complaint may still be sent to the component but  without any identifying information. However, there is no secondary check  of this manual process, such as a supervisory review. As a result, the  protection of an employee\u2019s identity depends on the accuracy and  integrity of the individual processing the complaint. Without additional  controls, the OIG could inadvertently disclose employees\u2019 identities  without their consent. Such disclosure can put employees at risk of  retaliation by the DHS components in which they work and could  discourage other employees from filing complaints. Officials in IQO said  that they were aware of these issues and that they were developing  standard operating procedures and considering improvements to the  website and the Enforcement Data System to better protect employees\u2019  identities, but they did not indicate when these would be complete."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OIG Lacks Guidelines for Obtaining Legal Advice", "paragraphs": ["While the OIG has its own Office of Counsel, it sometimes also obtains  advice or discusses legal issues with the department\u2019s counsel.

The manual states  that the AIG for each audit office is responsible for ensuring  implementation of these controls.

For auditors at the director level and below, the  manual requires staff to document their independence biweekly in the  OIG\u2019s Time and Tracking System. For senior executives, including the IG,  Deputy IG, Chief of Staff, AIGs, and others involved in reviewing audit  reports, the manual requires documentation of their independence once a  year when they complete ethics training and financial disclosure forms.  The manual further states that each office will maintain these annual  certifications of independence, but does not require the certifications to be  centrally maintained and monitored for compliance. Procedures for each  of the three audit offices regarding annual certificates varied. For  example, the Office of Audits said that it maintained annual independence  certificates for its division directors as well as senior executives, while the  Office of Emergency Management Oversight only maintained them for its  senior executives (the AIG and Deputy AIG). The Office of Information  Technology Audits said that instead of signing annual certifications, its  senior executives sign independence certifications for every audit they  work on, consistent with procedures for its audit staff. While the audit  offices told us they maintained independence certificates centrally within  each office, the OIG executive office, which consisted of four senior  executives at the time of our audit, indicated that it did not do so. In  response to our February 2014 request for copies of certificates for the  senior executives in the front office, an OIG official gathered certificates  from the individuals. Two of the certificates were signed after we  requested them, and according to the official, a certificate could not be  found for the Acting IG who had recently left the OIG. Similarly, both the  internal quality reviews and peer reviews conducted from 2009 through  2012 identified instances in which employees, including some senior  executives, had not documented their independence in accordance with  the OIG Audit Manual, although these instances were not deemed  significant enough to prevent the audit offices from passing these  reviews.", "If senior officials do not comply with the OIG Audit Manual requirement to  sign annual certificates of independence or maintain them centrally in  order to monitor compliance, they might not be aware of potential threats  to independence or be as familiar with GAGAS or CIGIE independence  requirements as they should be. For example, as a result of an  impairment to the former Acting IG\u2019s independence that was not identified  in a timely manner, several audits and inspections were affected in fiscal  year 2012. Specifically, a total of six reports from the Offices of Audits,  Information Technology Audits, and Inspections were reissued to include  a statement about an impairment of independence in appearance  resulting from a family member of the former Acting IG being employed  by an entity within DHS associated with these audits and inspections. In  addition, because of the same impairment, one other audit was  terminated without a report being issued.

The establishment of IQO is intended to enhance the OIG\u2019s ability to carry  out functions such as complaint intake and whistleblower protection,  including helping to ensure that these functions maintain their  independence.
