For its part, DCAA has conducted few business system audits since 2013, as it focused its efforts on other types of audits. DCAA plans to significantly increase the number of business system audits over the next 4 years, but its success in doing so depends on its ability to shift resources from other audits; to use public accounting firms to conduct other, non-business system audits; and DCAA staff's ability to execute new audit plans in a timely manner.", "DCMA relies on the three offices responsible for conducting DCMA-led reviews to manage the reviews, but DCMA does not formally monitor whether these reviews are being conducted consistent with policy nor does it monitor DCAA's efforts to complete the audits for which it is responsible.

DCMA currently lacks a mechanism based on relevant and reliable information, such as the number of reviews that are outstanding and the resources available to conduct such reviews, to ensure reviews are being completed in a timely fashion.

For example,  an approved accounting system can help prevent contractors from  overcharging or mischarging federal contracts. Federal and defense  acquisition regulations and DOD policy require DOD to take steps to  review the adequacy of these business systems and to ensure that  contractors correct identified deficiencies. These reviews and audits are  conducted primarily by two defense agencies: the Defense Contract  Management Agency (DCMA) and the Defense Contract Audit Agency  (DCAA). DCMA generally has responsibility for approving contractors\u2019  business systems; DCMA and DCAA have specific responsibilities for  reviewing these systems.", "In 2009, the Commission on Wartime Contracting and GAO highlighted  significant concerns about how DOD was conducting CBS reviews at that  time. Congress later enacted Section 893 of the National Defense  Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2011. This provision mandated  that DOD develop a program to improve contractor business systems.

We compared  current steps in the CBS review process to those used by DCMA and  DCAA prior to the Fiscal Year 2011 NDAA to gain a better understanding  of the changes made and discussed those changes with DCMA and  DCAA officials. We also analyzed DCMA and DCAA data to determine  the number of business systems reviewed by either agency from fiscal  years 2015 through 2017\u2014the last three fiscal years for which we could  obtain data for all CBS systems. To determine the reliability of these data,  we interviewed appropriate DCMA and DCAA officials and collected  information on the steps taken by their agencies to ensure data reliability.

To  better understand the process of identifying and resolving system  deficiencies, we selected five contractors that had at least one business  system that had been found to be materially deficient and one contractor  that had not had any material deficiencies identified. We interviewed  representatives from each of the six contractors as well as DCMA officials  responsible for approving the contractor\u2019s business systems.

We  interviewed DCMA and DCAA officials and collected relevant data, such  as DCAA\u2019s planned audits for fiscal years 2019 through 2022, to  understand their approach to prioritizing reviews and the challenges, if  any, in completing the reviews in a timely fashion.", "To determine the extent to which DOD has implemented changes to its  CBS review process in response to the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2017, we  interviewed DOD Defense Pricing and Contracting (DPC) officials  responsible for drafting the proposed regulations.

Where a contract includes these clauses, the  contractor\u2019s business systems generally must meet the criteria. Factors  such as the type of contract and the dollar value determine whether the  clauses are included in a contract (see table 1).", "In certain cases, the absence of an adequate system may preclude the  government from using a particular contract type or may require  additional oversight or analysis. For example, the FAR states that:", "A cost-reimbursement contract may be used only when, among other  things, contractors\u2019 accounting systems are adequate for  determining costs applicable to the contracts or orders; an adequate  accounting system is also required for the use of progress payments.", "Without an approved purchasing system, contractors may require  additional oversight of their subcontracting decisions.", "Significant deficiencies with contractors\u2019 estimating systems shall be  considered during negotiation.

For example:", "The Commission reported that billions of dollars in contingency- contract costs in Iraq and Afghanistan could not be verified by  government auditors and that inadequate internal controls over  contractor business systems hampered the government\u2019s insight into  cost errors and material misstatements. The report highlighted  instances where DCMA and DCAA came to different conclusions  when reviewing the same contracts and had inadequate resources to  complete business system reviews. It also stated that DCMA was not  aggressive in motivating contractors to improve their business  systems because it accepted corrective action plans as sufficient  progress to address deficiencies.

As result,  we made 17 recommendations to DOD to help improve the quality of  DCAA\u2019s audits, most of which the agency has implemented.", "Since then, subsequent GAO and DOD Inspector General (IG) reports  have pointed to other issues with the CBS review process and DCAA\u2019s  incurred cost audit process. Namely,  In November 2011, we found that DCAA could not complete the  number of CBS reviews needed to be consistent with its guidelines  because it was focused on higher priority areas\u2014such as incurred  cost audits\u2014and, as a result, DCMA contracting officers maintained  systems\u2019 determinations as adequate even though the systems had  not been audited by DCAA in a number of years. Among our  recommendations, we proposed that DCMA and DCAA identify  options, such as hiring external auditors, to assist in the conduct of  CBS reviews until DCAA could adequately fulfill those responsibilities  with its own workforce. In July 2014, DOD published a proposal to  change the DFARS to allow public accounting firms to perform  reviews of accounting, estimating, and material management and  accounting systems. According to DPC officials, however, the  department\u2019s IG raised concerns about consistency between the  proposed change and statutory and regulatory requirements for IG  oversight of outside audit services. Further, the private sector  expressed concerns that CBS audit criteria did not align with generally  accepted accounting principles used in the private sector. As result of  these challenges, DOD did not implement the proposed regulation  change.", "In December 2012, we found that DCAA\u2019s backlog of incomplete  incurred cost audits was a contributing factor in DOD\u2019s inability to  close out contracts in a timely manner. To address this backlog,  DCAA began implementing a new, risk-based approach that was  expected to shift DCAA\u2019s resources to focus on incurred cost audits  involving high-dollar value and high risk proposals.", "In October 2015, the DOD IG found that DCMA contracting officers  did not always comply with requirements to report business system  deficiencies and found instances where CBS determinations based on  DCAA-led reviews were not reported within required timeframes. The  IG concluded that this likely caused delays in correcting significant  business system deficiencies and lengthened the time the  government was unable to rely on data generated by those business  systems.", "In September 2017, we found that despite efforts by DCAA to reduce  the backlog of incurred cost proposals awaiting audit, the agency was  not able to meet its goals to eliminate the backlog by fiscal year 2016  and that it was unlikely to meet a revised goal of fiscal year 2018.  We recommended that DCAA assess and implement options for  reducing the length of time to begin incurred cost audits and establish  related performance measures.

It also required that DOD identify those  officials responsible for approval and disapproval of a system, and  that approval or disapproval of a system would be based on whether  the system has a significant deficiency. Further, the law authorized  DOD to withhold up to 10 percent of contract progress payments,  interim payments, and performance-based payments from certain  contracts when systems are disapproved based on a significant  deficiency.

For example:  In one case it took almost 4 years to resolve deficiencies identified in  a contractor\u2019s accounting system. In this case, DCAA issued an audit  report in July 2014 that found seven significant deficiencies including  inadequate monitoring and adjusting of rates the contractor was billing  the government. DCMA subsequently issued an initial determination 7  days later disapproving the system, citing three of the seven  deficiencies identified by DCAA. In August 2014, the contractor  responded by providing a corrective action plan for the three  deficiencies DCMA cited. DCMA sent a second determination letter  the next month citing two additional deficiencies identified by DCAA.  In October, the assigned ACO for the contractor left and new staff was  assigned to the review. Ten days later, the contractor submitted a  second corrective action plan to address the two deficiencies  identified. Disagreement between the ACO and DCAA on the  inclusion of the two remaining deficiencies identified by DCAA for the  accounting system resulted in a need to convene a board of review by  DCMA. The board decided that the two deficiencies would be included  in the final determination. This, in turn, delayed issuance of a final  determination until mid-December 2014. According to contractor  representatives, over the next 3 years, they submitted various  corrective action plans that DCMA determined were inadequate to  address the deficiencies. Each time, the ACO requested additional  information and follow-up DCAA audits to help assess the adequacy  of the contractor\u2019s corrective action plans. Eventually the contractor\u2019s  accounting system was approved in June 2018.", "In another case, a contractor\u2019s estimating system has been  disapproved for over 5 years. In June 2013, DCAA identified four  significant deficiencies in the contractor\u2019s system, including  inadequate support for commerciality determinations. As a result,  following a final determination of inadequacy, DCMA implemented a  payment withhold of 5 percent. In response, the contractor submitted  a corrective action plan in September 2013 addressing the  deficiencies that was accepted by DCMA and the withhold was  reduced to 2 percent. In a follow-up review in July 2014, DCAA  identified two new deficiencies, which the contractor corrected. In  March 2015 DCAA reviewed the contractor\u2019s forward pricing rate  proposal and identified 11 new deficiencies in the estimating system.  By August 2015, the contractor had corrected the new deficiencies but  the system remained disapproved because the previous four  deficiencies remained uncorrected. Finally, in September 2016, DCAA  canceled its audit of the estimating system because these four  deficiencies remained. According to officials, the contractor was not  ready for re-evaluation. At the time of this review the system remains  disapproved.", "In another case, a contractor\u2019s property management system was  disapproved for more than 4 years. In November 2013, DCMA  reviewed the contractor\u2019s property management system and,  according to officials, identified nine significant deficiencies, including  those related to missing records and supporting documentation for all  contracts. DCMA issued an initial determination of disapproval. DCMA  officials stated that they did not receive an adequate response from  the contractor for nearly 7 months, and in June 2014, DCMA issued a  final determination of system disapproval. The contractor  subsequently submitted a corrective action plan in August to address  the deficiencies. A DCMA official stated that they re-analyzed the  system in November 2014 and found one outstanding issue.  According to the official, the DCMA property administrator in charge of  the review elevated the issue to the assigned ACO, but received no  response. According to contractor representatives, they requested a  follow-up review from the DCMA ACO several times from August  2014 to June 2015 but did not receive a response until after June  2015. According to a DCMA official, this was due to resource issues  as the review went dormant because the new ACO assigned to the  contractor went overseas. The system was reviewed again in  November 2017 and the contractor\u2019s system was approved in January  2018.", "In another case, an audit of a contractor\u2019s estimating system took  DCAA 2 years to complete. The DCAA audit began in November  2014. According to contractor representatives, they were initially told  that the review would take 9 to 12 months, but a number of different  DCAA auditors were assigned to the review over time and each  identified different findings which led to a prolonged process. DCMA  approved the contractor\u2019s estimating system in December 2016.", "In another case, a contractor\u2019s estimating system was disapproved for  15 months. In June 2016 DCMA disapproved a contractor\u2019s estimating  system due to three significant deficiencies, including one related to  performing adequate price and cost analysis on subcontractor  proposals. According to contractor representatives, they submitted a  corrective action plan, but after submitting the plan DCAA performed  an audit of the contractor\u2019s forward pricing rates and identified  additional deficiencies. In December 2016 DCMA officials determined  that the corrective action plan the contractor provided was not  sufficient. DCMA subsequently approved the contractor\u2019s estimating  system in September 2017.", "DCMA and DCAA officials believe the cases we analyzed were not  representative of the length of time needed to complete the CBS review  process, but could not provide data to support their views because DCMA  and DCAA do not track data on the length of time it takes to complete the  entire CBS review process (i.e., from the start of an audit or review to the  resolution of system deficiencies and final determination). Our review of  selected cases was not intended to be projectable to all reviews and  audits conducted by DCMA and DCAA, but rather to be illustrative of the  challenges that may be encountered during the review process.", "From the perspective of program and contracting officers, the status of a  contractor\u2019s business system may have an impact on both contract award  decisions and contract monitoring, but officials stated that they can  mitigate the risks associated with a disapproved system. For example,  Army and Air Force program officials noted that a contractor leading  certain weapon system development and logistics efforts had a deficient  cost estimating system. According to the contracting officials, as the  government could not rely on the contractor\u2019s proposed costs to use a  fixed-price contract, they awarded a fixed-price incentive contract for the  program to better monitor the contractor\u2019s cost reporting compared to  under a fixed-price contract."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD Does Not Have a Mechanism to Monitor and Ensure That Contractor Business System Reviews and Audits Are Conducted in a Timely Manner", "paragraphs": ["DCMA and DCAA do not have a mechanism to monitor and ensure that  CBS reviews and audits are conducted in a timely manner. DCAA\u2019s data  show that it conducted few business system audits in the past 6 years,  due, in part, to the need for it to reduce its backlog on completing incurred  cost audits. Looking to the future, DCAA has developed plans for the  number of CBS audits it intends to perform over the next 3 years and  expects that it will be caught up in conducting the audits for which it is  responsible by fiscal year 2022. Successfully executing its plan is  dependent on several factors, including the ability to shift resources from  conducting incurred cost audits to business systems audits, the use of  public accounting firms to perform a portion of the incurred cost audits,  and the ability of DCAA auditors to use new audit plans and complete the  required audits in a timely manner. For its part, DCMA relies on the  offices that perform the reviews of the three systems to maintain the  information on the reviews completed and to plan for future reviews, but  DCMA headquarters does not centrally track its reviews or whether audits  conducted by DCAA are being completed within the timeframes described  in policy."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DCAA Plans to Address Previous Shortfalls in Conducting CBS Audits Are Dependent on Several Factors", "paragraphs": ["DCAA officials acknowledged they have not been able to conduct audits  of contractor business systems within the timeframes outlined in DCMA  instructions. DCAA officials attributed their inability to do so to the need to  conduct higher priority audits\u2014such as incurred cost audits\u2014and staffing  constraints. For example, in fiscal year 2017, DCAA initially proposed to  perform a total of 76 CBS audits for the three business systems in its  purview. However, DCAA completed only nine audits after assessing  available resources. Further, DCAA estimates that in fiscal year 2017 it  spent approximately 44 percent of its resources addressing incurred cost  audits, and 17 percent on other audits such as forward pricing rate  agreements. In contrast, only 6 percent of its resources were devoted to  business system audits and related activities.", "Recognizing that it cannot perform all of the required CBS audits in a  timely fashion to meet current DCMA policy requirements, DCAA officials  told us they focus their audits on business systems they identify as high- risk. To do so, DCAA officials consider factors such as the contractor\u2019s  current system status, the contractor size in terms of dollars on contract,  the amount of cost-type contracts, organizational changes, audit requests  by a DOD contracting officer or an ACO, and the types of deficiencies  identified and its impact on cost and schedule. DCAA headquarters  officials assess the candidates at an annual DCAA planning meeting to  determine which audits can be performed given the level of resources  available. DCAA officials told us, however, that the current policy  requirement\u2014which generally requires review of the systems every three  years\u2014would require DCAA to dedicate substantial resources to CBS  audits to maintain currency. As of November 2018, DCAA identified 285  systems that require an audit. DCAA officials stated that a risk based  approach to reviewing these systems would provide more value than a  routine 3 year cycle. DCAA officials stated they are willing to work with  others within DOD to develop risk factors that can be used to determine  when a business system needs a review.", "To better assess and plan future workload, DCAA issued a memorandum  in January 2017 to introduce a strategic workload resource initiative that  will project workload and resource availability in the out-years. Under this  process, DCAA field management teams provide information on workload  projections in March, and DCAA executive level officials make workload  planning recommendations in June that result in an agency-wide plan.  DCAA officials noted, however, that the projection for the second year is  less accurate, and as a result, the further out year projections are  reviewed every six months with adjustments made as needed. DCAA  officials also told us that the planning process is currently being expanded  to allow the agency to plan three years out. DCAA officials stated that the  fiscal year 2021 plans will be tentatively approved by the end of January  2019 and fiscal year 2022 plans will be approved by June 2019.", "Based on these planning efforts, DCAA plans to conduct a total of 285  CBS audits from fiscal years 2019 through 2022, including 50 audits in  fiscal year 2019 and 104 in fiscal year 2020. It also plans to shift some of  the hours previously devoted to incurred cost audits to CBS audits (see  figure 3).", "Our analysis indicates that successfully executing this plan is dependent  on several factors, including the ability to shift resources from conducting  incurred cost audits to business systems audits, the use of public  accounting firms to perform a portion of the incurred cost audits, and the  ability of DCAA auditors to use new audit plans and complete the required  audits in a timely manner.", "First, the plan is contingent upon DCAA being able to successfully  shift resources from incurred cost audits to CBS audits. According to  DCAA data, DCAA plans to shift more than 378,000 hours from  incurred cost audits to CBS audits between fiscal years 2018 and  2020. DCAA officials noted, however, that although they have made  significant progress in addressing incurred cost audits, the fiscal year  2018 NDAA requires DCAA to have all incurred cost audits performed  within 12 months. DCAA officials noted that this means it will have to  continue to spend significant resources on incurred cost audits in  fiscal year 2019 to meet this legislative requirement.", "Second, DCAA officials stated that these estimates include the  resources that are expected to become available to perform CBS  audits as DCAA starts using public accounting firms to perform  incurred cost audits. In its October 2018 report to Congress on the  progress made to implement Section 803 of the Fiscal Year 2018  NDAA, DCAA estimated that public accounting firms would be able to  perform 100 incurred cost audits per year for 2019 and 2020, which  would then increase to 200 each year for 2021 through 2025. DCAA  further projected, for example, that about 147,500 hours would  become available in 2020 based on the proposed plan to use public  accounting firms. DCAA officials told us they are in the process of  developing a solicitation to contract for these services, which they  anticipate releasing in the spring of 2019.", "Lastly, these plans assume that each audit conducted by DCAA can  be completed within an average number of hours based on the  experiences of the team that developed the revised audit plans  released in 2018. DCAA officials noted that these hours assume that  DCAA audit teams will experience some challenges conducting the  initial set of audits, but will be able to conduct them in fewer hours as  they gain more experience in implementing the new audit plans.  DCAA officials told us that, if successful, this plan will enable it to be  caught up on CBS reviews by 2022."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DCMA Headquarters Makes Limited Use of Data Collected by Functional Offices to Assess the CBS Review Process and does not Monitor DCAA\u2019s Progress In Completing Its Audits", "paragraphs": ["For the DCMA-led reviews, DCMA relies on its functional offices that  perform reviews of their respective systems to monitor the status of CBS  reviews, but does not use the information to ensure that all three reviews  are conducted within the timeframes established under DCMA\u2019s  instructions. The three DCMA functional offices use spreadsheets to  manually track reviews their office has completed, and track data on  when the next review should be scheduled. Each functional office plans  and tracks this data individually. For example,", "The property management functional office identifies the number of  contractor property systems requiring review on a monthly basis, and  tracks its progress in completing these reviews.

In fiscal year 2018, the office  reported completion of 92 percent of the 125 required EVM system  reviews.", "The purchasing functional office uses a rolling process to determine  which systems require a review. To do this, the ACO performs a  required risk assessment every 3 years to identify whether a full  business system review is required and then the purchasing functional  office develops a prioritization plan for the systems flagged for review.  The exact number of reviews conducted in a single year is dependent  upon the risk assessments; however, an official from the purchasing  system functional office estimated that their office is staffed to  complete approximately 125 reviews per year. The official also noted  that they do track to ensure all systems are reviewed in the required  timeframes.", "Officials from the functional offices described to us what information they  provide to senior leadership, but DCMA headquarters does not collect or  use this information to oversee the CBS review process. For example, a  supervisor from the property management functional office told us that the  office reports monthly to their supervisors on the status of their reviews  and whether they are on schedule, which also serves as a method for  requesting additional resources if necessary. EVM system functional  officials told us they report the number of planned and completed reviews  to a DCMA internal website for senior leadership to review, but did not  know what senior leadership does with this information. Purchasing  officials said their office provides monthly reports on the status of reviews  for specific large contractors, and weekly reports of the number of reviews  completed to the agency director and component heads. DCMA  headquarters officials stated that they informally share information with  ACOs in a variety of ways, including quarterly meetings, but headquarters  officials could not provide documentation on how this information is used  to monitor and assess whether CBS reviews were being conducted in  accordance with the policy timeframes.", "Further, DCMA officials indicated that they do not formally monitor  DCAA\u2019s efforts to complete the audits for which DCAA is responsible.  Despite being the agency responsible for issuing the instructions and  whose ACOs are responsible for making final determinations of business  system compliance, DCMA officials indicated that it is not their  responsibility to monitor or assess DCAA\u2019s efforts to complete the reviews  in DCAA\u2019s area of responsibility. DCMA and DCAA officials stated,  however, that they recently began to hold quarterly meetings, during  which time they can discuss CBS issues, including potential revisions to  the criteria and timeframes for conducting CBS reviews. But it is uncertain  what outcomes will come from this or the extent to which this will  contribute to improved management of CBS reviews.", "According to federal standards for internal controls, an agency should use  quality information to help ensure that it achieves its objectives. These  internal controls also state that monitoring activities should be conducted  to ensure that agency objectives are being met. Developing a mechanism  to track and monitor the number of CBS reviews that are outstanding, the  risk level assigned to those systems and the resources available to  conduct such reviews, would help DCMA and DCAA better manage the  CBS review process to ensure that contractor systems that are reviewed  and approved in a timely fashion."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Not Yet Implemented Recent Legislative Provisions to Change the Definition of a Covered Contractor or to Enable the Use of Public Accounting Firms", "paragraphs": ["Section 893 of the Fiscal Year 2017 NDAA amended the CBS provisions  of the Fiscal Year 2011 NDAA by revising the statutory definition of a  covered contractor and by allowing contractors to use registered public  accounting firms to review their business systems in place of DOD\u2019s  review. As of November 2018, DOD had not yet proposed regulations to  implement these legislative changes, and therefore we were unable to  fully evaluate the potential effects of these provisions. The Fiscal Year  2017 NDAA did not provide a specific timeframe for DOD to revise its  regulations, but the Director of the Defense Acquisition Regulation  Council\u2014who is responsible for promulgating proposed and final rule  changes to the DFARS\u2014 tasked her staff to draft a proposed rule by  March 2017. This deadline was subsequently extended to January 23,  2019. In November 2018, Defense Pricing and Contracting (DPC) officials  told us that they now expect to issue the proposed rule for public  comment in the third or fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019.

In  addition, DCMA does not monitor progress of either its functional offices  or of DCAA against the policies that the six systems each be reviewed  generally every 3 years.

Such  information could help inform more strategic oversight to determine  whether the current CBS review process is achieving intended results, or  whether additional changes to the timing of or criteria for conducting CBS  reviews are needed. As the agency that is responsible for issuing the  overarching policies that govern CBS reviews and is ultimately  responsible for approving contractor business systems, DCMA is in the  best position to lead the effort to develop this mechanism.
