The guidance calls for, among other things, CSF reimbursement claims to contain quantifiable information that indicates the incremental nature of support (i.e., above and beyond normal operations), validation that the support or service was provided, and copies of invoices or documentation supporting how the costs were calculated. While Defense generally conducted macro-level analytical reviews called for in its guidance, such as determining whether the cost is less than that which would be incurred by the United States for the same service, for a large number of reimbursement claims Defense did not obtain detailed documentation to verify that claimed costs were valid, actually incurred, or correctly calculated. GAO found that Defense did not consistently apply its existing CSF oversight guidance. For example, as of May 2008, Defense paid over $2 billion in Pakistani reimbursement claims for military activities covering January 2004 through June 2007 without obtaining sufficient information that would enable a third party to recalculate these costs. Furthermore, Defense may have reimbursed costs that (1) were not incremental, (2) were not based on actual activity, or (3) were potentially duplicative. GAO also found that additional oversight controls were needed. For example, there is no guidance for Defense to verify currency conversion rates used by Pakistan, which if performed would enhance Defense's ability to monitor for potential overbillings. Defense's guidance does not specifically task ODRP with attempting to verify Pakistani military support and expenses, despite recognition by Defense officials that such verification is best performed by U.S. officials in Pakistan, who have access to Pakistani officials and information. As such, ODRP did not try to verify Pakistan CSF claims from January 2004 through August 2006. Beginning in September 2006, without any formal guidance or directive to do so from U.S. Central Command or the Defense Comptroller, ODRP began an effort to validate Pakistani military support and expenses. This increased verification effort on the part of ODRP contributed to an increase in the amount of Pakistani government CSF claims disallowed and deferred. Prior to ODRP's increased verification efforts, the average percentage of Pakistani claims disallowed or deferred for January 2004 through August 2006 was a little over 2 percent. In comparison, the average percentage of Pakistani claims disallowed or deferred for September 2006 through February 2007 was 6 percent and for the most recent claims (March 2007 through June 2007) processed in February 2008, was approximately 22 percent. However, ODRP's continued oversight activity is not assured, as Defense had not developed formal guidance delineating how and to what degree ODRP should attempt to verify Pakistani claims for reimbursement. GAO recognizes that Defense may not be able to fully verify every Pakistani claim without the ability to access Pakistani records or do onsite monitoring. However, such ability would enhance CSF oversight."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here to discuss the U.S. Department of Defense\u2019s  (Defense) oversight over Coalition Support Funds (CSF) reimbursed to  Pakistan for its support of U.S. efforts to combat terrorism. My testimony  is based on our concurrently issued report, which focuses on Defense\u2019s  efforts to validate Pakistan\u2019s reimbursement claims and the role of the  Office of Defense Representative to Pakistan (ODRP). Following the  attacks of September 11, 2001, the United States began reimbursing  coalition partners for their logistical and combat support of U.S. military  operations in the global war on terror. CSF has reimbursed 27 coalition  allies for their incremental costs (i.e., costs above and beyond the partner  country\u2019s normal operating costs) incurred in direct support of U.S.  military operations. Pakistan is the largest recipient of CSF payments,  having received $5.56 billion (81 percent) of the $6.88 billion total CSF  reimbursements made as of May 2008.", "My testimony today focuses on (1) the extent to which Defense has  consistently applied its guidance to validate the reimbursements claimed  by Pakistan and (2) how ODRP\u2019s role has changed over time. Over the  course of our work, we reviewed and analyzed information on the CSF  oversight process, including Pakistani government reimbursement claims.  In addition, we interviewed officials at the Undersecretary of Defense for  Comptroller (Comptroller), the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense  for Policy, U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) in Tampa, Florida, ODRP,  and the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs. ODRP  memos, CENTCOM validation memos, Comptroller evaluations, and other  CSF documentation from February 2002 through February 2008 (February  2008 was when the latest claim, for March through June 2007, was  reimbursed). To assess the application of current CSF guidance, we  examined the CSF oversight documentation referenced above from  January 2004 through February 2008. We chose this timeframe because a  previous Defense Inspector General report had already examined the pre- January 2004 CSF oversight controls and made recommendations to  improve oversight. We evaluated these controls against all available  Comptroller criteria and guidance, as well as internal control standards  and general cost accounting criteria for adequacy, eligibility, and  reasonableness. As part of our data reliability process, we confirmed that  the data provided by the Comptroller were accurately recorded in the  software we used to analyze the data. To assess the oversight role played  by ODRP, we met with the relevant ODRP, CENTCOM and Comptroller  officials, as well as with other officials from the U.S. Embassy, and  Pakistan\u2019s Ministries of Defense and Interior. We visited Peshawar, near  the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), to discuss operations  being reimbursed with CSF funds with the U.S. consulate, Pakistan\u2019s 11th  Army Corps, and Frontier Corps.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2007 through June  2008 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

This  funding became known as Coalition Support Funds.", "To provide Defense with maximum flexibility, Congress passed the  Defense Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2002 granting the Secretary of  Defense the authority to make CSF payments notwithstanding any other  provision of law in such amounts as the Secretary may determine in his  discretion, based on documentation determined by the Secretary to  adequately account for the logistical and military support provided by  partner nations.

The 2003 guidance notes that Congress provided the Secretary of Defense  with the authority to determine how much to reimburse partner countries,  and how much documentation was needed to adequately account for the  support provided. However, the guidance also stated that CENTCOM and  the Comptroller are to obtain sufficient documentation to validate that  Pakistani military support had been provided and that costs were incurred,  reasonable, and appropriate under the CSF program.", "Under the December 2003 guidance and oversight process, Pakistan would  first submit its claim to ODRP at the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad, which  would assist the Pakistani military in formulating the claim before sending  it to CENTCOM in Tampa, Florida. CENTCOM would then conduct its own  review in an attempt to link claimed expenses to U.S. military operations  before forwarding the claim package to the Comptroller. Under this  process, ODRP and CENTCOM staff can make recommendations to defer  or disallow costs based on their analysis of the Pakistan submission;  however, the Comptroller makes the final recommendation to the  Secretary of Defense on which costs should be paid, deferred, or  disallowed. The Department of State, the Office of Management and  Budget, and Congress also have a role in the CSF oversight process after  the Comptroller has finished its review. The CSF process and guidance is  detailed in Figure 2.", "In July 2006, the Comptroller provided the Pakistani government with a  cost template and information intended to clarify the types of costs that  were reimbursable under CSF and the information the Comptroller needed  to support Pakistan\u2019s reimbursement claims."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Defense Did Not Consistently Apply Its Existing Guidance, and Additional Procedures Are Needed to Ensure Accountability over CSF to Pakistan", "paragraphs": ["We found that Defense did not consistently apply existing CSF guidance  and that certain deficiencies existed in their oversight procedures.

Defense guidance developed by the Comptroller also calls  for obtaining sufficient information to validate Pakistani claims to  determine that costs were incurred, reasonable, and appropriate.  However, Defense did not fully implement this criteria. For example,  Defense reimbursed Pakistan over $2 billion for claims from January 2004  through June 2007 without obtaining detailed documentation that would  allow a third party to recalculate the costs. In addition, Defense often did  not adequately document the basis for their decisions to allow or disallow  claims, and we found inconsistencies in Defense payments that were not  explained.

We also found that additional oversight controls were needed. Specifically,  while Comptroller guidance calls for a historical comparison of claimed  costs, the guidance does not indicate why or how the comparison should  be performed.

Defense reimbursed Pakistan  more than $2.2 billion, or 76 percent, of Pakistani army claims from  January 2004 through June 2007, without obtaining sufficient information  to support how the costs were calculated. In addition, the lack of  documentation led to inconsistencies in Defense\u2019s reimbursement of  certain costs. For example, as illustrated in figure 3, Defense paid  Pakistani navy claimed costs for boats for about half of the months and  disallowed them the other half, despite no discernable differences in the  level of documentation the Pakistani government provided for the claims.", "We also identified additional inconsistently reimbursed costs, such as  bulletproof jackets and telephone cables."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Defense Paid Costs That May Not Have Been Incremental", "paragraphs": ["Comptroller guidance states that reimbursement claims must clearly  indicate the incremental nature of the logistical and military support  provided\u2014i.e., that claimed costs are above and beyond the partner  country\u2019s normal operating costs.

From January  2004 through February 2007, Defense paid Pakistan more than $200 million  in radar expenses. However, the next month ODRP recommended the  Comptroller disallow the costs. ODRP reasoned that Pakistan\u2019s use of the  radar was not related to U.S. efforts to combat terrorism in the region, as  terrorists in the FATA did not have air attack capability. The Comptroller  took the position that Pakistan likely incurred some increased costs  related to U.S. efforts to combat terror in the region\u2014for example, by  providing air traffic control for U.S. military support flights into  Afghanistan.

These include costs associated with  construction, food, and vehicle maintenance. For example, Defense paid  Pakistan more than $30 million for army road construction and over $15  million for army bunker construction before concerns about the validity  of these charges led ODRP to ask the Pakistani military for the coordinates  of the roads and bunkers to verify their existence.", "We also found large unexplained differences between the average costs of  food per person for each force, as shown in figure 4.", "As the figure above shows, navy monthly food costs per person were  generally higher than monthly air force and army food costs per person.  From June 2005, navy claims for food rapidly increased from  approximately $445 per sailor to $800 per sailor in December 2005, while  air force and army food costs per person remained stable. Despite these  anomalies, Defense continued to pay the navy $800 per sailor for food until  September 2006, when the Comptroller began to question these costs.", "We also found Defense paid the Pakistani navy more than $1.5 million in  possibly inflated costs for damage to navy vehicles.

Despite this lack of  detail, we found that Defense paid the Pakistani navy an average of over  $19,000 per vehicle per month (more than $3.7 million per year) to  operate, maintain, and repair a fleet of fewer than 20 passenger vehicles  without sufficient information to determine that these costs were not  duplicative.", "An official at ODRP with a role in reviewing CSF reimbursement claims  stated that, based on the scarce details provided in the CSF claims, it was  it was nearly impossible to know the actual cost of claimed items. When  we discussed this issue with officials at the Comptroller\u2019s office, they  indicated that the Pakistani claims do not provide enough detail to explain  the context of the costs.

For  example, Defense paid the army\u2019s largest cost claimed in April 2006,  which experienced a 12 percent ($2.8 million) increase from March,  without investigating this fluctuation. As a result, Defense may be paying  for costs based on activities that did not occur.", "In addition, we found that CSF guidance does not require Defense to  evaluate the exchange rates used to convert claimed costs from Pakistani  rupees into U.S. dollars, and as a result, potential overbillings may have  gone undetected. Since January 2004, the Pakistani rupee has declined  over 6 percent against the U.S. dollar. Consequently, fewer dollars should  have, over time, purchased more rupees, resulting in a lower cost to the  CSF program. For one cost category we reviewed, Defense may have  overpaid more than $1.25 million over 12 months because it did not  consider the currency conversion used to calculate the cost. Figure 5  illustrates the results of our analysis and shows that CSF would have been  billed fewer dollars had International Monetary Fund (IMF) exchange  rates been used.", "If the rupee continues to decline against the dollar, future Pakistani claims  calculated using a fixed exchange rate will become more and more  inflated over time."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "ODRP Began Playing a Larger Role in the CSF Oversight Process in Late 2006; However, ODRP\u2019s Continued Oversight Is Not Assured", "paragraphs": ["Defense\u2019s 2003 guidance did not specifically task ODRP with attempting to  verify Pakistani military support and expenses, despite recognition by  Defense officials that such verification is best performed by U.S. officials  in Pakistan, who have direct access to Pakistani officials and information.

ODRP found that, despite $55 million in Defense reimbursements to  Pakistan for helicopter maintenance, only a few of these helicopters were  fully operational. According to ODRP officials, the Pakistani army was  not maintaining the helicopters, causing essential systems to malfunction.  Given the poor readiness rates, ODRP recommended that the Comptroller  defer payment on Pakistan\u2019s helicopter maintenance claims until a process  could be implemented to ensure that Pakistan could maintain its  helicopter fleet.

Defense had concerns about the accuracy of Pakistan\u2019s claims  from the very first claim submitted in 2001. Based on the lack of  supporting evidence in the Pakistani claims from January 2004 through  June 2007 (the latest claims reimbursed by Defense), we found that neither  Defense nor we could determine if Pakistan had actually incurred most of  the costs in their clams.

While we recognize that CSF is used to support 27  countries in fighting terrorism, the fact that Pakistan receives 81 percent  of these funds indicates that Defense should provide oversight procedures  that reflect the role Pakistan plays as both the major recipient of CSF and  its role in supporting U.S. national security objectives in Pakistan and  Afghanistan. Additionally we recognize that Defense may not be able to  fully verify all Pakistani claims without having the ability to access the  Pakistani government\u2019s records and make site visits or conduct spot  checks.
