The interoperability issues that the nation faces today did not arise overnight and they will not be successfully addressed overnight. Federal, state, and local governments face several major challenges in addressing interoperability in their wireless communications. The first challenge is to clearly identify and define the problem. For example, it is important to recognize that interoperable communications is not an end in itself, but it is rather one component for achieving an important goal--the ability to respond effectively to and mitigate incidents that require the coordinated actions of first responders. The second challenge is whether and how to establish national interoperability performance goals and standards and balance them with the flexibility needed to address differences in state, regional and local needs and conditions. The third challenge is defining the roles of federal, state, and local governments and other entities in defining the problem, implementing any national goals and standards, and assessing alternative means of achieving those goals and standards. The fundamental barrier to successfully addressing these challenges has been the lack of effective, collaborative, interdisciplinary and intergovernmental planning.

These  events could encompass a wide range of possibilities, such as multi- vehicle accidents, major floods or wildfires, or a terrorist attack that  involved thousands of injuries.", "Interoperable communications is also but one component, although an  important one, of an effective incident command planning and operations  structure. As a standard practice, public safety agencies are to establish  communications capabilities to support command and control of their  operations at an incident scene. Determining the most appropriate means  of achieving interoperable communications must flow from an effective  planning and operations structure that identifies who is in charge and who  must be able to communicate what information to whom under what  circumstances.

Both studies describe most local public safety  agencies as interacting with other local agencies on a daily or weekly  basis. As a result, most local agencies had more confidence in establishing  radio links with one another than with state agencies, with whom they less  frequently interact. Local public safety agencies interact with federal  agencies least of all, with a smaller percentage of local agencies  expressing confidence in their ability to establish radio links with federal  agencies.

AGILE is the Department of  Justice program to assist state and local law enforcement agencies to  effectively and efficiently communicate with one another across agency  and jurisdictional boundaries. It is dedicated to studying interoperability  options and advising state and local law enforcement, fire fighters, and  emergency technicians. The SAFECOM program director also said most of  the federal research and development on prototypes is being conducted  within the AGILE program. The Department of Justice said it is also  creating a database for all federal grants to provide a single source of  information for states and localities to access, and to allow federal  agencies to coordinate federal funding awards to state and local agencies.  SAFECOM and AGILE officials told us they have an informal, but close  working relationship today, and that they are negotiating a memorandum  of understanding between the two programs. Federal officials also told us  that efforts are also under way by SAFECOM, AGILE, and other federal  agencies to coordinate work on technical assistance to state and local  governments and to develop and set interoperability standards.

The National Governors\u2019  Guide to Emergency Management noted that extensive coordination will  be required between the FCC and the National Telecomunications and  Information Agency (NTIA) to provide adequate spectrum and to enhance  shared local, state, and federal communications. However, the current  legal framework for domestic spectrum management is divided between  the NTIA within the Department of Commerce, which regulates federal  government spectrum use, and the Federal Communications Commission,  which regulates state, local, and other nonfederal spectrum use. In a  September 2002 report on spectrum management and coordination, GAO  found that FCC\u2019s and NTIA\u2019s efforts to manage their respective areas of  responsibility were not guided by a national spectrum strategy. The FCC  and the NTIA have conducted independent spectrum planning efforts and  have recently taken steps to improve coordination, but they have not yet  implemented long-standing congressional directives to conduct joint,  national spectrum planning. We recommended that the FCC and the NTIA  develop a strategy for establishing a clearly defined national spectrum  plan and submit a report to the appropriate congressional committees.
