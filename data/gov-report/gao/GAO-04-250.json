Many participants agreed that attaining agricultural reform was essential to making progress on other issues. However, ministers disagreed on how each nation would cut tariffs and subsidies. Key countries rejected as inadequate proposed U.S. and European Union reductions in subsidies, but the U.S. and EU felt key developing nations were not contributing to reform by agreeing to open their markets. Ministers did not assuage West African nations' concerns about disruption in world cotton markets: The United States and others saw requests for compensation as inappropriate and tied subsidy cuts to attaining longer-term agricultural reform. Unconvinced of the benefits, many developing countries resisted new subjects--particularly investment and competition (antitrust) policy. Lowering tariffs to nonagricultural goods offered promise of increasing trade for both developed and developing countries, but still divided them. Services and special treatment engendered less confrontation, but still did not progress in the absence of the compromises that were required to achieve a satisfactory balance among the WTO's large and increasingly diverse membership. Several other factors contributed to the impasse at Cancun. Among them were a complex conference agenda; no agreed-upon starting point for the talks; a large number of participants, with shifting alliances; competing visions of the talks' goals; and North-South tensions that made it difficult to bridge wide divergences on issues. WTO decision-making procedures proved unable to build the consensus required to attain agreement.

The WTO General Council, made up of  representatives from all WTO members, implements decisions that  members adopt in between ministerial conferences.

The  Doha Round is the first round of global trade negotiations since the  conclusion of the Uruguay Round in 1994. The Doha Declaration sets forth  a work program for the negotiations on agriculture, services,  nonagricultural market access, and other issues. In addition, the work  program emphasizes the development benefits of trade and the need to  provide assistance to developing countries to help them take advantage of  these benefits. The Doha Declaration also sets forth a structure and series  of interim deadlines for the negotiations. Specifically, it established a Trade  Negotiations Committee (TNC) open to representatives from all WTO  members to oversee the negotiations, as well as several subsidiary bodies.  In addition, it laid out several deadlines and other milestones through the  next ministerial conference by which time negotiators were to make  decisions on issues under negotiation. In the months following Doha, WTO  members agreed that the next ministerial conference would occur in  Cancun, Mexico, in September 2003. Figure 1 presents key milestones  through the Cancun Ministerial Conference.", "The Doha Declaration also set several general goals for the next (Cancun)  ministerial conference, namely, to take stock of progress at midpoint of the  Doha negotiations, to provide necessary political guidance, and to make  decisions as necessary. However, at their fifth ministerial conference held  in Cancun, Mexico, from September 10 to 14, 2003, WTO ministers were  neither able to achieve these goals nor bridge wide differences on  individual negotiating issues.

On the symbolic level, several WTO officials we met prior to the meeting  noted that the Cancun Ministerial Conference might be a means to regain  the momentum needed to bring the Doha Round to a successful  conclusion. The Doha Round promised to be the most comprehensive  round of global trade negotiations yet, involving a commitment to further  liberalize trade, update trade rules, and further integrate developing  countries into the world economy. The Cancun Ministerial Conference  occurred at roughly the midpoint in the 3-year negotiations. However,  based on our meetings with country delegations and WTO officials in  Geneva and public statements by WTO officials, on the eve of the  ministerial there was a sense true negotiations had not really begun. In  particular, although WTO member governments had succeeded in actively  submitting and discussing many proposals to achieve the general goals laid  out at Doha, they had been less successful in narrowing their differences  on these proposals or coming up with workable plans for developing  specific national commitments (or schedules) to lower trade barriers.", "WTO members held differing views on the symbolic importance of the  Cancun Ministerial Conference. For instance, U.S. and some other member  country officials, as well as WTO officials, expressed hope that the Cancun  Ministerial Conference would create the political will to achieve a  meaningful and ambitious agreement by the deadline that would benefit all  participants. WTO officials we spoke with, for example, stressed that  Cancun needed to provide a \u201cboost\u201d of fresh momentum to the flagging  talks. Other members planned to use the meeting to focus on the centrality  of agriculture reform. However, some members downplayed the symbolic  importance of the ministerial and viewed it merely as an opportunity to  take a mid-point assessment of the negotiations.", "At a practical level, Cancun was viewed as critical to provide negotiators  with direction in key areas that had thus far eluded consensus, according  to WTO and member country officials. With just 16 months before the  agreed-upon deadline of January 1, 2005, for concluding the negotiations,  working-level progress in resolving outstanding issues was effectively  stalled.

As late as July 2003, observers and participants in  the negotiations noted that WTO members were simply restating long-held  positions on key issues and had yet to engage in real negotiations. For  instance, in July 2003, the WTO Director General said that negotiators had  been waiting to see what others are willing to offer without showing  flexibility themselves. The chairmen of some of the negotiating groups  repeated this sentiment in their statements to the July meeting of the Trade  Negotiations Committee. (See app. II for a discussion of significant events  in the WTO negotiations before and during the Cancun Ministerial  Conference.)", "A key factor hindering the progress of Doha Round talks had been the pace  and extent of reform of the EU\u2019s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).  Agriculture was considered by many WTO members to be a linchpin to  achieving progress in all other areas of the Doha negotiating agenda. After  considerable internal debate, on June 26, 2003, the EU agreed to CAP  reform. Among other things, the reform would ensure that for many  agricultural products, the amount of subsidy payments made to farmers  would be independent from the amount they produce. Yet even after the  EU CAP reform was announced, other members stated that they were still  waiting to see the EU\u2019s internal reform translated into a significantly more  ambitious WTO negotiating proposal. The EU resisted making a new WTO  proposal, arguing that in effect it was being forced to pay for reform twice  by reforming its internal policy once and then being asked by WTO  negotiators to reform again to be able to conclude an agreement.", "Another factor hindering overall progress was perceived linkages between  various negotiating topics.The Doha Round\u2019s outcome is to be a \u201csingle  undertaking,\u201d meaning a package deal involving results on the full range of  issues under negotiation such as agriculture, services, and nonagricultural  market access. As a result, trade-offs are expected to occur among issues  to accomplish an overall balance satisfactory to all members. Thus, it is  difficult to make progress on one issue without achieving progress on other  issues. For example, many developing nations consider agriculture their  number one priority and have been unwilling to make offers to open up  their services markets until they see more progress on agricultural reform.  On the other hand, the EU and Japan, who expect to make concessions on  agriculture, wanted a commitment at Cancun to begin negotiations on  several issues that were new to the trading system--investment,  competition (antitrust), government procurement, and trade facilitation\u2014 which are collectively known as Singapore issues.", "By our mid-July meetings in Geneva it was clear that expectations for  Cancun were being scaled back because of the overall lack of progress.  Instead of issuing \u201cmodalities,\u201d (numerical targets, timetables, formulas,  and guidelines for countries\u2019 commitments), for example, WTO officials  and country representatives we met with suggested that \u201cframeworks,\u201d or  more general guidance on what types of concessions each participant  would make, might be a more appropriate goal for Cancun. In other words,  instead of ministers agreeing on some specific target, such as \u201call nations  will cut tariffs by one-third,\u201d they would agree to something more general,  such as all nations are expected to cut tariffs by a certain method and with  the following kinds of results (e.g., substantially liberalizing trade and  reducing particularly high tariffs)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Real Negotiations Finally Began in the Weeks Just Before the Cancun Ministerial", "paragraphs": ["The negotiations began to make some progress at the end of July, when  trade ministers from a diverse group of approximately 30 WTO members  met in Montreal, Canada, to discuss the status of the negotiations.

The United States and the  European Union agreed to do so, and in August they presented a joint  framework on agriculture.", "In addition, in late August, the General Council removed a potential  obstacle to progress at the Cancun ministerial by approving an agreement  involving implementation of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of  Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) and public health declaration adopted  in Doha. The Doha TRIPS and public health declaration directed WTO  members to find a way for members with insufficient pharmaceutical  manufacturing capacity to effectively use the flexibilities in TRIPS to  acquire pharmaceuticals to combat public health crises. U.S. and WTO  officials and representatives from other WTO members we met with had  identified this as an important symbolic issue for the WTO as an institution,  especially for WTO members from Africa.

The Doha Declaration calls for negotiations to achieve fundamental  agricultural reform through three \u201cpillars\u201d or types of disciplines (rules):  (1) substantially improving market access; (2) reducing, with a view to  phasing out, all forms of export subsidies (export competition); and (3)  substantially reducing trade-distorting domestic support (subsidies).  Additionally, the declaration imposed two interim deadlines on WTO  agriculture negotiators: a March 31, 2003, deadline for establishing  modalities (rules and guidelines for subsequent negotiations), and a  deadline to submit draft tariff and subsidy reduction commitments at the  Cancun meeting. Negotiators missed both deadlines. As a result, the goal  for the Cancun ministerial was to adopt a framework and set new deadlines  for subsequent work on the three main pillars of the agriculture  negotiations. The delay in EU CAP reform, as well as the 2002 U.S. Farm  Bill, which was projected to increase U.S. agricultural support spending  complicated resolution of these issues. Many WTO members felt this bill  undermined the relatively bold negotiating stance the United States  assumed in the WTO, which called for making substantial reductions in  trade-distorting domestic support and tariffs.", "Various countries or groups of countries differ in their objectives for the  agriculture negotiations. The Cairns Group of net agriculture exporting  countries and the United States envisioned an ambitious agricultural  liberalization agenda. The United States proposed a two-phase process to  reform agriculture trade in the WTO. The first phase of the proposal would  eliminate export subsidies and reduce and harmonize tariff and trade- distorting domestic support levels over a five-year period. The second  phase of the proposal is the eventual elimination of all tariffs and trade- distorting domestic support. Other developed country members such as the  EU, Japan, Korea, and Norway favored a more limited agenda. This group  and several other small developed countries argued for flexibility to  maintain higher tariffs in order to protect their domestic agriculture  production. Finally, many developing countries wanted a reduction in  developed country agriculture subsidies and market access barriers while,  at the same time, wanting less ambitious obligations to liberalize their own  market access barriers."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Differences on Agricultural \u201cPillars\u201d Remained Wide", "paragraphs": ["Domestic support. Arguing that such programs resulted in lower world  prices and displacement of their producers from global markets, many  developing countries forcefully pressed the developed countries to make  significant cuts to their trade-distorting domestic support programs,  particularly the United States and the European Union, which in 1999  totaled $16.9 billion and 47.9 billion euros ($45 billion at 1999 exchange  rates), respectively. Although they agreed in principle on the desirability  of reducing trade-distorting subsidies, both the United States and the  European Union resisted further disciplines on their abilities to support  domestic agriculture in ways that present WTO rules consider to be non-  trade distorting. For example, they opposed calls to cap and reduce  subsidies that are not currently subject to spending limits under the WTO.  The EU argued that its CAP reform already addressed developing country  demands by making domestic support payments independent of  production, in principle making the payments less trade distorting, even  though total expenditures will not be lowered. However, several WTO  members indicated that the reforms were not ambitious enough. In  addition, the United States said that it would not reduce its domestic  support for agriculture unless other members, namely the EU, made cuts  that substantially reduced the wide disparities in allowed trade-distorting  domestic support. The United States also demanded that developing  countries provide something in return for cutting subsidies, such as  lowering their tariffs on U.S. exports.", "Market access. The United States viewed attaining additional market  access as an important objective in the negotiations. U.S. and Cairns Group  negotiators proposed a harmonizing formula for tariff reduction known as  the Swiss formula that would subject the higher tariffs to larger cuts. Other  members, including the EU, Japan, and Korea, favored an across-the-board  average cut and a minimum cut per product (tariff line). As illustrated in  figure 2, this approach would generally result in less liberalization than if  the harmonizing formula were used. Many developing countries, and the  Cairns Group, proposed substantially less liberalizing developing country  tariff reductions, in part to counter continued use of subsidies in developed  countries. Finally, according to their official statements, numerous smaller  developing countries emphasized the importance of trade preferences to,  and the negative effects that erosion of trade preferences would have on,  smaller, more vulnerable economies.", "Export competition. The United States, the Cairns Group, and many  developing countries wanted to eliminate export subsidies for agricultural  products. The EU, the primary employer of export subsidies, envisioned a  substantial reduction and elimination of export subsidies for certain  products but not a total elimination. It also tied any cuts in export subsidies  to the adoption of stricter disciplines on U.S. food aid and export credits.", "Like the United States, the EU also sought stricter disciplines on export  state-trading enterprises.", "As previously noted, the United States and the European Union had  responded to calls to provide leadership by narrowing their differences on  the three pillars of agricultural reform before the Cancun meeting. In a mid- August framework, the U.S. and the EU proposed reductions in trade- distorting domestic agricultural support, with those members with higher  subsidies making deeper cuts and a three-pronged strategy to reduce  agricultural tariffs. With respect to export subsidies, the framework  eliminated export subsidies for some agricultural products and committed  members to reduce budgetary and quantity allowances for others. Reaction  to the framework was negative and swift, in part because it implied less  ambitious reductions in domestic support and market access barriers  than the original U.S. proposal, which U.S. officials emphasize is still on the  table, and did not completely eliminate export subsidies. For example,  within a week a newly formed group of developing countries, commonly  referred to as the Group of 20 (G-20) for its 20 members, presented a  counter framework that implied deeper cuts in domestic agricultural  subsidies by developed countries, a tariff reduction formula that allowed  developing countries to make less substantial cuts, and the total  elimination of export subsidies. The draft ministerial declaration presented  to ministers in late August contained elements of both proposals.", "Although extensive discussions on agriculture did occur at Cancun, they  ultimately failed to bridge the substantial gaps that remained. Sharp  divisions remained on the extent to which the developing countries should  be required to open their markets and whether it was possible to eliminate  all export subsidies. On domestic support, divisions remained concerning  the extent of cuts in trade-distorting domestic support and the question of  whether additional disciplines on non trade-distorting support were  desirable. Furthermore, the prominence of the G-20 of developing  countries relative to the more diverse Cairns Group at the meeting imposed  a North-South dynamic on the agriculture negotiations. Specifically, several  developed countries criticized the G-20\u2019s negotiating tactics, including their  failure to offer market access concessions such as tariff cuts in exchange  for substantial cuts in developed country subsidies and their demands for a  long list of changes to the Conference Chairman\u2019s draft text, even though  very little time remained to negotiate. Meanwhile, representatives from the  G-20 argued that the developed country proposals and framework offered  very modest gains and maybe even some steps backward in efforts to  liberalize world agricultural trade."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cotton Issues Involved Subsidy Elimination and Compensation", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the three main agricultural pillars that were the agreed focus  of the Doha agriculture negotiations, the Sectoral Initiative in Favour of  Cotton put forward by four West and Central African countries figured  prominently in the Cancun ministerial discussions. The initiative was  added to the ministerial agenda in the weeks leading up to Cancun and  does not appear in the Doha Declaration. The proposal by these cotton  exporting countries singled out three WTO members--the United States, the  European Union, and China--as the primary cotton subsidizers. They  claimed that these subsidies were driving down world prices and that many  of their farmers no longer found it profitable to produce cotton, a concern  given their contention that cotton plays an essential role in their  development and poverty reduction efforts.", "The cotton initiative\u2019s guidelines called for immediately establishing a  mechanism at Cancun to eliminate all subsidies on cotton and a transitional  mechanism to compensate farmers in cotton-producing least developed  countries (LDC) that suffered losses in export revenue as a result of cotton  subsidies. Specifically, the proposal called for reducing all cotton support  measures by one third annually for 3 years, thereby eliminating all support  for cotton by year-end 2006. In addition, the proposal stipulated that any  cotton-subsidizing WTO member would be a potential contributor to a  proposed transitional compensation mechanism. The transitional  compensation mechanism would last up to 3 years. The sectoral initiative  did not specify the total amount of compensation to be paid but cited a  recent study that the direct and indirect losses for the 3 years\u20141999 to  2002\u2014were $250 million and $1 billion, respectively, for the countries of  West and Central Africa.", "The cotton initiative was discussed at length in Cancun; however, there was  no resolution. The reason for the failure was that certain members had  difficulty supporting a transitional compensation mechanism within the  context of the WTO and saw the issue of cotton as hard to separate from  the larger agricultural agenda. U.S. efforts to respond to the region\u2019s  immediate concerns on cotton by broadening the original initiative made  little headway, despite some evidence that falling world cotton prices were  also attributable to other factors such as competition from manmade  fibers. The failure to resolve the cotton initiative to the satisfaction of the  developing countries had a negative impact on the overall tone of the  Cancun meeting, because certain developing countries viewed the issue as  a litmus test for the WTO and thought the proposed response fell far short  of addressing their pressing needs. The issue also took on symbolic  importance, becoming a political rallying point for a number of countries\u2019  frustrations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Singapore Issues Remained Contentious", "paragraphs": ["The Doha Declaration established a deadline for deciding how to handle  negotiations aimed at adding four new issues, called the Singapore issues,  to the global trading system. The four Singapore issues are investment,  competition (antitrust), transparency (openness) in government  procurement, and trade facilitation (easing cross-border movement of  goods). According to the draft ministerial text presented to ministers  before Cancun, ministers were to decide by explicit consensus the basis for  starting actual negotiations on these issues, or to continue exploratory  discussions on them.   However, the wording of the Doha Declaration left  unclear what was to specifically occur in Cancun. Certain members  thought the declaration implied that formal negotiations were to begin in  Cancun and that the only issue for Cancun was the type of negotiation.  Others thought the declaration implied that formal negotiations could only  begin if there were explicit consensus among the members at Cancun to do  so.", "Key players\u2019 positions were divided into three main camps. A group of  developed and developing country members led by the European Union,  Japan, and South Korea strongly advocated starting negotiations on all four  issues, including investment and competition, which were particularly  controversial. These nations had succeeded at Doha in getting the four  issues included as part of the round\u2019s overall package but only on the  condition that explicit agreement be reached at Cancun on the parameters  to negotiate these issues. Many developing countries, on the other hand,  had consistently expressed their strong opposition to the inclusion of the  Singapore issues in the WTO negotiating agenda and several viewed  Cancun as their opportunity to block negotiations on these issues. For  example, India argued that for many of these countries, undertaking new  obligations in these areas would have presented too great a burden, since  they were still having difficulty implementing their Uruguay Round  obligations. They also were not convinced of the development benefits that  would result. A third group of countries, including the United States and  some developing nations, were willing to negotiate but wanted each issue  considered on its own merit. However, some of the developing countries  linked their willingness to negotiate with progress in other areas such as  agriculture. The United States had been pushing the issues of transparency  in government procurement and trade facilitation. The United States was  also willing to negotiate on competition policy and investment, but had  some concerns that included whether negotiations could call into question  its enforcement of strong antitrust laws and match the high standards that  are a feature of its bilateral investment agreements.", "The discussions at Cancun on the Singapore issues were contentious and  contributed to the breakdown of the ministerial. Early in the week, a group  of 16 developing countries argued that because there was no clear  consensus on the modalities for the negotiations as required by the Doha  Declaration, the matter of whether to add these four new issues to the  negotiations should be dropped from the Cancun agenda and moved back  to Geneva for further discussion. The draft text issued later that week  called for beginning negotiations on two issues and setting deadlines for  trying to reach agreement on possible bases for addressing the other two  issues.

The  Doha Declaration stated that negotiations on nonagricultural market  access should be aimed at reducing or, as appropriate, eliminating tariffs  for nonagricultural products, including reducing or eliminating tariff  peaks and tariff escalation, as well as nontariff barriers. The Doha  Declaration also said that the liberalization of nonagricultural goods should  take fully into account the principle of special and differential treatment  for developing countries, including allowing for \u201cless than full reciprocity\u201d  in meeting tariff reduction commitments. Because WTO members missed a  May 31, 2003, deadline for reaching agreement on modalities for  nonagricultural market access that would govern preparation of national  schedules of barrier-cutting commitments, the goal for Cancun was to  establish a \u201cframework\u201d or basic approach to tariff and nontariff barrier  liberalization that would then be supplemented by more detailed modalities  later.", "Even though there are important differences in the situations and  individual positions of various developing countries\u2014a fact the United  States likes to emphasize--WTO members were largely divided along North- South lines in nonagricultural market access talks going into the Cancun  meeting. The United States and other developed countries were pushing for  substantial cuts in tariffs and wanted the high overall tariffs of key  developing countries like India and Brazil to come down. For example,  India has an average bound tariff of 34 percent on nonagricultural  products, while China and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire have average bound tariffs of 10  percent or less. The United States also aimed to seek a high level of  ambition in opening markets and expanding trade for all countries through  a harmonizing formula that cuts tariffs in all countries. In addition, it  wanted to reduce wide disparities among members\u2019 tariffs as well as  reduce low tariffs. Publicly, the developing countries were fairly united in  saying that any liberalization needed to leave them sufficient flexibility to  address their special needs and should involve greater cuts by richer  countries than poor ones. In May 2003, the chairman of the negotiating  group on market access issued a \u201cchair\u2019s proposal,\u201d attempting to reconcile  WTO members\u2019 various positions, including on tariff cutting formulas,  sectoral liberalization, and special and differential treatment.", "Coming into Cancun, two major proposals for cutting tariffs--one from the  market access chairman and another from the United States, EU, and  Canada--were under active discussion, though all of the numerous original  proposals submitted by WTO members remained \u201con the table.\u201d These two  proposals differed in the type of mathematical formula that would be used  to determine how much each member would be expected to reduce its  tariffs. The proposed tariff formula developed by the chairman as a  compromise would largely differentiate among countries according to their  current overall average bound tariff rate. Specifically, a country with higher  average bound tariffs would have to reduce its bound tariffs at a lesser rate  than a country with lower average bound tariffs. To use an illustrative  example, Brazil, with higher overall bound rates to begin with, would have  to cut a 10 percent bound tariff on a particular product to approximately  7.5 percent, or by 25 percent. Malaysia, with lower overall bound tariffs,  would have to slash a 10 percent bound tariff to 6 percent, or by 40 percent  (see fig. 3). Proponents argue that this formula would recognize each  country\u2019s differing starting points for liberalization while still  accomplishing significant cuts in bound tariff rates. Some officials counter  that average bound tariffs are not a direct or good indicator of development  status or needs. Moreover, they expressed concern that this formula would  require more reduction from nations that have lower overall bound tariffs.  The United States was concerned that this would effectively punish  countries that have previously liberalized, while rewarding countries that  had not liberalized. In addition, the United States was concerned that this  proposal was based on average bound tariff rates, which would not  necessarily lead to lower applied rates. Many developing countries\u2019 bound  tariff rates are higher than the tariffs they currently apply. For example,  Brazil has an average bound tariff of 31 percent and a 15 percent average  applied rate. Real liberalization will only occur if countries reduce bound  tariffs to below currently applied rates.", "On the other hand, the United States, the European Union, and Canada  developed an alternative framework for negotiations. This framework calls  for all countries to use a single harmonizing formula, such as a Swiss  formula, where the coefficient of reduction does not depend on a country\u2019s  average bound tariff rate. For example, if a Swiss formula using a  coefficient of 8 were used, all countries would have to cut a 10 percent  tariff on a particular product to 4 percent. Nevertheless, the U.S., EU,  Canada framework does foresee some differentiation among countries. For  example, it suggested that countries could be rewarded for \u201cgood behavior\u201d  by giving credits to countries that commit to do things that are considered  sound trade policy, such as putting a ceiling on, or binding, a high  percentage of their tariffs. According to U.S. Trade Representative  (USTR) officials, the credits would allow them to lower tariffs by a lesser  amount than that implied by the formula. Developing countries, however,  say this approach is inconsistent with the Doha mandate, which states  developing countries as a whole will be allowed to make lesser  commitments. In addition, they fear that they would have to cut tariffs  much more than developed countries in absolute terms. As a result, just  prior to the Cancun meeting, a few nations such as India reasserted their  interest in an across-the board or linear approach to cutting tariffs on  nonagricultural goods, similar to that depicted in figure 2. Under a linear  approach, all tariffs would be cut at the same rate and therefore the results  would not be harmonizing. The discussions at Cancun never got into the  detailed proposals that had been debated before Cancun and failed to  bridge these gaps on tariff formulas.", "At Cancun, WTO members were also considering the complete elimination  of tariffs in to-be-agreed-upon sectors, including ones that are particularly  important to developing countries. However, the issues of choice of sectors  and participation in the elimination remained controversial. Many  developing countries wanted sectoral elimination to be voluntary. Also  under debate was whether sectoral elimination should result in zero tariffs,  harmonization, or a differentiated outcome for developed versus  developing countries. The United States and many other countries thought  that sectoral initiatives were an important way to supplement the general  tariff cutting formula and to achieve their ambitious liberalization  objectives. The United States wanted to make sure all countries  competitive in a given sector would participate in sectoral elimination  regardless of their level of development.", "Consistent with the Doha mandate, WTO members were also considering  special treatment for developing countries and new entrants such as  recently acceded members in implementing their tariff commitments. This  included longer periods to implement the tariff reductions, differentiation  in how sectoral initiatives would be applied, and not making reduction  commitments mandatory. The developed countries recognized that many  nations, particularly least developed and other vulnerable economies, need  flexibility to deal with sensitive sectors and other adjustment needs.  However, they opposed across-the-board flexibility for all developing  countries, including the more advanced ones.", "At Cancun, some steps were taken to address the inherent trade-off  between committing to ambitious tariff liberalization and retaining  flexibility. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, for  example, provided assurances that they were prepared to work with  developing nations to help offset lost tariff revenue and address concerns  related to erosion of preferences. Nevertheless, ministers did not resolve  the debates over tariff-cutting formulas, the mandatory nature of sectoral  elimination, and the degree of flexibility to accord to developing countries.  Progress was not made on these issues because progress was not made or  expected in agriculture nor on the Singapore issues."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Energizing Services Negotiations Was a Key U.S. Goal for the Cancun Ministerial", "paragraphs": ["The Doha Declaration set a deadline for WTO members to complete the  work they had initiated in January 2000 to further open services markets  under the General Agreement on Trade in Services.

The goal for  Cancun\u2014particularly for the United States\u2014was to energize the ongoing  services negotiations and to set a deadline for submission of improved  offers to lower barriers to services. According to a WTO official, only 38  (counting the EU as one member) of the WTO\u2019s 146 members had  submitted offers before the Cancun ministerial.

Global trade rules have long included the principle that  developing countries would be accorded special and differential treatment  consistent with their individual levels of development, including the notion  that they would not be expected to fully reciprocate tariff and other  concessions made by developed countries. In the Doha Declaration, WTO  members agreed that all special and differential treatment provisions in  existing WTO agreements should be reviewed with a view to strengthening  them in order to make them more precise, effective, and operational. The  declaration requires the WTO\u2019s Committee on Trade and Development to  identify those special and differential treatment provisions that are  mandatory and those that are nonbinding and to consider the legal and  practical implications of turning the nonbinding ones into mandatory  obligations. According to USTR officials, part of the continuing difficulty of  this work has been the problems of separating work on special and  differential treatment from the work underway in actual individual  negotiating groups (e.g., agriculture) and the lack of progress on related  issues such as graduation/differentiation, which is also part of the  Committee on Trade and Development\u2019s work programme.", "Also, as part of the Doha Declaration, WTO members committed  themselves to address outstanding implementation issues and set a  December 2002 deadline for recommending appropriate action on them,  but they missed that deadline. Although there was agreement on a number  of implementation issues at Doha, outstanding issues remain in areas like  trade related investment measures, anti-dumping rules, and textiles. These  issues have proved divisive, even among developing countries.", "At Cancun, ministers were asked to endorse and immediately implement a  subset of the numerous proposals for special and differential treatment as  well as to set a new deadline for resolving outstanding special and  differential treatment and implementation issues. For some developing  countries, progress on these issues at Cancun was key to their willingness  to negotiate further market liberalization in other areas. In addition, the  African Group in particular wanted to better ensure that the needs of the  WTO\u2019s poorest member countries would be satisfactorily addressed in the  overall package of Doha Round results.", "However, developed and developing countries fundamentally disagreed in  their interpretation and use of special and differential treatment. For  example, government officials from several developed countries echoed  their desire to better target special and differential treatment by adopting a  needs-based approach. According to these officials, special and differential  treatment provisions should be tailored to match the various levels of  development and the particular economic needs of developing countries.    Many developing countries, on the other hand, wanted an expansion of  special and differential treatment. Their expansionist ambition was  reflected in 88 proposals for additional special treatment obligations,  mostly from the African Group and the group of least developed countries.  Among other things, the proposals sought additional technical support and  called for an exemption for developing countries and LDC members from  requirements to comply with existing WTO obligations that they believed  would be prejudicial to their individual development, financial, or trade  needs or beyond their administrative and institutional capacity. Developed  countries and more advanced developing countries considered many of  these demands to be problematic because some changes proposed would  alter the balance of the Uruguay Round agreements.", "In the end, however, developed countries and some developing countries  appeared ready to move forward on some of these proposals at Cancun,  had the ministerial proved successful. The General Council Chairman  worked carefully with a diverse group of key countries to put this package  together. A total of 24 special and differential treatment proposals,  including some related to implementation issues, were included in the draft  Cancun Ministerial Declaration sent to Cancun from Geneva. An additional  three proposals were added during the course of the Cancun meeting.
