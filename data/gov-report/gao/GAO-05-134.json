The sources of these deposits were primarily penalties and multiple damages and criminal fines collected from health care fraud cases. Amounts reported as appropriations from the trust fund for HCFAC activities--$209 million (fiscal year 2002) and $240 million (fiscal year 2003)--were consistent with HIPAA. The HHS/OIG received funds within the minimum and maximum amounts allowed by HIPAA to carry out Medicare and Medicaid antifraud activities. The expenditures charged against HCFAC funds by HHS and DOJ for fiscal years 2002 and 2003 were reasonable but the HHS/OIG did not record time charges in its workload systems for all staff that worked on HCFAC activities. Also, DOJ did not record all fiscal year 2003 expenditures in its accounting system so they could be readily identified as HCFAC related. Failure to properly record staff hours and expenditure data could hinder DOJ and HHS in monitoring the uses of HCFAC funds. Some reported cost savings--$19.9 billion (fiscal year 2002) and $20.8 billion (fiscal year 2003) can be considered savings to the trust fund, resulting from trust fund expenditures for the HCFAC program, but most can not. For example, $1.5 billion of the cost savings for fiscal year 2002 and $3.9 billion for fiscal year 2003 are the result of HHS/OIG recommendations and other initiatives since the HCFAC program was created. However, the remaining cost savings continued to be largely the result of actions that predate the HCFAC program and cannot be associated with expenditures from the trust fund for HCFAC. HIPAA requires that HHS and DOJ issue to Congress a joint HCFAC report on January 1 of each year. However, DOJ and HHS have issued the last three reports late and the length of the delay has increased each year.

The maximum amount for fiscal year 1997, the  first year of HCFAC, was $104 million and HIPAA limited the amounts for  each of the fiscal years 1998 through 2003 to an amount equal to the limit  for the preceding fiscal year increased by 15 percent. For each fiscal year  after 2003, the amount made available was capped at the 2003 limit (See  table 1).", "In addition to the annual limits on the total amount made available for  HCFAC, HIPAA includes annual minimum and maximum amounts that are  earmarked specifically for HHS/OIG activities for the Medicare and  Medicaid programs. For example, of the $240.6 million available in fiscal  year 2003, a minimum of $150 million and a maximum of $160 million were  earmarked for the HHS/OIG to ensure continued efforts by the HHS/OIG to  detect and prevent fraud and abuse in the Medicare and Medicaid  programs.", "HHS\u2019s Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) performs the  accounting for the HCFAC control account.

The HHS and DOJ entities accounted for  their HCFAC obligations and expenditures in their respective accounting  systems and reported them to CMS. CMS then recorded the obligations  and expenditures against the appropriate allotments in its accounting  system.

As shown in  figure 1, these deposits primarily consisted of penalties and multiple  damages and criminal fines collected as a result of health care fraud  cases. The considerable difference in the amount of criminal fines  reported for fiscal year 2002 and 2003 is primarily due to large criminal  fine collections from two major cases settled in prior years.

We reviewed the methodology that the HHS/OIG used to charge  expenditures against its HCFAC funding and determined that it was  reasonable. The OIG charges a percentage of its total payroll and  nonpayroll expenses to the HCFAC program. The percentage that is  charged each year is based on the relative proportion of its annual HCFAC  funding to its total funding. These amounts are then monitored throughout  the year. As table 2 shows, HCFAC funding for fiscal years 2002 and 2003  was 80 and 81 percent, respectively, of the OIG\u2019s total funding.", "HHS/OIG management takes several steps to help assure that HCFAC  funds are expended on HCFAC-related activities. For one, management  meets with its component offices at the beginning of the year to determine  how much of each component\u2019s resources will be devoted to HCFAC- related activities. Some component offices make plans to devote resources  to HCFAC in excess of the 80-81 percent funding level, while other  components plan to devote less. OIG management evaluates each  component\u2019s plans in relation to each component\u2019s full-time equivalents  (FTE) to ensure that OIG resources overall are spent on HCFAC activities  in accordance with the funding level. In addition, throughout the year,  three of the components, Office of Audit Services (OAS), Office of  Evaluations and Inspections (OEI), and Office of Investigations (OI) track  the staff time spent on various projects in their workload tracking system.  The information in each component\u2019s system is summarized and  monitored quarterly to ensure that staff time is being spent on HCFAC in  accordance with the funding.", "The OIG\u2019s Office of Management and Policy (OMP) requests summary  reports from the component offices that include the staff time spent on  HCFAC activities and uses the information in determining if the OIG  overall is performing HCFAC work as planned. The lead OMP staff person  said that when material variances are identified in the amount of staff time  devoted to HCFAC, the components are instructed to adjust the type of  work performed. We reviewed the monitoring reports that the OMP staff  prepares and these reports showed that the amount of time devoted to  HCFAC activities for the OIG as a whole was in line with the planned  amount.", "We also performed several tests on the information maintained in  components\u2019 workload systems as they are relied on in monitoring HCFAC  payroll expenditures. For example, we analyzed the data in the  components\u2019 workload tracking systems to determine if the projects  identified as HCFAC were appropriately classified as HCFAC-related in  each component. We analyzed titles and supporting documents for all of  the projects in the workload tracking systems of OAS and OEI\u2014two  components that account for about 55 percent of the OIG staff. We  determined that the projects were appropriately classified as HCFAC or  non-HCFAC.", "We also compared hours in the OAS, OEI, and OI workload tracking  systems to hours in the payroll system to determine if the components\u2019  systems included hours for all staff. We found that the hours recorded in  OAS\u2019s system agreed with hours in the payroll system. However, hours in  OI\u2019s and OEI\u2019s systems did not agree with the payroll system. The OI  system included approximately 52 percent fewer hours for fiscal year 2002  and 44 percent fewer hours for 2003 than were in the payroll system. OI  managers were aware of the variance and explained that until they  recently implemented a new system, their workload system did not  include staff hours for administrative and supervisory staff. In determining  the amount of staff hours spent on HCFAC-related assignments, OI  concluded that administrative and supervisory time was spent in the same  relative percentages as the staff who recorded their time in the workload  system.", "In June 2003, OI upgraded its workload tracking system to record hours  for all staff. In addition, OI implemented new procedures to help ensure  that all hours were recorded in its workload system. The procedures  include weekly automatic, system-generated electronic mail messages that  are sent to supervisors informing them of employees that did not record  their time and a reconciliation of hours in the HHS payroll system to hours  in the workload system that is performed during periodic inspections at  regional offices.", "The OEI workload tracking system included about 12 percent fewer hours  than the payroll system for fiscal years 2002 and 2003. OEI officials said  that they did not have procedures in place to identify missing hours.  However, they believed that most of the people not entering data into the  workload system were probably managers and administrative personnel  whose hours would probably reflect the same allocation of hours between  HCFAC and non-HCFAC work as those staff recording hours. In addition,  the OMP staff person who monitored staff hours applied the HCFAC and  non-HCFAC hours recorded in the workload system against the total FTEs  for OEI to determine that the OIG as a whole performed HCFAC work as  planned. Therefore, while this issue did not appear to impact the propriety  of HCFAC payroll expenditures during our review period, incomplete staff  hours in the component workload tracking systems could hinder OIG  managers in monitoring the amount of HCFAC work performed in the  future. Therefore, it is critical that all OIG components have procedures in  place to ensure that workload data are complete.", "In assessing the reliability of DOJ fiscal year 2002 expenditures, we tested  a statistical sample of the largest category of fiscal year 2002 nonpayroll  expenses, which accounted for 69 percent of nonpayroll and 34 percent of  DOJ\u2019s total fiscal year 2002 HCFAC expenditures. We determined that  nonpayroll expenses were adequately supported and related to HCFAC on  the basis of our review of supporting documentation.  In addition, we  reviewed the payroll expenses charged by DOJ\u2019s United States Attorneys  Office (USAO) against HCFAC funds that represented 76 percent of DOJ\u2019s  fiscal year 2002 HCFAC payroll expenditures and 38 percent of DOJ\u2019s total  fiscal year 2002 HCFAC expenditures.", "We determined that the USAO methodology for charging salaries to  HCFAC was reasonable. USAO charged the full annual salaries of 160  individuals against HCFAC program funds in fiscal year 2002 as a  surrogate for the 160 FTEs that were funded by the program. USAO  managers said that this was administratively easier than trying to charge a  portion of the salary of all the staff that perform health care fraud and  abuse work. To assess the reasonableness of this approach, we reviewed  the hours recorded in the USAO workload system for fiscal year 2002.  According to data in the system, USAO staff devoted about 587,168 staff  hours (282.3 FTEs) to health care fraud-related activities during fiscal year  2002, which was about 76 percent more than the 160 FTEs (332,800 hours)  funded by the program. In addition, to ensure that the salaries charged to  HCFAC were reasonable, we compared the average annual salaries for the  160 staff (i.e., attorneys, paralegals, and administrative staff) charged to  the HCFAC account to the average annual salary for the same positions  USAO-wide. We found that the salaries were generally comparable.", "Our review of DOJ\u2019s fiscal year 2003 HCFAC expenditures also included a  review of USAO salaries charged against HCFAC funds as these amounts  represented 75 percent of DOJ\u2019s fiscal year 2003 HCFAC payroll  expenditures and 49 percent of all fiscal year 2003 HCFAC expenses.  USAO charged the salaries of 162 individuals against HCFAC funding in  fiscal year 2003. Our review procedures were similar to our work on 2002  payroll expenditures, and we again found the payroll expenditure amounts  to be reasonable.", "We also tested a nonstatistical selection of nonpayroll expenses for fiscal  year 2003 from hard copy documentation included in DOJ billing  packages. We determined that these expenses were adequately supported  and related to HCFAC. We did not select a statistical sample of fiscal year  2003 nonpayroll HCFAC expenses because DOJ could not provide an  electronic file of detailed transactions from its accounting system for all  nonpayroll HCFAC expenditures. Only one of the four DOJ components  properly recorded expenditures under the specific HCFAC account class  in the accounting system. DOJ accounting policy, issued March 2003,  required that each DOJ component record expenses charged against  HCFAC funds under a specific HCFAC account class so that they can be  readily identified as related to HCFAC.", "Managers for the components that did not follow this accounting policy  told us that they recorded their fiscal year 2003 HCFAC expenses at a  summary level under an account class for general expenses and not under  the HCFAC account class as required because they instead prepared the  hard copy billing packages for reimbursement, which were supposed to  provide details on HCFAC expenditures. However, we found that the  billing packages contained varying levels of detail. Without the full detail  recorded in the accounting system it is difficult to monitor HCFAC  expenditures.

The report  included recommendations that resulted in changes in program  regulations and administrative actions. For example, in January 2001, CMS  issued a final rule to change Medicaid payment policies, placing limitations  on enhanced payments under Medicaid upper-payment limit requirements  for hospital services, nursing facility services, intermediate care facility  services for the mentally retarded, and clinic services.", "In addition, CMS issued a final rule in January 2002 placing additional  limitations on enhanced payments for hospitals. CMS projected that the  regulatory changes would result in cost savings of $79.3 billion over   10 years beginning with about $1.4 billion in fiscal year 2002 and about  $3.8 billion in fiscal year 2003. The two other reports issued in fiscal year  2000 that resulted in costs savings of about $100 million for both fiscal  years 2002 and 2003 were related to recovering overpayments to nursing  homes and Medicaid drug rebates. Because the three reports were issued  since the HCFAC program was created and the savings occurred in fiscal  years 2002 and 2003, the savings can be linked to expenditures from the  trust fund.", "We reviewed the support for the total cost savings amounts reported by  the HHS/OIG for fiscal years 2002 and 2003. We initially found an  overstatement of $840 million in the amounts included in the draft report  for fiscal year 2003. The overstatement occurred because the HHS/OIG did  not record an adjustment for the revised cost savings amounts issued by  the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). The annual cost savings amounts  reported by the HHS/OIG are based on estimates issued by CBO of savings  that are expected from implementation of health-care-related legislation.  CBO revised its estimate of fiscal year 2003 cost savings that would be  realized from implementation of the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP  Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999, but HHS officials did not  recognize and factor in the effect of the adjustment in the fiscal year 2003  draft HCFAC report.

Until  HHS and DOJ streamline their internal review processes, the annual joint  reports will continue to be delinquent and therefore of limited use to  congressional decision makers and other interested parties."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve HHS\u2019s accountability over HCFAC program expenditures, we  recommend that the HHS Inspector General require all HHS/OIG  components to develop procedures for ensuring that all key staff hours  spent on HCFAC activities are recorded in OIG workload tracking  systems.", "To improve DOJ\u2019s accountability for HCFAC program expenditures, we  recommend that the Attorney General develop monitoring procedures to  ensure that DOJ components record key HCFAC program expenditure  data under the appropriate HCFAC account class in DOJ\u2019s accounting  system.", "To help ensure that the joint HHS and DOJ HCFAC reports are issued in a  more timely manner, we recommend that the Secretary of HHS and the  Attorney General    develop a more expedited review process and    notify congressional committees with oversight responsibility for the  HCFAC program of delays in issuing the joint report within 1 month after  missing the January 1 deadline and provide updates until the report is  issued."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["A draft of this report was provided to HHS and DOJ for their review and  comment. Written comments from HHS and DOJ are reprinted in  appendixes III and IV. HHS and DOJ also provided technical comments  that we incorporated as appropriate.", "In written comments, HHS concurred with our recommendation that the  HHS Inspector General require all of its components to develop  procedures for ensuring that all key staff hours spent on HCFAC activities  are recorded in its workload tracking systems and noted that it is already  moving to implement such procedures. Similarly, in its written comments,  DOJ concurred with our recommendation for ensuring that DOJ  components record key HCFAC program expenditure data under the  appropriate HCFAC account class in DOJ\u2019s accounting system and noted  that its Justice Management Division will meet with the components to  assist them in using the accounting classes designated for HCFAC funds.", "Regarding our recommendation for ensuring that HCFAC reports are  issued in a more timely manner, HHS and DOJ agreed to develop a more  expedited review process for the HCFAC reports. DOJ commented that it  has already instituted several new procedures that it believes will shorten  the time needed for future reports and HHS stated that it will work with  DOJ in developing changes to the review process. HHS and DOJ, however,  did not agree that they should report to Congress delays in issuing the  HCFAC report by the mandated deadline. In their comments, HHS and  DOJ noted that additional reporting, which requires clearance through  both departments, would be counterproductive to clearing the annual  HCFAC report. HHS added that such notification would not provide  Congress with any substantial information and DOJ added that reporting  on delays would be of little value to congressional oversight committees.  Instead, DOJ officials stated that they propose to expedite the review and  approval process, to the extent that source data are available and  circumstances are within the department\u2019s control.", "We disagree with HHS\u2019s and DOJ\u2019s position that Congress would not gain  any value in knowing that the HCFAC report is going to be issued after the  date that Congress mandated in law. Congress should be informed if  reports that it may use in making future program funding and oversight  decisions are not expected to be issued by the mandated report deadline.  In addition, it appears that HHS and DOJ interpreted our recommendation  for reporting delays in issuing the HCFAC report to mean sending  Congress a report that would require a formal clearance process through  both agencies. This was not our intent. HHS and DOJ officials can and  should develop a mechanism for notifying Congress of delays that would  not place an undue burden on their staff or interfere with issuing and  clearing the HCFAC report itself. Such a mechanism could be as simple as  sending an electronic mail message to all the committees of jurisdiction.", "DOJ also commented on the status of two remaining open  recommendations from our prior report. We will continue to work with  DOJ to obtain documentation to support the actions that DOJ said it is  implementing.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of HHS, the Attorney  General, and other interested parties.

We assessed  the reliability of the data by (1) performing electronic testing of required  data elements, (2) reviewing existing information about the data and the  system that produced them, and (3) interviewing agency officials  knowledgeable about the data. We determined that the data were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. The transactions that  we selected on a statistical basis included the following:   We selected a dollar unit sample of penalties and multiple damages  totaling $276.8 million from a population totaling $322.6 million for fiscal  year 2002, and a dollar unit sample totaling $181.2 million from a  population totaling $229.8 million for fiscal year 2003.", "We selected a dollar unit sample of criminal fines totaling $435.5 million  from a population totaling $443.5 million for fiscal year 2002 and a dollar  unit sample totaling $1.9 million from a population totaling $2.5 million for  fiscal year 2003.", "We selected a dollar unit sample of civil monetary penalties totaling   $1.7 million from a population totaling $6.9 million for fiscal year 2002 and  a dollar unit sample totaling $1.7 million from a population totaling   $7.1 million for fiscal year 2003.", "We obtained supporting documentation for each sample transaction from  various sources depending on the type of deposit.

USAO payroll expenses were equal to the  annual salaries for 160 FTEs for fiscal year 2002 and 162 FTEs for fiscal  year 2003. We reviewed the hours recorded in USAO\u2019s workload system to  ensure that the office devoted staff time to HCFAC-related activities equal  to or greater than the annual hours of the 160 FTEs for both fiscal years.  We compared the average annual salary for USAO staff positions  (attorney, paralegal, administrative) charged to the HCFAC account to the  average annual salary for the same staff positions USAO-wide to ensure  that the salary amounts charged against HCFAC were reasonable.
