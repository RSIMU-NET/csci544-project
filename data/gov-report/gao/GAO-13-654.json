State has a separate process to address related grievances. Selection boards review all candidates and sort them into one of three categories: promotable, mid-ranked, and low-ranked. The selection boards produce rank-ordered lists of those candidates recommended for promotion, and a \"cut line\" is subsequently determined based on the number of available promotion slots. Before announcing promotions, State vets all recommended candidates to determine whether there are outstanding issues, such as a pending investigation, that can lead to their removal from the promotion list. Subsequently, State convenes performance standards boards to assess low-ranked candidates for possible separation from the Service. There are several mechanisms to address grievances relating to the promotion process. For example, State may initiate reconstituted boards to reassess candidates if a board failed to follow the procedures or if the underlying performance information contained omissions or inaccuracies. Employees not satisfied with grievance outcomes can file an appeal with the Foreign Service Grievance Board.", "In response to concerns identified by the Office of Inspector General (OIG) and Foreign Service Grievance Board in 2010, State has taken a number of actions to strengthen its Foreign Service promotion process internal controls. For example, in response to concerns about improper introduction of information about candidates, State instituted a requirement that board members sign an oath to adhere to the promotion criteria and protect the confidentiality of board materials. State also revised its procedures governing recusal requests, thereby broadening the provisions under which a candidate can request an individual board member's recusal from reviewing their file. In addition, State updated its reconstituted board procedures, outlining a set of required documents, such as signed board member score sheets, to be included in each board's official record. In addition to actions taken in response to others' identified concerns, State initiated other practices to strengthen promotion process safeguards, such as including selection board and reconstituted board member recusal memos in the final board report.", "GAO found that Foreign Service selection boards, performance standards boards, and reconstituted boards complied with many of State's updated procedures in the 2011 and 2012 Foreign Service promotion cycles, but some board reports had documentation gaps for certain internal controls. For example, all 41 selection board reports we reviewed included a signed memo certifying final results. However, only 29 of 41 selection boards had signed oaths from all board members, and 45 of 122 required oaths were missing from 2012 selection board reports. In addition, some board reports lacked documentation of some recusal requests. The absence of a fully documented system of controls increases the risk that intentional or unintentional failures to implement safeguards, by board members or State Human Resources staff, may go undetected and uncorrected. Such a failure to implement safeguards, in turn, increases the risk that the integrity of promotion results could be intentionally or inadvertently compromised."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that State take actions to ensure full implementation of promotion process internal controls.

Any time  there is a discrepancy between board members of at least four points in  the ranking of a given candidate, the members must discuss the case  and, if the discussion results in any changes, adjust rankings accordingly  to comply with the forced distribution requirement.

According to State officials, this grievance was denied at the agency  level in April 2013. Grievances generally focused on a complaint that a  board misapplied a given precept in arriving at a low-ranking decision. For  example, some grievants alleged that a board relied on comments made  in the Area for Improvement section of the EER to support a low-ranking  determination without corroborating evidence of poor performance  elsewhere in the EER, as is required by the procedural precepts. We  noted that HR officials often agreed with the grievant in low-ranking  complaints and provided the requested relief of expunging the low- ranking statement from the employee\u2019s performance folder, along with  related modifications to their \u201cscorecard.\u201d", "Our online data collection tool revealed a limited number of procedural  concerns relating to the operations of three specific boards. Our online  tool was designed to provide board members with an opportunity to  identify whether they observed any actions, behaviors, or concerns that  could have compromised their board\u2019s integrity and fairness. Our online  tool was sent to 293 of 298 members who served on the 2011 and 2012  selection boards, 2011 and 2012 performance standards boards, and  reconstituted boards since October 2011. We received 206 completed  forms. From this total, two responses identified a total of four concerns  with the operation of a board in 2011 or 2012. One response claimed that  a board member had refused to follow precept instructions to consider  candidate service in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan in a favorable light.", "The same response noted that the board did not follow proper recusal  procedures in all cases. The second response claimed that an \u201cHR  official\u201d had inappropriately instructed a board member. The same  response noted that the board did not follow proper recusal procedures in  all cases.

Within an organizational culture that emphasizes performance and career  advancement, safeguards to ensure the fairness and integrity of the  promotion process are of particular importance. While we found that State  had responded to previously identified concerns about its Foreign Service  promotion process and taken a number of actions to strengthen internal  controls over the process, documentation supporting the full  implementation of these controls was sometimes missing. For example,  we found that many selection board member oaths were missing from  2012 selection board reports and some boards did not include  documentation of recusal requests. In the absence of a fully documented  system of controls, there is a risk that intentional or unintentional failures  to implement safeguards, by board members or HR staff, will go  undetected and uncorrected. A failure to implement safeguards, in turn,  increases the risk that promotion results could be intentionally or  inadvertently compromised."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve and better document State\u2019s compliance with key safeguards  governing the Foreign Service promotion process, we recommend that  the Secretary of State instruct the Director General of the Foreign Service  and Director of the Human Resources Office of Performance Evaluation  to take steps to ensure that selection board, performance standards  board, and reconstituted board reports are complete and fully document  compliance with internal controls, including but not limited to signed oaths  and recusal memos."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to State for its review and comment.

To understand how these procedures are  implemented in practice, we interviewed State officials within the Bureau  of Human Resources (HR), including officials from the offices of  performance evaluation and grievances. We also interviewed the  president and several other officials from the American Foreign Service  Association (AFSA), the exclusive bargaining agent for Foreign Service  personnel, to understand AFSA\u2019s role in the promotion process. We  interviewed four public, or non-State, members of selection boards, which  evaluate and rank order candidates for promotion. We reviewed State  data on the 2011 and 2012 Foreign Service promotion cycles, and the  number, resolution, and status of grievances filed by candidates who  were \u201clow ranked\u201d by selection boards in 2011 and 2012. We discussed  with State officials how these promotion process and grievance-related  data were collected and checked for accuracy. State HR officials told us  the promotion data were compiled by HR\u2019s Office of Resource  Management and Organizational Analysis. According to HR officials, HR  staff members manually enter these data into a system referred to as the  Board Maintenance Application. HR Office of Resource Management and  Organizational Analysis staff members work with HR performance  evaluation staff to verify the number of promotions, as well as the  rankings of those promoted, and the number of those recommended for  promotion but not promoted. These results are published annually, every  spring. For grievance data, the director of State\u2019s grievance staff told us  grievance staff obtained the names of every person low ranked or  referred to a performance standards board in 2011 and 2012 from HR  performance evaluation staff, then cross-checked those names against  the names of individuals who had filed grievances. Grievance staff then  manually searched the grievance files to determine whether the  individuals\u2019 grievances involved low rankings, by year. We determined  these data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "To review the procedural changes State has made to its Foreign Service  promotion process in response to identified concerns, we focused on  concerns identified since March 2010, when the State Office of Inspector  General (OIG) issued its Report of Inspection, \u201cReview of the Integrity  and Fairness of the Foreign Service Selection Board Process.\u201d We also  focused on State procedural changes made since March 2010. In addition  to the OIG\u2019s report, we reviewed the record of proceedings for the  Foreign Service Grievance Board\u2019s case 2008-051 from July 2010, which  addressed concerns with State\u2019s procedures governing reconstituted  boards, which are convened if it is determined a promotion candidate was  not properly reviewed. We also reviewed Foreign Service personnel  grievance cases related to the promotion process, from 2011 through  February 2013. In particular, we reviewed those cases the grievance  office had categorized as one of the following grievance types: promotion,  low-ranking, performance standards boards (which review low-ranked  candidates for possible separation), or separation. We selected these  categories after reviewing a spreadsheet State provided that listed all filed  grievances by category, as we determined they were most applicable to  our review of the promotion process, compared with other categories  such as discipline, financial, and leave restoration. We also reviewed all  Foreign Service Grievance Board filings related to the same universe of  filed grievance cases. In addition, we reviewed selection board  recommendations to the Director General from the 2011 and 2012  promotion cycles, which we discuss further below. We also reviewed  responses to our online data collection tool, discussed below, that was  sent to 2011 and 2012 selection board, performance standards board,  and reconstituted board members. To learn about State\u2019s procedural  changes developed in response to the OIG\u2019s recommendations, we  reviewed State and OIG documents showing actions taken by State to  comply with the OIG\u2019s recommendations. We also interviewed State HR  officials and officials from the OIG. To examine State actions taken in  response to selection board member recommendations to the Director  General, we reviewed HR summary memos and cables explaining  suggested actions, and interviewed HR officials to discuss the status of  these actions. We further discuss these actions in our report\u2019s third  objective.", "To review the extent to which updated procedures were consistently  followed in 2011 and 2012, and whether any notable concerns about the  process remain, we reviewed selection board and performance standards  board records for 2011 and 2012 and reconstituted board records from  October 2011 through April 2013. According to State officials, the official  reports, referred to as board reports, from these boards are the only  records retained; the remaining records are destroyed as a standard  practice. We reviewed the three types of board reports within the  following timeframes:", "All 41 selection boards reports from 2011 and 2012, the 2 years  subsequent to the Inspector General\u2019s report, to enable us to assess  the extent to which State had implemented and consistently followed  changes made subsequent to that report. To ensure we reviewed the  accurate universe of selection board reports, we compared the list of  board reports provided against State cables announcing the results of  the promotion process for 2011 and 2012, which also identified all  boards convened in 2011 and 2012. This comparison identified no  discrepancies.", "All four performance standards board reports from 2011 and 2012.", "There were two performance standards board reports each year for  2011 and 2012, contained within a single folder for each year. We  received both reports for each year.", "All 32 board reports for reconstituted boards\u2014convened in response  to grievances pertaining to selection board promotion or low-ranking  determinations, and convened after October 2011, when State issued  new Standard Operating Procedures for these boards, through April  2013. To ensure we reviewed the accurate universe of reconstituted  board files within this timeframe, we compared the files provided by  State against an inventory list provided by State; identified several  discrepancies and resolved them with HR officials; and presented a  master list of reconstituted boards to State officials, who confirmed the  list reflected all reconstituted boards relating to promotions within our  requested timeframe. Near the conclusion of our engagement, we  reviewed those reconstituted boards that had taken place following  our initial file review.", "To help conduct our review of the three types of boards, we developed a  data collection instrument with data categories reflecting the information  required and routinely captured in each type of report. To determine the  data included in these reports, we reviewed applicable precepts and  standard operating procedures outlining required information, reviewed a  sample of the board reports, and discussed the reports with HR officials.  The analysts discussed the data categories with two research  methodologists and a senior manager and reached agreement on them  before coding the reports. For all reports, two analysts reviewed each  report jointly. Another independent party reviewed the results of this  process after the fact.", "To summarize and organize the selection boards\u2019 written  recommendations or observations to the Director General, two analysts  read and entered this information into the data collection instrument. In 41  selection board reports, the team identified 306 separate  recommendations or observations. To analyze this written information,  the two analysts developed a set of summary statements and higher-level  categories to be used for reporting purposes. The summary statements  provided a detailed explanation of the nature of the board  recommendations or observations, including examples to illustrate what  types of recommendations or observations would be coded under these  statements. The higher-level categories served as abbreviated headings  or titles of these more detailed statements. These statements and  categories were based on an inductive exercise involving an in-depth  reading and comparison of the board recommendations. The two analysts  then tested these statements on an initial set of five board reports, by  coding the text in them jointly. The statements and categories were  developed iteratively, with modifications made as appropriate. The text  was coded \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d If a segment of text was coded as \u201cyes,\u201d it  indicated that the particular board had made one or more  recommendation that fell into this category. If a recommendation  addressed more than one of our categories, we coded it into all applicable  categories. The analysts coded the remainder of the reports  independently. Once concluded, the analysts met to discuss codes and  reconcile disagreements as needed. The two analysts were able to  reconcile all disagreements. A third party reviewer reviewed the team\u2019s  work and provided several suggestions, informed by discussions with  team members, on revisions to some of the categories to more clearly  capture how the team defined and interpreted them. Final tallies of the  analysis were obtained by counting, for each statement, the number of  \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d responses and reflecting the number of times a category of  recommendation occurred in the 41 reports.", "To determine whether State was following its procedures for promoting  candidates recommended for promotion by selection boards, we  reconciled selection board report lists of rank-ordered candidates for  promotion against State official promotion announcements. We first  identified discrepancies between the two lists by reviewing selection  board rank-ordered promotion lists against the State promotion  announcements. We provided a copy of our list of discrepancies to HR  officials, who provided lists explaining the reasons why certain candidates  were removed from promotion lists. Through this process, State  accounted for all missing names. To corroborate State\u2019s explanation of  why names were removed from promotion lists, we requested  documentation from State attesting to the reasons given for these  removals for a selected number of these individuals. State provided us  with this documentation, and therefore fully accounted for all  discrepancies between selection board report lists of rank-ordered  candidates for promotion against State official promotion announcements.", "Similarly, we took steps to compare recusals we found documented in  selection board reports against State\u2019s master list of recusal requests. We  cross-referenced State\u2019s master list of recusal requests against the  recusals documented in board reports. Through this process, we  identified discrepancies, namely that four board reports had recusal  information that was not reflected in State\u2019s master list and that nine  recusal requests included in State\u2019s master list were not documented in  the board reports. We discussed and provided specific information on  these discrepancies with State officials. State subsequently presented  copies of the nine recusal requests that were not initially documented in  selection board reports.", "To supplement our promotion process file review, we distributed an online  tool to allow selection board, performance standards board, and  reconstituted board members an opportunity to anonymously comment on  any actions, behaviors, or other concerns relating to the board on which  they served that they believed could have compromised the board\u2019s  integrity and fairness. The online tool\u2019s intended use was to gather any  information received from selection board members, and, to the extent  possible, follow up on any concerns or allegations; it was not intended to  present frequencies or tabulations based on the responses we received,  or to report comprehensively on the attitudes of board members on the  promotion process. We determined this type of online tool was  appropriate for this case because of the prior allegations of improper  behavior related to the process. Before distributing the online tool, we  shared it with three selection board members and incorporated their  comments, as appropriate. We also shared the online tool with State and  AFSA. We received comments from both State and AFSA; incorporated  some of their suggestions, as appropriate; and explained, where  applicable, why we did not incorporate certain other suggestions. We  requested that State provide us with email addresses for board members  from the following board types and within the following timeframes:  selection boards in 2011 and 2012, performance standards boards in  2011 and 2012, and reconstituted boards from October 2011 to February  2013, as we distributed the online tool in March 2013. State provided  email addresses for all but several of these names; we obtained some of  the missing email addresses through our own research and others from  AFSA. Through our own cross-referencing of State-provided lists of board  members against our lists of boards and board members, we discovered  that certain board member email addresses were missing. We requested  that State provide email addresses for these names. Overall, we identified  a universe of 298 individuals who served on the three types of boards  within our specified timeframes. We were unable to contact five of these  members for various reasons, including one retired board member for  whom State had no email address, and several others due to missing or  invalid e-mail addresses.", "We sent an e-mail with a link to the online tool to 293 board members on  March 11, 2013. Responses were accepted through April 7, 2013. We  received 206 completed forms. We cannot report a response rate as it is  possible that respondents submitted multiple forms or individuals  responded who were not board members in 2011 or 2012. Board  members could respond anonymously, and some respondents did not  provide contact information. We reviewed written responses to identify  any obvious or apparent duplicate or multiple entries, and identified one  such entry. We reviewed all 206 completed forms and identified four  responses indicating a concern or problem with the operation of a  particular board. Two of these four responses constituted the one  apparent duplicate entry, and pertained to a selection board convened in  2009, which is outside the scope of this engagement. We nonetheless  provided this concern to State\u2019s HR staff and the OIG for further review  and follow-up as appropriate. The remaining two responses, each of  which identified two separate concerns, fell within our engagement\u2019s  scope and are discussed in the body of the report.
