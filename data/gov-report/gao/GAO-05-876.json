The United States provided about $24 billion (for fiscal years 2003 through 2005) largely for security and reconstruction activities. Of this amount, about $18 billion had been obligated and about $9 billion disbursed. The State department has reported that since July 2004, about $4.7 billion of $18.4 billion in fiscal year 2004 funding has been realigned from large electricity and water projects to security, economic development, and smaller immediate impact projects. From May 2003 through June 2004, the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) controlled $23 billion in Iraqi revenues and assets, which was used primarily to fund the operations of the Iraqi government. The CPA allocated a smaller portion of these funds--about $7 billion--for relief and reconstruction projects. Finally, international donors pledged $13.6 billion over 4 years (2004 through 2007) for reconstruction activities, about $10 billion in the form of loans and $3.6 billion in the form of grants. Iraq had accessed $436 million of the available loans as of March 2005. As of the same date, donors had deposited more than $1 billion into funds for multilateral grant assistance, which disbursed about $167 million for the Iraqi elections and other activities, such as education and health projects. The U.S. reconstruction effort in Iraq has undertaken many activities in the oil, power, water, and health sectors and has made some progress, although multiple challenges confront each sector. The U.S. has completed projects in Iraq that have helped to restore basic services, such as rehabilitating oil wells and refineries, increasing electrical generation capacity, restoring water treatment plants, and reestablishing Iraqi basic health care services. However, as of May 2005, Iraq's crude oil production and overall power generation were lower than before the 2003 conflict, although power levels have increased recently; some completed water projects were not functioning as intended; and construction at hospital and clinics is under way. Reconstruction efforts continue to face challenges such as rebuilding in an insecure environment, ensuring the sustainability of completed projects, and measuring program results."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Rebuilding Iraq is a U.S. national security and foreign policy priority and  constitutes the largest U.S. assistance program since World War II.

Looting  and sabotage of many infrastructure facilities and offices were pervasive  after Operation Iraqi Freedom and have continued to varying degrees. In  addition, according to senior military officials, the insurgency in Iraq has  grown in size, complexity, and intensity and has affected reconstruction  priorities. Infrastructure in such areas as the oil, water, and electricity  sectors has been subject to attacks. In addition, workers have been  threatened, the ability to safely transport materials has been compromised,  and access to work sites has been hindered. Another complicating factor in  the reconstruction effort, according to Coalition Provisional Authority  (CPA) and U.S. officials, has been the state of some Iraqi infrastructure,  which was more severely degraded than officials anticipated or initial  assessments indicated and was exacerbated by post-2003 conflict looting  and sabotage.", "This report is part of our effort under the Comptroller General\u2019s authority  to monitor Iraq reconstruction and is being addressed to you because of  your committee\u2019s jurisdictions.

Some officials estimated that a combination of these factors have  contributed to delays of 2 to 6 months at different points in the oil sector  program\u2019s overall implementation. Some significant projects experienced  further delays from late 2004 to early 2005 due to security, technical, or  legal problems that over the past several months, according to agency  officials, resulted in lower crude oil production or export. For example,  one significant project to provide water and field pressure maintenance in  southern Iraq could not be fully utilized, primarily due to associated  infrastructure degradation, thus limiting the facility\u2019s operations and Iraq\u2019s  level of crude oil production.

About $2.3 billion of the $2.7 billion in Iraqi funds was used to  purchase, supply, and distribute these refined fuel products. These efforts  required the coordination of significant trucking operations and military  convoys to move considerable quantities of fuels and to increase the  capacity to download these fuels at several supply points throughout Iraq.  Although no longer responsible for the purchase and delivery of these  refined fuels, U.S. agencies continue to monitor Iraq\u2019s efforts to maintain a  15-day supply of refined fuel stocks. Although estimated national supply  levels were low from November 2004 to March 2005, U.S. agency  documents report that levels of these products improved and, as of May  2005, only diesel stocks remained significantly below the 15-day supply  targets.

CPA oil security efforts included the establishment of a U.S. task force to  manage the training and equipping of an oil security force. This effort  began in late 2003 and focused primarily on guarding fixed facilities and, to  a lesser extent, patrolling pipelines. The oil security force numbers reached  over 14,000 as of June 2004, according to agency officials; however, in  responding to our draft report State indicated that this force was not  staffed, trained, or equipped to patrol pipelines. Because the number and  intensity of pipeline attacks increased during the summer and fall of 2004,  the overall effectiveness of this force has been difficult to gauge. In  responding to our draft report, State indicated that this level of attacks  demonstrates the effectiveness of the insurgency in Iraq and the inability of  coalition forces to register the security of the oil infrastructure as a high  priority. According to agency documents, the Ministry of Oil assumed  responsibility for these security personnel in December 2004.", "In a related effort, the CPA established an emergency response  organization in early 2004 to rapidly return damaged pipelines to service.

As of May 2005, U.S.-funded projects reportedly  had added or restored about 1900 megawatts of generating capacity to  Iraq\u2019s power grid. However, U.S. program and contracting officials have  raised concerns about the ability of the Ministry of Electricity and local  power plant operators to sustain the added generation capacity.", "The other key target has been to help Iraq produce 120,000 megawatt-hours  of electricity per day by June 2005. In May 2005, agency reports show this  target was revised to producing 110,000 megawatt-hours by December  2005. As shown in figure 4, Iraq produced more than 100,000  megawatt-hours of electricity most days between July and November 2004;  however, production dropped below prewar production levels through May  2005, varying between 51,000 and 99,800 megawatt-hours daily. Agency  reports attribute the decreased production figures to several causes,  including planned and unplanned maintenance on power stations, fuel  shortages due to insurgent attacks on oil pipelines that provide fuel to the  power plants, and limited supply of fuels allocated by the Ministry of Oil. In  commenting on our draft report, State noted that planned outages are  necessary operational procedures to ensure reliable and sustainable  operations at the plants and that the central reason for high unplanned  outages is that Ministry of Electricity workers do not yet have the  necessary skills to ensure adequate operations and maintenance practices.  As of June 2005, Iraq\u2019s electricity production was increasing to meet greater  summer demand and exceeded 100,000 megawatts in the latter half of the  month. U.S. officials attributed the increased production to (1) power  plants that were returned to service after maintenance was completed, (2)  imported power and fuel supply from neighboring countries, and (3)  activation of U.S. funded power projects.", "The electricity sector faces a number of challenges to meeting Iraq\u2019s  electricity needs. These challenges include the lack of appropriate fuel  supplies, Iraqis lack of capacity in operation and maintenance, the unstable  security environment, financing needs for distribution projects, and  ineffective management of electricity generation and distribution.", "Iraq\u2019s limited accessible supply of natural gas and diesel fuel affects the  operation of the new gas combustion turbines provided by the United  States and continues to affect the operations and production capacity  of Iraq\u2019s electrical power plants. The United States purchased and  installed gas combustion turbines to operate several Iraqi power plants,  including Bayji and Qudas. These turbines were readily available for  purchase, could be installed in less than 1 year, and could also be  modified to burn oil-based fuels, although with some negative effect on  the turbines\u2019 efficiency and operation. Although Iraqi power plants have  largely relied on steam turbines that use crude oil or oil-derived fuels,  these turbines are less readily available for purchase on the world  market and require a longer installation time. Due to limited access to  natural gas, some gas combustion turbines at Iraqi power plants are  operating on low grade, oil-based fuels. The use of liquid fuels, without  adequate equipment modification and fuel treatment, decreases the  power output of the turbines by up to 50 percent, requires three times  more maintenance, and could result in equipment failure and damage  that significantly reduces the life of the equipment, according to U.S.  and Iraqi power plant officials.", "U.S. agencies report they have incorporated operations and  maintenance training into the reconstruction program. However, the  Iraqis\u2019 capacity to operate and maintain the power plant infrastructure  and equipment provided by the United States remains a challenge.  Contractors cited several instances where the Iraqis had significant  problems operating and maintaining projects after they were transferred  to the government. For example, in December 2004, the Iraqis\u2019 inability  to operate a recently overhauled plant at Bayji led to a widespread  power outage. U.S. officials said that contractors installed the  equipment and provided the Iraqis onsite training in operating the new  or refurbished equipment. However, Iraqi power plant officials from 13  locations throughout Iraq, including Bayji, indicated that the training did  not adequately prepare their staff to operate and maintain the new gas  turbine engines. U.S. officials have acknowledged that more needs to be  done to train plant operators and ensure that advisory services are  provided after the turnover date of the projects. To address this issue, in  February 2005, USAID implemented a project to train selected  electricity plant officials (plant managers, supervisors, and equipment  operators) in various aspects of plant operations and maintenance.  According to DOD, PCO also has awarded one contract and is  developing another to address operations and maintenance concerns. A  June 29, 2005, USAID Inspector General report stated that until the  operations and maintenance challenges are addressed at both the Iraqi  power plants and ministry levels and practices at the power plants are  significantly improved, reports of damaged equipment and  infrastructure will continue and the electrical infrastructure rebuilt and  refurbished by USAID\u2019s program will remain at risk of sustaining  damage following its transfer to the Ministry of Electricity. In comments  on our draft report, State department said that there has not been  enough focus on strengthening operations and maintenance capacity  and that such strengthering had not been a U.S. government priority in  the early phases of the reconstruction effort.", "Providing security for power plants, transmission lines, and distribution  stations is another key challenge to electricity reconstruction projects  and to meeting Iraq\u2019s electricity needs. According to U.S. agency  officials and contractors, insurgent attacks on people and infrastructure  have increased project costs and caused scheduling delays. Our  analyses of five U.S.-funded electricity sector contracts indicate that  security costs to obtain private security services and security-related  equipment as of December 31, 2004, ranged from 10 to 36 percent of  project costs. In March 2004, the United States awarded a $19 million  contract to train and equip Iraq\u2019s Electrical Power Security Service to  protect electrical infrastructure, including power plants, transmission  lines, and Ministry of Electricity officials. Although the program was  designed to train 6,000 guards over a 2-year period, fewer than 340  guards had been trained when the contract was terminated early.  According to agency reporting in April 2005, current plans are for the  Iraqi Ministry of Defense to provide mobile security for linear assets  such as transmission lines and pipelines.", "The Iraqi electricity sector will require additional financial assistance to  restore its infrastructure to meet the national needs. The Ministry of  Electricity estimates that Iraq needs about $20 billion to restore its  electricity sector, including over $3 billion to update the distribution  network system, that provides electricity from the distribution station to  the end user. The activities of the U.S. assistance program have focused  on generation, transmission, and distribution projects to improve the  electricity sector and have provided about $100 million to address the  provision of power from the distribution station to the end user.", "Effective management of electricity generation, transmission, and  distribution is affected by illegal connections to existing power lines and  the lack of metering. According to industry officials, the inability of  system operators to balance the amount of electric generation with  consumer demand can cause severe failures in both equipment and  service, as evidenced in January 2005 when the national grid collapsed  following an electrical circuit imbalance near Bayji. Further, limited and  inaccurate metering in Iraqi homes precludes the Ministry of Electricity  from measuring the amount of electricity that end users consume.  Experts indicate that the demand for electricity has increased  dramatically since UN sanctions were removed in 2003 and estimate  that the demand for electricity will exceed 8,500 megawatts this  summer.

For example, the completed delivery of USAID-funded  health kits, coupled with primary health care provider training, is  expected to result in an increase in the capability of primary health care  providers to deliver care to the Iraqi population. Although the equipment  items for these health kits were received by May 2004, the delivery of  these kits to Iraqi health clinics was still incomplete, as of May 2005.  Agency documents and officials indicated several reasons why medical  equipment had not been delivered, including long lead times for medical  equipment manufacturing and delivery, the security environment, the  timing of equipment delivery with the completion of infrastructure  construction, and the need to obtain agreement on equipment lists from  the Ministry of Health. To address the Ministry of Health\u2019s limited  capacity to accept, store, and distribute large shipments of supplies and  equipment, the PCO has developed a revised distribution plan,  according to a U.S. official. Further, as of May 2005, the construction  plans for 150 primary health clinics did not have an identified  procurement plan for backup power generators, furniture, consumable  supplies, incinerators, or a security perimeter. According to a U.S.  official, without full power supply\u2014by generators or from the power  grid\u2014these clinics will be able to provide only the most basic services  and limited or no maternal and/or pediatric services. In response to our  draft, DOD told us that they plan to build 142 primary health clinics  supplied with generators, furniture, and three months of consumables.", "IRMO has developed metrics to track the progress of the U.S. health  reconstruction program in Iraq. Limitations to the available metrics and  data make it difficult to assess the outcome of U.S. activities in the  health sector. For example, IRMO\u2019s measurements of progress track the  completion of facilities, which is an indicator of increased access to  health care. However, the measures available do not indicate how well  these facilities are equipped or staffed to provide primary health care  services. The measures used by IRMO do not relate the progress of U.S.  projects to the overall effort of improving the quality and access of  health care in Iraq."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The United States, along with its coalition partners and various  international organizations and donors, has undertaken a challenging and  costly effort to stabilize and rebuild Iraq. Over the past 2 years, the United  States, coalition partners, and, more recently the Iraqis have undertaken  and accomplished numerous activities to stabilize and rebuild Iraq,  including efforts to help restore basic essential and social services. This  enormous effort has been undertaken in an unstable security environment,  and is concurrent with the institutional development of Iraqis to govern and  secure the country. As we reported in June 2004, these challenges continue  to affect the pace and cost of reconstruction. A key challenge to the  success of the rebuilding effort will be the Iraqis\u2019 ability to sustain the  rehabilitated and new infrastructure and to address continuing  maintenance and basic service needs. U.S. reconstruction efforts include  requirements to build operational and ministerial capacity to sustain this  infrastructure. As U.S. activities that have already started reach completion  by the end of the year, the options and plans developed and actions taken  to address this challenge will be critical to the success of the U.S.  reconstruction program and the overall reconstruction effort in Iraq."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided drafts of this report to the Departments of Defense and State  and the U.S. Agency for International Development.

In particular, in response to  our statement that agency metrics for tracking water projects do not show  how the U.S. program is affecting the Iraqi people, USAID stated that the  agency tracks increases in the amount of water treated and estimates  increases in beneficiary numbers. However, these metrics do not address  the quality of water and sanitation services in Iraq, which may hinder the  U.S. ability to gauge progress toward its goal of providing essential  services. For example, because of problems with the distribution network,  water that is potable at the treatment plants may be contaminated by the  time it reaches users.", "USAID also provided technical comments, which we incorporated where  appropriate.", "We are sending copies of this report to interested congressional  committees.

U.S.  agencies provided us with electronic data files for appropriated funds, the  Development Fund for Iraq (DFI), vested assets, and seized assets. These  files generally included objective or project descriptions with allocated,  obligated, and disbursed amounts. We assigned each of the funding line  items to broad categories based on the descriptive information available in  the data files. To assign the data to a category, we relied on project  descriptions from agency data files.", "In addressing the amount of U.S. funds that have been appropriated,  obligated, and disbursed for the Iraq reconstruction effort, we collected  funding information from the Department of Defense (DOD), including the  Project and Contracting Office (PCO), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers  (USACE), and others; Department of State; the Department of the Treasury;  U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID); and the Coalition  Provisional Authority (CPA). Data for U.S. appropriated funds are as of  March 31, 2005. We also reviewed Defense Contract Audit Agency reports,  U.S. agency inspector generals\u2019 reports, Special Inspector General for Iraq  Reconstruction (SIGIR) reports, other audit agency reports, and Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) documents. Although we have not audited  the funding data and are not expressing our opinion on them, we discussed  the sources and limitations of the data with the appropriate officials and  checked them, when possible, with other information sources.

To  determine the reliability of these data, we examined the financial files and  interviewed CPA officials responsible for the data. Based on these  evaluations, we determined the data are sufficiently reliable to describe the  major deposits to the DFI and the allocations and disbursements by major  categories. We did not audit these data and are not expressing our opinion  on them. After June 28, 2004, the stewardship of the DFI was turned over to  the Iraqi Interim Government.
