The threat of WMD  proliferation was underscored in 2002 when the United States and its allies  encountered difficulties in seizing a shipment of North Korean missiles  bound for Yemen. In December 2002, the U.S. administration released its  \u201cNational Strategy to Combat Weapons of Mass Destruction,\u201d which called  for a comprehensive approach to countering such threats. The President  subsequently announced the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) in May  2003. According to the Department of State (State), PSI aims to enhance  and expand our efforts to prevent the flow of WMD, their delivery systems,  and related materials on the ground, in the air, and at sea, to and from  states and nonstate actors of proliferation concern.", "In September 2006, we issued a classified report on the PSI. The report  found that U.S. agencies did not have the policies and procedures in place  to plan and manage their PSI activities or performance indicators required  to measure the results of PSI activities. Accordingly, we recommended  that the Secretaries of Defense and State better organize their efforts for  performing PSI activities, including establishing clear PSI policies and  procedures and indicators to measure the results of PSI activities. In  addition, we recommended that the two departments develop a strategy to  work with PSI-participating countries to resolve interdiction issues.", "In August 2007, Congress passed the Implementing Recommendations of  the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 (here and after, \u201cthe law\u201d), which  specified that the President and relevant agencies and departments take a  variety of actions to expand and strengthen PSI, including implementing  our recommendations. Under a sense of Congress provision of the law,  the President is called upon to issue a directive to U.S. agencies to take  actions to expand and strengthen PSI. The law calls upon U.S. agencies to  take specific actions, namely to establish clear PSI policies and  procedures, structures, funding, and performance indicators to measure  the results of PSI activities; increase cooperation and coordination with  PSI countries; and develop a strategy to resolve interdiction issues. The  law required the President to submit a PSI implementation report by  February 2008 to relevant congressional committees. State and DOD are  required to submit a comprehensive joint budget report to Congress for  each fiscal year describing U.S. funding and other resources for PSI- related activities. Finally, Congress required GAO to assess and report on  the effectiveness of PSI, including the progress made in implementing the  provisions of the law.", "Based on these provisions, we examined the actions that the  administration and relevant U.S. agencies have taken to expand and  strengthen PSI. Specifically, this report assesses the (1) extent to which  the administration issued a PSI directive and submitted to Congress the  required PSI-related reports; (2) steps U.S. agencies have taken to  establish clear PSI policies and procedures, structures, budgets, and  performance indicators; and (3) efforts U.S. agencies have made to  increase cooperation and coordination with PSI countries and develop a  strategy to resolve interdiction issues.", "To address these objectives, we reviewed and analyzed U.S. agency  management reports, cables, and other documents. We interviewed  officials from the Departments of State, Defense, Homeland Security,  Justice, and other agencies with PSI responsibilities, including officials  and military personnel at five Combatant Commands: (1) Central  Command, (2) European Command, (3) Africa Command, (4) Southern  Command, and (5) Strategic Command\u2019s Center for Combating WMD. We  also conducted structured interviews with U.S. agency officials and  military personnel who have attended multilateral PSI planning meetings  of WMD proliferation experts. At these multilateral meetings\u2014referred to  as Operational Expert Group meetings\u2014experts from the United States  and 19 other leading PSI countries consider ways to enhance the WMD  interdiction capabilities of PSI participants, plan PSI exercises, and build  support for the initiative.

PSI encourages partnership among states to work  together to develop a broad range of legal, diplomatic, economic, military,  law enforcement, and other capabilities to prevent WMD-related transfers  to states and nonstate actors of proliferation concern. International  participation is voluntary, and there are no binding treaties on those who  choose to participate. Countries supporting PSI are expected to endorse  PSI principles, embodied in six broad goals in the Statement of  Interdiction Principles of September 2003 (see app. II) by a voluntary,  nonbinding \u201cpolitical\u201d commitment to those principles and to voluntarily  participate in PSI activities according to their own capabilities. According  to the principles, PSI participants use existing national and international  authorities to put an end to WMD-related trafficking and take steps to  strengthen those authorities, as necessary.", "The U.S. government\u2019s PSI efforts involve three broad activities:  multilateral PSI planning meetings (referred to as Operational Expert  Group meetings), participation in PSI exercises, and other outreach efforts  such as workshops and conferences.

However,  uncertainties remain about how to incorporate law enforcement agencies  into PSI exercises and track PSI expenditures. Consistent with internal  controls, establishing clear PSI policies and procedures will help the  agencies better organize their PSI activities. COCOMs generally plan,  implement, and pay for military exercises in their area of responsibility.  According to agency officials, in the past, DOD Joint Staff encouraged the  COCOMs to implement PSI exercises in addition to their scheduled  standard DOD exercise program. As a result, financial and logistical  pressures of planning and implementing PSI exercises outside their  standard exercise program discouraged COCOM participation in PSI  exercises. In March 2007, DOD Joint Staff revised its guidance to direct  COCOMs to leverage the staff, assets, and resources of the existing DOD  exercise program in support of PSI exercises. Joint Staff guidance is the  primary document setting forth PSI policy and provides procedures,  including roles and responsibilities, for the planning and execution of U.S.  military support to PSI. The guidance encourages COCOMs to put a PSI  component into existing DOD exercises and establishes a small office that  will assist COCOMs in planning and executing a PSI component.", "According to agency officials, COCOMs generally plan to include PSI  components, such as PSI-focused interdictions and boardings, into their  existing multinational exercises that regularly practice these activities and  intend to increase the complexity of PSI components in the future. For  example, since 2006, Southern Command has included a PSI component in  its multinational military exercise designed to defend the Panama Canal  against a terrorist-based threat. Agency officials stated that there is no  significant cost for including an additional PSI interdiction scenario. This  strategy helps to relieve COCOMs from developing and paying for a stand- alone PSI exercise with their operational funds and, therefore, allows  COCOMs to exercise PSI objectives more frequently.", "However, placing a PSI component in a strictly military exercise does not  allow COCOMs to exercise law enforcement issues and interagency  coordination. To address these issues, COCOMs can plan stand-alone PSI  exercises and computer-based or gaming exercises. In one case, a COCOM  is planning a stand-alone PSI exercise that will address law enforcement  issues, such as seizure and disposal of cargo, and interagency  participation. DOD officials stated that it also plans to examine these and  other law enforcement concerns in greater detail through gaming and  simulation exercises. In February 2008, DOD conducted such a simulation  using a U.S. shipboarding agreement with Malta. In June 2007, DOD  sponsored a PSI game at the Naval War College to test national  interagency processes to interdict WMD-related materials and to address  post-interdiction issues, such as disposition of seized cargo and  prosecution of proliferators.", "Although COCOM officials generally report having clear roles and  responsibilities in incorporating PSI components, they lack guidance on  how to incorporate law enforcement issues into military exercises and  track PSI expenditures. The revised Joint Staff guidance does not clearly  address some areas of COCOM responsibility. For example, to facilitate  interagency involvement, the revised Joint Staff guidance encourages  COCOMs to include law enforcement agencies in exercise planning, but  the guidance does not provide specifics on how to liaise with law  enforcement agencies. Some COCOM officials stated that they need clear  guidance on how to exercise the disposition of cargo and other law  enforcement issues. Direct coordination with either domestic or foreign  law enforcement agencies is outside of normal COCOM military function.  In one case, a PSI exercise was hosted by foreign law enforcement  agencies, but a DOD official stated that they did not have clear guidance  on how to coordinate U.S. military participation with U.S. and foreign law  enforcement agencies. Also, Joint Staff guidance calls upon COCOMs to  track PSI expenditures, personnel, and military assets used in support of  PSI activities. However, some COCOM officials stated that they typically  do not track these types of expenditures, except for PSI-related travel  costs for COCOM staff. For example, while COCOMs may submit to Joint  Staff the costs for travel to exercise planning conferences or a PSI  exercise site, as well as travel cost estimates for future activities, they  typically do not submit other costs expended on PSI stand-alone exercises  or PSI components of existing DOD exercises."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Established Some PSI Structures and Budget", "paragraphs": ["DOD has structures in place at the Office of the Secretary of Defense  (OSD), the Joint Staff, and the COCOMs to coordinate its involvement in  PSI activities.

Joint Staff assists with exercise planning and provides  COCOMs with policies and procedures to direct their participation in PSI  activities. Joint Staff also can provide COCOMs with information gathered  at multilateral PSI planning meetings to keep them informed on PSI- related developments. COCOMs plan, implement, and participate in PSI  stand-alone exercises or existing DOD exercises with PSI components  based on their mission priorities and available resources.", "DOD also has established an office to further support COCOM  involvement in PSI exercises and produce guidance on how to achieve this  goal. The March 2007 Joint Staff guidance directed Strategic Command to  develop a \u201cPSI Support Cell\u201d that educates COCOMs regarding the process  of putting a PSI component into an existing DOD exercise and helps  develop exercise scenarios that meet objectives developed at multilateral  PSI planning meetings. COCOM officials reported that they have  collaborated with the cell to incorporate PSI components into two existing  DOD exercises and, in one case, it improved the exercise\u2019s sophistication.  COCOM officials also reported that they use the cell\u2019s secure Web portal,  which integrates information for planning and implementing PSI exercises,  such as scenarios and lessons learned from previous PSI exercises. The  PSI support cell is drafting an exercise planning handbook that will detail  guidelines and best practices for use by COCOMS in designing and  conducting multilateral PSI exercises. DOD also has created public affairs  guidance to publicize exercises and other PSI activities in U.S. and  international media.", "OSD established an interagency working group that sets priorities for U.S.  agencies involved in multilateral PSI planning meetings. This interagency  working group leverages capabilities and resources of U.S. agencies  participating in PSI activities. Through this working group, OSD provides  input to the host of the multilateral meeting on the agenda and determines  which agencies will participate in the U.S. delegation. Before the  multilateral PSI planning meeting, OSD ensures that the U.S. delegation  coordinates and cooperates to reach a consensus on PSI-related issues  and resolves any disagreements. OSD requests relevant U.S. agencies to  submit briefings on agenda topics and circulates them to staff involved in  PSI to receive feedback before clearing them for presentation at the  multilateral meeting. After the multilateral meeting, OSD also oversees the  process of delegating tasks to relevant U.S. agencies and keeps track of  their progress. Agency officials reported that this informal interagency  working group is valuable because it is a regular channel for exchanging  information about PSI and setting priorities identified at multinational PSI  planning meetings among all U.S. agencies that support PSI activities.", "DOD has established an annual budget to offset COCOM costs of adding a  PSI component into existing DOD exercises and other PSI-related  expenses. However, COCOM staff responsible for arranging PSI exercises  stated that this funding level is inadequate to support stand-alone PSI  exercises. DOD has created an $800,000 annual budget (starting fiscal year  2008) that can be used by COCOMs for variety of PSI-related activities,  including upgrades to equipment used in interdictions and to engage  subject matter experts. Some COCOMs stated that this funding helped  them to attend multilateral PSI planning meetings, exercise planning  conferences, and other PSI events. These funds are not available, however,  to other U.S. agencies to host PSI events, such as PSI workshops or other  outreach events, or to cover any foreign country\u2019s costs to participate in  PSI activities. Some COCOM officials responsible for arranging PSI  exercises stated that the $800,000, which DOD has established out of  operations and maintenance funds, is sufficient to fund less-expensive PSI  activities, such as adding PSI components into existing DOD exercises,  hosting computer-simulated games or tabletop exercises. However, this  funding is inadequate to cover the costs of stand-alone PSI exercises or  large exercise planning conferences, according to these officials. For  example, one COCOM reported that it will need to request additional  funds from DOD or find additional operational funds to host a stand-alone  PSI exercise in the next 2 years.

For example, CBP and Coast Guard assisted New Zealand  with developing a PSI exercise hosted by New Zealand in September 2008.  According to agency officials, this was the first live PSI exercise mostly  focused on law enforcement issues. Agency officials stated that law  enforcement agencies of other countries, instead of their militaries, are  increasingly participating in PSI exercises. According to agency officials, it  can be challenging to find countries willing to exercise PSI law  enforcement issues with the U.S. military in an existing DOD exercise.

Agency  officials use bilateral meetings to reach agreements with other leading PSI  countries to host future multilateral PSI planning meetings, participate in  PSI exercises, or engage in outreach to countries that do not yet endorse  or support PSI. Agency officials said that the bilateral meetings have been  useful in increasing U.S. cooperation and coordination with the 19 other  leading PSI countries. Meeting bilaterally before the multilateral PSI  planning meetings allows the U.S. delegation to make arrangements with  other leading PSI countries before the large plenary session of the  multilateral PSI planning meeting begins.", "Agency officials stated that the plenary session and related breakout  sessions at multilateral meetings have been useful in increasing  cooperation and coordination with their counterparts from other leading  PSI countries. The plenary session is where the heads of the delegations  from the 20 leading PSI countries meet to discuss current PSI issues and  explain their countries\u2019 perspectives and opinions on such issues.  Following or concurrent with the plenary session, breakout sessions are  held for working-level officials to get together and discuss exercise, law  enforcement, intelligence, or legal issues in more detail.", "However, because the multilateral PSI planning meetings only include the  20 leading PSI countries (including the United States), U.S. agencies have  not built and expanded relationships in the same way with their  counterparts from the more than 70 additional PSI countries who are not  invited to attend these meetings. Agency officials acknowledged that more  needs to be done to directly engage these more than 70 additional PSI  countries."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "U.S. Agencies Have Made Efforts to Increase Cooperation and Coordination with PSI Countries through Exercises, but More Than 70 PSI Countries Are Not Always Involved", "paragraphs": ["U.S. agencies also have made efforts to increase cooperation and  coordination with PSI countries through hosting and/or participating in  PSI exercises, but countries from among the more than 70 PSI countries  who are not invited to attend multilateral meetings are not always  involved. While the United States encourages PSI supporting countries to  participate in PSI exercises, agency officials acknowledged that more  needs to be done to directly engage the PSI countries who are not invited  to attend multilateral PSI planning meetings. According to DOD, PSI  exercises are intended to test national capabilities to conduct air, ground,  and maritime interdictions; increase understanding of PSI among  participating countries; and establish interoperability among PSI  participants. The 20 leading PSI countries have established a schedule of  PSI exercises to practice and enhance collective capabilities to interdict  suspected WMD cargoes shipped by sea, air, and land. These exercises  have also included simulations and scenarios to practice country-to- country and interagency communication processes to conduct WMD  interdictions.", "Twenty-one countries have led 36 PSI exercises from September 2003  through September 2008. As figure 1 shows, these exercises have included  sea, land, and air exercises, spanning the different regions of the globe,  although more of them have been held in Europe and the Mediterranean.  Also, while the United States has led a number of the exercises, the large  majority of them have been led by other PSI countries, with European  countries leading most of these. However, only 6 of the 36 exercises held  from September 2003 to September 2008 were hosted or cohosted by  countries from among the more than 70 PSI countries who are not invited  to attend the multilateral PSI planning meetings.", "According to agency officials, U.S. agencies have used PSI exercises to  increase cooperation and coordination with PSI countries and educate  countries that have not yet endorsed PSI about the initiative. For example,  DOD officials stated that they used a U.S.-hosted September 2007 exercise  to protect the Panama Canal as a means of increasing cooperation and  coordination among the 8 PSI countries (including the United States) that  participated in it. However, of the 8 PSI countries who participated, only 3  were from among the more than 70 PSI countries who are not invited to  attend multilateral meetings. According to DOD officials, the inclusion of  PSI in existing DOD exercises also creates opportunities to educate other  countries about PSI. The September 2007 exercise was an existing DOD  exercise, which included a PSI component, and involved 9 other countries  that have not yet endorsed PSI. However, agency officials cautioned  against potential backlash from \u201coverloading\u201d existing DOD exercises with  PSI components.

At this conference,  these countries restated their support for PSI and the PSI Statement of  Interdiction Principles. State officials also stated that their outreach  efforts have included promoting the PSI when senior State officials meet  foreign representatives or make high-level country visits. In addition,  agency officials said the United States and other leading PSI countries  sometimes engage in ad hoc outreach activities to other PSI countries  before or after multilateral PSI planning meetings, such as a 1-day  outreach session with Middle Eastern PSI countries after the February  2008 multilateral meeting in London, England.", "Also, State is continuing to seek international agreements, such as PSI  shipboarding agreements, with input from the U.S. Coast Guard. These  legally binding bilateral agreements, between the United States and other  countries, facilitate bilateral, reciprocal cooperation by establishing the  authorities and procedures the parties use to confirm and authorize flag  state consent to board and search each other\u2019s vessels suspected of  carrying WMD and related materials. Since PSI was announced in 2003, the  United States has signed a total of nine PSI shipboarding agreements,  including agreements with Malta, Mongolia, and the Bahamas since we  issued our report in 2006. In addition, as we reported in September 2006,  the United States helped negotiate an amendment to the Convention on  the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Maritime  Navigation that criminalizes WMD proliferation activities. The amendment  also created an international framework for nations that are party to the  amended convention to board ships believed to be engaged in WMD  proliferation activities. Agency officials said that the amended convention  was sent to the Senate for review in October 2007, and the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee voted favorably on it on July 29, 2008. According to  agency officials, the Senate gave its advice and consent to the ratification  of the amended convention on September 25, 2008. The administration  awaits congressional enactment of the necessary implementing legislation.  With the success of amending the maritime convention, U.S. agencies, with  other members of the International Civil Aviation Organization, are  currently examining ways to amend the Montreal Convention of 1971, to  criminalize the airborne transportation of WMD and related materials.", "Other U.S. agencies have also made some efforts to increase cooperation  and coordination with PSI countries through outreach activities.

Also, through the recently established Africa  command, DOD officials, in consultation with State, have contacted some  North African political officials on enhancing their involvement in PSI  activities, including exercises. The FBI sponsored a workshop in 2006 to  train law enforcement officials from the 19 other leading PSI countries to  identify WMD items. According to agency officials, attendance of  representatives from the 19 other leading PSI countries at the conference  led to improved relationships between the United States and these  countries, and these relationships are still yielding benefits.

These agreements provide  expedited procedures for obtaining authorization to board and search ships  suspected of transporting proliferation-related cargo.", "GAO Statement:  The Administration has not issued a PSI directive that  directs U.S. agencies to establish clear PSI authorities, structures, roles,  responsibilities, policies and procedures, including budget requests for PSI  activities.  In its implementation report to Congress in July 2008, the  Administration stated it is unnecessary to issue a directive for PSI because it  believes that an existing WMD interdiction process, documented in an 8- page 2002 National Security Presidential Directive, already addresses the  relevant issues that would be covered under a PSI directive.", "Response:  As was the case in 2006, all U.S. PSI activities are conducted via  an extensive interagency coordination process through a policy coordination  committee chaired by National Security Council (NSC) staff, implementing  clearly defined strategy documents that established agency roles,  responsibilities, and common goals.  In its PSI implementation report to  Congress of July 2008, the Administration stated it does not consider issuing  an additional Presidential directive to be necessary in order to continue  expanding and strengthening the PSI.  The Administration continues to hold  this view.  A classified National Security Presidential Directive governs the  interdiction process.", "The report correctly notes that there is no single Administration budget  request for the PSI.  In fact, the PSI was designed to be not a single, distinct  program, but rather a set of activities interwoven into the USG\u2019s established  diplomatic, military, and law enforcement relations with other countries.  In  addition, many existing programs, missions, international agreements and  frameworks promote the same objectives as the PSI without being narrowly  defined as part of the PSI.  It should remain the responsibility of each agency  to determine whether it can accomplish its PSI objective best by establishing  a budget line item for PSI activities.", "GAO Statement:  The existing WMD interdiction process covers how U.S.  agencies should coordinate U.S. government efforts to conduct WMD  interdictions.  However, this process predates the creation of PSI and does  not cover U.S. agencies\u2019 involvement in three broad PSI activities: multilateral planning meetings, exercises, and other outreach efforts.", "Response:  Presidential directives set out broad U.S. Government policy and  goals.  Such a document is neither appropriate nor necessary to administer  the details of USG agencies\u2019 work on PSI Operational Experts Group  meetings, PSI exercises, PSI outreach, and WMD-related interdictions.   USG agencies are working together closely and continuously on these PSI  activities, via an extensive interagency coordination process through a policy  coordination committee chaired by National Security Council (NSC) staff.", "GAO Statement:  U.S. agencies have not established performance indicators  to measure the results of PSI activities.", "Response:  Standard Department of State procedures are followed regarding  indicators to measure program results for State\u2019s work on the PSI.  There are  certain unclassified PSI activities that can be quantified, which State uses as  indicators to measure the Initiative\u2019s progress as required in the annual  Strategic Plan of the Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation  (ISN).  These are:  increases in the number of countries endorsing the PSI;  the number and complexity of PSI exercises conducted around the world;  and the conclusion of PSI shipboarding agreements.", "The Department of State requires evidence of countries\u2019 endorsement of the  PSI Statement of Interdiction Principles in order to consider them to be PSI  participants.  Such evidence can take the form of a diplomatic note to the  U.S. or to another PSI partner state, a public statement of endorsement, or  representation at a meeting of PSI participating states.  Use of this clear  criterion allowed the Department to begin publishing in 2006 a list of PSI  participants on the State website.", "GAO Statement:  State officials stated that they measure PSI progress by the  number of endorsing PSI countries; the number and complexity of PSI  exercises around the world; and the number of PSI shipboarding  agreements.  However, it is difficult to attribute these high-level outcomes to  the PSI activities of U.S. agencies because these outcomes are dependent on  the actions of other governments as well.", "Response:  The mission of the Department of State is to conduct  international diplomacy in support of U.S. foreign policy goals, where all  outcomes depend on the actions of other governments.  State\u2019s PSI activities  are no exception, as the GAO\u2019s previous report highlighted.  State uses these  performance indicators because we are confident that the results would not  have occurred without our efforts.", "GAO Statement:  State and DOD have not developed a written strategy to  resolve interdiction issues.  Agency officials stated that the involvement of  the U.S. delegation at the multilateral meetings is part of an attempt to  resolve these issues.", "Response:  U.S. agencies have developed tools and use standard procedures  to plan and execute interdictions.  To deal with issues arising as a result of  interdictions that have taken place, we have not found it feasible or effective  to develop a single, comprehensive written strategy, because every  interdiction case is unique and each must be dealt with on a case-by-case  basis depending on the specific circumstances.  U.S. agencies are familiar  with the tools and resources available to deal with the issues that come up.   Subject matter experts from across the USG consult and coordinate courses  of action to address each WMD-related interdiction case, guided by  Presidential Directives and agency procedures.", "Because interdictions involve other countries, resolving interdiction issues is  a task the U.S. cannot accomplish by itself.  The PSI is based on the concept  of cooperation and coordination among PSI partners in countering WMD- related trafficking, each utilizing the national authorities available to it.  All  PSI activities are aimed at strengthening such cooperation and coordination.", "GAO Statement: State has an existing structure but does not have policies,  procedures, or a budget in place for PSI activities.", "Response:  The Department of State does have policies and procedures in  place for its PSI activities, although they are not all recorded in a single  document.  State updates its PSI plans and strategies frequently to take  developments into account.", "The Department of State has provided funding to support four complex  interdiction-related PSI exercises hosted by PSI partners Poland and  Ukraine, as authorized under section 504(a) of the FREEDOM Support Act  and the Nonproliferation and Disarmament Fund\u2019s (NDF) expanded  authority under the Nonproliferation, Anti-terrorism, Demining and Related  Programs (NADR).  Apart from these line items, the ISN Bureau\u2019s operating  budget has been sufficient to fund the expenses for State\u2019s PSI activities.", "In order to ensure that Department of State activities related to the PSI and  interdiction are properly coordinated, in late 2005 the Department created  the Office of Counterproliferation Initiatives.  This Office is responsible for  all State Department PSI activities, as part of its counterproliferation  diplomacy mission.  As noted in its Mission Statement, the Office of  Counterproliferation Initiatives develops and conducts diplomatic outreach  to prospective PSI participants, informs current participants of PSI events,  and works on broadening their participation; participates in negotiation of  ship-boarding and other relevant international agreements and  understandings; and facilitates State support to the PSI Operational Experts  Group.  Most important, this Office routinely interfaces with foreign  governments on WMD-related interdictions and the disposition of seized  cargo.", "GAO Statement: International  participation is voluntary and there are  no binding treaties on those who choose to participate.", "Response:  It is correct that PSI participation is voluntary.  Of course, the  actions of PSI participants must be consistent with their national legal  authorities and relevant international law.  The PSI is part of the overall  international nonproliferation framework that includes the international  nonproliferation treaties \u2013 such as the NPT, CWC, and BWC, to which most  countries are parties.  The Law of the Sea and the Chicago Conventions  govern the actions of PSI countries in the maritime and air domains,  respectively.  In addition, the UN Security Council resolutions addressing  North Korea\u2019s and Iran\u2019s WMD-related activities, as well as UNSC  Resolution 1540, are legally binding on all UN Member states.  Finally, our  bilateral PSI shipboarding agreements with other countries are binding on  the Parties.", "GAO Statement:  The multilateral PSI planning meetings themselves have no  compliance mechanisms.", "Response:  The term \u201ccompliance\u201d indicates legal obligations.  The meetings  of the 20-nation OEG are not based on or involved with establishing legal  obligations, so it is meaningless to refer to compliance mechanisms in this  context.  The operational experts meet to discuss and resolve issues related  to interdictions, and to plan exercises and outreach events.  This forum for  experts to meet regularly with their counterparts from other countries has  proven very valuable for strengthening the PSI network and the collective  body of knowledge about how to effectively interdict proliferation-related  trafficking.  We are working on ways to expand the benefits of the OEG to  all PSI countries by holding more regionally-focused meetings.", "GAO Statement:  The United States helped negotiate an amendment to the  Convention on the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of  Maritime Navigation that criminalizes WMD proliferation  activities\u2026Agency officials said that the amended convention was sent to the  Senate for review in October 2007, and the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee voted favorably on it on July 29, 2008.  It is now awaiting full  Senate action.", "Update:  The Senate gave its advice and consent to the ratification of the  2005 Protocols to the Convention of the Suppression of Unlawful Acts  against the Safety of Maritime Navigation on September 25, 2008 (source:   Congressional Record).  The Administration welcomes the Senate\u2019s action,  and awaits Congressional enactment of the necessary implementing  legislation before the U.S. can deposit its instruments of ratification.", "The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the Department of State\u2019s letter  dated October 17, 2008."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1.

Appendix IV provides information on the shipboarding agreements the  United States has signed with other countries.  4.  As we stated in our report, the existing WMD interdiction process  covers how U.S. agencies should coordinate U.S. government efforts to  conduct WMD interdictions.

As noted in our report, the WMD interdiction process predates the  creation of PSI and does not cover U.S. agencies\u2019 involvement in three  broad PSI activities: multilateral planning meetings, exercises, and  other outreach efforts.  6.  We reaffirm the recommendation from our 2006 report that DOD and  State should better organize their efforts for performing PSI activities,  including establishing indicators to measure the results of PSI  activities. As we stated in our report, a good internal control  environment calls for agencies to create their own means to monitor  and evaluate their own efforts to enable them to identify areas needing  improvement. Further, a good internal control environment requires  assessing both ongoing activities and separate evaluations of  completed activities and should assess quality of performance over  time.  7.  See response (6) above.  8.  State has not worked with DOD to implement the second  recommendation from our 2006 report, as called for in the law. While  acknowledging the unique characteristics of each interdiction, we  reaffirm our prior recommendation. The recurring interdiction issues  that are beyond the control of the United States, as noted in our 2006  classified report, demonstrate the need for a written strategy to resolve  these issues.  9.  While State said that it has PSI policies and procedures that are not  recorded in a single document, it did not provide GAO any evidence of  its written PSI policies and procedures.  10.
