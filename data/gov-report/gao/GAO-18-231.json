In contrast to prior rounds, which focused  on the goal of reducing excess infrastructure, DOD\u2019s goals for BRAC  2005 also included transforming the military and fostering joint activities  across the military departments. In the department\u2019s BRAC 2005 report,  the Secretary of Defense stated that BRAC 2005 provided DOD a unique  opportunity to address new challenges posed by international terrorism,  the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, ungoverned areas,  rogue states, and nonstate actors. By implementing the 198  recommendations approved by the 2005 BRAC Commission, DOD closed  23 major bases, realigned 24 major bases, combined 26 installations into  12 joint bases, and eliminated about 12,000 civilian positions. After  implementing these BRAC 2005 recommendations, in 2017 DOD  estimated that it continued to have significant excess capacity remaining.  To address remaining excess capacity, between 2013 and 2017 DOD  requested additional BRAC rounds and, in February 2018, stated that it  would work with Congress to find common areas where reforms and  changes could be made. Congress has not authorized additional BRAC  rounds to date.", "Since 2005, we have issued more than 40 reports and testimonies on  BRAC 2005 planning, implementation, costs, and savings; this work  highlights information DOD can use to improve its process for developing  and implementing BRAC recommendations. For example, in our March  2013 report on lessons learned from the BRAC 2005 round, we found that  DOD\u2019s process for providing the BRAC Commission with cost and  savings estimates was hindered by underestimating requirements.  Additionally, we found that DOD did not fully anticipate information  technology requirements for many of the BRAC recommendations. Our  report made several recommendations designed to improve any future  BRAC rounds and suggested legislative changes that Congress should  consider to enhance its oversight of any future BRAC rounds. Of the 10  recommendations in the March 2013 report, DOD generally concurred  with 5. According to DOD officials, DOD has not taken any actions  because these recommendations can only be implemented if another  round of BRAC is conducted.", "Since 1997, we have designated DOD infrastructure as a high-risk area,  noting that reducing the cost of DOD\u2019s excess infrastructure activities is  critical to the department making use of scarce resources and maintaining  high levels of military capabilities. In GAO\u2019s 2017 high-risk update, we  reported on DOD\u2019s need for improvement in reducing excess  infrastructure, which included disposing of and consolidating facilities  under the BRAC process and improving how DOD uses its facilities. We  noted that DOD has demonstrated leadership by requesting more rounds  of BRAC\u2014its primary method for reducing excess infrastructure.  However, we stated that DOD needs to take additional action on some of  our recommendations related to implementing any future BRAC rounds,  such as improving DOD\u2019s ability to estimate potential liabilities and  savings to achieve desired outcomes.

To calculate the excess infrastructure disposed of as a result  of BRAC 2005, we reviewed the square footage and plant replacement  value data from DOD\u2019s Cost of Base Realignment Actions model.  However, DOD\u2019s data were incomplete, and we determined they were not  sufficiently reliable to conduct this calculation, as discussed later in this  report.", "To assess the extent that DOD implemented prior GAO recommendations  on BRAC 2005 and addressed any additional challenges faced in BRAC  2005 to improve performance for any future BRAC round, we reviewed  our prior reports and testimonies to identify recommendations made.

We also met with officials to identify what additional  challenges they faced from BRAC 2005 and what opportunities exist to  improve any future BRAC round. For the purposes of this report, we used  DOD documentation and interviews to identify and divide our assessment  of the BRAC 2005 process into three phases: the analysis phase from  2001 to 2005, the implementation phase from 2005 to 2011, and the  disposal phase from 2005 to the present. For the analysis phase, we  reviewed available military departments\u2019 lessons-learned documents. For  the implementation phase, we reviewed business plans supporting the  implementation of the BRAC 2005 recommendations and other applicable  documentation, such as a workforce planning study and an environmental  impact statement affecting the implementation of some  recommendations. For the disposal phase, we analyzed DOD\u2019s caretaker  costs for closed bases that it has not yet transferred.

In testimony before the BRAC Commission in May  2005, the Secretary of Defense said that DOD collected approximately 25  million pieces of data as part of the BRAC 2005 process. Given the  extensive volume of requested data, we noted in July 2005 that the data- collection process was lengthy and required significant efforts to help  ensure data accuracy, particularly from joint cross-service groups that  were attempting to obtain common data across multiple military  components. We reported that, in some cases, coordinating data  requests, clarifying questions and answers, controlling database entries,  and other issues led to delays in the data-driven analysis DOD originally  envisioned.

Moreover,  25 of the 26 military units or organizations we met with stated that they  did not measure the achievement of BRAC 2005 goals. The one  exception in our selected sample was the command at Joint Base  Charleston, which stated that it measured jointness through common  output or performance-level standards for installation support, as required  for installations affected by the BRAC 2005 recommendation on joint  basing. By measuring jointness, officials were able to identify that the  base met 86 percent of its common output level standards in the second  quarter of fiscal year 2017, and it has identified recommendations to  improve on those standards not met.", "Instead of measuring the achievement of BRAC 2005 goals, officials with  ASD (EI&E) and the military departments stated that they tracked  completion of the BRAC recommendations by the statutory deadline of  September 2011 and measured the cost savings associated with the  recommendations. Senior ASD (EI&E) officials stated that the primary  measure of success was completing the recommendations as detailed by  the implementation actions documented in the business plans. In  addition, officials from the Army, Navy, and Air Force stated that they  measured the savings produced as a result of BRAC 2005. For example,  Army officials stated that closing bases in BRAC 2005 significantly  reduced base operations support costs, such as by eliminating costs for  trash collection, utilities, and information technology services. However,  tracking completion of the recommendations and measuring savings did  not enable the department to determine the success of the BRAC round  in achieving its goals. For example, tracking completion of the  recommendations establishing joint training centers did not give DOD  insight into whether the military departments achieved the jointness goal  by conducting more joint activities or operations. Similarly, measuring  savings did not allow DOD to know whether it achieved the goal of  reducing excess infrastructure, and in reviewing DOD\u2019s data we found  that the department ultimately did not have the needed data to calculate  excess infrastructure disposed of during BRAC 2005. Key practices on  monitoring performance and results highlight the importance of using  performance measures to track an agency\u2019s progress and performance,  and stress that performance measures should include a baseline and  target; should be objective, measurable, and quantifiable; and should  include a time frame.

Specifically, they stated that the data  showed an overall estimate of Fort Knox\u2019s excess capacity, but the  data did not detail that the excess was not contiguous but rather  based on space at 40 buildings spread throughout the installation.  The officials stated that there was no way to communicate to decision  makers during the data collection process that the facilities were ill- suited for relocating the Human Resources Command and would  require significant renovation costs to host the command\u2019s information  technology infrastructure. The officials said that, because the needed  details on the facility data were not communicated, the relocation  moved forward without full consideration of alternatives for using  better-suited excess space at other locations that would not require  significant costs to renovate. As a result, the Army ultimately  constructed a new headquarters building for the Human Resources  Command at Fort Knox and DOD spent approximately $55 million  more than estimated to complete this action.", "Officials at the Naval Consolidated Brig Charleston, South Carolina,  told us that the lack of communication outside of the data-collection  process resulted in decision makers not taking into account declining  numbers of prisoners, leading to the construction of a new, oversized  building in which to house prisoners. The officials said that the  decision makers analyzing the facilities data did not consider the  current correctional population; rather, the decision makers  considered a correctional model based on the type of military fielded  in World War II and the Korean and Vietnam wars\u2014a force comprised  of conscripted personnel that served longer tours and had higher  correctional needs. Further, the officials said the decision makers did  not consider that, in the 2000 to 2005 period, DOD increased the use  of administrative separations from military service rather than  incarcerate service members convicted of offenses, such as drug- related crimes or unauthorized absence, further reducing correctional  needs. The officials said they did not have a mechanism to  communicate this information outside of the data-collection process  when decision makers were analyzing the facilities data. As a result,  the BRAC Commission recommendation added 680 beds throughout  the corrections system, increasing the Navy\u2019s total confinement  capacity to 1,200 posttrial beds. Specifically at Naval Consolidated  Brig Charleston, the BRAC recommendation added 80 beds at a cost  of approximately $10 million. However, the facility already had excess  capacity prior to the 2005 BRAC recommendation, and its excess  capacity further increased after adding 80 beds (see fig. 2).", "Air National Guard officials said that the lack of communication  outside of the data-collection process in the BRAC analysis phase  meant that they could not identify the specific location of excess  facilities. Specifically, they said the facilities data showed that  Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska, had sufficient preexisting space to  accept units relocating from Kulis Air Guard Station, Alaska, a base  slated for closure. However, without communicating with base  officials, Air National Guard officials did not know that the space was  not contiguous. As a result, officials stated that DOD ultimately  needed to complete additional military construction to move the  mission from Kulis Air Guard Station.

Navy officials said that, with limited communication, there were  shortfalls in the decision-making process. Overall, officials from ASD  (EI&E) and the military departments agreed that communication could be  improved in the analysis phase of any future BRAC round.

For example:", "During the implementation process, a final environmental impact  statement at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, contributed to the decision  that only a portion of the initial proposed aircraft and operations would  be established to fulfill the Joint Strike Fighter Initial Joint Training Site  recommendation. Marine Corps officials stated that as a result of this  environmental impact statement and the subsequent limitations, the  Marine Corps decided to eventually move its training from Eglin Air  Force Base to Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort, South Carolina.  Despite these limitations, the Air Force constructed infrastructure for  the Marine Corps\u2019 use at Eglin Air Force Base in order to fulfill the  minimum legal requirements of the recommendation. Specifically, the  BRAC 2005 recommendation realigned the Air Force, Navy, and  Marine Corps portions of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Initial Joint  Training Site to Eglin Air Force Base. The Air Force\u2019s goal and the  initial proposal for the Joint Strike Fighter Initial Joint Training Site at  Eglin Air Force Base was to accommodate 107 F-35 aircraft, with  three Air Force squadrons of 24 F-35 aircraft each, one Navy  squadron with 15 F-35 aircraft, and one Marine Corps squadron of 20  F-35 aircraft. In 2008, after the implementation phase began, DOD  completed an environmental impact statement for the proposed  implementation of the BRAC recommendations at Eglin Air Force  Base. Based on the environmental impact statement and other  factors, a final decision was issued in February 2009, stating that the  Air Force would only implement a portion of the proposed actions for  the recommendation, with a limit of 59 F-35 aircraft and reduced  planned flight operations due to potential noise impacts, among other  factors. This decision stated that the subsequent operational  limitations would not be practical for use on a long-term basis but  would remain in place until a supplemental environmental impact  statement could be completed. After the final supplemental  environmental impact statement was released, in June 2014 DOD  decided to continue the limited operations established in the February  2009 decision.", "Marine Corps officials stated that, as a result of the February 2009  decision, the Marine Corps decided that it would eventually move its  F-35 aircraft from Eglin Air Force Base to Marine Corps Air Station  Beaufort. According to Marine Corps officials, by September 2009  the Marine Corps had developed a concept to prepare Marine Corps  Air Station Beaufort to host its F-35 aircraft. A September 2010 draft  supplemental environmental impact statement included updated  operational data and found that the Marine Corps total airfield  operations at Eglin Air Force Base would be reduced by 30.7 percent  from the proposals first assessed in the 2008 final environmental  impact statement. However, to abide by the BRAC recommendation,  Marine Corps officials stated that the Marine Corps temporarily  established an F-35 training squadron at Eglin Air Force Base in April  2010. Using fiscal year 2010 military construction funding, DOD spent  approximately $27.7 million to create a landing field for use by the  new Marine Corps F-35 training squadron mission at Eglin Air Force  Base. Marine Corps officials stated that this construction occurred  during the same period as the decision to relocate the F-35 training  squadron to Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort. However, ASD  (EI&E) officials stated that they did not know about this mission- related change, adding that they expected any change to be reported  from the units to the responsible military department through the chain  of command. However, the military departments did not have  guidance to report in the business plans to ASD (EI&E) these mission- related changes during implementation; without this guidance, the  changes related to the Marine Corps F-35 mission were not relayed to  ASD (EI&E) through the Air Force. Officials from the Joint Strike  Fighter training program at Eglin Air Force Base stated that this  construction was finished in June 2012 and that it was never used by  the Marine Corps. In February 2014, the Marine Corps F-35 training  squadron left Eglin Air Force Base and was established at Marine  Corps Air Station Beaufort. The Marine Corps does not plan on  returning any F-35 aircraft from Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort to  Eglin Air Force Base for joint training activities.", "Additionally, officials from the Armed Forces Chaplaincy Center stated  that studies undertaken during the implementation phase determined  that it would be difficult to fulfill the intent of a recommendation  creating a joint center for religious training and education, yet the  recommendation was implemented and included new construction  with significantly greater costs than initial estimates. The BRAC 2005  recommendation consolidated Army, Navy, and Air Force religious  training and education at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, establishing a  Joint Center of Excellence for Religious Training and Education. Prior  to the construction of facilities to accommodate this recommendation,  the Interservice Training Review Organization conducted a study  published in November 2006 that assessed the resource  requirements and costs of consolidating and colocating the joint  chaplaincy training at Fort Jackson. This study identified limitations in  the feasibility of consolidating a joint training mission for the chaplains,  including differences within the services\u2019 training schedules and the  limited availability of specific administrative requirements for each  service, as well as limited instructors and curriculum development  personnel. Despite the results of this study, in 2008 an  approximately $11.5 million construction project began to build  facilities for the Joint Center of Excellence for Religious Training and  Education. However, ASD (EI&E) officials stated that they did not  know about the results of the study. The military departments did not  have guidance to report these mission-related changes, which  ultimately were not relayed from the units to ASD (EI&E). Officials  from the Armed Forces Chaplaincy Center stated that following the  start of construction to accommodate the recommendation, the  services completed additional studies in 2008 and 2011 that further  identified limitations to the feasibility of joint training for the services\u2019  chaplains. Overall, the services discovered that 95 percent of the  religious training could not be conducted jointly. Moreover, the military  departments have faced additional impediments to their respective  missions for religious training and education. For example, the Army  stated it could not house its junior soldiers alongside the senior Air  Force chaplaincy students, and both the Navy and Air Force had to  transport their chaplains to other nearby bases to receive service- specific training. Due to these challenges, officials from the Armed  Forces Chaplaincy Center stated that the Air Force chaplains left Fort  Jackson and returned to Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama, in 2017,  and the Navy has also discussed leaving Fort Jackson and returning  to Naval Station Newport, Rhode Island.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government emphasizes the  importance of monitoring the changes an entity faces so that the entity\u2019s  internal controls can remain aligned with changing objectives,  environment, laws, resources, and risks. During the implementation  phase of BRAC 2005, DOD did not have specific guidance for the military  services to monitor mission-related changes that added difficulties to  fulfilling the intent of BRAC recommendations. The Office of the Secretary  of Defense required BRAC recommendation business plans to be  submitted every 6 months and include information such as a listing of all  actions needed to implement each recommendation, schedules for  personnel movements between installations, updated cost and savings  estimates based on better and updated information, and implementation  completion time frames. In addition, in November 2008, the Deputy Under  Secretary of Defense (Installations and Environment) issued a  memorandum requiring the military departments and certain defense  agencies to present periodic status briefings to the Office of the Secretary  of Defense on implementation progress and to identify any significant  issues impacting the ability to implement BRAC recommendations by the  September 15, 2011, statutory deadline. The 6-month business plan  updates and the memorandum on periodic briefings focused primarily on  changes affecting the ability to fully implement the BRAC  recommendations and on meeting the statutory deadline, but they did not  provide specific guidance to inform ASD (EI&E) of mission-related  changes that arose from unforeseen challenges during the  implementation phase.", "According to a senior official with ASD (EI&E), if the organization  responsible for a business plan identified a need to change the plan to  fulfill the legal obligation of the recommendation by the statutory deadline,  ASD (EI&E) reviewed any proposed changes through meetings with  stakeholders involved in implementation. According to this official, the  office typically only got involved with the implementation if the business  plan was substantively out of line with the intent of the recommendation  or if there was a dispute between two DOD organizations, such as two  military departments. The official stated that any installation-level  concerns had to be raised to the attention of ASD (EI&E) through the  responsible military department\u2019s chain of command. If a mission-related  change was not raised through the military department\u2019s chain of  command, then ASD (EI&E) officials were not always aware of the details  of such changes. ASD (EI&E) officials acknowledged that they did not  know about all mission-related changes during implementation, such as  with the Joint Strike Fighter recommendations, and they stated that there  was no explicit guidance informing the military departments to report  challenges and mission-related changes to ASD (EI&E). Senior officials  from ASD (EI&E) stated that additional guidance would be appropriate in  the event of any future BRAC round. This lack of specific guidance to  monitor and report mission-related changes that arose during BRAC 2005  implementation ultimately resulted in inefficient use of space and extra  costs for DOD. Without providing specific guidance to monitor and report  mission-related changes that require significant changes to the  recommendation business plans, DOD will not be able to effectively  monitor the efficient use of space and the costs associated with  implementing any future BRAC recommendations.

As of October 2017, DOD had implemented 4 of  the recommendations, with actions on 8 others pending. Our previous  recommendations relate to three primary issues: guidance for  communities managing the effects of the reduction or growth of DOD  installations, the environmental cleanup process for closed properties,  and the process for reusing closed properties for homeless assistance.  Appendix V provides more information on our recommendations, DOD\u2019s  response, and DOD\u2019s actions to date concerning the BRAC disposal  phase.", "During our review, we identified an additional example of challenges in  the disposal phase related to the environmental cleanup process.  Specifically, officials representing Portsmouth, Rhode Island, stated that  the city had issues with the environmental cleanup process resulting from  BRAC 2005 changes at Naval Station Newport, Rhode Island. According  to the site\u2019s environmental impact statement, the land Portsmouth is to  receive is contaminated and requires cleanup prior to transfer, and  officials from the community stated that the Navy has not provided them  with a clear understanding of a time frame for the environmental cleanup  process needed to transfer the property. However, a senior official from  the Navy stated that uncertainties in available funds and unforeseen  environmental obstacles are common and prevent the Navy from  projecting specific estimates for environmental cleanup time frames. The  officials representing Portsmouth stated that, due to the lack of  information from the Navy on a projected time frame for cleaning and  transferring the property, representatives in the community have begun to  discuss not wanting to take over the land and letting the Navy hold a  public sale. We had previously recommended in January 2017 that DOD  create a repository or method to record and share lessons learned about  how various locations have successfully addressed environmental  cleanup challenges. DOD concurred and actions are pending.", "Moreover, during our review we identified additional examples of  challenges in the disposal phase related to the homeless assistance  program. For example, officials representing the community of  Wilmington, North Carolina, stated that they had issues with the  homeless-assistance process regarding a closed Armed Forces Reserve  Center. According to the officials, they did not know that there were legal  alternatives to providing on-base property for homeless assistance.  Wilmington officials stated that the city would have been willing to  construct a homeless-assistance facility in a nonbase location, and use  the closed property for a different purpose, which would have expedited  the overall redevelopment process. According to the officials, the  organization that took over the property for homeless-assistance  purposes lacks the financial means to complete the entire project plan,  and as of July 2017 it remains unfinished. We had previously  recommended that DOD and the Department of Housing and Urban  Development\u2014which, with DOD, develops the implementing regulations  for the BRAC homeless-assistance process\u2014include information on legal  alternatives to providing on-base property to expedite the redevelopment  process, but DOD did not concur and stated no action is expected.  Additionally, officials from New Haven, Connecticut, stated that the  process of finding land suitable for a homeless assistance provider and  converting an Army Reserve Center into a police academy took an  undesirably long amount of time to complete. The officials stated that the  process of preparing its redevelopment plan and transferring the property  from DOD to the community lasted roughly 5 years from 2008 to 2013,  and they suggested streamlining or expediting this process.", "As a result of these types of delays, many properties have not yet been  transferred from DOD to the communities, and undisposed properties  continue to increase caretaker costs. As of September 30, 2016, DOD  had received approximately $172 million in payments for transfers, and it  had spent approximately $275 million for caretaker costs of buildings and  land prior to transferring property on closed installations during BRAC  2005. Implementing our prior recommendations related to the BRAC  environmental cleanup and homeless-assistance process could help  DOD expedite the disposal of unneeded and costly BRAC property,  reduce its continuing fiscal exposure stemming from continuing to hold  these properties, and ultimately improve the effectiveness of the disposal  phase."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DOD has long faced challenges in reducing unneeded infrastructure, and  on five different occasions DOD has used the BRAC process to reduce  excess capacity and better match needed infrastructure to the force  structure and to support military missions. In addition to using BRAC to  reduce excess capacity, DOD also sought to promote jointness across  the military departments and realign installations in the 2005 round,  making the round the biggest, costliest, and most complex ever. While  DOD finished its implementation of BRAC 2005 in September 2011 and  continues to prepare some remaining sites for disposal, it did not  measure whether and to what extent it achieved the round\u2019s goals of  reducing excess infrastructure, transforming the military, and promoting  jointness. Because it did not measure whether the BRAC actions  achieved these goals, DOD cannot demonstrate whether the military  departments have improved their efficiency or effectiveness as a result of  the BRAC 2005 actions. In October 2017, DOD officials stated the  department does not plan to take action on our March 2013  recommendation to measure goals for any future BRAC round. Congress  can take steps to improve its oversight of any future BRAC round,  specifically by requiring DOD to identify and track appropriate measures  of effectiveness. Congress would have enhanced information to make  decisions about approving any future BRAC rounds, while DOD would be  in a stronger position to demonstrate the benefits it achieves relative to  the up-front implementation costs incurred for holding any future BRAC  rounds.", "In addition, challenges in the analysis, implementation, and disposal  phases of BRAC 2005 led to unintended consequences, such as  increases in costs, workforce recruitment issues, and delayed disposal of  closed properties. Limited or restricted communications throughout  different levels of authority in the department during data collection  hampered the ability of decision makers to receive as much relevant  information as possible during BRAC 2005. If Congress authorizes any  future BRAC round, ASD (EI&E) can encourage clear and consistent  communication throughout DOD during the analysis phase, thereby  helping personnel to address any potential problems that may arise. In  addition, without specific guidance to monitor mission-related changes  during the BRAC implementation phase, DOD did not fulfill the intent of  some recommendations and spent millions of dollars to build  infrastructure that was ultimately unused or underutilized. This lack of  specific guidance meant that ASD (EI&E) was not aware of all mission- related changes. By instituting improvements to the analysis,  implementation, and disposal phases in any future BRAC round, DOD  could better inform decision making, better ensure that its infrastructure  meets the needs of its force structure, and better position itself to gain  congressional approval for additional rounds of BRAC in the future."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matter for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["Congress should consider, in any future BRAC authorization, a  requirement for DOD to identify appropriate measures of effectiveness  and to track the achievement of its goals.

Congress enacting a  requirement for DOD to identify appropriate measures of effectiveness  and to track the achievement of its goals, alongside the requirement to  prioritize military value, would address DOD\u2019s concern about subverting a  statutory requirement related to military value.

We disagree with DOD\u2019s statement  that we relied on the perceptions of lower-level personnel. We obtained  perceptions from senior personnel in the various military organizations  deemed by DOD leadership to be the most knowledgeable. We then  corroborated these perceptions with those from senior officials from the  military departments, along with evidence obtained from the Air Force and  Army lessons-learned reports. Moreover, DOD stated that the ability to  gather data was not limited by the nondisclosure agreements or an  inability to communicate with those participating in the BRAC process.

We also tried to calculate the excess infrastructure disposed  of during BRAC 2005; however, DOD\u2019s data were incomplete.  Specifically, in reviewing the square footage and plant replacement value  data from DOD\u2019s Cost of Base Realignment Actions model, we found that  data from several bases were not included. Additionally, a senior official  with the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy,  Installations, and Environment stated the data provided were not the most  current data used during BRAC 2005 and the office did not have access  to the complete data.

To identify the communities surrounding closed bases, we  focused our review on the 23 major DOD installations closed in the BRAC  2005 round and their surrounding communities. For BRAC 2005, DOD  defined major installation closures as those that had a plant replacement  value exceeding $100 million. We used information from our 2013 report,  which identified the major closure installations. We then defined the  \u201ccommunity\u201d surrounding each major installation by (1) identifying the  economic area in DOD\u2019s Base Closure and Realignment Report, which  linked a metropolitan statistical area, a metropolitan division, or a  micropolitan statistical area to each installation, and then (2) updating  those economic areas based on the most current statistical areas or  divisions, as appropriate. Because DOD\u2019s BRAC report did not identify  the census area for the Galena Forward Operating Location in Alaska or  the Naval Weapons Station Seal Beach Detachment in Concord,  California, we identified the town of Galena as within the Yukon-Koyukuk  Census Area and the city of Concord in the Oakland-Hayward-Berkeley,  CA Metropolitan Division, and our analyses used the economic data for  these areas.

We assessed the reliability of these  data by reviewing U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and U.S. Bureau of  Economic Analysis documentation regarding the methods used by each  agency in producing their data and found the data to be sufficiently  reliable to report 2016 annual unemployment rates and 2006 through  2016 real per capita income growth. We used unemployment and  annualized real per capita income growth rates as key performance  indicators because (1) DOD used these measures in its community  economic impact analysis during the BRAC location selection process  and (2) economists commonly use these measures in assessing the  economic health of an area over time. While our assessment provides an  overall picture of how these communities compare with the national  averages, it does not isolate the condition, or the changes in that  condition, that may be attributed to a specific BRAC action.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2017 to March 2018 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
