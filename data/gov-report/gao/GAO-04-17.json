While some modest fluctuations in enrollment are to be expected, regional offices had differing definitions of unacceptable underenrollment, and the approaches they used to identify it were either not timely or not systematic. The regional offices identified a total of about 7 percent of grantees as unacceptably underenrolled in 2001-02, significantly less than the percentage of grantees reporting enrollment ratios below 100 and 95 percent on ACF's survey of grantees. As a result of differences in regional definitions of what constitutes an unacceptable level of underenrollment, grantees with similar levels of underenrollment may be treated differently across regions. ACF regional officials and officials of underenrolled Head Start grantees often cited a mixture of factors that made it difficult to achieve full enrollment, including increased parental demand for full-day child care, a decrease in the number of eligible children, facilities-related problems, and more parents seeking openings with other sponsors of early education and care. ACF national and regional offices and grantees all report taking action to address underenrollment through the issuance of guidance, increased monitoring by regional offices, and more aggressive outreach attempts by grantees. The ACF national office issued a memo in April 2003 that instructed regional offices to address underenrollment with a variety of measures depending on its causes. While this guidance was clear on the actions to be taken, it lacked clear criteria for prioritizing grantees for corrective actions. Also, while many grantees we spoke with had taken steps to address underenrollment, some told us of their concern to maintain total funded enrollment levels, even as they were converting unfilled part-day openings to full-day. While 18 of the 25 grantees we contacted had made progress toward full enrollment, others cited continuing problems."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Head Start is the largest federal early childhood program, funded at about  $6.7 billion in fiscal year 2003. Created in 1965, Head Start is designed to  prepare poor children for school by providing a comprehensive set of  developmental services. The Administration for Children and Families  (ACF) of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)  administers the program. Over the last decade, the Head Start program has  expanded substantially. Between fiscal years 1990 and 2002,  appropriations for Head Start quadrupled from $1.6 billion to over   $6.5 billion, and the number of children served increased by 69 percent  from about 540,000 to over 910,000.", "Over the past decade, significant changes to Head Start\u2019s environment may  have created challenges for some Head Start grantees when they tried to  find children to fill funded slots. For example, in the 1990s there was a  decline in welfare caseloads following welfare reform and a decline in the  number of children living in poverty, which may have decreased the  number of children eligible for Head Start. At the same time, the  expansion of other federal and state early childhood programs may have  increased child care options available to Head Start-eligible families.  Consequently, it is possible that federally funded Head Start slots in some  areas remain unfilled even while eligible children elsewhere remain on  waiting lists. Given these potential challenges, and in anticipation of Head  Start\u2019s reauthorization, you asked that we determine the extent to which  Head Start grantees were underenrolled and that we identify potential  causes of underenrollment. As agreed with your offices, our review  addresses: (1) what is known about the extent to which Head Start  programs are underenrolled, (2) what factors may have contributed to  underenrollment, and (3) what actions ACF and grantees have taken to  address underenrollment.", "To determine what is known about the extent to which Head Start  programs are underenrolled, we attempted to verify the accuracy of  national enrollment data, interviewed ACF headquarters officials, and  reviewed federal guidance and regulations on enrollment. Because we  determined that national enrollment data were not reliable and because  the regional offices have primary responsibility for identifying and  addressing underenrollment, we surveyed all 10 ACF regional offices and  the American Indian-Alaska Native Program Branch. We asked them to  identify the threshold below which they consider underenrollment to be  unacceptable and to identify grantees with enrollment levels beneath this  threshold. To gather further details on the process by which regions  identify and address underenrollment, we interviewed regional officials in  3 regions\u2014region III (covering Delaware, the District of Columbia,  Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia), region V (Illinois,  Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin), and region IX  (Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada, and the Pacific Insular Areas)\u2014 selected on the basis of geographical representation and the number of  underenrolled grantees they reported to us. To determine what factors  ACF officials and Head Start grantees believed contributed to  underenrollment and to identify actions they took to address it, we  surveyed all 10 ACF regional offices and the American Indian-Alaska  Native Program Branch office, selected and interviewed 25 grantees  identified by regional offices as unacceptably underenrolled, and  conducted site visits to 3 regional offices listed above. We performed our  work between May and October 2003 in accordance with generally  accepted government accounting standards. Appendix I further describes  our scope and methodology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Head Start was designed to help break the cycle of poverty by providing  comprehensive educational, social, health, nutritional, and psychological  services to low-income children. Head Start is authorized to serve children  at any age prior to compulsory school attendance. Originally, the program  was aimed at 3- to 5-year-olds. A companion program begun in 1994, Early  Head Start, made these services available to children from birth to 3 years  of age as well as to pregnant women. Head Start and Early Head Start  programs are administered by ACF, which funds and monitors more than  1,500 grantees through its 10 regional and 2 branch offices. (See fig. 1)  ACF\u2019s national office has responsibility for overseeing and providing  guidance to the regional offices, as well as for administering and collecting  annual survey data from grantees.", "Head Start grantees include community action agencies, school systems,  for-profit and nonprofit organizations, other government agencies, and  tribal governments or associations. Also, many Head Start grantees  provide services by subcontracting with other organizations, known as  delegate agencies. In fiscal year 2002, Head Start grantees served more  than 912,000 children, a 69 percent increase over the number of children  served in 1990. Head Start has traditionally been a part-day, part-year  program, but currently serves more children on a full-day basis, which is  defined as 6 hours or more a day, than on a part-day basis. Approximately  47 percent of children served by Head Start were enrolled in a center- based full-day program for 6 hours or more a day. Less than 20 percent of  children enrolled in Head Start receive 8 hours or more of center-based  services a day. As of 2001-02, about 44 percent of Head Start children were  enrolled in a part-day center-based program. Figure 2 shows the  percentages of Head Start services provided on a full-day or part-day basis.", "Head Start funds are allotted among the states based on their 1998  allocation and, for funds exceeding that amount, by formula based on the  number of children in each state under the age of 5 from families whose  income is below the federal poverty level. Head Start grantees are  required to provide at least 20 percent of annual program funding, which  can include in-kind contributions, such as facilities for holding classes.  During the award process, Head Start grantees receive from ACF regional  officials their level of funded enrollment\u2014the number of children the  grantee is to serve.", "Head Start regulations require that at least 90 percent of the children  enrolled in Head Start come from families with incomes at or below the  federal poverty guidelines, from families receiving public assistance, or  from families caring for a foster child. While the poverty guidelines are  firm, grantees have some flexibility in determining income eligibility. For  example, grantees can use the 12 months prior to the month the family  applied to Head Start or the previous calendar year as a basis for  determining income eligibility. Also, once a family is determined to be  eligible in 1 program year, it is considered eligible for the subsequent  program year, for a total of 2 years. Additionally, families that participate  in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program (TANF) or the  Supplemental Security Income program (SSI) or that care for a foster  child are eligible for Head Start services even when family income exceeds  the poverty guidelines. Grantees may fill up to 10 percent of their slots  with children from families that exceed the low-income guidelines.", "An enrollment occurs when a Head Start program officially accepts a child  and completes all necessary steps to begin providing services. If a child is  chronically absent and the grantee cannot serve the child in another way,  the child\u2019s slot is considered vacant. Once a slot is vacant, the grantee  generally must fill it within 30 days to be considered fully enrolled.  Consequently, actual enrollments can fluctuate somewhat throughout  funding periods. Head Start regulations require grantees to track program  attendance on a daily basis. However, grantees are asked to annually  report enrollment levels for any 2 months they choose as part of ACF\u2019s  annual Program Information Report (PIR) survey. ACF regions may  require grantees to report enrollment data more frequently.", "Head Start regulations require grantees to maintain enrollment at 100  percent of the funded level and regional offices have primary  responsibility for identifying and addressing underenrollment. However,  as a practical matter, not all grantees are able to continually sustain  enrollment at the fully funded level. Underenrollment can occur for a  variety of reasons and can vary from month to month in a given program.  Therefore, before deciding that underenrollment is unacceptable and  taking action, the regions take into consideration a variety of factors about  underenrollment, including its level and duration, its causes, and the  actions taken by grantees to address it.", "The number of children eligible for Head Start services on the basis of  being below the poverty line has decreased over the last decade, falling  from over 6 million children in 1992 to just over 4 million in 2000. By 2002,  the number of children under age 6 living in poverty had increased to  nearly 4.3 million. Over the same period, Head Start enrollment has  increased to over 910,000 children\u2014a level that is significantly below the  number of children living in poverty. (See fig. 3.) However, it should be  noted that Head Start predominately serves children ages 3 and 4, who  make up only a portion of all children under 6 living in poverty.", "In addition, during the 1990s, the number of other federal and state  programs offering services to low-income children increased substantially.  For example, welfare reform in 1996 greatly expanded the Child Care  Development Fund (CCDF) and also allowed TANF funds to be used for  child care. For fiscal years 1997 through 2002, these programs increased  their investment in children; CCDF spending increased from $2.5 billion to  $6.4 billion and TANF spending on child care increased from $13 million to  $1.6 billion. (See fig. 4.) On the state level, one study cited by the  Congressional Research Service (CRS) found that state spending on  prekindergarten programs increased from about $700 million in 1991-92 to  about $1.7 billion in 1998-99. Over the same period, the number of  children served by these programs has increased from 290,000 to 725,000.", "Expanding federal and state early childhood programs has increased the  need for coordination to better ensure that services are provided in a  complementary fashion. One way that Head Start encourages coordination  is by requiring all grantees to periodically prepare community assessments  that analyze trends in the number of eligible children in their jurisdictions  and assess the other early childhood services provided in the area. While  grantees are not required to coordinate with other service providers, ACF  has issued guidance encouraging grantees to coordinate with other  providers in order to provide more full-day services. Also, in recent years,  ACF has used some Head Start expansion money to build partnerships  with child care providers to deliver full-day, full-year services. As another  way to increase coordination, HHS has been authorized since 1998 to  provide additional funds to states to encourage such collaboration."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Extent to Which Head Start Programs Are Underenrolled is Not Known", "paragraphs": ["The extent to which Head Start programs are underenrolled is unknown  because ACF does not collect accurate national data and it does not  monitor grantee enrollment in a uniform or timely way.

For 6 underenrolled grantees, we found they  underreported their enrollment ratio by an average of 25 percent. We also  found that 2 overenrolled grantees had erroneously reported enrollment  ratios that were over 200 percent. A similar review by ACF of 75 grantees  and delegate agencies that had reported particularly high or low  enrollment levels found that approximately half had erroneously reported  their actual numbers.

Of 11 regional offices we surveyed, we found that 3 did not utilize a  specific threshold to distinguish between acceptable and unacceptable  underenrollment, while the other 8 offices used different thresholds. Each  of the 3 regions that did not have a set threshold for \u201cunacceptable\u201d  underenrollment indicated that underenrollment was treated on a case-by- case basis that would take into consideration the degree of  underenrollment and other factors, including the grantee\u2019s efforts to  increase enrollment.

Conversely, while most  regional officials we surveyed said that they rely on periodic discussions  with grantees to identify underenrolled grantees, regional officials we  visited said that they do not systematically discuss enrollment levels with  grantees during this process. Officials from one region we interviewed also  said that enrollment data included in grant re-funding applications are not  informative because the data are based on forecasts. Also, while surveyed  officials listed the PIR data as a key resource, those we spoke with said it  was not necessarily accurate or timely due to the fact that data arrive after  the subsequent program year has begun.

Similarly, of the 25 grantees we contacted, 11 cited this  factor. Regional officials and grantees suggested the movement from  welfare to work affected enrollments in two ways. First, as many parents  began to work full-time, they increasingly needed full-day care. When  Head Start grantees could not meet this need, some eligible families  secured child care elsewhere. Second, some families entered work and  earned income that disqualified their children from Head Start programs.  A number of grantees related specific examples of how the movement  from welfare to work affected enrollments. For example,    A large grantee in Illinois said that many former welfare recipients who  need full-day child care services no longer qualify for Head Start because  they earn wages just above the Head Start income guidelines or work  rotating schedules to avoid using formal child care services.", "A grantee in California said that the cost associated with switching to full- day care sometimes is a barrier to meeting families\u2019 needs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Construction Delays and Inadequate Facilities Affected Enrollments", "paragraphs": ["Of the 25 underenrolled grantees we surveyed, 14 reported that difficulty  acquiring and developing adequate facilities contributed to  underenrollment.

The  guidance instructs regional officials to address underenrollment  depending on four possible causes. For example, if the grantee can  demonstrate that an inappropriate program option is causing  underenrollment, the guidance instructs regions to carefully consider  grantee requests to make changes to their services, such as converting  current part-day slots to full-day slots. The four causes identified in the  guidance and the recommended actions are summarized in table 5.", "The April guidance does not suggest any systematic process for identifying  underenrolled grantees, nor does it specify criteria for prioritizing when  grantees should be subject to corrective action based on their level of  underenrollment.

Officials in all 11 regions responded that they  had taken at least one action to ensure that grantees address  underenrollment. The interventions taken most often were to monitor  enrollment levels (55 grantees), track improvement efforts (43), and  provide training and technical assistance (30). Notably, 4 regions provided  additional funds to a total of 18 underenrolled grantees to purchase or  renovate facilities. Somewhat less often, regions took action to reduce  funded enrollment levels or recoup funds. Specifically, only 2 regions  reported that they recouped funds from a total of 6 underenrolled  grantees. (See table 6.)", "As noted earlier, many regions and grantees said the need for full-day  services was a major factor fostering underenrollment. As part of their  efforts to assist grantees in providing more full-day services, some ACF  regional officials told us they had encouraged grantees to collaborate with  other programs or had provided additional funds to purchase or renovate  facilities. However, such efforts can be costly.

Most grantees we contacted said that they had taken one or more actions.  The most frequently mentioned was more aggressive recruiting followed  by collaboration with other programs. For example, a large grantee in New  York State that faced increased demand for full-day care since welfare  reform collaborated increasingly with other child care providers to piece  together a package of full-day services. Nine grantees also reported trying  to increase physical facilities capacity. (See table 7.)

According to region V officials, this concern to maintain  enrollment levels may be in keeping with national efforts to serve a greater  number of needy children. For example, one underenrolled grantee said  that ACF suggested several alternatives to address underenrollment,  including converting part-day to full-day slots, but would not permit the  grantee to reduce funded slots as a way to address underenrollment.

These 18 grantees overcame a variety of  factors that they said affected underenrollment. For example, 6 of these 18  grantees overcame a shortage of available full-day slots and 8 managed to  fill slots lost due to a decline in eligible children attributed to declining  TANF rolls. The 7 grantees that had not made progress addressing  underenrollment often cited similar issues.

While we could not determine with any precision the extent to  which there is underenrollment, our survey work and analysis indicate it is  possible that underenrollment is more widespread than ACF has  acknowledged. The complexity of factors buffeting Head Start grantees  underscores the need for ACF to accurately identify underenrollment and  its causes on a timely basis. Even if ACF corrects national survey data  issues, there is no guarantee that its regions will know of underenrollment  in a timely manner because the main national data source is not available  until the following program year.", "Furthermore, because ACF regions vary in how they define unacceptable  levels of underenrollment and because they rely on approaches to identify  grantees that are not timely or consistent, there is some indication that  Head Start grantees with similar levels of underenrollment are treated  differently across regions. ACF guidance to the regions on how to address  different types of underenrollment is a good first step toward a more  systematic approach to underenrollment. However, until ACF issues  guidance that more clearly explains how to prioritize grantees with  varying levels of underenrollment for purposes of corrective action,  regions are likely to continue using varied criteria or none at all. Also, until  more timely and systematic approaches are developed for regions to  identify underenrolled grantees, it is possible that low enrollment will go  undetected and federal dollars will not be fully utilized for low-income  children who could benefit from Head Start\u2019s program goals.", "Finally, it appears that there may be a perceived incentive for  underenrolled grantees to maintain or increase enrollments due, in part, to  ACF\u2019s emphasis on counting the total number of children served  irrespective of whether they are enrolled part-day or full-day. Measuring  Head Start enrollments without capturing the difference in level of service  provided by full-day or part-day programs adds to the difficulty of meeting  local needs and adjusting to changes in those needs. Until ACF can get a  better grasp of the nature and size of underenrollment and align program  incentives with family needs, it may be a challenge for Head Start to best  meet the needs of some families it could serve."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of HHS direct ACF to (1) take steps to  ensure the accuracy of enrollment data reported in its annual nationwide  survey of grantees, (2) develop a standard criterion for regional offices to  use in identifying grantees whose underenrollment merits monitoring or  corrective actions, (3) develop an additional measure of aggregate services  other than total enrollment that takes into consideration the different  levels of service provided by full-day and part-day programs, and (4) work  with regional offices to develop a more systematic process for them to  collect reliable enrollment data during the program year so that they can  address underenrollment more quickly."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Department of Health and Human  Services for review and comment.
