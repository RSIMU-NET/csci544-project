As you know, the radio-frequency spectrum is used to provide an  array of wireless communications services that are critical to the U.S.  economy and various government missions, such as national security.  Demand for radio-frequency spectrum has exploded over the past several  decades as new technologies and services have been\u2014and continue to  be\u2014brought to the market in the private sector, and new mission needs  unfold among government users. As a result, nearly all parties are  becoming increasingly concerned about the availability of spectrum for  future needs because most of the usable spectrum in the United States has  already been allocated to existing services and users. Compounding this  concern is evidence that some of the spectrum is currently underutilized.  Many parties believe that spectrum management reform\u2014such as greater  reliance on market-based mechanisms that invoke the forces of demand  and supply\u2014is essential to meeting the growing and unpredictable  demand for spectrum.", "My statement today will identify (1) the extent to which the Federal  Communications Commission (FCC) has adopted market-based  mechanisms for commercial uses of spectrum, (2) the extent to which  market-based mechanisms have been adopted for federal government use  of spectrum, (3) options for improving spectrum management, and (4)  potential barriers to spectrum reform.

Market-based mechanisms can help promote  the efficient use of spectrum by invoking the forces of supply and  demand\u2014that is, they provide users an incentive to use the spectrum as  efficiently as possible. Examples of market-based mechanisms include  introducing flexibility in the use of spectrum, using auctions to assign  licenses, and enhancing the use of secondary markets as a means for  companies to obtain access to spectrum. FCC has adopted these  mechanisms for commercial uses. For example, although FCC currently  employs largely a command-and-control process for spectrum allocation,  it has provided greater flexibility within certain spectrum bands.

It is the medium that makes wireless communications  possible and supports a vast array of commercial and governmental  services. Commercial entities use spectrum to provide a variety of wireless  services, including mobile voice and data, paging, broadcast radio and  television, and satellite services. Additionally, some companies use  spectrum for private tasks, such as communicating with remote vehicles.  Federal, state, and local agencies also use spectrum to fulfill a variety of  government missions. For example, state and local police departments,  fire departments, and other emergency services agencies use spectrum to  transmit and receive critical voice and data communications, and federal  agencies use spectrum for varied mission needs such as national defense,  law enforcement, weather services, and aviation communication.", "Spectrum is managed at the international and national levels. The  International Telecommunication Union (ITU), a specialized agency of the  United Nations, coordinates spectrum management decisions among  nations. Spectrum management decisions generally require international  coordination, since radio waves can cross national borders. Once  spectrum management decisions are made at the ITU, regulators within  each nation, to varying degrees, will follow the ITU decisions. In the  United States, responsibility for spectrum management is divided between  two agencies: FCC and NTIA. FCC manages spectrum use for nonfederal  users, including commercial, private, and state and local government users  under authority provided in the Communications Act. NTIA manages  spectrum for federal government users and acts for the President with  respect to spectrum management issues. FCC and NTIA, with direction  from the Congress, jointly determine the amount of spectrum allocated to  federal and nonfederal users, including the amount allocated to shared  use.", "Historically, concern about interference or crowding among users has  been a driving force in the management of spectrum. FCC and NTIA work  to minimize interference through two primary spectrum management  functions\u2014the \u201callocation\u201d and the \u201cassignment\u201d of radio spectrum.  Specifically:    Allocation involves segmenting the radio spectrum into bands of  frequencies that are designated for use by particular types of radio  services or classes of users. For example, the frequency bands between 88  and 108 megahertz (MHz) are allocated to FM radio broadcasting in the  United States. In addition to allocation, FCC and NTIA also specify service  rules, which include the technical and operating characteristics of  equipment.", "Assignment, which occurs after spectrum has been allocated for  particular types of services or classes of users, involves providing a license  or authorization to use a specific portion of spectrum to users, such as  commercial entities or government agencies. FCC assigns licenses for  frequency bands to commercial enterprises, state and local governments,  and other entities, while NTIA makes frequency assignments to federal  agencies.", "When FCC assigns a portion of spectrum to a single entity, the license is  considered exclusive. When two or more entities apply for the same  exclusive license, FCC classifies these as mutually exclusive  applications\u2014that is, the grant of a license to one entity would preclude  the grant to one or more other entities. For mutually exclusive  applications, FCC has primarily used three assignment mechanisms\u2014 comparative hearings, lotteries, and auctions. FCC historically used  comparative hearings, which gave competing applicants a quasi-judicial  forum in which to argue why they should be awarded a license instead of  other applicants. In 1981, partially in response to the administrative  burden of the comparative hearing process, the Congress authorized the  use of lotteries, which allowed FCC to randomly select licenses from the  qualified applicant pool.  The Congress provided FCC with authority to  use auctions to assign mutually exclusive licenses for certain subscriber- based wireless services in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993.  Auctions are a market-based mechanism in which FCC assigns a license to  the entity that submits the highest bid for specific bands of spectrum. As  of November 30, 2005, FCC has conducted 59 auctions for over 56,000  licenses to select between competing applications for the same license,  which have generated over $14.5 billion for the U.S. Treasury. However,  only a very small portion of total licenses has been auctioned. (See fig. 1.)", "In some frequency bands, FCC authorizes unlicensed use of spectrum\u2014 that is, users do not need to obtain a license to use the spectrum. Rather,  an unlimited number of unlicensed users can share frequencies on a non- interference basis. Thus, the assignment process does not apply to the use  of unlicensed devices. However, manufacturers of unlicensed equipment  must receive authorization from FCC before operating or marketing an  unlicensed device."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FCC Has Adopted Several Market-Based Mechanisms for Commercial Uses", "paragraphs": ["To promote the more efficient use of spectrum, FCC is incrementally  adopting market-based approaches to spectrum management.

That is, FCC applies regulatory judgments to  determine and limit what types of services\u2014such as broadcast, satellite, or  mobile radio\u2014will be offered in different frequency bands by geographic  area. In addition, for most frequency bands FCC allocates, the agency  issues service rules to define the terms and conditions for spectrum use  within the given bands. These rules typically specify eligibility standards  as well as limitations on the services that relevant entities may offer and  the technologies and power levels they may use. These decisions can  constrain users\u2019 ability to offer services and equipment of their choosing.", "However, FCC has provided greater operational and technical flexibility  within certain frequency bands. For example, FCC\u2019s rules for Commercial  Mobile Radio Service (CMRS), which include cellular and Personal  Communications Services (PCS), are considered less restrictive. Under  these rules, wireless telephony operators are free to select technologies,  services, and business models of their choosing. FCC has not provided  comparable flexibility in other bands. For example, spectrum users have  relatively little latitude for making similar choices in frequency bands  allocated to broadcast television services.", "Further, the Spectrum Policy Task Force Report, a document produced by  FCC staff, identified two alternatives to the command-and-control model:  the \u201cexclusive, flexible rights\u201d model, and the \u201copen-access\u201d model. The  exclusive, flexible rights model provides licensees with exclusive, flexible  use of the spectrum and transferable rights within defined geographic  areas. This is a licensed-based approach to spectrum management that  extends the existing allocation process by providing greater flexibility  regarding the use of spectrum, and the ability to transfer licenses or to  lease spectrum usage rights. The open-access model allows a potentially  unlimited number of unlicensed users to share frequency bands, with  usage rights governed by technical standards, but with no rights to  interference protection. This approach does not require licenses, and as  such is similar to FCC\u2019s Part 15 rules (which govern unlicensed use in the  900 MHz, 2.4 GHz, and 5.8 GHz bands)\u2014where cordless phones and Wi-Fi  technologies operate. Both models allow flexible use of spectrum, so that  users of spectrum, rather than FCC, play a larger role in determining how  spectrum is ultimately used. FCC\u2019s Spectrum Policy Task Force  recommended a balanced approach to allocation\u2014utilizing aspects of the  command-and-control; exclusive, flexible rights; and open-access models.  FCC is currently using elements of these two alternatives models, although  it primarily employs the command-and-control model."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FCC\u2019s Use of Auctions for Commercial Licenses Is Seen as an Improvement Over Past Assignment Mechanisms", "paragraphs": ["In 1994, FCC began using auctions\u2014a market-based mechanism that  assigns a license to the entity that submits the highest bid for specific  bands of spectrum.

For example:    Auctions are a relatively quick assignment mechanism. With auctions, FCC  reduced the average time for granting a license to less than 1 year from the  initial application date, compared to an average time of over 18 months  with comparative hearings.", "Auctions are administratively less costly than comparative hearings.  Entities seeking a license can reduce expenditures for engineers and  lawyers arising from preparing applications, litigating, and lobbying; and  FCC can reduce expenditures associated with reviewing and analyzing  applications.", "Auctions are a transparent process. FCC awards licenses to entities  submitting the highest bid rather than relying on possibly vague criteria, as  was done in comparative hearings.", "Auctions are effective in assigning licenses to entities that value them the  most. Alternatively, with lotteries, FCC awarded licenses to randomly- selected entities.", "Auctions are an effective mechanism for the public to realize a portion of  the value of a national resource used for commercial purposes. Entities  submitting winning bids must remit the amount of their winning bid to the  government, which represents a portion of the value that the bidder  believes will arise from using the spectrum.", "As we reported in December 2005, many industry stakeholders we  contacted, and panelists on our expert panel, stated that auctions are more  efficient than previous mechanisms used to assign spectrum licenses. For  example, among our panelists, 11 of 17 reported that auctions provide the  most efficient method of assigning licenses; no panelist reported that  comparative hearings or lotteries provided the most efficient method. Of  the remaining panelists, several suggested that the most efficient  mechanism depended on the service that would be permitted with the  spectrum."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FCC Has Acted to Facilitate Secondary Market Transactions", "paragraphs": ["While FCC\u2019s initial assignment mechanisms provide one means for  companies to acquire licenses, companies can also acquire licenses or  access to spectrum through secondary market transactions. Through  secondary markets, companies can engage in transactions whereby a  license or use of spectrum is transferred from one company to another.  These transactions can incorporate the sale or trading of licenses. In some  instances, companies acquire licenses through the purchase of an entire  company, such as Cingular\u2019s purchase of AT&T Wireless. Ultimately, FCC  must approve transactions that result in the transfer of licenses from one  company to another.", "Secondary markets can provide several benefits. First, secondary markets  can promote more efficient use of spectrum. If existing licensees are not  fully utilizing the spectrum, secondary markets provide a mechanism  whereby these licensees can transfer use of the spectrum to other  companies that would utilize the spectrum. Second, secondary markets  can facilitate the participation of small businesses and introduction of new  technologies. For example, a company might have a greater incentive to  deploy new technologies that require less spectrum if the company can  profitably transfer the unused portion of the spectrum to another company  through the secondary market. Also, several stakeholders with whom we  spoke noted that secondary markets provide a mechanism whereby a  small business can acquire spectrum for a geographic area that best meets  the needs of the company.", "In recent years, FCC has undertaken actions to facilitate secondary-market  transactions. FCC authorized spectrum leasing for most wireless radio  licenses with exclusive rights and created two categories of spectrum  leases: Spectrum Manager Leasing\u2014where the licensee retains legal and  working control of the spectrum\u2014and de Facto Transfer Leasing\u2014where  the licensee retains legal control but the lessee assumes working control  of the spectrum. FCC also streamlined the procedures that pertain to  spectrum leasing. For instance, the Spectrum Manager Leases do not  require prior FCC approval and de Facto Transfer Leases can receive  immediate approval if the arrangement does not raise potential public  interest concerns. While FCC has taken steps to facilitate secondary  market transactions, some hindrances remain.

However,  imposing fees will make the cost visible to agency managers, thus  providing them information they need if they are to manage spectrum use  more efficiently. Whether more efficient spectrum use actually occurs will  depend in part on whether agencies receive appropriations for the full  amount of the fees or only for some portion.

While new users of spectrum view relocations as  essential, incumbent users often oppose relocations because the moves  may impose significant costs and disrupt their operations. A third source  of conflict relates to existing technology and emerging technology. Some  new technologies, such as ultra wideband, may use the spectrum more  efficiently, thereby facilitating more intensive use of the spectrum.  However, users of existing technology, both commercial and government,  have expressed concern that these new technologies may create  interference that compromises the quality of their services.", "The current spectrum management framework may pose a barrier to  spectrum reform because neither FCC nor NTIA has ultimate authority to  impose fundamental reform and these stakeholder conflicts cross the  jurisdictions of both FCC and NTIA. As such, contentious and protracted  negotiations arise over spectrum management issues. We previously made  two recommendations to help further the reform process. First, we  recommended that the Secretary of Commerce and FCC should establish  and carry out formal, joint planning activities to develop a national  spectrum plan to guide decision making. Additionally, we also  recommended that the relevant administrative agencies and congressional  committees work together to develop and implement a plan for the  establishment of an independent commission that would conduct a  comprehensive examination of current spectrum management. To date,  neither recommendation has been implemented."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["With authorization from Congress, FCC has taken several steps to  implement a more market-oriented approach to spectrum management. In  recent years, FCC has taken actions to facilitate secondary-market  transactions. FCC authorized spectrum leasing for most wireless radio  licenses with exclusive rights and also streamlined the procedures that  pertain to spectrum leasing. In addition, FCC has conducted 59 auctions  for a wide variety of spectrum uses, including personal communications  services and broadcasting. FCC\u2019s auctions have contributed to a vibrant  commercial wireless industry. The Congress\u2019 recent decision to extend  FCC\u2019s auction authority was, in our opinion, a positive step forward in  spectrum reform. However, more work is needed to ensure the efficient  and effective use of this important national resource. To help reform  spectrum management, we have previously recommended that (1) the  Secretary of Commerce and FCC should establish and carry out formal,  joint planning activities to develop a national spectrum plan to guide  decision making; and (2) the relevant administrative agencies and  congressional committees work together to develop and implement a plan  for the establishment of a commission that would conduct a  comprehensive examination of current spectrum management. To date,  these recommendations have not been implemented.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared statement.
