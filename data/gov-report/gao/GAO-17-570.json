IoT devices, or \u201csmart\u201d  devices, are increasingly being used to communicate and process  information to an extent that was not possible before. For example, a  \u201csmart\u201d thermostat may allow a homeowner not only to remotely adjust  the home\u2019s temperature, but also gather data on motion, temperature,  and light, and analyze those data to automate the thermostat to respond  to changes in the home\u2019s environment and use. Recent advancements in  IoT-related technologies, such as the decreasing cost and size of  electronics and the expansion of connectivity (e.g., broadband networks  and Wi-Fi) have allowed not only individuals and businesses, but also  governments and communities, to use connected objects to gather and  communicate new types and quantities of information.", "As a result of these advances, communities\u2014both at home and abroad\u2014 are increasingly deploying projects with IoT devices, generally with a goal  of improving livability, management, service delivery, or competitiveness.  These projects can be targeted to specific community goals. For example,  \u201csmart\u201d traffic lights may collect and evaluate real-time traffic information  to update traffic signals\u2019 timing to reflect current traffic conditions, with the  goal of improving traffic flow by easing congestion and reducing vehicles\u2019  emissions. IoT-enabled garbage cans can signal waste removal teams  when cans are full, streamlining the routes that garbage trucks take and  reducing wear and tear on roads due to unnecessary trips by these heavy  trucks.", "Researchers and industry stakeholders have noted that integrating  technologies and projects so that they work in concert with one another is  key to realizing the full potential of IoT applications. The goals of different  sectors of the community\u2014such as energy efficiency, mobility for  underserved populations, or improved public health\u2014are often  interconnected in such a way that integrating IoT projects and systems  may save resources and enable solutions that address multiple goals at  once. In the example above, the smart traffic lights that are deployed by  communities to improve traffic flow may also lead to reduced vehicle  emissions, targeting a secondary goal of improving air quality and public  health.", "The U.S. government has shown increased interest in supporting IoT in  communities, in part to harness the economic potential; help address  anticipated challenges, such as risks to privacy or security; and promote  replicability\u2014that is, make it easier for projects in one community to be  deployed in other communities. Over the past 22 months, the White  House announced more than $240 million in federal investments for  research and technology to support making communities \u201csmarter.\u201d And  on January 12, 2017, the former administration issued for public comment  a draft federal strategic plan for smart cities and communities that  provides a high-level framework to guide and coordinate federal efforts  supporting IoT in communities.

How selected communities are using federal funds to deploy IoT  projects, including any challenges they face in integrating those  projects.", "To identify the kinds of efforts that selected federal agencies have  undertaken to support IoT in communities, we reviewed documents and  interviewed officials from 11 selected federal agencies that we identified  as having a key role in providing such support, including those that  support research or community IoT efforts, oversee privacy or security  protections and threats, or have direct authority over IoT issues. The 11  selected agencies include the following: the Departments of Commerce  (Commerce), Energy (DOE), Health and Human Services (HHS),  Homeland Security (DHS), Justice (DOJ), and Transportation (DOT), as  well as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Federal  Communications Commission (FCC), Federal Trade Commission (FTC),  National Science Foundation (NSF), and Office of Science and  Technology Policy (OSTP). We collected and synthesized information on  current or recent major efforts these agencies identified as supporting the  application of IoT in communities. The efforts discussed in this report are  not an exhaustive list of such federal efforts.", "To identify how selected communities are using federal funds to deploy  IoT projects and any challenges they face in integrating those projects,  we conducted semi-structured interviews by telephone or in person with  representatives from multiple stakeholders groups in four communities  that are using federal efforts to implement IoT projects\u2014Chattanooga,  Tennessee; Chicago, Illinois; Columbus, Ohio; and Portland, Oregon. We  selected these four communities to include a range of city sizes and  locations and communities with projects that used federal support and  involved multiple community sectors (e.g., energy, transportation, public  safety), as well as experience in successfully and unsuccessfully seeking  federal funds. The experiences of the selected communities are not  generalizeable to those of all U.S. communities; however, we believe that  the information provides a balanced and informed perspective on the  topics discussed.", "We also reviewed information on the European Commission\u2019s efforts  supporting IoT in communities and selected European communities\u2019  experiences with deploying IoT projects. We reviewed available  documents from and conducted interviews by telephone or in person with  representatives from European Union (EU) to better understand how its  efforts align with the United States\u2019 efforts, given the EU\u2019s experience with  supporting IoT in communities. We selected the European Union and  select member states based on criteria that included the relative maturity  of efforts compared to the United States; similarity to U.S. governance  structure; and the availability of information about projects and  governmental support. Specifically, we interviewed multiple stakeholder  groups in three selected European communities\u2014Eindhoven, The  Netherlands; Gothenburg, Sweden; and Stockholm, Sweden. We also  interviewed officials from the European Commission (Directorate-General  for Communications Networks, Content, and Technology) and Sweden\u2019s  Ministry of Enterprise and Innovation.", "In addition, we interviewed 11 representatives from industry associations,  consulting companies, academia, and industry vendors to obtain  perspectives on domestic and foreign efforts to support IoT in  communities and any challenges faced by communities in using these  efforts. We selected these representatives, based on our review of  background material and recommendations from others, concerning their  expertise and involvement in IoT efforts. We also reviewed literature from  the last 4 years in peer-reviewed journals, trade publications, and  conferences, among other professional resources, to identify federal and  international efforts related to IoT in communities, as well as any analyses  of communities\u2019 projects.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2015 to July 2017  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["IoT has no generally accepted, all-inclusive definition. Instead, IoT is  generally described as a concept referring to how connected devices  interact and process information. The devices themselves are generally  not computers, but have embedded components that connect to a  network. We define IoT for the purposes of our report as the concept of  connecting and interacting with a wide array of objects through a  network. An IoT-enabled object is often referred to as a \u201csmart\u201d or a  \u201cconnected\u201d device, which allows that object to communicate and  potentially process information and thereby provide capabilities and  functionality beyond what that object would normally provide. For  example, connected vehicles\u2014vehicles that \u201ctalk\u201d to infrastructure and  other vehicles\u2014provide the capability to identify threats and hazards on  the roadway and allow drivers to receive notifications and alerts of  dangerous situations, potentially reducing the number of accidents.", "IoT devices are used in a variety of settings, such as the home (e.g.,  smart appliances), manufacturing (e.g., predictive maintenance), or a  health care setting (e.g., remote patient monitoring). In this report, we  focus on the application of IoT within a community setting\u2014often referred  to as a \u201csmart city\u201d or \u201csmart community\u201d\u2014with the aim to generally  improve the livability, management, or service delivery of that community.  For example, a community may deploy streetlights with embedded  sensors that detect sound or motion and that are programmed to switch  on and off or raise dimmed lighting levels when vehicles or pedestrians  pass. By managing the level of streetlight use, communities seek to  improve energy efficiency and costs, as well as reduce maintenance  costs by reducing service trips to replace burned-out lights. Figure 1  illustrates other examples of how IoT technologies may be used in a  community. More indirectly, these technologies can drive economic  growth by generating demand for new products, new companies, and  new skilled jobs, according to literature and industry experts.", "While the idea of connecting objects is not new, recent advancements in  technologies that support IoT\u2014such as the decreasing cost and size of  electronics and the expansion of connectivity (e.g., broadband networks  and Wi-Fi), are driving a proliferation in the number and types of uses of  connected devices. One projection puts the future number of IoT devices  (excluding computers, mobile phones, and tablets) at over 10 billion in  2020. This would represent an increase of more than 200 percent  between 2015 and 2020, at which point the number of connected things  would outpace the number of computers, tablets, and smartphones  currently connected.", "There are also, however, hurdles that may impede widespread use of IoT  devices. Security and privacy risks can originate from unintentional  threats, such as equipment failures, or intentional threats, such as from  hackers. As noted in a Commerce green paper on IoT, published in  January 2017, while these risks are generally not unique to IoT,  ubiquitous connectivity and growth in IoT devices raise new challenges.  As new and more \u201cthings\u201d become connected, they increase not only the  opportunities for security and privacy breaches, but also the scale and  scope of any resulting consequences. For example, in October 2016, a  cyberattack that involved the hacking of thousands of unsecured IoT  devices interrupted Internet access to a number of major websites across  the United States for hours. These hurdles demonstrate the need for  strategies to respond to concerns about safety and increased risks to  privacy and security. We have reviewed and continue to review some of  these issues; for example, we recently issued a report that discusses the  specific implications of IoT technologies, including safety, security, and  privacy issues.", "IoT projects are also complex, crosscutting, and require expertise to  design and deploy. IoT projects involve the deployment of rapidly  evolving technologies and also often collect and store vast amounts of  data that must be analyzed before they can be used to develop  community solutions. For example, as we have previously reported,  when local transportation departments deploy IoT-enabled sensors on  traffic lights to monitor and collect data on traffic flow to help manage  congestion, they may need assistance in developing the system  requirements; collecting, analyzing, and protecting the vast amounts of  data collected; and identifying interdependent goals for the community,  such as improving air quality. As such, the local transportation  department may hire consultants to help with procurement and  deployment of a system; purchase the system from a vendor; partner with  academia for support in data analysis and innovative solutions;  collaborate with other local-government departments to identify  interdependent goals; and collaborate with other entities, such as transit  operators or regional planning departments, to leverage outcomes,  among other activities.", "As noted earlier, researchers and industry stakeholders have noted that  successful integration of technologies and projects\u2014including across  sectors (e.g., transportation, energy, or public safety)\u2014is key to realizing  the full potential of IoT. That is, when systems are interoperable\u2014or work  in concert with one another\u2014they may support interdependent goals. For  example, sensors deployed in community infrastructure to report on traffic  conditions or environmental conditions such as air quality can also, if  equipped with audio or visual capability, provide real-time traffic  information to public-safety or emergency-response persons, to help  determine the fastest route to an emergency. Government departments  that work with each other to build integrated systems can help optimize  resource expenditures and maximize services to community residents.  One research institute estimated in 2015 that IoT applications in cities  could have a global economic impact between $930 billion to $1.6 trillion  per year in 2025, with systems that are interoperable enabling more than  40 percent of that value.", "No single federal agency addresses all aspects of IoT. We identified at  least 11 federal agencies that have a key role in supporting IoT in  communities, either because they support research or communities,  oversee privacy or security protections and threats, or have direct  authority over IoT issues.

See appendix I for more  information on selected agencies\u2019 missions and examples of relevant  support for communities\u2019 IoT applications.", "The EU also has made investments in supporting IoT projects in  communities. For example, in 2013 the EU adopted a research and  innovation framework program for 2014 to 2020 (Horizon 2020) that  includes cross-cutting focus areas in both:  IoT, which aims to enable the emergence of an IoT environment that  is supported by open (i.e., publicly available) technologies and  platforms, and  \u201cSmart cities and communities,\u201d which aims to bring together cities,  industry, and citizens to demonstrate solutions and business models  that can be scaled up and replicated.", "These focus areas are supported by bi-annual funding strategies. The  European Commission, similarly to the U.S. government, is divided into  departments and executive agencies that have varied responsibilities. For  example, the European Commission has departments for Energy; Mobility  and Transport; and Communications Networks, Content, and Technology  that each have responsibility in carrying out the European Commission\u2019s  policies related to the respective industry sector that the departmental  entity oversees. With support from the EU, as well as local initiatives,  European communities are increasing investments in IoT projects, and  according to literature we reviewed and some U.S. and European industry  experts we interviewed, some of those communities are generally  recognized as having more advanced and mature IoT projects than  communities in the United States."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "In Addition to Broad IoT Research and Oversight, Federal Agencies More Directly Support Communities by Funding IoT Projects and Fostering Collaboration", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Broad Federal IoT Research and Oversight Provide Underlying Support for IoT in Communities", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Research", "paragraphs": ["Many of the federal agencies we reviewed are conducting or funding  broad research in IoT-related technologies.

According to NIST,  many custom-designed systems are not cost effective, and the growth of  the smart cities market is also hindered by deployments that are  customized. And, with standards-based solutions\u2014or replicable  projects\u2014communities can build on each other\u2019s work and make their  solutions available to other communities that may lack resources. For  example, the multi-stakeholder team that is deploying the sensor and  computer research platform, called the Array of Things, in the City of  Chicago first began as a partnership between the City of Chicago,  University of Chicago, and Argonne National Laboratory. This partnership  participated in the GCTC program and also received an NSF research  instrumentation grant, as discussed above.

Twenty-two federal departments and agencies have  participated on the task force as of January 2017 with initial efforts  focused on developing (1) a federal strategic plan and (2) a resource  guide for communities. On January 12, 2017, the task force released for  public comment a draft federal strategic plan that offers a high-level  framework to guide and coordinate smart community-related federal  initiatives, with an emphasis on local government and stakeholder  engagement. The draft plan highlighted five goals motivating the  strategy, including accelerating innovation and infrastructure improvement  and facilitating cross-sector collaboration and bridging existing silos. It  also identified four strategic priorities and next steps that include  promoting interagency collaboration and developing a road map for  specific federal actions to execute the strategic priorities. According to  federal officials who are chairing the efforts, the public comments will help  inform a revised federal strategic plan, which, as of April 2017, is  anticipated for publication in the summer of 2017. According to these  officials, following the completion of the strategic plan, the task force will  be dissolved, and the NITRD program\u2019s standing Cyber-Physical Systems  interagency working group will identify and coordinate any additional  action that is needed to support these efforts, such as any activities  related to the execution of the federal strategic plan.
