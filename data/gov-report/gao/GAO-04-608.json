Each action plan provided an  overview and analysis of its respective encroachment issue along with  strategies and actions for consideration by DOD decision makers. The  department considered these action plans to be working documents  supporting the overall sustainable range initiative. In June 2003, the Under  Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness issued a memorandum  to the secretaries of the military departments providing guidance for  sustainable range planning and programming efforts for fiscal years  2006-2011.

Instead,  the report provides the current status of the services\u2019 various sustainable  range efforts in the United States. Currently, OSD\u2019s inventory consists of  individual services\u2019 inputs as of November 2003, but it is not a tool that  commanders could use to identify range availability, regardless of service  ownership, and schedule the best available resources to provide required  training. In addition, OSD apparently has no planned method to  continuously maintain this inventory. Without an integrated training  range inventory that could be continuously updated and available at all  command levels, the services may not have knowledge of or access to  the best available training resources. This inventory may also have a  significant impact on the ability of the services to support joint training.  Also, without such an inventory, it will be difficult for OSD and the  services to develop a comprehensive plan to address these issues to  ensure range sustainability to support current and future training range  requirements. As a result, even though various services\u2019 initiatives are  underway to better address encroachment or other factors and ensure  sustainability of military training ranges for future use, OSD\u2019s training  range report did not include a comprehensive plan to address training  constraints in the United States and overseas\u2014as required by section 366.  Without a plan that includes quantifiable goals and milestones for  tracking planned actions and measuring progress, and projected funding  requirements, OSD and the services may not be able to address the  ever-growing issues associated with encroachment and measure the  progress in addressing these issues. Similarly, OSD\u2019s training range report  did not fully assess current and future training range requirements or fully  evaluate the adequacy of current resources to meet these requirements.  Without these types of analyses, OSD and the services will not be able to  determine shortfalls in training resources to better allocate training  resources and may continue to maintain ranges that are no longer needed  to meet current training requirements. Finally, the report did not include  any recommendations for legislative or regulatory changes to address  training constraints or a plan to improve the readiness reporting system  to reflect the impact on readiness caused by training constraints due to  limitations on the use of training ranges. Without an inventory identifying  range capacities or training constraints caused by encroachment or  other factors or a comprehensive training range plan to address training  constraints caused by limitations on the use training ranges, OSD and  the services will continue to rely on incomplete information to support  funding requests and legislative or regulatory changes to address these  issues."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To serve as the baseline for the comprehensive training range plan  required by section 366, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense  direct the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness and  the secretaries of the military services to jointly develop an integrated  training range database that identifies available training resources, specific  capacities and capabilities, and training constraints caused by limitations  on the use of training ranges, which could be continuously updated and  shared among the services at all command levels, regardless of service  ownership.", "To improve future reports, we also recommend that OSD provide a  more complete report to the Congress to fully address the requirements  specified in the section 366 mandate by (1) developing a comprehensive  plan that includes quantifiable goals and milestones for tracking planned  actions and measuring progress, and projected funding requirements to  more fully address identified training constraints, (2) assessing current  and future training range requirements and evaluating the adequacy of  current resources to meet these requirements, and (3) developing a  readiness reporting system to reflect the impact on readiness caused by  training constraints due to limitations on the use of training ranges."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In commenting on a draft of this report, the Deputy Under Secretary of  Defense for Readiness disagreed with our finding that OSD\u2019s training  range report failed to address the congressional reporting requirements  mandated in section 366 of the Bob Stump National Defense Authorization  Act for Fiscal Year 2003 and disagreed with three of our four  recommendations. As it clearly points out, this report outlines numerous  instances where OSD\u2019s report did not address congressionally mandated  reporting requirements. Our recommendations were intended to help DOD  address all requirements specified in section 366. Without their  implementation, DOD will continue to rely on incomplete information to  support funding requests and legislative or regulatory changes to address  encroachment and other factors.", "DOD disagreed with our first recommendation\u2014to jointly develop an  integrated training range database that identified available training  resources, specific capacities and capabilities, and training constraints,  which could be continuously updated and shared among all the services  at all command levels regardless of service ownership. As discussed in  our report, OSD\u2019s inventory consists of individual services\u2019 inputs as of  November 2003 and is not a tool that commanders could use to identify  range availability, regardless of service ownership, and schedule the best  available resources to provide required training. Further, as noted in our  report, the individual service submissions continue to provide limited  information on how training has been constrained by encroachment or  other factors. In contrast, section 366 clearly requires the Secretary of  Defense to develop and maintain an inventory that identifies all available  operational training ranges, all training range capacities and capabilities,  and any training constraints at each training range. DOD\u2019s suggestion  that our draft report recommended that DOD should initiate a \u201cmassive  new database\u201d effort to allow OSD management of individual range  activities is without merit. Our recommendation merely specified section  366 legislative requirements that were not found in OSD\u2019s training range  report to the Congress.", "Also, DOD\u2019s disagreement with our first recommendation seems  inconsistent with other comments DOD officials have made as noted in  this and other GAO reports regarding military training range inventories.  In commenting on this report, DOD specifically stated that it agreed that,  as a long-term goal, the services\u2019 inventory systems should be linked to  support joint use. In commenting on a prior report, DOD stated that the  services were developing a statement of work in order to contract with a  firm capable of delivering an enterprise level web-enabled system that will  allow cross service, as well as intra-service training use of inventory data.  Further, in a 2003 study, the U.S. Special Operations Command stated that  all components needed to create master range plans that addressed their  current and future range issues and solutions. The command also  recommended that plans identify and validate training requirements and  facilities available and define the acceptable limits of workarounds.  Without an integrated training range inventory, we continue to believe that  it will be difficult for OSD and the services to develop a comprehensive  plan and track its progress in addressing training constraints and ensuring  range sustainability.", "DOD generally concurred with our second recommendation\u2014to develop a  comprehensive plan that includes quantifiable goals and milestones for  tracking planned actions and measuring progress, and projected funding  requirements to more fully address identified training constraints.  However, the department\u2019s comments suggest it plans simply to  summarize ongoing efforts of individual services rather than formulate a  comprehensive strategy for addressing training constraints. Without a  plan that includes quantifiable goals and milestones for tracking planned  actions and measuring progress, and projected funding requirements,  OSD and the services may not be able to address the ever-growing issues  associated with encroachment and other training constraints and measure  the progress in addressing these issues. Also, a summary of ongoing  efforts does not fully address the requirements of section 366, which calls  for a comprehensive plan for using existing authorities available to the  Secretaries of Defense and the military departments to address training  constraints caused by limitations on the use of military lands, marine  areas, and airspace that are available in the United States and overseas for  training. Second, it directly contradicts DOD\u2019s concurrence with  recommendations made in our June 2002 report where we specifically  recommended that the department develop a plan with the same elements  subsequently required by the mandate. Third, it contradicts a January  2003 report of the Southwest Region Range Sustainability Conference  sponsored by the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Readiness and  the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Installations and  Environment. The conference report recommended a national range  sustainability and infrastructure plan\u2014which could also address section  366 requirements\u2014to include range requirements, overall vision, current  and future requirements, and encroachment issues. Without a  comprehensive plan that includes quantifiable goals and milestones for  tracking planned actions and measuring progress, and projected funding  requirements, we continue to believe that OSD and the services may not  be able to address the ever-growing issues associated with encroachment  and other training constraints, and measure the progress in addressing  these issues.", "DOD disagreed with our third recommendation\u2014to assess current and  future training range requirements and evaluate the adequacy of current  resources to meet these requirements. It stated that it is inappropriate and  impractical to include this level of detail in an OSD-level report and that  the Congress is better served if the department describes, summarizes, and  analyzes range requirements. Clearly, these statements are contradictory  in that section 366 requires that OSD report on its assessment of current  and future training range requirements and an evaluation of the adequacy  of current DOD resources to meet current and future training  requirements, which could be accomplished by providing the  aforementioned description, summary, and analysis of range requirements.  While the department\u2019s training range report provided a description of the  methodology used by each service to develop their requirements, it did not  provide any detail regarding such analyses. Without these types of  analyses, we continue to believe that OSD and the services will not be able  to determine shortfalls in training resources to better allocate training  resources and may continue to maintain ranges that are no longer needed  to meet current training requirements. In addition, the department  questions why we did not examine detailed requirements work being done  at each installation. While we agree with DOD that this type of  examination could be useful, it is unclear why OSD\u2019s report did not  provide a discussion of the work underway at individual installations.  While we may conduct such an examination in the future, section 366 did  not specifically require us to conduct this examination, nor did it provide  us sufficient time for such an examination.", "DOD disagreed with our fourth recommendation\u2014to develop a readiness  reporting system to reflect the impact on readiness caused by training  constraints. DOD further stated that it was inappropriate to modify the  Global Status of Readiness and Training System report to address  encroachment and that it plans to incorporate encroachment impacts on  readiness into the Defense Readiness Reporting System. Our draft report  recognized that the department does not believe that the Global Status of  Readiness and Training System is the system to capture encroachment  impacts. Given that OSD\u2019s training range reports are required to provide a  status of efforts to address training constraints, it is unclear why OSD\u2019s  report did not provide an assessment of progress in this area. We continue  to believe that future reports should provide the Congress with  information on DOD\u2019s progress toward improving readiness reporting\u2014 whether it is the Defense Readiness Reporting System as cited in DOD\u2019s  comments or another system\u2014to reflect the impact on readiness caused  by training constraints due to limitations on the use of training ranges, as  required by section 366.", "We continue to believe our recommendations are valid and without their  implementation, DOD will continue to rely on incomplete information to  support funding requests and legislative or regulatory proposals to address  encroachment and other training constraints, and will not be able to fully  address the congressionally mandated requirements in section 366.", "The Deputy Under Secretary\u2019s comments are included in appendix II."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To determine the extent to which OSD\u2019s training range inventory contains  sufficient information to develop a comprehensive training range plan, we  reviewed OSD\u2019s inventory of the services\u2019 training ranges to determine  whether the inventory identified training capacities and capabilities, and  constraints caused by encroachment or other factors for each training  range. In addition, we reviewed the services\u2019 inputs to OSD\u2019s inventory and  OSD\u2019s report for a comprehensive training range plan.
