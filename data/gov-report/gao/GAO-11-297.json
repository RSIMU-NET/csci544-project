Significant management challenges also affect the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) ability to administer NFIP. This report examines (1) the extent to which FEMA's management practices affect the administration of NFIP; (2) lessons learned from the cancellation of FEMA's attempt to modernize NFIP's insurance management system; and (3) limitations on FEMA's authority that could affect NFIP's financial stability. To do this work, GAO reviewed internal control standards and best practices, analyzed agency documentation, reviewed previous work, and interviewed relevant agency officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["FEMA faces significant management challenges in areas that affect NFIP, including strategic and human capital planning; collaboration among offices; and records, financial, and acquisition management. For example, because FEMA has not developed goals, objectives, or performance measures for NFIP, it needs a strategic focus for ensuring program effectiveness. FEMA also faces human capital challenges, including high turnover and weaknesses in overseeing its many contractors. Further, FEMA needs a plan that would ensure consistent day-to-day operations when it deploys staff to federal disasters. FEMA has also faced challenges in collaboration between program and support offices. Finally, FEMA lacks a comprehensive set of processes and systems to guide its operations, in particular a records management policy and an electronic document management system. FEMA has begun to address some of these challenges, including acquisition management, but the results of its efforts remain to be seen. Unless it takes further steps to address these management challenges, FEMA will be limited in its ability to manage NFIP's operations or better ensure program effectiveness. FEMA also faces challenges modernizing NFIP's insurance policy and claims management system. After 7 years and $40 million, FEMA ultimately canceled its latest effort (NextGen) in November 2009 because the system did not meet user expectations. As a result, the agency continues to rely on an ineffective and inefficient 30-year old system. A number of acquisition management weaknesses led to NextGen's failure and cancellation, and as FEMA begins a new effort to modernize the existing legacy system, it plans to apply lessons learned from its NextGen experience. While FEMA has begun implementing some changes to its acquisition management practices, it remains to be seen if they will help FEMA avoid some of the problems that led to NextGen's failure. Developing appropriate acquisitions processes and applying lessons learned from the NextGen failure are essential if FEMA is to develop an effective policies and claims processing system for NFIP. Finally, NFIP's operating environment limits FEMA's ability to keep the program financially sound. NFIP assumes all risks for its policies, must accept virtually all applicants for insurance, and cannot deny coverage for high-risk properties. Moreover, additional external factors--including lapses in NFIP's authorization, the role of state and local governments, fluctuations in premium income, and structural and organizational changes--complicate FEMA's administration of NFIP. As GAO has previously reported, NFIP also faces external challenges that threaten the program's long-term health. These include statutorily required subsidized premium rates, a lack of authority to include long-term erosion in flood maps, and limitations on FEMA's authority to encourage owners of repetitive loss properties to mitigate. Until these issues are addressed, NFIP's long-term financial solvency will remain in doubt."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO makes 10 recommendations to improve the effectiveness of FEMA's planning and oversight efforts for NFIP; improve FEMA's policies and procedures for achieving NFIP's goals; and increase the usefulness and reliability of NFIP's flood insurance policy and claims processing system. GAO also presents three matters for congressional consideration to improve NFIP's financial stability. DHS concurred with all of GAO's recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which is administered by  the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) within the  Department of Homeland Security (DHS), is a key component of the  federal government\u2019s efforts to minimize the damage and financial impact  of floods and is the only source of insurance against flood damage for  most residents of flood-prone areas. Until 2004, NFIP was able to cover  most of its claims with premiums it collected and occasional loans from  the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) that were repaid. However,  after the 2005 hurricanes\u2014primarily Hurricane Katrina\u2014the program  borrowed $16.8 billion from Treasury to cover the unprecedented number  of claims. NFIP has subsequently borrowed additional funds from  Treasury to make interest payments on this debt and, as of March 2011,  owed approximately $17.8 billion. Because of structural weaknesses in the  way the program is funded and operated, NFIP is unlikely to be able to  repay this debt in the near future, if ever.", "As a result of the program\u2019s importance, level of indebtedness, and  potential for future losses, we placed NFIP on our high-risk list in March  2006. In earlier reports, we identified a number of operational challenges  that hindered FEMA\u2019s ability to effectively administer NFIP and  contributed to NFIP\u2019s placement on the list. For example, we found  internal control weaknesses in FEMA\u2019s oversight of the write-your-own  (WYO) insurers that are key to NFIP operations and that have received  payments representing one-third to two-thirds of the premiums collected.  We also found problems with the oversight of contractors responsible for  performing key NFIP functions such as collecting NFIP data and  marketing the program.", "Because of the risks and challenges facing NFIP and the financial and  operational weaknesses we had identified, we undertook a review to look  for potential underlying management weaknesses that, if addressed, might  improve the operation and functioning of the program. Specifically, our  objectives were to (1) analyze the extent to which FEMA\u2019s key  management practices\u2014including strategic planning, human capital  planning, intra-agency collaboration, records management, financial  management, and acquisition management\u2014affect the agency\u2019s ability to  administer NFIP; (2) identify lessons to be learned from the cancellation of  its most recent attempt to modernize NFIP\u2019s flood insurance policy and  claims processing system, including to what extent key acquisition  management processes were followed; and (3) describe factors that are  relevant to NFIP operations and analyze limitations on FEMA\u2019s authority  that could affect its financial stability.", "To address these objectives, we collected available data from FEMA and  conducted over 80 interviews with representatives from FEMA and their  relevant bureaus or divisions. We also interviewed representatives of  DHS\u2019s Office of the Inspector General, the National Association of Public  Administration (NAPA), and KPMG LLP. These interviews allowed us to  gather further insights into management challenges that affect NFIP. In  addition, we analyzed planning documents, policies, directives, materials,  and data related to program, human capital, records, acquisition, and  financial management. In the areas of human capital and financial  management, we assessed the data provided to us and found it to be  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our report. The remaining audit  work did not require a data assessment. Further, we reviewed relevant  legislation, internal control standards, best practices, and external studies  of FEMA\u2019s management challenges. We compared the information we  obtained on NFIP\u2019s policies and procedures to relevant criteria developed  by GAO and others. To determine the lessons to be learned from the  NextGeneration Flood Insurance Management System (NextGen)  program\u2019s cancellation and to what extent key acquisition management  processes were followed on NextGen, we analyzed a range of program  documentation and interviewed cognizant program and contractor  officials relevant to the following acquisition management disciplines:  requirements development and management, test management, risk  management, program oversight, and human capital management. For  each discipline, we compared key program documentation, such as the  concept of operations document; test plans for functional, regression, and  usability testing; and NextGen application summary test reports, and risk  management and program management plans. To identify external factors  that affect NFIP\u2019s ability to carry out its mission, we reviewed our  previous reports that analyzed various aspects of NFIP\u2019s policies,  practices, and organizational structure, identifying factors that affected  NFIP\u2019s operations but over which NFIP did not have control. To determine  whether and to what extent the factors identified in these reports were  still affecting NFIP\u2019s operations, and to identify any additional factors, we  interviewed knowledgeable FEMA representatives and reviewed relevant  testimony of FEMA officials before Congress. Appendix I provides  additional details about our scope and methodology.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2009 to June 2011 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

NFIP, which  makes federally backed flood insurance available to homeowners and  businesses, was intended to reduce the federal government\u2019s escalating  costs for repairing flood damage after disasters. Floods are the most  common and destructive natural disaster in the United States. In fact,  according to NFIP statistics, 90 percent of all national disasters in the  United States have involved flooding. However, flooding is generally  excluded from homeowners\u2019 policies that typically cover damages from  other losses, such as wind, fire, and theft. Because of the catastrophic  nature of flooding and the inability to adequately predict flood risks,  historically, private insurance companies have largely been unwilling to  underwrite and bear the risk that results from providing primary flood  insurance coverage. Under NFIP, the federal government assumes the  liability for the insurance coverage and sets rates and coverage limitations,  among other responsibilities, while the private insurance industry sells the  policies and administers the claims for a fee determined by FEMA.", "As of January 2011, 21,361 communities across the United States and its  territories participated in NFIP by adopting and agreeing to enforce state  and community floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood  damage. In exchange, NFIP makes federally backed flood insurance  available to homeowners and other property owners in these  communities. Homeowners with mortgages from federally regulated  lenders on property in communities identified to be in high-risk special  flood hazard areas (SFHA) are required to purchase flood insurance on  their dwellings for at least the outstanding mortgage amount. Optional  lower-cost coverage is also available under NFIP to protect homes in areas  of low to moderate risk. To insure furniture and other personal property  items against flood damage, homeowners may purchase separate NFIP  personal property coverage. Although premium amounts vary according to  the amount of coverage purchased and the location and characteristics of  the insured property, the average yearly premium was around $620 as of  October 2010.", "NFIP is designed to pay operating expenses and flood insurance claims  with premiums collected on flood insurance policies rather than with tax  dollars. However, FEMA has statutory authority to borrow funds from  Treasury to keep NFIP solvent in years when losses are high. NFIP, by  design, is not actuarially sound because Congress authorized subsidized  insurance rates to be made available for policies covering certain  structures to encourage communities to join the program. As a result,  NFIP is not able to build reserves to cover losses that exceed the historic  averages."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Management of the National Flood Insurance Program", "paragraphs": ["NFIP is managed by FEMA\u2019s Federal Insurance and Mitigation  Administration (FIMA), with administrative support from FEMA\u2019s Mission  Support Bureau (see fig. 1).

Around 350 FEMA employees, assisted by contractor employees, manage  and oversee NFIP and the National Flood Insurance Fund, into which  premiums are deposited and from which claims and expenses are paid.  Their management responsibilities include establishing and updating NFIP  regulations, analyzing data to determine flood insurance rates, and  offering training to insurance agents and adjusters. In addition, FIMA and  its program contractors are responsible for monitoring and overseeing the  performance of the WYO insurance companies to help ensure that NFIP is  administered properly.", "FIMA receives administrative and management support as well as  direction on program operations from FEMA\u2019s Mission Support Bureau  offices, including the Office of the Chief Administrative Officer (OCAO),  Office of the Chief Component Human Capital Officer (OCCHCO), Office  of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO), Office of the Chief Information  Officer (OCIO), and Office of the Chief Procurement Officer (OCPO). In  addition, FEMA\u2019s Office of Policy and Program Analysis (OPPA) serves a  collaborative support role to provide leadership, analysis, coordination,  and decision-making support on agency policies, plans, programs, and key  initiatives.

First, FEMA has not  provided FIMA with strategic direction and guidance for administering  NFIP and therefore lacks the starting point necessary to develop  performance measures for assessing the program\u2019s effectiveness. Second,  FEMA faces a number of human capital challenges, including developing a  strategic human capital plan that addresses mitigating high turnover,  hiring, and overseeing contractors that play a key role in NFIP. Moreover,  it has yet to adequately address managing the day-to-day operations when  deploying staff to respond to federal disasters. Third, collaboration among  offices within FEMA that are responsible for administering NFIP has at  times been ineffective, leading to challenges in effectively carrying out  some key functions. In particular, FIMA, the office that administers NFIP,  and FEMA Mission Support, which provides mission-critical functions  such as information technology (IT), acquisition, and financial  management, have had difficulties collaborating on these functions.  Finally, FEMA does not have a comprehensive set of policies, procedures,  and systems to guide its operations. Specifically, it lacks an updated  records management policy, procedures to effectively manage  unliquidated obligations, and a fully developed and implemented  documentation of its business processes. FEMA has begun taking steps to  improve its acquisition management and document some of its business  processes, but as they were recently implemented or still in progress, the  results of these efforts have yet to be realized. Unless it takes further steps  to address these management challenges, FEMA will be limited in its  ability to manage NFIP\u2019s operations or ensure program effectiveness."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "A More Comprehensive Strategic Framework Would Improve FEMA\u2019s Administration of NFIP", "paragraphs": ["FEMA published its most recent agencywide strategic plan in February  2011, but the plan did not clearly lay out how and where NFIP\u2019s mission  and activities fit within FEMA\u2019s own goals and objectives. The  Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) requires  agencies to submit a strategic plan containing a number of components,  including a comprehensive mission statement, long-term goals and  objectives for major operations, and strategies for achieving these goals  and objectives. Further, we have reported that an agency\u2019s strategic  planning effort is the most important element in results-oriented  management and serves as the foundation for defining what the agency  seeks to accomplish, identifying strategies to achieve desired results, and  determining how well it succeeds in reaching its goals and objectives.  Leading results-oriented organizations focus on the dynamic and inclusive  process of strategic planning, rather than on a strategic planning  document, to provide a foundation for day-to-day activities and foster  communication between the organization and its stakeholders. Moreover,  the committee report accompanying GPRA stated that clear and precise  goals enable an organization to maintain a consistent sense of direction  regardless of the leadership changes that can occur frequently across the  federal government.", "NFIP is a major operation with $1.2 trillion in coverage and $17.8 billion in  debt that has remained on GAO\u2019s high-risk list since 2006. FEMA officials  told us that FEMA chose not to prescribe goals and objectives for specific  programs in its strategic plan as required by GPRA. They said that the  agency chose a different strategic approach that would allow for more  flexibility, something that was needed because FEMA must respond to  emergencies as they occur. While FEMA may require flexibility in its  operating environment, as a federal insurance program NFIP requires a  more structured framework to help ensure that its operations are properly  managed and allow for the development of effective performance  measures. Unless FEMA provides FIMA with strategic direction and  guidance for administering NFIP, the program risks not having a strategic  focus that is aligned with agency goals and objectives or effective  performance measures.", "FIMA officials told us they were in the process of developing a strategy for  mitigation and insurance but did not provide a specific timeline for  completing or implementing it and did not provide details of what it might  include. FIMA officials said they began developing the strategy in June  2010 and had created a steering committee with about 15 members  representing various areas within FIMA. The committee held a summit  with a number of stakeholders in November 2010 to validate the proposed  mission, goals, and objectives of the organization before entering the  drafting process and expect to eventually publish the final strategy in the  summer of 2011. Because these efforts have not yet been completed,  whether the strategy will include adequate goals and objectives for  administering and managing NFIP remains to be seen. Without goals and  objectives and a firm timeline for completing them, NFIP will continue to  lack a strategic direction.", "FIMA officials said they had relied on other documents for strategic  guidance, including FEMA- and DHS-level guidance and the agency\u2019s  general mission\u2014managing risks from all natural hazards to help free  America from the burden of such disasters. However, without specific  agency- or program-level goals, FIMA cannot ensure that any performance  measures it develops for NFIP properly and adequately measure the  program\u2019s success. According to GPRA, agencies should establish  performance indicators to be used in measuring and assessing the relevant  outputs, service levels, and outcomes of each program activity. Moreover,  GAO\u2019s Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states  that management should ensure that agencies establish and review  performance measures and indicators. As we have reported, performance  goals and measures that successfully address important and varied aspects  of program performance are key to a results-oriented work environment.  Measuring performance allows organizations to track the progress they  are making toward their goals and gives managers critical information on  which to base decisions for improving their programs. We have also  reported that successful performance measures are, among other things,  linked to core program activities.", "FIMA officials said that in recent years they had generally relied on five  performance measures for NFIP that they reviewed quarterly:    Percentage of the U.S. population (excluding territories) covered by  local hazard mitigation plans that had been approved or were pending  adoption.", "Percentage of the national population whose safety had been improved  through the availability of flood risk data in Geospatial Information  System (GIS) format.", "Number of communities taking or increasing actions to reduce their  risk from natural disasters.", "Potential property losses, disasters, and other costs avoided.", "NFIP premium income per $100 dollars of combined operating expense  and historical losses paid.", "However, FIMA recently revised its operating plan, which FIMA officials  said aligns resources to major activities and provides transparency to  FIMA\u2019s performance. In this revision, FIMA replaced the five measures  with 11 new performance measures aligned with DHS\u2019s mission and  relevant DHS goals.

While FEMA developed a 2008-2012 Strategic Human Capital  Plan, we found that the plan did not meet PKEMRA\u2019s requirements.  PKEMRA required that the plan include an assessment of (1) the critical  skills and competencies that would be needed in the workforce during the  10-year period after the law was enacted; (2) the skills and competencies  of the FEMA workforce and projected trends in that workforce based on  the expected losses due to retirement and other attrition; and (3) staffing  levels for each category of employee and gaps that should be addressed to  ensure that FEMA has continued access to the necessary critical skills and  competencies. In addition, PKEMRA requires FEMA to develop a \u201cPlan of  Action\u201d to address gaps in critical skills and competencies, including:    specific goals and objectives for recruiting and retaining employees,  such as recruitment and retention bonuses;    specific strategies and program objectives to develop, train, deploy,  compensate, motivate, and retain employees;    specific strategies for recruiting staff with experience serving in  multiple state agencies responsible for emergency management; and    specific strategies to develop, train, and rapidly deploy a surge capacity  force.", "FEMA\u2019s plan\u2014including a 2010 Human Capital Operational Plan\u2014did not  address all PKEMRA requirements. For example, it did not define the  critical skills and competencies that FEMA would need in the coming  years or provide specific strategies and program objectives to motivate,  deploy, and retain employees, among other things. In an October 2009  report, NAPA also stated that FEMA\u2019s plan did not meet certain PKEMRA  requirements, which the report described as being focused on  understanding and planning for the current and future workforce. NAPA  also recommended that FEMA strengthen its human capital planning.  One NAPA official noted that the 2008-2012 Strategic Human Capital Plan  is essentially a \u201cplan to develop a workforce plan.\u201d", "We have noted in previous work that agencies should develop human  capital strategies\u2014including succession planning, training, and staff  development\u2014to eliminate gaps between current skills and competencies  needed for mission success. FEMA\u2019s human capital plan does not have  strategies to address retention challenges or contractors, among other  things. For example, FEMA experiences frequent turnover in key positions  and divisions that can result in lost productivity, a decline in institutional  knowledge, and a lack of continuity for remaining staff. Within the past  several years, key leadership has also changed within several key FEMA  offices that support FIMA in some NFIP activities. For example OCCHCO  has hired its third chief in the last 2 years. Further, FEMA has experienced  turnover in several of the offices that provide critical mission support  services to NFIP. For example, OCPO, which had 88 permanent full-time  (PFT) staff at the beginning of FY 2007, had lost 59 employees as of August  2010. FEMA staff told us the high turnover had resulted in the loss of  institutional knowledge, specialized skills, and management continuity and  efficiency.", "FEMA also faces challenges in hiring, which has been a major focus of its  workforce operations. As of the third quarter of fiscal year 2010,  approximately 876 of FEMA\u2019s 4,916 funded positions were unfilled.  Further, both FEMA program officials and OCCHCO, which screens  candidates, said that OCCHCO often sent candidates without the requisite  skills forward to the program offices that typically make the final hiring  decisions. OCCHCO officials told us that in several instances program  offices had not properly aligned announcements and position descriptions,  so that candidates appearing to meet the requirements of the position  description did not meet the actual requirements of the position. OCCHCO  officials added they were working to improve the situation.", "FEMA also lacks accurate data on its current staffing levels, largely  because of IT issues, exacerbating the difficulties of workforce planning.  In a 2009 review of OCCHCO, NAPA found that frequent shifting of  organizational resources over the previous 6 years, the lack of a single  system to track and account for the workforce, complexities associated  with tracking multiple workforce categories, and problems with FEMA\u2019s  human resource management system had hindered efforts to obtain  complete and accurate human capital data for review. According to  NAPA, these shortcomings had significant consequences in 2009, when  FEMA established an informal hiring freeze because the number of staff  hired exceeded authorized levels. In 2010, the Homeland Security Studies  and Analysis Institute also found a discrepancy of around 700 filled  positions between FEMA\u2019s manpower database and National Finance  Center data. The institute found that the two most common discrepancies  in employee data were errors involving on the employees\u2019 work unit and  activities. OCCHCO officials said they had also experienced difficulties  with human resource management systems. Most recently, in 2010 DHS  deployed the Talent Link system to manage its human resource needs, but  the system was found to be incompatible with government human  resource systems and processes. As a result, a few months after Talent  Link was deployed DHS phased it out and moved FEMA to the USA  Staffing system.", "In addition, in spite of the importance of the work of contractors to NFIP\u2019s  activities, FEMA does not centrally track the number of contractors or the  type of work they do. For example, FIMA staff estimated that one of its  divisions had as many as 10 contractors per FIMA staff member, and other  FEMA staff said that they were unable to estimate the number of  contractors. According to a FEMA Workforce Baseline Assessment  conducted by the Homeland Security Studies and Analysis Institute,  examining the federal workforce alone cannot fully assess FEMA\u2019s full  human capital capability. The assessment went on to note that contract  support must be considered in any discussion of FEMA staffing because  contractors do not just supplement staff efforts but perform a substantial  amount of FEMA\u2019s work. Unless FEMA tracks its contractors, it is severely  limited in its ability to assess the total workforce and their respective roles  and to plan for future staffing needs. However, pursuant to the  Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2010, the head of DHS, which includes  FEMA, is now required to prepare an annual inventory of service contracts  it awards or extends through the exercise of an option. The initial  inventory was due not later than December 31, 2010, and annually  thereafter. As part of the inventory, DHS must include the number and  work location of contractor and subcontractor employees expressed as  full-time equivalents for direct labor, compensated under the contract.", "FEMA told us it had begun developing an initial workforce assessment  that it planned to complete in 2012, but the agency is uncertain whether it  will include contractors in this study. According to FEMA staff, a new  strategic human capital plan is also under review, and therefore, FEMA  could not provide us with a copy. As a result, we were unable to determine  whether it addressed PKEMRA\u2019s requirements and the human capital  challenges that NFIP faces. Without a human capital plan that, at a  minimum, meets PKEMRA\u2019s requirements, includes a comprehensive  workforce assessment that identifies staffing and skills requirements,  addresses turnover and staff vacancies, and analyzes the use of  contractors, FEMA will continue to have difficulty hiring and retaining  staff and managing its contractors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Neither FEMA nor FIMA Has a Plan to Ensure That Key NFIP Operations Are Maintained When Staff Are Deployed During a Disaster", "paragraphs": ["As we have previously reported, neither FEMA nor FIMA has a plan to  help ensure that agency operations, including NFIP\u2019s, are maintained when  a federal disaster is declared and staff are required to respond to it.

In addition to their responsibilities for day-to-day operations,  FEMA employees are also expected to be on call during disasters for  potential assignment to disaster-related activities, including deployment to  field operations. FEMA staff told us that neither FIMA nor FEMA had a  program-specific or agencywide plan that covered all of its staff and  functions, including NFIP. According to a FEMA official, while program  offices have some ability to make decisions about how many mission- critical staff to deploy to the field during a disaster and how many to keep  in their office positions, the current administrator has made it clear that  when a disaster hits, the priority is to deploy staff to the field.", "As was the case with Hurricane Katrina, FEMA staff can be deployed for  weeks or months and, during that time, are often performing duties in the  field that take them away from their day-to-day responsibilities. According  to a recent study by the Homeland Security Studies and Analysis Institute,  FEMA staff found that operating normally during and immediately after a  disaster was problematic due to staff deployment and an increased  workload due to the disaster. For this reason, planning for business  continuity management and deployment planning are particularly  important for the agency. We previously reported that FEMA did not have  guidelines on what constitutes a mission-critical position, had not  conducted an assessment of the minimum level of support that would be  necessary to keep the agency fully operational, and thus had limited  guidelines for deciding who should be deployed. In addition, the report  found that nearly 57 percent of FEMA\u2019s permanent employees who are  deployable do not have assigned deployment job titles or roles that would  facilitate deployment during a disaster. Without a plan for deploying staff  during a disaster, FEMA faces the risk that critical functions, such as  managing NFIP operations, may not be performed while staff are deployed  to the field during a natural disaster, increasing the likelihood that the  agency will be unable to provide the necessary support for disaster relief  missions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Instances of Ineffective Collaboration between FIMA and Mission Support Have Complicated FEMA\u2019s Administration of NFIP", "paragraphs": ["FIMA relies on Mission Support for a variety of mission-critical functions,  including IT, acquisition, and financial management, but FIMA and Mission  Support have faced challenges in collaborating with one another.

They said they had to wait months for C&A approval for at  least two mission-critical systems, one of which had been held up for  about 9 months as of February 2010. One official said this problem had  arisen because the C&A process lacked a formalized structure and  communication between FIMA and OCIO was inadequate. OCIO officials  acknowledged that some communication problems existed and said they  were aware of FIMA\u2019s concerns. OCIO\u2019s primary concern, however, was  that at times FIMA would perform IT functions independently from OCIO  and believed that involving OCIO would help streamline IT development.  For example, an OCIO official said that assessing and approving a $1  million investment would require 30 to 45 days.", "OCIO officials also said that 95 percent of FEMA\u2019s known systems were  certified but noted that other systems, including some of FIMA\u2019s that  affect NFIP, might have been developed independently of OCIO and thus  lacked its approval. For example, in the past year OCIO discovered five  FEMA human resources programs that were developed without its  knowledge or involvement. OCIO now requires that all systems on FEMA\u2019s  network complete the C&A process and be approved by the CIO, because  undocumented systems can create risks that are difficult to correct. In  accordance with the Federal Information Security Management Act of  2002 (FISMA), OCIO is creating an inventory of IT systems for each of  FEMA\u2019s offices. OCIO officials said that once the portfolio lists had been  verified, OCIO would address the backlog of pending C&As. FEMA also  developed an Acquisition Review Board (ARB) to help ensure that IT  systems within the agency are developed with the CIO\u2019s involvement,  because the acquisition system requires the CIO\u2019s approval at key points in  the IT development process.", "OCIO is also taking steps to improve collaboration with FEMA\u2019s program  offices, but it is too early to determine if the issues with FIMA have been  fully addressed. For example, in January 2008 OCIO began assigning a  customer advocate to each program office to help it better understand the  IT needs of FEMA\u2019s program offices and to act as liaisons. The customer  advocates are responsible for understanding all of the systems that are  needed to support their assigned program offices and for regularly  updating the CIO. FIMA\u2019s customer advocate said he met frequently with  FIMA officials to resolve IT issues that arose and he was aware of only one  major issue\u2014the need to replace the legacy policy and claims processing  system. While FIMA officials have mentioned a number of processes that  could benefit from greater automation, including document management  and budget formulation, it is unclear whether they have communicated  these needs to their customer advocate. Until cooperation between FIMA  and OCIO improves, FEMA will be unable to ensure that FIMA\u2019s and  NFIP\u2019s IT needs are adequately met."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FIMA and the Office of the Chief Procurement Officer Have Differed on Implementing a Policy for Small Business Contracts", "paragraphs": ["FEMA has exceeded its goals for awarding contracts to small businesses,  but FIMA and OCPO have differed on the question of how the policy for  setting aside these contracts should be implemented. The federal  government\u2019s goal for participation by small business concerns is at least  23 percent of the total dollar value of all prime contract awards for each  fiscal year. By comparison, FEMA\u2019s fiscal year 2010 goal of 31.9 percent  was higher because, according to OCPO officials, DHS noticed that FEMA  was exceeding its previous targets and wanted to provide incentives for  continuing to exceed them. In general, before setting aside a contract for  competition among small businesses, an agency must conduct market  research to determine whether there is a reasonable expectation of  obtaining offers from at least two small businesses that could meet the  contract\u2019s requirements. OCPO officials make this determination within  FEMA. If the program office objects to the decision, OCPO generally asks  the office to support its position. If a disagreement persists, the Head of  Contracting Activity has traditionally resolved the disagreement  informally. No formal process exists for resolving these disagreements or  appealing decisions.", "FIMA officials said that in several instances the use of small business  contracts has caused inefficiencies for NFIP. According to these officials,  flood insurance work is better suited to large businesses. For instance, in  2007 OCPO decided to split one of FIMA\u2019s contracts\u2014which covered many  areas of NFIP, including marketing, training, and data management\u2014into  five smaller contracts that were more conducive to small business  involvement. According to FIMA officials, OCPO did not involve FIMA  sufficiently in this decision and did not sufficiently consider how it would  affect FIMA, which would need additional staff to monitor the contractors  and would lose experienced contractors. OCPO officials disagreed, noting,  among other things, that the requirements for each contractor were  outlined in the contract\u2019s solicitation and only contractors that could meet  the requirements were considered. No formal process exists for resolving  the disagreement, and whether OCPO effectively communicated to FIMA  how it could justify its position is unclear. Such disagreements indicate a  need for those involved to improve their collaboration by establishing  mutually reinforcing or joint strategies to achieve common outcomes.", "According to FIMA officials, these disagreements have created  inefficiencies that have required extra work to resolve\u2014for instance,  lengthening the time required to complete certain processes. Recognizing  that it needed to improve its relationship with program offices, OCPO  management appointed an individual to reach out to and help them  recognize the value of OCPO\u2019s services. OCPO officials said that program  offices now understand they must work with OCPO, and OCPO hopes to  improve the relationship and help the program offices to better  understand how beneficial the procurement office can be. OCPO officials  said that the office now acts as an advocate for the program offices to DHS  and helps improve communication by explaining to program offices the  reasoning behind DHS\u2019s various requirements.

In  particular, FIMA officials have said they need a system for building their  budget, a process that involves estimating expected policy fee revenue and  identifying and allocating funds from six appropriations. OCFO currently  provides FIMA with spreadsheets for formulating the budget that contain  templates for the spending plans detailing the resources required to  execute programs, projects, and activities. OCFO officials acknowledged  that the current process was more time consuming and prone to data entry  errors than an automated system would be. FIMA officials noted that using  these spreadsheets was particularly challenging because of fluctuations in  NFIP premium revenues.", "To address some of these concerns, OCFO developed an automated  budget formulation tool and is customizing it to meet the agency\u2019s needs.  OCFO expects that the new tool will act as an interface with its current  systems and ease budget formulation by eliminating the use of  spreadsheets and allowing FIMA and other program offices to develop  spend plans directly in the system. The tool became operational within  OCFO in March 2011, and OCFO plans to implement it FEMA-wide on a  rolling basis throughout fiscal year 2011 to allow time to train staff.

While KPMG reports that  this condition was corrected in fiscal year 2009, to prevent future  problems the auditor recommended that FEMA develop better methods of  communicating such changes. KPMG also found that FEMA had not  completed its documentation of formal business policies and procedures  for several of the roles, responsibilities, processes, and functions  performed within FEMA.

Records enable and support an agency\u2019s ability to fulfill its  mission, and because records contain information, taking a systematic  approach to managing them is essential. According to NARA, effective  records management helps deliver services in a consistent and equitable  manner; facilitates effective performance throughout an agency; protects  the rights of the agency, its employees, and its customers; and provides  continuity in the event of a disaster. According to NARA, from a strategic  perspective, agencies lacking effective records management policies and  procedures can hinder their ability to respond swiftly to opportunities,  events, incoming requests, and investigations, and to effectively implement  policy. From an operational perspective, such agencies may waste internal  resources searching for or recreating records, while at the same time  incurring storage costs for records that are not properly purged. From a  regulatory standpoint, such agencies can face fines, sanctions, and  convictions from noncompliance with federal statutes, rules, and  regulations. Finally, from a legal perspective, such agencies can use  excessive time, costs, and resources during discovery in order to retrieve  needed materials from poorly organized records.", "According to a FEMA official, while there is broad consensus on the need  for a centralized electronic document management system, currently no  such system is in use. According to FEMA staff, FIMA has electronic  systems in place for claims processing and correspondence  recordkeeping, and FIMA\u2019s Risk Insurance Division has a system in place  that is used for document archiving for its division. FEMA\u2019s Records  Management Division told us it had instructed program offices needing a  records management system immediately to continue the use of existing  document management systems until DHS implements such a system.  However, the agency has no policies or procedures in place for  implementing such electronic systems. FEMA officials told us they had not  implemented an agencywide system, even on an interim basis, because  they were waiting for a decision from DHS on a centralized system.", "Further, FEMA lacks effective and systematic procedures to fully ensure  that it appropriately retains and manages its records. While DHS has an  overall records management directive, FEMA\u2019s agency-specific guidance is  outdated. For example, the guidance does not provide clear direction on  electronic recordkeeping but does contain direction on file cabinet sizes  and the use of candles in file rooms. FEMA Records Management officials  were unable to tell us when an updated directive would be forthcoming.  FEMA officials also said they had a plan for annually updating file plans  that staff were supposed to follow but did not have processes in place to  ensure that the plans actually were updated.", "As result of this lack of updated policy and guidance, FEMA\u2019s  recordkeeping practices, which apply to NFIP, may not conform with the  requirements of federal records management laws and regulations and  may not adhere to Standards for Internal Controls in the Federal  Government, which state that management should ensure that relevant,  reliable, and timely information is available for decision making and  external reporting. For example, in our review, FEMA staff told us they  were storing documents using a system of file rooms, personal file  cabinets, and document-sharing software with limited staff access.  According to FIMA staff, documents can be difficult to locate and at times  have been lost or thrown away when staff separate from the agency.  FEMA staff also told us they had faced decreased productivity due to lost  packages, delays in budget execution and policy decisions, destroyed  documents, and duplicated efforts. In addition, because FEMA staff are  currently spread across several different locations in the Washington, D.C.,  area and 10 field offices across the country, progress in meeting NFIP  goals can be slowed by staff\u2019s inability to locate, transfer, and archive  documents across all of these locations.", "FEMA has taken two actions that could help to ensure that its current  paper-based records are effectively managed. First, in fiscal year 2010 DHS  required all staff to take records management training on their individual  responsibilities for maintaining agency records. FEMA officials told us this  training was the first of its kind that the agency had offered. Second,  FEMA has begun identifying staff to act as records liaison officers in each  program office. Records liaison officers are responsible for helping ensure  that records are kept in accordance with the agency\u2019s file plan. Agency  officials told us they relied heavily on records liaison officers to provide  oversight in these areas. However, FEMA has not yet identified records  liaison officers for each section of the agency and has not yet conducted a  review or audit to fully ensure that records were being systematically  retained and managed. Until FEMA addresses the agency\u2019s immediate  need for a centralized document management system and develops  effective policies guiding the use of electronic systems, staff will continue  to face challenges maintaining records, affecting FEMA\u2019s ability to make  effective decisions and report accurately on its finances and operations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FEMA\u2019s Outdated Financial Management Systems and Processes Have Created Challenges and Left Unliquidated Obligations Unresolved", "paragraphs": ["Our review of FEMA\u2019s financial management found that staff faced  multiple challenges in their day-to-day operations due to limitations in the  systems they must use to perform these operations.

For example, they said that some of their systems for invoicing,  travel management, and debt collection did not interface with FEMA\u2019s  financial management system and, as a result, they had to manually enter  data in FEMA\u2019s system. In addition, OCFO staff said that because their  current travel management system was difficult and time consuming to  use, they employed a paper-based process for staff travel. While FEMA has  plans to implement a new system, a FEMA official told us the new system  would also be time consuming to use\u2014for example, it would not allow  staff to process multiple travel orders in a short period of time, as would  be required during emergency deployment. Finally, OCFO staff said that  both the current debt collection and Department of Justice grant systems  for nondisaster grants required that grant obligations be entered manually.  According to FEMA officials, DHS is currently in the process of developing  a DHS-wide grants management system; however, they estimated the  system would take roughly a few more years to fully develop and  implement.", "The lack of automated systems for budget formulation and execution  helped to make these tasks two of its biggest challenges. As we have seen,  FIMA currently uses a system of spreadsheets to formulate fiscal year  budgets and to track overall budget expenditure and specific line-item  expenses. According to FIMA officials, spreadsheets can be corrupted and  data are prone to errors because staff work on multiple versions. In  addition, FIMA staff also told us they faced challenges with the paper- based tracking of requisition orders, which are sent between departments.  In order to determine what was approved or not approved in the system  on a daily basis, staff must manually track requisition packages through  various offices. An agency official told us that the risks associated with  this paper-based process were high and there had been instances in which  packages were lost or signed for by unauthorized staff. These issues have  been raised in past audits by the DHS\u2019s Office of the Inspector General  (OIG). While FIMA has begun to implement an automated tracking  system, according to FEMA staff, the process was delayed due to IT  challenges.", "We have previously reported on weaknesses in FEMA\u2019s financial  management processes.

In addition, we reported that the design of FEMA\u2019s financial reporting  process increased the risk of inaccurate or incomplete data because it did  not include transaction-level data and places an over reliance on manual  data entry. Furthermore, our testing of transactions from the Bureau and  Statistical Agent database found that many transactions either lacked or  had incomplete insured names, addresses, or policy effective dates. As a  result, we were unable to test the accuracy of reported insured premium  amounts or whether policy premium information was complete.", "Recent external audits of DHS\u2019s financial statements, performed by KPMG,  have also identified material weaknesses in the area of unliquidated  obligations. As of March 2011, FEMA had a total of $3.3 million in  unliquidated obligations for NFIP-related funds that had been inactive for  at least 5 years. According to a FEMA official, around $3.0 million of these  funds could potentially be deobligated and used for new obligations  consistent with the purposes for which the funds were appropriated.  According to GAO\u2019s Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government, transactions should be promptly recorded to maintain their  relevance and value to management in controlling operations and making  decisions. This applies to the entire process or life cycle of a transaction o event from the initiation and authorization through its final classification  in summary records.\u201d Further, \u201ccontrol activities help to ensure that all  transactions are completely and accurately recorded.\u201d In addition,  \u201cinternal control and all transactions and other significant events need to  be clearly documented, and the documentation should be readily avai for examination.\u201d All documentation and records should be properly  managed and maintained.", "KPMG cited the unliquidated obligations issue as a material weakness i 2008 and as a significant deficiency in the 2009 and 2010 Consolidated  DHS Audits. According to a FEMA official, in 2009 the agency issued an  interim directive and procedures for addressing the unliquidated  obligations issue. For example, it has started to verify the age of  obligations older than 365 days and is working with points of contacts in  program offices to certify that the unliquidated accounts are still open.  However, OCFO told us that staff had sent memos to FIMA regarding this  issue but that FIMA staff responded they were unaware of the amount of  the unliquidated obligations and the potential amount that might be  returned to FIMA.

Historically, some FEMA investments have been  funded despite not receiving adequate review or oversight. Most notably,  the NextGen system went forward without the necessary reviews and  failed after 7 years and an investment of $40 million. Further, the $1  billion Risk Mapping Assessment and Planning (RiskMAP) program, which  is an effort to modernize flood hazard mapping, was funded without  receiving approval from the review board. OCPO officials said that this  former DHS review board did not sufficiently meet the department\u2019s  acquisition oversight needs, leading DHS to issue an interim acquisition  directive in November 2008 and a final directive in January 2010. The  directive provides an overall policy and structure for acquisition  management within DHS describing the Acquisition Life Cycle  Framework, Acquisition Review Process, and ARB, and outlines  management procedures and responsibilities related to various aspects of  acquisition.", "Because the DHS acquisition directive allows its component agencies to  set internal acquisition processes and procedures as long as they are  consistent with the DHS directive, in August 2010 OCPO began drafting its  own acquisition directive and a handbook explaining how to implement it.  FEMA had circulated its directive, for comments, and OCPO officials  expect it will be completed within 30 days after comments have been  collected and incorporated.", "One important component of acquisition management is reviewing  programs through an ARB. FEMA created its ARB in July 2009 and had  held four meetings as of January 2011.

While FEMA can choose to review  any acquisition activity, it requires that certain items be presented to the  ARB, including all acquisition programs with life cycle costs of more than  $50 million and enterprise service contracts with annual expenditures  greater than $20 million. As of January 2011, DHS recognized nine FEMA  programs requiring FEMA ARB review. Seven of these\u2014including the $1  billion RiskMAP program\u2014had gone through the FEMA ARB as of January  2011, and FEMA plans to review the other two, as well as others, in fiscal  year 2011. As it continues to review its portfolio of programs, it expects to  add additional programs to this list. In particular, OCPO is examining  FIMA\u2019s acquisition activities and considering adding NFIP operations to its  ARB list.", "FEMA has also faced challenges in the acquisition and oversight of its  contractors, which are critical to NFIP. Both OCPO and FIMA officials  said there had been communication challenges between contracting  officers who were part of OCPO and Contracting Officer\u2019s Technical  Representatives (COTR) who report to the contracting officers but also  work in the program offices. OCPO officials said that many COTRs were  loyal to their program office and communicated with contracting officers  only when a problem arose. FIMA officials said that contracting officers  had at times been unresponsive to them, particularly when reporting  contractor discrepancies. Moreover, both we and KPMG previously noted  weaknesses in FEMA\u2019s oversight of contractors. For example, we reported  that a lack of monitoring records, an inconsistent application of  procedures, and a lack of coordination diminished the effectiveness of  FEMA\u2019s monitoring of NFIP-related contracts. Further, KPMG officials  said that FIMA did not provide sufficient oversight of its contractors,  something that is of particular concern because FIMA has a relatively high  proportion of contractor staff. Moreover, DHS\u2019s OIG found that acquisition  personnel could not locate a number of contract files that were part of its  review including one for a $3 million flood risk assessment contract. The  report said that missing contract files created uncertainties, including  whether proper contracting procedures were followed, contractors were  held accountable for goods and services, and tax dollars were  appropriately spent.", "To correct some of its acquisition challenges, FEMA issued a directive in  September 2009 to clarify the roles, responsibilities, and requirements of  COTRs in contract administration. This directive includes, among other  things, a COTR Tiered Certification Program consisting of credentialing  and compliance, and FEMA plans to train all of its COTRs to their  appropriate certification levels by March 2011. Providing further guidance,  FEMA also issued a COTR handbook in February 2009. Among other  things, the handbook includes training requirements, duties, monitoring  and surveillance procedures, and documentation requirements. In May  2010, OCPO began a technical review of COTRs\u2019 Contract Administration  Files to better ensure that COTRs were adequately documenting their  contracts. OCPO officials also said that, realizing the importance of  outreach to FEMA\u2019s program offices, they had developed and funded a  \u201cHow to Work with Us\u201d training course and held the agency\u2019s first annual  program management seminar. Moreover, officials from FIMA\u2019s Risk  Insurance Division said they had changed their process for monitoring  contractors, including requiring the contractors to submit monthly  monitoring reports. As we have seen, most of these actions are relatively  new, and some have not been fully implemented. While these steps need to  be taken, the extent to which they will ensure effective oversight of  FEMA\u2019s acquisition activities remains to be seen.

FEMA officials told us they  had tentative plans to roll out the initial changes to processes throughout  relevant mission teams in 2011. In addition, FIMA officials told us they had  plans to undertake a separate effort to map seven other business  processes, including those for requisitions, hiring, congressional  correspondence, and salaries and benefits.

According to program plans, NextGen was to employ modern technology  and reengineered business processes to, among other things, improve the  accuracy and completeness of policy and claims data and provide 24-hour- a-day transaction processing and customer service. To meet these goals,  five system applications were to be developed, all of which were to be  supported by a new centralized database.  1.  Transaction Record Reporting Process (TRRP), which was to  collect data from the WYO insurers and flood insurance vendors on  policies and claims, conduct front-end balancing of financial data,  perform checks for errors in issued policies and processed claims, and  develop financial and statistical reports.  2.  Simple and Quick Access Net (SQANet), which was to permit  standardized and customized reporting of NFIP data.  3.  Flood Rating Engine Environment (FREE), which was to generate  online flood insurance rates and quotes.  4.  Flood Financial Management (F2M), which was to provide an  interface for NFIP financial stakeholders (NFIP bureaus, WYO  companies, and vendors) to enter, update, submit, and process  monthly financial data.  5.  ezClaims, which was to provide an interface for authenticated  claimants to view, edit, and process disaster and claims data.", "To deliver the system, the contractor adopted a spiral development  methodology, which involves the development of prototype applications  that are tested and assessed by users and refined accordingly.

In May  2008, a production version of NextGen was placed into operational use.  Shortly thereafter, however, users began reporting serious problems with  the system\u2019s performance, such as inaccurate calculations and erroneous  data. For example, the system showed no claims received or processed for  the entire state of Alaska, despite the fact that the legacy system showed  numerous claims.", "Shortly thereafter, NFIP decided to revert to its legacy system, and as a  result was forced to extend this system\u2019s operations and maintenance  contract. At the same time, NFIP decided to conduct user testing on  NextGen in late 2008 and early 2009. During this testing, system users  identified additional problems, causing FEMA leadership to establish an  Executive Steering Committee to decide how best to proceed. The  committee included FEMA\u2019s Director for Acquisition Management, Chief  Information Officer (CIO), Assistant Administrator for Mitigation, and  other senior-level executives. To support the steering committee, two  assessments were performed: one by the DHS Emergency Management  Inspector General that focused on FIMA\u2019s management and oversight of  both the legacy system contractor and the NextGen contractor; and one by  OCIO that focused on what could be salvaged from NextGen. In November  2009, based on interim results from the assessments, FEMA leadership  decided to cancel NextGen.", "In June 2010, FEMA leadership transferred responsibility for modernizing  NFIP\u2019s legacy system to OCIO.

To meet this goal, OCIO intends to first develop a clear  understanding of NFIP\u2019s business requirements. Next, it will test the  NextGen software applications against these requirements to determine  what gaps exist. During this time, OCIO also intends to establish a project  office capable of managing the effort.

While NFIP did conduct activities  intended to elicit NextGen requirements, these requirements\u2014which NFIP  refers to as \u201cbusiness requirements\u201d\u2014were neither complete nor clear.  Specifically, NFIP established five working groups to review and refine  business processes and provided the NextGen system developer with  NFIP operational manuals. These five groups, which were associated with  five business areas\u2014claims, marketing, financial management,  underwriting, and information technology\u2014were each expected to  produce a set of recommended business requirements. However, FEMA  officials described the groups\u2019 efforts as largely based on oral  communications, resulting in misunderstandings and poorly documented  requirements. For example, one working group produced four different  models of business processes, all of which were provided to the system  developer as a basis for defining more detailed system requirements.  According to the system developer, reconciling differences in these  models contributed to the challenges in defining the requirements for  NextGen.", "NFIP also provided the system developer with its operational manuals  (e.g., flood insurance manuals, specific rating guidelines, and transaction  reporting process manuals). However, none of these manuals were  current and complete, according to NFIP officials. For example, officials  told us the manuals were constantly changing and did not fully reflect  actual flood insurance underwriting practices. According to these officials,  only the NFIP subject matter experts had sufficient knowledge about the  practices actually being employed. However, the subject matter experts  were not sufficiently involved in defining business requirements. As a  result of this inadequate information, the system developer had to  interpret the business requirements, leading to the development of more  detailed requirements that were later found to be incomplete and  inaccurate.

These include lapses in NFIP\u2019s authorization, the role of  state and local governments, fluctuations in premium income, and  structural and organizational changes that have been made. Finally, as  noted in past GAO reports, NFIP also faces external challenges that will  continue to threaten the program\u2019s long-term financial health if they are  not addressed.

At the  same time, it is expected to cover its claims losses and operating expenses  with the premiums it collects, much like private insurers. In years when  flooding has not been catastrophic, NFIP has generally managed to meet  these competing goals. But in years of catastrophic flooding, such as 2005,  it has not. During those years, it has exercised its authority to borrow from  Treasury to pay claims and, as of April 2011, NFIP owed approximately  $17.8 billion to Treasury, mostly for the 2005 hurricane season. NFIP will  likely not be able to meet its interest payments in all years, causing the  debt to grow in certain years as FEMA may need to borrow to meet the  interest payments in some years and potential future flood losses in  others.

Adverse selection may also lead  to a concentration of policyholders in the riskiest areas. This problem is  further compounded by the fact that those at greatest risk are required to  purchase insurance from NFIP if they have a mortgage from a federally  regulated or insured lender.", "Finally, by law, FEMA is prevented from raising rates on each flood zone  by more than 10 percent each year. While most states regulate premium  prices for private insurance companies for other lines of insurance, they  generally do not set limits on premium rate increases, instead focusing on  whether the projected losses and expenses justify them."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "A Variety of External Factors Complicate FEMA\u2019s Administration of NFIP", "paragraphs": ["As previously reported, FEMA also faces a number of external factors that  are not necessarily within its control but that also must be considered  when discussing the administration of the program. First, FEMA relies on  private insurers to sell and service policies and adjust claims under the  Write-Your-Own (WYO) Program, but multiple lapses in program  authorization in recent years have strained NFIP\u2019s relationship with WYO  insurers. In particular, NFIP\u2019s legal authorization has lapsed multiple times  since it expired in 2008, leaving FEMA and WYO insurers unable to renew  policies that expired during these lapses. Recent reauthorizations of the  program have been for periods of time as short as 5 days. FIMA officials  said these lapses in reauthorization created a significant burden for WYO  insurers. For example, the insurers were forced to reallocate resources to  communicate with agents and customers about how program lapses would  affect them. In part for this reason, the largest WYO insurer left the  program, and NFIP is transitioning the 840,000 policies that the insurer  had been selling and servicing to NFIP\u2019s Direct Servicing Agent.", "Second, like some other federal programs, FEMA relies on state and local  governments and communities to implement parts of the program, which  can limit the effectiveness of some of FEMA\u2019s efforts. For example,  communities enforce building codes and other floodplain management  regulations in an effort to reduce the flood risk that insured structures  face, but some communities may not have sufficient resources to enforce  existing regulations. FEMA also relies on communities to administer grant  funds that are intended to mitigate high-risk properties. However certain  types of mitigation, such as relocation or demolition, might be met with  resistance by communities that rely on those properties for tax revenues,  such as coastal communities with significant development in areas prone  to flooding. Finally, communities and individuals have sometimes  mounted challenges to and resisted flood map revisions that place homes  in higher-risk flood zones and would thus raise premium rates.", "Third, the financial resources that NFIP uses to fund much of its  operations have fluctuated in recent years. NFIP divides the premiums  paid by policyholders into \u201cmandatory\u201d and \u201cdiscretionary\u201d dollars. Most  premium dollars are considered mandatory and are used to pay flood  claims and other budget items such as WYO fees and advertising. The  remaining premium dollars are allocated to discretionary uses and are  used to fund NFIP operations. FIMA staff have noted that lower-than- expected policy fee income in recent years has forced them to cut back on  certain functions, including contract and WYO oversight, field office  management, and community outreach. For example, FEMA officials said  that in 2009 FEMA based NFIP\u2019s budget on expectations that the program  would collect $156 million in policy fees, $107 million of which the  President\u2019s budget required to be spent on mapping. By the end of the  fiscal year, NFIP had collected only $144 million in policy fees, leaving  NFIP with only $37 million, instead of the expected $49 million, to pay  salaries and other operating expenses. NFIP received approval from  Congress to redirect $4.9 million in mandatory funds from the advertising  budget into the discretionary budget to pay for these expenses, and it  compensated for the remaining $7.1 million shortfall with spending cuts,  largely from staff attrition and a hiring freeze.", "Finally, both FEMA and FIMA have faced many significant changes to their  organizational structures and responsibilities since 2001, creating  challenges in implementing consistent and effective business processes.  FEMA underwent several organizational changes in 2001 and 2002, but the  most significant change occurred in 2003, when FEMA transitioned from  an independent agency to a component of the newly created DHS. At that  time, FEMA became part of DHS\u2019s Emergency Preparedness and Response  Directorate, and some of its functions were moved to other organizations  within DHS. In addition, functions that had formerly been part of other  agencies were incorporated into the new Emergency Preparedness and  Response organization. From 2003 through 2005, over $1.3 billion in new  or significantly expanded programs came into FEMA, while programs with  funding of nearly $1.5 billion were transferred out. Although these changes  nearly balance in dollar terms and the number of employees remained the  same, they created considerable disruption to FEMA\u2019s operations and  uncertainty about the availability of resources. After the 2005 hurricanes  and the widespread perception that FEMA had failed to effectively meet  its mission, the agency faced changes that created further uncertainty and  affected employee morale. In 2007, PKEMRA expanded FEMA\u2019s mission  by integrating preparedness with protection, recovery, response, and  mitigation to address all hazards. FEMA was reorganized again in 2009 at  the direction of a new FEMA Administrator. At the same time, FIMA has  also faced considerable organizational changes\u2014both through the overall  FEMA reorganizations and additional reorganizations that occurred with  successive FIMA administrators, most significantly in 2006. Policies and  processes are often specific to the organizational and oversight structures  that are in place when they are created, and when those structures change,  the policies and processes may no longer be relevant or complete."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FEMA Lacks Authority in Areas Critical to Its Long- term Financial Health", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FEMA Lacks Authority to Charge Full-Risk Rates on Many Properties and Is under Pressure to Allow Grandfathered Rates on Others", "paragraphs": ["As we have pointed out in previous reports, FEMA is required by law to  charge many policyholders less than full-risk rates, otherwise known as  subsidized rates. These rates are intended to encourage property owners  to purchase flood insurance, and today nearly one out of four NFIP  policies are based on a subsidized rate. These rates allow policyholders  with structures that were built before floodplain management regulations  were established in their communities to pay premiums that represent  about 40 percent to 45 percent of the actual risk premium. Moreover,  FEMA estimates that properties covered by policies with subsidized rates  experience as much as five times more flood damage than compliant new  structures that are charged full-risk rates. One difficulty in analyzing the  effect of subsidized premium rates is that, while they affect the overall  financial stability of NFIP and can potentially increase borrowing from the  Treasury, the subsidy is not recognized in FEMA\u2019s budget. As we have  reported in the past, the cost of federal insurance programs is often not  accurately reflected in agencies\u2019 budgets. As a result, Congress may not  have adequate information about the potential claims on the federal  budget when it establishes or reviews federal insurance programs. This  lack of information may be especially problematic in the case of NFIP  because of the continued growth in the subsidy. As we have pointed out,  the number of policies receiving subsidized rates has grown steadily in  recent years, and without changes to the program, will likely continue to  grow, increasing the potential for future NFIP operating deficits.", "In addition, NFIP may \u201cgrandfather\u201d properties when new flood maps  place them in higher-risk zones. Unlike private insurers that charge risk- based rates, FEMA made a policy decision to allow certain properties  remapped into riskier flood zones to keep their previous lower rates.  While FEMA is not statutorily required to grandfather these policies,  FEMA officials told us that they made the decision because of resistance  to rate increases and based on considerations of equity, ease of  administration, and goals of promoting floodplain management. However,  homeowners who are remapped into high-risk areas and do not currently  have flood insurance may be required to purchase it at the full-risk rate.  Further, FEMA recently introduced a new rating option called the  Preferred Risk Policy (PRP) Eligibility Extension that is, in effect, a  temporary grandfathering of premium rates. While PRPs traditionally  would have to be converted to more expensive standard-rated policies  when they were renewed, FEMA extended PRP eligibility to 2 years after a  new flood map\u2019s effective date or January 1, 2011, whichever is later.  FEMA made the decision to offer these lower rates in response to  significant community resistance to remapping and the resulting increased  rates as well as concern expressed by Congress. As we have reported, to  the extent that NFIP charges less than full-risk rates on many properties, it  adds to the risk that the program will need to borrow from Treasury to pay  claims."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FEMA Is Not Authorized to Account for Long-term Erosion in Developing Flood Maps", "paragraphs": ["While FEMA is in the process of updating the flood maps used to set  premium rates for NFIP, it is not authorized to account for long-term  erosion in developing these maps. The purpose of these maps is to  accurately estimate the likelihood of flooding in specific areas given  certain characteristics including elevation and topography. Despite these  modernization efforts, some maps can quickly become inaccurate because  of changes from long-term erosion, particularly in coastal areas. However,  FEMA is not authorized to map for these changes\u2014that is, it is not allowed  to take into account situations in which long-term erosion might increase  the risk of flooding in certain areas. Not accurately reflecting the actual  risk of flooding increases the likelihood that even full-risk premiums will  not cover future losses and adds to concerns about NFIP\u2019s financial  stability."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FEMA Is Limited in Its Ability to Encourage Property Owners to Undertake Mitigation Efforts", "paragraphs": ["In reforming NFIP in 2004, Congress noted that repetitive loss  properties\u2014generally, those that FEMA defines as having had two or more  flood insurance claims payments of $1,000 or more over 10 years\u2014 constituted a significant drain on NFIP resources. While Congress has  made efforts to address this issue through mitigation activities, repetitive  loss properties continue to be a drain on NFIP. Many of these properties  are part of the subsidized property inventory, and thus receive subsidized  rates, further contributing to NFIP\u2019s financial instability. This situation  exposes the federal government and ultimately taxpayers to greater risks  and is not consistent with several of the public policy goals (e.g., limiting  exposure to the federal government and the taxpayer) that we have  previously identified for disaster programs. As previously reported,  FEMA will offer premium discounts for efforts to mitigate high-risk  structures including raising the elevation of, relocating, or demolishing a  property, but these efforts are for the most part voluntary. FEMA does  have some authority to raise premium rates for property owners who  refuse mitigation offers made by local authorities, such as an offer to  elevate the property, in connection with the severe repetitive loss pilot  program. Specifically, if a property owner refuses a mitigation offer, FEMA  can increase premiums to up to 150 percent of their current amount and  by a similar amount later on if the property owner is paid a claim of  greater than $1,500. However, FEMA is prohibited from charging more  than the current full rate and as a result cannot increase premiums on  property owners are paying the full rate but who refuse a mitigation offer.  In addition, FEMA is not allowed to discontinue coverage for those who  refuse mitigation offers. As a result, FEMA has some limitations on its  ability to compel owners of properties with repetitive losses to undertake  flood mitigation efforts. Further, while Congress has made efforts to  reduce the number of repetitive loss properties, their number has grown,  making them an ongoing challenge to NFIP\u2019s financial stability.  Specifically, these properties account for about 1 percent of all policies  but are estimated to account for up to 30 percent of all NFIP losses. Unless  FEMA is able to effectively encourage owners of severe repetitive loss  properties to undertake mitigation efforts, the potential losses associated  with such properties continues to threaten the financial stability of the  NFIP.", "Recognizing that NFIP faces a variety of structural challenges that need to  be reformed, FIMA began a three-phase effort to develop  recommendations to reform the program by addressing some of the  program\u2019s external challenges. The process began with a listening session  in November 2009 to capture concerns and recommendations from about  200 stakeholder participants and to better understand the need for NFIP  reform. The second phase included adopting a policy analysis framework,  analyzing existing stakeholder input, developing and agreeing on guiding  principles to direct the NFIP reform effort, and creating evaluation criteria  to be used in scoring each of the proposed policy alternatives. The final  phase, which began in June 2010 and includes evaluating the policy  alternatives, will result in a reform proposal package that FIMA will  submit to FEMA leadership. To inform this phase, FIMA conducted two  additional stakeholder meetings in December 2010. This process may  provide some helpful ideas to address some of the major challenges facing  FEMA in its administration of NFIP. But as we have noted in earlier  reports, comprehensive legislative reform will be needed to stabilize its  financial condition."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["While FEMA has begun to take steps to address its issues, it faces  significant management challenges in areas that affect NFIP, including  strategic planning, human capital planning, collaboration among offices,  records management, financial management, acquisition management, and  business processes. Effectively addressing these challenges would require  program improvements at all levels within FIMA, FEMA, and DHS and  would not only help improve the administration of NFIP but also help to  more effectively deal with financial and operational challenges that NFIP  faces\u2014challenges over which FEMA often has limited direct control.  While FEMA has not yet addressed many of these issues, in part because  of the demands of its key mission of responding to emergencies, it is  beginning to take certain steps to address its challenges. While some  efforts are under way, FEMA has much work ahead of it in beginning to  plan and execute the day-to-day activities necessary to effectively manage  both the agency and NFIP and to ensure effective collaboration between  program and support offices. As we have seen, for example:    FEMA has not provided FIMA with strategic direction and guidance for  administering NFIP, and FIMA has not developed a comprehensive  strategy with goals and objectives for the program. GPRA states that  strategic plans should include such guidance and strategies for major  programs like NFIP. Without this direction, NFIP lacks a strategic  focus, and the agency is limited in its ability to develop effective  performance measures to measure NFIP\u2019s progress. Without a robust  set of performance measures and an established process for  management to regularly review them, the agency cannot monitor and  hold accountable management and staff involved in the program.", "FEMA lacks a strategic human capital plan (as required by PKEMRA)  that addresses the critical competencies required for its workforce.  Such a plan is critical for FEMA because of its heavy reliance on  contractors. Without such a plan, FEMA is limited in its ability to  assess its staffing and workforce needs, manage turnover, fill  vacancies, and oversee its contractor workforce.", "FEMA lacks a plan to ensure that agency operations are maintained  when federal disasters are declared and staff are deployed to respond.  Without such a plan, FEMA faces the risk that some critical day-to-day  functions may not be performed while staff are deployed, limiting the  agency\u2019s ability to provide the necessary support for disaster relief  missions.", "FIMA relies on Mission Support for a variety of mission-critical  functions, including IT, acquisition, and financial management, but  FIMA and Mission Support have faced challenges in collaborating with  one another. For example, FIMA and OCFO have had limited  communication regarding FIMA\u2019s budget formulation needs. Without  better collaboration and communication between FIMA and Mission  Support\u2019s various offices, FEMA will be unable to fully ensure that  NFIP\u2019s IT, acquisition, and financial and budgetary needs are being  met.", "Further, FEMA still lacks comprehensive systems, policies, and processes  that would help ensure sound records, financial, and acquisition  management as they relate to NFIP. In particular:    FEMA has no centralized electronic document management system  that would allow its various offices to easily access and store  documents. As a result, the offices have faced problems with lost or  destroyed documents, decreased productivity, and duplicated effort.  While there is broad consensus for the need for a centralized electronic  document management system, FEMA is currently awaiting an overall  DHS decision on a system to be used for this process. However, until  such a system is provided, FEMA will continue to face document  management challenges that impede program effectiveness.", "In previous audits, KPMG found weaknesses within FEMA\u2019s  management of unliquidated obligations. The agency has issued an  interim directive for addressing the issue, but FIMA staff said they did  not know the amount of these obligations and the extent to which they  have been inactive. Until FEMA reviews FIMA\u2019s unliquidated  obligations, FIMA may be foregoing funds that could otherwise be  returned and used for other program needs.", "Recognizing a number of weaknesses in its oversight and management  of acquisitions, FEMA has taken steps to improve these functions,  including drafting an acquisition directive and a handbook explaining  how to implement it. However, most of these actions have either been  recently implemented or are still under development. While they are  the kinds of steps that need to be taken, the extent to which they will  ensure effective oversight of FEMA\u2019s acquisition activities remains to  be seen.", "FEMA Mission Support staff told us that in early 2009 they began a  business process improvement effort that involved mapping current  processes, analyzing them, and determining how they could be  improved. Until this mapping process is complete and related internal  control processes are developed, a high risk exists that certain  functions will be inconsistently or incompletely carried out.", "In addition, FEMA has spent about 7 years and $40 million in its latest  attempt to modernize NFIP\u2019s insurance policy and claims management  system. FEMA ultimately canceled the effort in November 2009 because it  failed to meet user expectations, forcing the agency to continue relying on  an outdated system that is neither effective nor efficient. Any further  attempts to modernize the program\u2019s existing system must recognize the  root causes of NextGen\u2019s failure, which include:    FEMA\u2019s and DHS\u2019s failure to provide sufficient oversight of the project  and to allow these acquisition weaknesses to go unchecked for years.  Without sufficient management oversight, FEMA will be limited in its  ability to ensure that future modernization attempts are completed  efficiently and effectively.", "Weaknesses in several key system acquisition areas that led to  NextGen\u2019s cancellation, including poorly defined and managed  requirements, poorly planned and executed system testing,  insufficiently mitigated program risks, and an inadequately staffed  program office. Unless FEMA learns from these mistakes, future  modernization attempts could face the same fate.", "In addition to management challenges, FEMA still faces challenges related  to its financial operations and rate structure. The hurricanes of 2005  required a massive response from FEMA as it worked to help thousands of  individuals recover from sometimes devastating damage to their property.  The scope of the damages and total claims paid, which were unparalleled  in NFIP\u2019s history, highlighted challenges with the program\u2019s financial  structure. These challenges, along with the debt incurred by NFIP as a  result of the 2005 hurricanes, remain today.", "As we have indicated in previous reports, FEMA can take some actions to  improve NFIP\u2019s financial stability, such as ensuring that NFIP\u2019s full-risk  premium rates accurately reflect the risk of loss and ensuring that WYO  insurers justify and document their claims for payment. However, fully  addressing other challenges to the long-term financial stability of the  program will require congressional action. For example, as we have  pointed out, congressional action to allow NFIP to charge full-risk  premium rates to all property owners would decrease the potential for  future NFIP operating losses. Authorizing the inclusion of long-term  erosion in future rate maps and providing FEMA with the authority to  require owners of repetitive loss properties to mitigate or impose penalties  for not doing so would also reduce the risks of future NFIP losses. We  recognize that these potential changes involve tradeoffs. Increasing  premium rates and requiring homeowners to mitigate flood-prone  properties could, for example, reduce participation and create hardship  for some property owners. Nevertheless, until these and related issues are  resolved, the program will continue to present a significant financial risk  to the government and taxpayers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve strategic planning, performance management, and program  oversight within and related to NFIP, we recommend that the Secretary of  DHS direct the FEMA Administrator to take the following four actions:    Provide strategic direction and guidance to the process for developing  a comprehensive strategy for FIMA operations; establish a firm  timeframe for and complete the development of this strategy; and take  steps to ensure that this strategy has appropriate performance goals  and measures to track NFIP\u2019s progress.", "Develop a comprehensive workforce plan according to PKEMRA that  identifies agency staffing and skills requirements, addresses turnover  and staff vacancies, and analyzes FEMA\u2019s use of contractors.", "Direct the FEMA Administrator to develop guidance for continuing  operations when staff are deployed to respond to federal disasters and  direct FIMA Acting Assistant Administrator to develop such a plan.", "Direct the FIMA Acting Assistant Administrator and the FEMA Mission  Support Associate Administrator to develop protocols to encourage  and monitor collaboration between FIMA and relevant support offices,  including those for information technology, acquisition management,  and financial management.", "To improve FEMA\u2019s policies, procedures, and systems for achieving  NFIP\u2019s program goals, we recommend that the Secretary of DHS direct the  FEMA Administrator to take the following four actions:    While waiting for DHS to implement an agencywide electronic  document management system, consider the costs and benefits of  implementing an interim system for FEMA and updating its document  management policies and procedures.", "Ensure that FEMA regularly reviews unliquidated obligations within  NFIP-related funds.", "Establish timelines for and complete the development and  implementation of FEMA\u2019s revised acquisition process, in line with the  DHS Acquisition Directive 102-01, including a rollout process with staff  training and a mechanism to better ensure that all acquisitions undergo  the necessary reviews.", "Ensure that FEMA Mission Support\u2019s business process improvement  efforts are expeditiously completed.", "To improve the usefulness and reliability of NFIP\u2019s flood insurance policy  and claims processing system, we recommend that the Secretary of DHS  take the following two actions:    Direct the DHS Deputy Secretary, as the Chair of DHS\u2019s ARB, to  provide regular oversight of FEMA\u2019s next attempt to modernize this  system.", "Direct the FEMA Administrator to ensure that FEMA\u2019s CIO applies  lessons learned from the NextGen experience to the next  modernization attempt.
