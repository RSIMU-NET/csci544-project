The aging HH-60G inventory has shrunk over the years as a result of mishaps. As the inventory was declining, the Air Force began efforts to replace its fleet with the new Combat Rescue Helicopter.", "The National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2018 includes a provision for GAO to review HH-60G replacement programs. This report examines: (1) the maintenance condition and service life of the Air Force's HH-60G Pave Hawk helicopters; (2) the Air Force's schedule for fielding the new Combat Rescue Helicopter in the active and reserve components; and (3) any training challenges the Air Force has identified related to this schedule.", "GAO analyzed flight hour and availability data and contracts and fielding schedule for new and refurbished personnel recovery helicopters for the Air Force. GAO also analyzed documentation, and interviewed officials from the Air Force Headquarters, the Air Force major commands, including the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve, and training and test and evaluation units to discuss challenges the Air Force expects to face as it fields its new helicopters."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The material condition of the Air Forces' aging HH-60G fleet has declined and maintenance challenges have increased, in part due to extensions beyond the designed service life of the helicopters. About 68 percent of the 96-helicopter fleet were mission-capable as of fiscal year 2017, below the Air Force desired mission-capable rate of 75 percent. The fleet is experiencing maintenance challenges. For example, the helicopters undergoing depot-level maintenance spent an average of 332 days undergoing such maintenance in fiscal year 2017 compared with 233 days in fiscal year 2007, more than a 40-percent increase. Air Force officials attribute these challenges to the helicopters exceeding their initially planned service life. Currently, available helicopters across the fleet average about 7,100 flight hours about 18 percent more than their initial expected service life of 6,000 hours.", "According to Air Force officials, the schedule for fielding the new Combat Rescue Helicopters generally prioritizes the replacement of helicopters with the highest number of flight hours; as a result, the active component is scheduled to begin receiving its new helicopters in fiscal year 2020, 6 years before the reserve component. In May 2018, the Air Force's active component HH-60Gs averaged about 2,000 more flight hours per helicopter than the reserve component. Under the fielding schedule, the Air National Guard squadrons are to receive new Combat Rescue Helicopters beginning in 2027, at the end of the fielding period. According to officials, in the meantime, to address aging helicopters in the Air National Guard, the Guard is scheduled to receive refurbished Army helicopters beginning in 2019. According to Air Force officials, these helicopters will have 3,000 or fewer flight hours and will be upgraded to the Air Force's HH-60G configuration. The Air Force officials explained that these helicopters are expected to increase reliability rates, reduce the need for unscheduled maintenance, and bridge the gap until the Air National Guard receives the new Combat Rescue Helicopters.", "Due to the Air Force fielding schedule for the Combat Rescue Helicopters, the Air Force may face a challenge in supporting formal training for reserve component squadrons in fiscal year 2025 through 2028. The training squadrons at Kirtland and Nellis Air Force Bases conduct all formal HH-60G training for both the active and reserve components. By 2025, these training squadrons are scheduled to be completely transitioned to the new Combat Rescue Helicopters. Given the fielding schedule, the training squadrons will not have any legacy HH-60Gs for formal training for the reserve component. However, some squadrons in the reserve component are scheduled to continue flying HH-60Gs until 2028 and will still need formal training. Air Force reserve component officials did not concur with the new Combat Rescue Helicopter fielding schedule. However, Air Force officials said that they plan to maintain their fielding schedule because changing it would require renegotiation of the contract, likely increase costs, and possibly delay delivery of the new helicopters. Air Force officials acknowledged this potential training issue and told GAO that the Air Force was considering options to address it; including retaining some legacy HH-60Gs at a training squadron to provide training during any gap period."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making any recommendations in this report.

The unique  and advanced capabilities of this helicopter and its highly trained crews  make it the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) premier personnel recovery  helicopter. HH-60G units deploy frequently to support DOD personnel  recovery missions and other operations around the world, and in recent  years DOD has relied on these units to support medical evacuations in  Iraq and Afghanistan. Although the other military services fly similar  helicopters\u2014such as the Army\u2019s UH-60L\u2014the HH-60G\u2019s extensive  communication suite and ability to operate at high altitudes and conduct  in-flight refueling are some of the capabilities that make the HH-60G  uniquely suited for recovering personnel who may be isolated in enemy  territory.

The HH-60G was initially designed to have a  service life of approximately 6,000 flight hours, according to officials, and  the Air Force procured 112 helicopters. As the helicopters aged and the  inventory shrunk as a result of mishaps, the Air Force planned to procure  a replacement helicopter\u2014the Combat Search and Rescue Replacement  Vehicle. However, this replacement program was canceled in 2009. Since  then the inventory has continued to shrink and currently the Air Force has  96 HH-60G Pave Hawk helicopters, 16 fewer than required. The Air Force  is now planning to rebuild its inventory in two ways. First, the Air Force  procured 21 Army UH-60Ls, and those helicopters are being converted  into the HH-60G Pave Hawk configuration under the Air Force\u2019s  Operational Loss Replacement program. Second, the Air Force is  purchasing 112 new Combat Recovery Helicopters (HH-60Ws) to replace  its fleet of HH-60G Pave Hawk helicopters by 2029.", "The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal year 2018 included a  provision for us to review the Air Force\u2019s HH-60G replacement programs,  which it defined as including both the Operational Loss Replacement and  Combat Rescue Helicopter programs.

We compared the average squadron mission capable rates to  the Air Force desired mission capable rate. We also analyzed fiscal year  2013-2017 Air Force maintenance \u201ccode 3 breaks\u201d data, defined by the  Air Force as an aircraft that lands and is unable to complete at least one  of its primary missions. According to Air Force policy, this metric primarily  indicates aircraft system reliability. To determine which \u201ccode 3 breaks\u201d  were most common, we analyzed fiscal year 2013\u20132017 annual code 3  break reports across the HH-60G fleet. We also analyzed flight hour data  across the HH-60G fleet. Specifically, we analyzed flight-hour data by  component and major command and compared them with the initial  number of flight hours that Air Force officials stated the helicopters were  originally designed to fly.", "To assess the reliability of the fiscal year 2013\u20132017 mission capable  rates, maintenance \u201ccode 3 break\u201d data, and flight-hour data we  discussed with Air Force officials the processes used to collect the data  and the internal controls used to maintain the databases where the data  are maintained. We also conducted manual data testing on the flight-hour  data and did not find any missing data, outliers, or obvious errors. We  concluded that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  determining average mission capable rates, reported flight hours by  component, and the three most frequently-noted maintenance \u201ccode 3  breaks\u201d between 2013 and 2017. To corroborate our understanding of Air  Force efforts to rebuild the personnel recovery helicopter inventory and  maintenance, and mission capable rate data, we conducted interviews  with officials from Air Force Headquarters, the Air Combat Command, the  Air National Guard, the Air Force Reserve, the formal training squadrons  at Kirtland and Nellis Air Force Base, and the Test and Evaluation  squadron at Nellis Air Force Base.", "For objective two, we analyzed historical information from the Combat  Search and Rescue Replacement Vehicle helicopter program and from  the current Combat Rescue Helicopter fielding schedule.

However, for each of the  past 5 years, the helicopters\u2019 mission capable rates have been below the  Air Force\u2019s goal, and for fiscal year 2017, 68 percent of the 96 helicopter  fleet were mission capable.", "As the helicopters have aged, the amount of time spent conducting  maintenance on them has increased. For example, according to Air Force  officials, in fiscal year 2013 the fleet averaged about 21 maintenance  manhours for every HH-60G flight hour. However, by fiscal year 2017, the  maintenance time spent had increased to an average of more than 25  maintenance manhours for every flight hour. According to officials, the  increased time conducting maintenance is a result of an aging helicopter  that requires more intensive maintenance. Further, according to officials,  in 2007 the average amount of time required to conduct more extensive  depot-level maintenance was 233 days, but by fiscal year 2017 it was 332  days, more than a 40 percent increase. Air Force maintenance data for  fiscal years 2013-2017 show that airframes, turboshaft engines, and flight  controls (see fig. 4) were the HH-60G elements that failed most often.

According to Air Force officials, as part of this fixed- price contract, specific terms such as base locations and order of delivery  were predetermined.", "According to Air Force officials, while the Combat Rescue Helicopter  contract does allow for some variation in the quantity of helicopters  procured each year, there is no location and order variation permitted  without the renegotiation of price. According to the Air Force, any  changes outside the included variation of the number of aircraft to be  purchased in a given year (i.e. change in the order or location of the  bases) would negate the firm-fixed prices in the year where the change  occurred, and in all the remaining years of the contract. Specifically, if  changes are made to the order or location of the bases, potential contract  line items that could increase include base level spares, readiness spares  packages, support equipment, interim supply support and field support  representatives for both aircraft and training systems. According to Air  Force officials, fielding schedule changes could also put at risk the ability  to provide timely funding for the military construction projects necessary  to house new simulators at the rescue squadrons\u2019 bases. These officials  stated that the current Combat Rescue Helicopter fixed-price contract is  ahead of schedule and within budget, as of June 2018. Air Force officials  said they expect to have new helicopters by March 2020, 3 months ahead  of schedule.
