A key expectation is that  the Congress will gain a clearer understanding of what is being achieved in  relation to what is being spent.  To accomplish this, the act requires that,  beginning for fiscal year 1999, agencies prepare annual performance plans  containing annual performance goals covering the program activities in  agencies\u2019 budget requests.  In addition, Office of Management and Budget  (OMB) guidance states that agency performance plans should display, by  program activity, the funding level being applied to achieve performance  goals.

Finding that waste and inefficiency in  federal programs were undermining confidence in government, the  Congress sought to hold federal agencies accountable for the results of  federal spending through regular and systematic performance planning,  measurement, and reporting.  Among its several purposes, the act is  designed to improve congressional decision-making by providing more  objective information on the relative effectiveness and efficiency of federal  programs and spending.  That is, with regard to spending decisions, the act  aims for a closer and clearer link between the process of allocating  resources and the expected results to be achieved with those resources."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Concept of Performance Budgeting", "paragraphs": ["The concept of linking performance information with the budget is  commonly known as performance budgeting.  Within the past 50 years,  initiatives at the local, state, and federal levels of government as well as in  other nations have sought to link performance expectations with specific  budget amounts.  In essence, the concept of performance budgeting  assumes that a systematic presentation of performance information  alongside budget amounts will improve budget decision-making by  focusing funding choices on program results.  Specifically, performance  budgeting seeks to shift the focus of attention from detailed items of  expense\u2014such as salaries and travel\u2014to the allocation of resources based  on program goals and measured results.  In this sense, the Results Act is the  most recent of a series of federal initiatives embodying concepts of  performance budgeting.", "At the federal level and elsewhere, performance budgeting initiatives have  encountered many challenges.  Key challenges include a lack of credible  and useful performance information, difficulties in achieving consensus on  goals and measures, dissimilarities in program and fund reporting  structures, and limitations of information and accounting systems.  For  example, some prior initiatives used new and unfamiliar formats that were  layered onto existing budget and appropriations processes, compromising  the goal of integrating performance information into the budget process.   Specifically in the federal government, past performance budgeting  initiatives resulted in unique and often voluminous presentations  unconnected to the structures and processes used in congressional budget  decision-making.", "When viewed collectively, these past initiatives suggest three common  themes.  First, any effort to link plans and budgets must explicitly involve  the executive and legislative branches of our government.  Past initiatives  often faltered because the executive branch developed plans and  performance measures in isolation from congressional oversight and  resource allocation processes.  Second, the concept of performance  budgeting will likely continue to evolve.  Past initiatives demonstrated that  there is no single definition of performance budgeting that encompasses  the range of needs and interests of federal decisionmakers.  Third and  perhaps most importantly, past initiatives showed that performance  budgeting cannot be viewed in simplistic terms\u2014that is, resource  allocation cannot be mechanically linked to results.  The process of  budgeting is inherently an exercise in political choice\u2014allocating scarce  resources among competing needs\u2014in which performance information  can be one, but not the only, factor underlying decisions.  Ultimately, the  promise of any performance budgeting initiative, including the Results Act,  lies in its potential to more explicitly infuse performance information into  budgetary deliberations, thereby changing the terms of debate from simple  inputs to expected and actual results."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Performance Budgeting Under the Results Act", "paragraphs": ["The Results Act differs from earlier performance budgeting initiatives in  several key respects but can be viewed as a continued evolution of the  concept.  At its most basic level, the act requires agencies\u2019 annual  performance plans to directly link performance goals and the program  activities of their budget requests.  Testifying on the Results Act before its  passage, the Director of OMB characterized this linkage as a \u201climited\u2014but  very useful\u2014form of performance budgeting . . . .\u201d  The act also requires  that another form of performance budgeting be tested during performance  budgeting pilots.", "The Results Act requires an agency\u2019s annual performance plan to cover  each program activity in the President\u2019s budget request for that agency.   Subject to clearance by OMB and generally resulting from negotiations  between agencies and appropriations subcommittees, program activity  structures are intended to provide a meaningful representation of the  operations financed by a specific budget account.  Typically, the President\u2019s  annual budget submission encompasses over 1,000 accounts and over 3,000  program activities.  As the committee report accompanying the act noted,  however, the program activity structure is not consistent across the federal  government but rather is tailored to individual accounts. The committee  report further cautioned that agencies\u2019 annual plans should not be  voluminous presentations that overwhelm rather than inform the reader.  Accordingly, the act gives agencies the flexibility to consolidate, aggregate,  or disaggregate program activities, as illustrated in figure 1, so long as no  major function or operation of the agency is omitted or minimized.  In  addition to this flexibility, agencies also have the option to propose  changing their budget structures, subject to concurrence from OMB and  the Congress.", "OMB\u2019s guidance regarding this provision of the act set forth an additional  criterion: plans should display, generally by program activity, the funding  level being applied to achieve performance goals.  That is, OMB expected  performance plans to show how amounts from the agency\u2019s budget request  would be allocated to the performance goals displayed in the plan.", "In addition to mandating a linkage between budget requests and  performance plans, the act required that pilot projects be used to test  another approach to performance budgeting.  OMB, in consultation with  the head of each agency, was required to designate for fiscal years 1998 and  1999 at least five agencies to prepare budgets that \u201cpresent, for one or more  of the major functions and operations of the agency, the varying levels of  performance, including outcome-related performance, that would result  from different budgeted amounts.\u201d  While the act required agencies to  define goals consistent with the level of funding requested in the  President\u2019s budget, the act\u2019s pilots would also show how performance  would change if the agency received more or less than requested.  OMB  was to include these pilot performance budgets as an alternative  presentation in the President\u2019s budget for fiscal year 1999 and to transmit a  report to the President and to the Congress no later than March 31, 2001, on  the feasibility and advisability of including a performance budget as part of  the President\u2019s budget.  This report is also to recommend whether  legislation requiring performance budgets should be proposed.", "The performance budgeting pilots were scheduled to start in fiscal year  1998 \u201cso that they would begin only after agencies had sufficient  experience in preparing strategic and performance plans, and several years  of collecting performance data.\u201d  In this context, and recognizing the  importance of concentrating on governmentwide implementation in 1998,  OMB announced on May 20, 1997, that the pilots would be delayed for at  least a year.  OMB stated that the performance budgeting pilots would  require the ability to calculate the effects on performance of marginal  changes in cost and funding.  According to OMB, very few agencies had this  capability, and the delay would give time for its development.  In  September 1998, OMB solicited agencies\u2019 comments on these pilots, but no  agencies have been designated as pilots.  At present, OMB has no definite  plans for proceeding with the performance budgeting pilots."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agencies Linked Complex Planning and Budgeting Structures Using Many Approaches", "paragraphs": ["The complexities that are the hallmark of today\u2019s federal budget account  structure and the diverse planning structures associated with broad federal  missions were reflected in the approaches used to link budget and planning  structures.  The fiscal year 1999 performance plans we reviewed frequently  depicted complex and imprecise relationships between these structures.   Using the Results Act\u2019s flexibility to aggregate, consolidate, and  disaggregate existing program activities, most agencies generally linked  their program activities to some level of a frequently complex planning  hierarchy.  These linkages were often presented in a performance plan that  was separable from the agency\u2019s budget justification.  As a result, plans  frequently depicted a relationship between program activities and  performance goals that, while consistent with the act\u2019s charge to cover  program activities, proved difficult to translate into budgetary terms.   However, 14, or 40 percent of the agencies we reviewed, built on these  relationships to show how the funding from program activities would be  allocated to achieve discrete sets of performance goals.

As a result,  budget accounts and program activities within the accounts vary from  agency to agency.  This complexity was evident for agencies included in  this review.  For example, the number of budget accounts associated with a  given agency\u2019s performance plan ranged from a low of 1 to a high of 118 for  the agencies we reviewed, while the number of program activities to be  covered by the plan ranged from 6 to 465.  The median number of accounts  for agencies that we reviewed was 9, and the median number of program  activities was 32.  Typically, program activity structures were unique not  only to each of the agencies in our review, but also to each of the budget  accounts within an agency.  In only 2 agencies\u2014EPA and the Department  of Defense\u2014were the same program activity titles repeated across all or  groups of an agency\u2019s budget accounts.", "Agencies\u2019 planning structures were similarly complex, comprised of widely  varying numbers and layers of goals.  The Results Act and OMB guidance  give agencies flexibility in structuring strategic and annual performance  goals. Annual performance goals are expected to measure progress in  achieving longer term strategic goals. There is no required format or  structure and no limitation on the number of goals that can be included in a  performance plan.  Our sample of performance plans presented a variety of  planning structures and many different terms to describe those structures.   Twenty-one of the 35 agencies we reviewed used a cascading hierarchy of  goals to put their fiscal year 1999 performance in context\u2014that is, these  plans placed one or more layers of goals between their strategic and annual  performance goals.  For example, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM)  plan contained a complex hierarchy of goals: 5 \u201cGeneral Goals,\u201d supported  by 17 \u201cStrategic Goals,\u201d that were supported by 43 \u201cPerformance Goals,\u201d  47 \u201cLong-Term Goals,\u201d and, finally, 64 fiscal year 1999 \u201cAnnual Goals.\u201d   Figure 2 shows the numbers and layers of goals associated with one of  BLM\u2019s five general goals.  The remaining 14 agencies, however, had fewer  layers of goals.  For example, the U.S. Agency for International  Development\u2019s (USAID) six strategic goals were supported directly by  performance goals with fiscal year 1999 targets.  Figure 3 presents the  performance goals associated with one of USAID\u2019s strategic goals.", "To analyze these disparate planning structures, we developed and used a  common framework that defined two layers of goals above the annual  performance goals stated in the performance plans: (1) strategic goals, to  reflect the first goal layer under an agency\u2019s mission statement and (2)  strategic objectives, to reflect the next subordinate level of goals under  strategic goals. We found that, quantifying just these two layers, most  agency plans involved relatively complex presentations.  The number of  strategic goals in plans we reviewed ranged from 1 to 47, with a median of  5.  Just over half of the agencies in our review placed an intervening layer  of strategic objectives between strategic and performance goals.  In plans  where strategic objectives were used, the number of strategic objectives  ranged from 5 to 122.  Across our sample of agency plans, the median  number of strategic objectives used was nine."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Variety of Approaches to Linking Budget and Planning Structures", "paragraphs": ["The variety and complexity of agencies\u2019 planning and budget structures  necessarily resulted in a range of approaches to present and link this  information.

Only 6 of the 35 plans we reviewed had been fully  integrated into the agency\u2019s budget justification (see appendix II).", "In addition to separating plans and budgets, almost all agencies retained  the budget structure they had used in previous budget submissions.  Only  three agencies in our review\u2014EPA, the Customs Service, and the Nuclear  Regulatory Commission (NRC)\u2014substantially changed their program  activity structures, and all cited the Results Act as a factor in this change.   Some others\u2014such as the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and the  Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)\u2014noted that such changes were under  consideration but proposed no changes in fiscal year 1999.  For example,  BIA stated that it would work with OMB and congressional committees  to \u201csimplify the budget format to mirror the strategic plan.\u201d  However,  agencies very frequently took advantage of the act\u2019s flexibility to  modify\u2014that is, to aggregate, consolidate, or disaggregate\u2014program  activities in order to show linkages with performance goals.  The extent to  which this flexibility was used varied greatly.  For example, figure 4  illustrates how the Administration for Children and Families (ACF)  consolidated program activities before relating them to performance goals.", "Figure 5 illustrates how the Health Resources and Services Administration  (HRSA) linked some performance goals to disaggregated program  activities.", "In addition to modifying or proposing changes to program activities,  agencies in our review used three principal strategies to meet the Results  Act\u2019s expectation that annual plans would \u201cestablish performance goals to  define the level of performance to be achieved by a program activity.\u201d", "About half (13) of the agencies that made linkages between  performance goals and program activities in their performance plans  established this connection at the relatively high level of strategic goals  or objectives.  For example, as shown in figure 4, ACF linked  consolidated program activities to strategic objectives, which, in turn,  were subsequently associated with performance goals.", "About the same number of agencies (14) defined direct linkages to  performance goals.  Figure 5 illustrates how HRSA linked disaggregated  program activities directly to its performance goals.", "Three agencies\u2014the National Aeronautics and Space Administration,  the National Science Foundation, and VA\u2014linked program activities to  something other than a statement of strategic goals, strategic objectives,  or performance goals.  For example, the VA plan contained 17 strategic  goals and 25 strategic objectives.  However, instead of linking program  activities directly to these goals and objectives, VA linked both its  program activities and performance goals to its 10 business lines.  The  business lines generally represented different agency functions such as  medical care and education.", "As the above discussion indicates, regardless of the strategy used, most  agencies ended with the same basic relationship\u2014many program activities  were related to many performance goals (see appendix II).  These  imprecise, \u201cmany-to-many\u201d relationships frequently resulted from agencies\u2019  linking aggregated or consolidated program activities with strategic goals  or other groupings of performance goals.  For example, in figure 4, ACF  consolidated program activities and linked them to the group of  performance goals associated with a strategic objective, creating a many- to-many relationship between program activities and performance goals.   In contrast, eight plans used a more direct and simple approach\u2014typically  linking a single program activity with multiple performance goals.  Figure 5  shows that HRSA linked a single disaggregated program activity to multiple  performance goals.", "While 30 of 35 plans defined some relationship between program activities  and performance goals, 16 of these did not build on that relationship by  showing how the funding from program activities would be allocated to  discrete sets of performance goals.", "Ten of these 16 plans did not present funding levels for any set of  performance goals in their performance plans.", "Six of these 16 plans presented funding levels for some set of  performance goals without explaining how those funding levels had  been derived from program activities in their budget requests.", "However, 14 agency plans, or 40 percent of those included in our review,  both identified the funding for program activities and explained how that  funding would be allocated to a discrete set of performance goals.

We  found that some of the approaches that these agencies used, alone or in  combination, were more frequently associated with plans that linked  program activity funding to performance goals.  For example, agencies that  (1) established simple relationships between program activities and  performance goals or (2) fully integrated budget justifications and  performance plans were significantly more likely to allocate program  activity funding to performance goals.

To determine if  concentration of spending was a significant factor, we calculated the  number of agencies for which 75 percent or more of requested spending  was associated with a single account.  Again, no significant relationship  was observed (see figure 7).  Four, or 36 percent, of the agencies with  spending concentrated in one account allocated program activity funding  to performance goals.

Agencies whose plans  were fully integrated with the budget justification nearly always (five of six  such plans) allocated program activity funding to performance goals (see  figure 11).

Three agencies proposed new program activities within existing  budget accounts to generally reflect the strategic goals of their  performance plan.  These proposals sometimes facilitated a relatively  simple relationship between program activities and performance goals  that helped make connections clear. integrating performance information with budget justifications.  In some  cases, this took the form of fully integrating the performance plan with  the agency\u2019s budget justification, as in the IRS, the Customs Service, and  the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Where plans were not fully  integrated with budget justifications, some agencies used the  justification to provide more detailed information on goals contained in  their performance plan.

The crosswalk identifies funding for  accounts or program activities and\u2014using consolidation and  aggregation\u2014relates an account or program activity to a strategic  objective, and consequently, to the objective\u2019s set of discrete  performance goals.

We reviewed fiscal year 1999 appropriations  hearings and reports for the agencies in our review that allocated program  activity funding to performance goals and observed that members of the  Congress often made specific reference to the performance information  contained in the agency\u2019s justification and/or performance plan.  Some  notable examples include the following.", "ACF officials were questioned as to whether a 4 percent increase in  children exiting foster care through reunification justified the  appropriation being sought for these activities.", "U.S. Customs Service officials were asked how the appropriations  committee should evaluate performance and resource requirements for  Customs\u2019 marine mission, given an apparent lack of measures for its  marine enforcement program.", "NRC officials were asked what performance measures would be used to  justify U.S. participation and funding in international nuclear safety  programs and how requested budget increases were related to NRC\u2019s  mission.", "Food and Nutrition Service officials presented data on the number of  meals being served in the school lunch and breakfast programs and  were asked how much additional budgetary resources would be needed  to serve all eligible children.", "The Conference Report on HUD\u2019s Fiscal Year 1999 Appropriations  directed the agency to revise its performance plan to incorporate  measurable goals and outcomes for providing housing vouchers and  certificates to assist families in transitioning from welfare to work.", "A House Subcommittee on Appropriations was unwilling to recommend  funding for a request for community-based technology centers in part  because specific performance measures for this new program were not  presented.", "The Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act of 1999  stated that the Office of National Drug Control Policy could not obligate  funds provided to continue its national media campaign until it  submitted the evaluation and results of the campaign."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Challenges Facing Future Performance Budgeting Efforts", "paragraphs": ["Deliberations on agencies\u2019 appropriations also indicate that making  effective linkages between budget program activities and performance  goals is one of many challenges that need to be addressed for performance  information to be used in the budget process.  Members of the Congress  also questioned agencies about why goals were not more results-oriented  and what steps were being taken to coordinate activities with other  agencies.  For example, Office of Personnel Management officials were  asked if the agency\u2019s performance plan could identify measures to help  determine the agency\u2019s progress toward a result of recruiting and retaining  the federal workforce required for the 21st century.  Members of the  Congress were also concerned about agencies\u2019 use of program evaluation  and other techniques to ensure the validity and reliability of performance  data.  ACF officials were asked about their approach for evaluating the  academic success of Head Start preschool participants after those students  leave the program.", "These concerns demonstrate that agencies also need to adopt a broader  agenda for improving performance plans that includes focusing on results,  defining clear strategies, and improving their capacity to gather and use  performance data. Translating the use of agency resources into concrete  and measurable results will be a continual challenge that will require both  time and effort on the part of the agency.  The uneven pace of progress  across government is not surprising; agencies are in the early years of  undertaking the changes that performance-based management entails.  Although some agencies, as indicated in our review, began to show the  performance consequences of budget decisions, improvements can be  made in the clarity and completeness of linkages between program  activities and performance goals.  Agencies must also balance the scope  and precision of funding estimates for performance goals with the  usefulness of such estimates for resource allocation decisions.  In addition,  we believe weaknesses in the performance measurement systems  described in agencies\u2019 fiscal year 1999 performance plans need to be  addressed.", "Linkages between plans and budgets must be supported by results-oriented  and credible performance data to be useful.  Our assessment of agencies\u2019  fiscal year 1999 performance plans found most goals were focused on  outputs, not outcomes.  This presents a dilemma for future performance  budgeting efforts.  While outcome information is clearly useful for  measuring performance, it may be more difficult to allocate funding to  outcomes that are far removed from the inputs that drive costs.  Allocating  funding to outcomes presumes that inputs, outputs, and outcomes can be  clearly defined and definitively linked.  For some agencies, these linkages  are unclear or unknown.  For example, agencies that work with state or  local governments to achieve performance may have difficulty specifying  how each of multiple agencies\u2019 funding contributes to an outcome.", "In addition to understanding how actions affect outcomes, allocating  funding to outcomes also requires an ability to understand how costs are  related to outcomes.  Agencies are noting the importance of cost  accounting and other management systems for success in allocating  funding to performance. For example, the Department of Housing and  Urban Development\u2019s (HUD) fiscal year 1999 performance plan  acknowledged that the agency \u201chas no mechanism for tracking resources  as they are applied to performance measures.\u201d  The plan noted that HUD  intends to develop a system that \u201cwill allow the Department to identify,  justify, and match resource requirements for effective and efficient  program administration and management.\u201d", "Agencies are expected to develop such systems as they implement  managerial cost accounting standards developed by the Federal  Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB).  These standards  require that agencies develop and implement cost accounting systems that  can be used to relate the full costs of various programs and activities to  performance outputs.  Although these standards were originally to become  effective for fiscal year 1997, the Chief Financial Officers (CFO)  Council\u2014an interagency council of the CFOs of major agencies\u2014 requested the effective date be delayed for 2 years due to shortfalls in cost  accounting systems.  As FASAB recommended, the effective date was  extended by 1 year, to fiscal year 1998, with a clear expectation that there  would be no further delays.  However, developing the necessary approach  to gather and analyze needed program and activity-level cost information  will be a substantial undertaking.  While there is a broad recognition of the  importance of doing so, for the most part agencies have just begun this  effort.", "As discussed earlier in this report, agencies\u2019 difficulties in developing  performance planning and measurement and cost accounting systems were  cited by OMB in its 1997 decision to delay the performance budgeting pilots  required by the Results Act.  To further discussion of those pilots, OMB  recently suggested possible formats and time frames for the pilots in a  September 1998 paper sent to federal agencies.  In that discussion paper,  OMB noted that pilot projects would not be designated unless they could  \u201cfairly test the  concept of performance budgeting,\u201d which it  described as \u201cthe application of multi-variate or optimization analysis to  budgeting.\u201d  The paper described three analytical alternatives that could be  tested involving performance tradeoffs (1) in the same program with  changes in program funding, (2) in the same program with no change in  total program funding, or (3) in several programs with shifts in intra-agency  funding between these programs.", "At present, OMB has no definitive plans for proceeding with the  performance budgeting pilots.  OMB solicited agencies\u2019 comments on the  discussion paper and on their capability to produce the alternative budgets  suggested in the committee report accompanying the Results Act.   According to OMB, no agency has as yet volunteered to participate in the  pilots.  In its discussion paper, OMB stated that \u201cthe absence of designated  pilots or having fewer designations than required would be an indication of  agency readiness to do performance budgeting, and would be discussed in  the OMB report to Congress.\u201d", "These developments reflect some of the broader tensions involved in  linking planning and budgeting structures. On one hand, performance plans  need to be broad and wide-ranging if they are to articulate the missions and  outcomes that agencies seek to influence. Often these plans will include  goals that the agency can only influence indirectly because of  responsibilities assigned to other actors, such as state and local  governments. On the other hand, budget structures have evolved to help  the Congress control and monitor agency activities and spending and, as  such, are geared more to fostering accountability for inputs and outputs  within the control of agencies.", "Performance budgeting poses the daunting task to agencies of discovering  ways to address these competing values that are mutually reinforcing, not  mutually exclusive.  Strategies for bringing planning and budgeting  structures together must balance both sets of values.  For example, some  agencies might let their planning structures be the starting point for making  connections and seek to crosswalk broad overarching goals to their many  program activities.  This approach is consistent with a results orientation  but can obscure the impact of specific funding decisions.  Other agencies  might decide to use the budget structure as their starting point and  integrate performance information into formats familiar and useful for  congressional oversight.  Although this approach may be helpful in  focusing on the performance consequences of budget decisions, such  strategies risk confining performance information to structures that may be  too limited to fully address the broad mission and outcomes of the agency."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The fiscal year 1999 annual performance plans\u2014the first called for under  the Results Act\u2014showed potential for providing valuable information that  can be used to better program performance.  However, the linkage between  requested funding and performance goals is just one of many elements that  need improvement for these plans to be useful for improving program  performance.  Top management within agencies must provide the  consistent leadership necessary to direct the needed management changes  and to ensure momentum is maintained.  Ultimately, performance-based  management should become an integral part of an agency\u2019s culture.  The  transition process must include proven \u201cchange management\u201d approaches  to be successful and sustained.   In addition, congressional use of results- oriented program performance and cost information in its decision-making  about federal policies and programs will also spur agencies\u2019 efforts to  implement the statutory framework by sending the unmistakable message  to the agencies that the Congress remains serious about performance- based management and accountability.", "As we have noted in a previous report, one of the Results Act\u2019s most  conspicuous and useful features is its reliance on experimentation.  This  is certainly true regarding performance budgeting.  The act calls for one  form of performance budgeting by requiring that performance goals from  an agency\u2019s annual performance plan cover the program activities of the  agency\u2019s budget request while giving agencies flexibility in how this linkage  is made.  This requirement, when coupled with OMB\u2019s guidance that plans  reflect the funding levels being applied to achieve performance goals,  constitutes the first governmentwide expectation to directly associate  budgetary resources with expected results.  In addition, the act also  requires pilot projects to test a specific form of performance budgeting that  presents varying levels of funding for varying levels of performance.  The  committee report accompanying the act noted that \u201cthis pilot approach is  best because, while performance budgeting promises to link program  performance information with specific budget requests, it is unclear how  best to present that information and what the results will be.\u201d", "The fiscal year 1999 performance planning and budgeting cycle produced a  useful experimentation in connecting planning and budgeting structures  that accommodated unique federal missions and structures.  Some, but not  all of the agencies we reviewed, began to develop useful linkages.   Moreover, challenges in performance planning and measurement and  deficiencies in cost accounting systems continue to confront federal  agencies.  OMB has already cited these problems as the reasons why  performance budgeting pilot projects were not being initiated. The  progress that has been made and the challenges that persist underscore the  importance of developing a specific agenda to ensure continued progress in  better showing the performance consequences of budgetary decisions.", "The original goal for the act\u2019s performance budgeting pilot projects was  twofold: to allow OMB and agencies to develop experience and capabilities  towards realizing the potential of performance budgeting, and to provide  OMB with a basis for reporting to the Congress on next steps and needed  changes.  Although OMB stated in 1997 that agencies\u2019 financial  management systems were not capable of the specific form of performance  budgeting called for in the act, our review demonstrates that some agencies  were able to develop approaches to make perhaps a more basic, but still  useful, connection between proposed spending and performance.  These  fiscal year 1999 efforts to link performance goals and program activity  funding essentially constitute a first step toward achieving the intent of the  performance budgeting pilots.  They also provide a baseline from which  OMB could assess future progress and determine what changes, if any, may  be needed to the act and federal budget processes.", "In addition to its longstanding responsibilities regarding the formulation,  review, and presentation of the President\u2019s annual budget requests, OMB is  the lead agency for overseeing a framework of recently enacted financial,  information resources, and performance planning and measurement  reforms designed to improve the effectiveness and responsiveness of  federal agencies.
