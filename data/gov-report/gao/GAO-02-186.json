Under the Clean Water Act and its regulations, EPA has given the states some flexibility to develop listing approaches that are tailored to their circumstances. However, some of the approaches have no appropriate scientific basis. States apply a range of quality assurance procedures to ensure the quality of data used to make impairment decisions. Although states have long used quality assurance procedures for the data they collect directly, they have become increasingly vigilant about applying such procedures to data from other sources. Because of inconsistencies in states' approaches to identifying impaired waters, the information in EPA's database of impaired waters is of questionable reliability. The number of impaired waters cannot be compared from one state to the next, and EPA cannot reliably tally the number of TMDLs that must be completed nationwide.

Among the primary concerns associated with these waters are human health problems, caused either directly by coming into contact with contaminated waters or indirectly through consumption of contaminated fish. Under the Clean Water Act, states must identify bodies of water that are not meeting applicable state water quality standards and submit a list of those waters to the EPA, along with an explanation of the methodology used to identify them. To bring these waters into compliance with the standards, states are required to establish a pollutant \u201cbudget\u201d\u2014or a total maximum daily load (TMDL)\u2014for each pollutant causing a body of water to be impaired. A TMDL is the maximum amount of a pollutant that can enter into a body of water without exceeding the water quality standard for a pollutant.", "In March 2000, we reported that states have little of the information they need to assess the quality of their waters and, in particular, to identify those that are impaired\u2014a particularly serious problem, given the resources needed to address such impairments. Concerned about possible inconsistencies in the way that states identify impaired waters and EPA conveys information about such waters to the public, you asked us to (1) identify and assess the effects of any differences in states\u2019 approaches to identifying impaired waters, (2) determine how states ensure the quality of data used to identify impaired waters, and (3) assess the reliability of the information in EPA\u2019s database of impaired waters. To respond to your questions, we analyzed written methodologies that all 50 states and the  District of Columbia submitted to EPA with their lists of impaired waters.  We also completed a telephone survey of water quality officials from 15  randomly selected states to obtain more detailed information about states\u2019  processes for identifying impaired waters, identify the methods they use to  ensure the quality of data collected, and determine how accurately they  believe their state\u2019s water quality is reflected in information that EPA  provides to the public on the Internet. We also analyzed the EPA database  containing states\u2019 data on impaired waters and TMDLs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The primary objective of the Clean Water Act is to \u201crestore and maintain  the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation\u2019s waters.\u201d As  authorized under the act, states have primary responsibility for  implementing programs to manage water quality. As a first step, states set  water quality standards to achieve designated (or beneficial) uses for  waters, such as recreational, agricultural, industrial, or other uses. These  standards are then used to determine whether the states\u2019 waters are  impaired, among other things.", "In addition to establishing water quality standards, states are also  responsible for monitoring the quality of their waters, assessing all readily  available water quality data to determine whether the criteria for  particular waters are being met, and reporting on the quality of their  waters to EPA. Generally, to monitor water quality, states select the rivers,  lakes, and other waters for which they plan to collect data during a  specific period of time and collect water samples from them. After the  data are collected, the states analyze the data and compare the results to  their standards to assess whether the water bodies are meeting standards.  In assessing their waters, state agencies responsible for water quality  programs can also use data collected by other state agencies, federal  agencies, volunteer or academic groups, and other entities. For example,  one source used by many states is the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)  within the Department of the Interior, which has a large program for  monitoring water quality. Under section 305(b) of the act, states are  responsible for reporting biennially on the quality of their waters, and EPA  is responsible for compiling these reports into the National Water Quality  Inventory. As part of this effort, EPA provides guidance to states on  monitoring and assessing their waters.", "In addition to reporting on the overall quality of their waters, the Clean  Water Act requires states to identify waters that do not meet applicable  water quality standards. Specifically, section 303(d) of the act requires  states to list the waters within their state boundaries for which certain  technological controls required under the act are not stringent enough to  implement applicable standards. Under the act, EPA must approve the  states\u2019 lists. The 303(d) lists identify waters in which pollutants need to be  reduced. States are required to develop a TMDL for each of the pollutants  affecting each impaired body of water. Under the act, if states do not  establish TMDLs for impaired waters, EPA must do so.", "While the states are primarily responsible for managing water quality, EPA  is responsible for developing regulations and guidance implementing the  act. In 1985, EPA issued water quality regulations requiring states to  provide a list of impaired waters. In 2000, EPA finalized major revisions to  these regulations that would have required the states to develop more  comprehensive lists of impaired waters and would have clarified the  required elements of a TMDL. However, Congress postponed  implementation of these revisions, in part because of widespread concerns  among a variety of groups. Because the regulations were in flux during  2000, EPA waived the requirement for states to submit their lists that year;  instead, states are required to submit their next list by October 1, 2002. In  October 2001, EPA further postponed the effective date of the revised  regulations to April 30, 2003. Prior to that time, EPA plans to develop a  second set of revised regulations.", "Concern over the impaired waters program has led to years of litigation  among states, EPA, and interest groups. Lawsuits in 38 states have  resulted in almost two dozen consent decrees requiring states to develop  TMDLs or requiring EPA to develop them if states fail to do so. At  congressional hearings in 2000, we and other organizations raised  concerns over the ability of states to gather the data needed to monitor  their waters, and in particular to support the identification of impaired  waters needing TMDLs. As a result of these concerns, Congress requested  the National Academy of Sciences\u2019 National Research Council to study the  scientific basis for the TMDL program. The council issued a report in June  2001 that expressed support for the TMDL program but called for  improvements in how impaired waters are identified and how TMDLs are  developed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States Use Varying Approaches to Identify Impaired Waters", "paragraphs": ["While the general process that states follow to identify impaired waters is  similar, the specific approaches they use vary considerably among states.  Generally, the process involves establishing water quality standards,  gathering data on water quality through monitoring, and assessing the data  to determine whether the criteria and standards are being met or whether  a body of water is impaired (see fig. 1). If a state determines that a  previously listed body of water is no longer impaired, then it can seek  EPA\u2019s approval to remove that body of water from its list. Variation in the  approaches that states use occurs at each step in the process and causes  inconsistencies in the listing of impaired waters. These inconsistencies are  particularly apparent in cases of interstate waters. EPA published one set  of guidance in November 2001 that it believes will address some of these  inconsistencies. It plans to issue a second set in early 2002 to address  other causes. However, EPA officials stated that the underlying causes of  inconsistent listings require long-term action."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Water Quality Standards Are Often Inconsistent", "paragraphs": ["Water quality standards can vary significantly among states. Variations in  water quality standards arise from differences among states in two  components of the standard-setting process: (1) the identification of  designated (or beneficial) uses for a particular body of water and (2) the  development of water quality criteria to protect each use. According to  EPA, some of these variations are appropriately based on different  ecological conditions but others are not. For example, states with coastal  plains could appropriately have lower standards for dissolved oxygen than  states with high mountain streams. The agency also notes that other  variations are often not appropriate. Inappropriate variations may arise if  states with shared or immediately adjacent water bodies designate them  for different uses. For example, one may consider the water suitable for  swimming and therefore have more stringent water quality criteria, while a  neighboring state may consider the same water to be used for wading,  which requires less stringent criteria."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Designated Uses", "paragraphs": ["Designated uses are the beneficial uses established by states, based on  social and environmental factors that waters are intended to support. For  example, a water may be designated for use as a public water supply or to  support aquatic life, irrigation, or contact recreation. Officials in some  states said that the designated uses in their states are appropriate while  others did not. Of the 15 state officials that we interviewed, 8  acknowledged that designated uses in their states need to be revised. For  example, all waters in Virginia are designated for swimming even though  some of the waters are inaccessible and too shallow for swimming  purposes. Other waters in Virginia are impaired by bacteria from wildlife  sources and cannot achieve the primary contact use. As a result, these  waters do not meet the water quality standard set for them. In other states,  in some cases where designated uses are inappropriate and need revision,  waters may be considered impaired by natural water quality conditions.  Yet, one state may list such waters as impaired, while another might not.  For example, according to their 1998 303(d) listing methodologies, Arizona  precludes the listing of waters impaired by naturally-occurring conditions  while California includes such waters on its list.", "One explanation for the problems with many designated uses is that states  established many of them en masse in the early 1970s in order to meet the  requirements of the Clean Water Act. States had 180 days to put  designated uses in place, and many used the highly general goals of the  Clean Water Act\u2014fishable-swimmable waters\u2014as their designated uses.  In addition, implementation of the act initially focused on installing  controls on individual point sources of pollution and little attention was  paid to whether overall water quality met specific standards.", "Reflecting these concerns, the National Research Council\u2019s recent report  states that many designated uses are too broad and need to be refined in  order to incorporate the range of scientific data and social needs for water  quality. The Council\u2019s report recommended that states\u2019 designated uses  should be divided into several tiers to more adequately represent water  quality conditions and that water quality criteria should have a more  logical link to the designated use to sufficiently measure attainment.  According to responses from our 15-state survey, such a refinement in  states\u2019 designated uses and water quality criteria would most likely result  in different waters being listed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Water Quality Criteria", "paragraphs": ["Water quality criteria provide thresholds for determining whether bodies  of water can support their designated uses. As with designated uses,  criteria used by states vary and in many states need updating. Variation  among states is primarily caused by different states focusing on different  pollutants, mainly because of differences in water quality criteria. Illinois,  for example, has numeric water quality criteria for two pollutants\u2014  sediment and nutrients\u2014for which neighboring Indiana does not have  numeric criteria. As a result, Illinois listed 32 percent of its waters as  impaired by sediment, while Indiana listed none. Similarly, Illinois listed 22  percent of its waters as impaired by nutrients, but Indiana listed less than  1 percent as so impaired. In some instances, neighboring states may both  have numeric criteria for a given pollutant, but the criteria may differ  significantly. Connecticut and New York on the Long Island Sound have  different criteria for dissolved oxygen and, therefore, list the Sound  differently.", "States also vary in the extent to which they use narrative criteria versus  numeric criteria to make a listing determination. For example, Nevada  focuses its listing determinations on violations of numeric water quality  criteria. On the other hand, Massachusetts used narrative criteria to list  approximately one-third of its reported impairments because it felt that  the designated use was impaired. With the criteria, Massachusetts  considered a lake to be impaired (for swimming) if noxious aquatic plants  covered over 50 percent of its area. Massachusetts\u2019 officials conceded that  their narrative criteria may not correctly identify when a lake is impaired  for various uses, and they are currently working on revising the water  quality standards.", "Other states also discussed the need to revise criteria that are difficult to  use in identifying impairments. Officials in 14 of the 15 states represented  in our interviews believe that water quality criteria in their states need to  be revised. Their views are consistent with the National Research Council,  which noted in its report that criteria should be measured by reasonably  obtainable monitoring data and should be defined in terms of magnitude,  frequency, and duration. Some state officials mentioned that they would  like to switch their narrative criteria to numeric criteria to provide a  clearer threshold for demonstrating whether an impairment exists.  Officials indicating their water quality criteria need to be revised told us  that such revisions could change the waters states have listed and the  number of waters listed. The most common pollutants for which the state  officials we interviewed believe water quality criteria need to be revised  are nutrients, bacteria, sediment, dissolved oxygen, and metals. These five  pollutants have been found to be among the leading causes of impairment  nationwide."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Monitoring Practices Differ Significantly", "paragraphs": ["States use a variety of monitoring practices.

They also  determine how often to take samples. In addition to their own data, states  can use data from other sources such as universities, other federal and  state agencies, and volunteer groups.

USGS officials recommend that states utilize all three types of  monitoring to help ensure that water quality conditions are adequately  characterized. The officials suggested that although biological indicators  may be used to identify the condition of the waters, physical and chemical  factors such as improving habitat or reducing discharges will be adjusted  to achieve biological goals. Similarly, the National Research Council  reported that biological indicators integrate the effects of multiple  stressors over time and space and recommended that they be used in  conjunction with physical and chemical criteria.", "States vary in their emphasis on these different types of monitoring. For  example, Illinois, Maine, and Ohio rely primarily on biological monitoring  while Texas and Utah rely on chemical and physical monitoring. A 1998  Ohio study suggests how these divergent monitoring approaches may yield  different impairment determinations for waters.This study found that of  645 waters monitored, 50 percent met chemical but not biological criteria.  It also showed that the number of impaired waters in the state increased  from 9 percent of assessed waters in 1986 to 44 percent in 1988, and that  the increase was due primarily to the increased use of biological  monitoring to support numeric biologic criteria. Water quality managers in  Utah stated that they hope to increase biological and habitat monitoring  depending on available funding and it is probable that more impaired  waters would be identified and listed as a result.", "In addition to differences in the types of monitoring that states perform,  states also differ in the emphasis that they place on various pollutants in  their monitoring programs. For example, according to Indiana officials,  Indiana conducts more bacteriological monitoring than bordering states,  and has consequently identified 13 percent of its impaired waters as  impaired by bacteriological pathogens. In comparison, neighboring Illinois  and Ohio, which conduct less bacteriological monitoring, have identified  only 1 and 2 percent, respectively, of their impaired waters as impaired by  such pathogens."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comprehensiveness of Monitoring Programs", "paragraphs": ["States also vary in the comprehensiveness of their monitoring programs.  In 1998, the percentage of rivers and streams monitored and assessed by  states ranged from 0 to 100 percent; 39 states had monitored and assessed  under 50 percent of their rivers and streams. Similarly, the percentage of  lakes, reservoirs, and ponds monitored and assessed by states ranged from  0 to 100 percent; 18 states monitored and assessed less than 50 percent of  these waters (see figs. 3 and 4). Finally, several states that have estuaries  and ocean shorelines monitored and assessed 100 percent of these waters;  however, other states have not monitored and assessed these waters (see  app. I for a detailed list of the percentages by state).

However, only 15  states had waters that were listed as impaired because of a fish  consumption advisory, based on their 1998 303(d) list. Most of the other  states either chose not to list their waters as impaired or counted a fish  advisory as a single impairment for the entire state rather than counting  each of the state\u2019s affected waters. For example, Wisconsin issued 447 fish  consumption advisories for individual waters in 1998 and listed 307 waters  as impaired for a fish consumption advisory in their 1998 303(d) list. On  the other hand, Minnesota issued 825 fish consumption advisories for  individual waters in 1998 but listed no waters as impaired for a fish  consumption advisory in their 1998 303(d) list.

States vary  both in the percentage of samples exceeding water quality standards that  are needed to consider a body of water as impaired, and in the number of  samples that need to be taken to consider the sampling data as  representative of actual conditions. For example, as recommended by  EPA, most states list waters as impaired by conventional pollutants if 10  percent of the samples taken exceed water quality standards. However,  some states, such as Kansas and Nevada, list waters as impaired only if the  water quality standard is exceeded in more than 25 percent of collected  samples. In addition, some states require a minimum data set of 10  samples, while other states, such as Nevada and Arizona, require only 4  samples.

In some cases, waters were listed  initially on the basis of little or no data. For example, officials from one  state told us that about half the waters on its 303(d) list were listed on the  basis of evaluated data. Upon additional monitoring of these waters, the  state found that many meet standards and should therefore be removed  from the 303(d) list.", "EPA regulations require states to demonstrate \u201cgood cause\u201d before an  impaired water can be removed from a 303(d) list.

Nonetheless, based on our analysis of the 50  states\u2019 methodologies, states vary in their methods and justifications for  delisting waters. These findings were corroborated by our interviews with  officials in the 15 states we contacted, which demonstrated a widely  diverse experience in the delisting process. For example, officials in 11 of  the 15 states represented in our interviews cited a variety of reasons for  delisting waters, including their belief that some waters were incorrectly  listed in the first place; that the quality of some waters had improved; or  that a TMDL was established for the water, eliminating the need to keep it  on the 303(d) list.", "We found that EPA regions play a key role in advising states on delisting  matters.

State  officials in another region, however, said that regardless of how a body of  water was originally listed, they could remove it only if they had new data  showing that the body of water was now meeting water quality standards.

A quality  management plan is a management tool that documents an organization\u2019s  system for planning, implementing, documenting, and assessing its  environmental data collection and assessment methods. Within the overall  plan, an organization develops project-specific quality assurance project  plans that serve as a \u201cblueprint\u201d for data collection, handling, analysis, and  management on that particular project.

Standard operating procedures involve specific  activities to manage a data collection project, collect and handle water  samples, analyze the samples, and manage the resulting database. These  procedures demonstrate that the data created and used by the states are  scientifically valid, legally defensible, and credible. For example, one  procedure to assure the integrity of the data is to have a \u201cchain of custody\u201d  for water samples, if a chemical analysis is to be undertaken. This chain of  custody is evidence that the water samples could not be tampered with or  tainted. Another example of a procedure to assure the quality of a water  sample is the calibration of testing instruments.", "The use of standard sampling procedures, in particular, is important to  provide accurate data for impairment decisions. For example, because its  previous methods were determined to be inadequate, USGS developed  stringent procedures to sample for trace metals and EPA has  recommended that these procedures be used by states. However,  according to USGS and EPA officials, states have the flexibility to select  their sampling and data analysis procedures and not all states use the  more stringent methods. According to the officials, the stringent methods  are more intensive and expensive and could place a burden on state  monitoring programs. According to USGS officials, the purpose of its  stringent procedures is to discover the specific amounts of trace metals in  a water body to depict current conditions and allow for delineation of  trends in water quality. On the other hand, states may only need to know if  their standards or criteria are met, and those criteria levels may be much  higher than the actual concentrations measured by USGS methods. The  officials also said that states can use alternative procedures if they collect  quality control data for their water samples. Such quality control data  include a variety of \u201cblank\u201d tests, which are samples that can be used to  identify whether any contaminants are coming from the sampling  equipment, such as the containers, filters, and fixatives used to collect  samples.", "According to an EPA monitoring official, the most important and  challenging quality assurance issue that states face is the sufficiency of  their monitoring networks and the amount of data available to make  impairment decisions. For each water body sampled, states need to have a  sufficient number of samples to support an impairment decision. However,  because of the large number of waters that states need to monitor and the  fact that the waters need to be sampled several times, the states are often  constrained in the number of samples they can take for each one.", "According to USGS officials, sampling is sometimes complicated by the  need to take samples at different times. Depending on the pollutant, water  samples need to be taken at various times of the day to reflect different  physical conditions in a water body.

In addition, the regulations establish the number of  exceedances that are needed to declare a water impaired. For example,  the regulations require that at least 5 samples should exceed the water  quality standard for a water with 20 samples overall.

However,  increasing standards of data quality may result in the rejection of some  data, with the risk that some impaired waters might not be identified.

Furthermore, EPA and some state officials indicated that data  from external sources can extend the state\u2019s monitoring resources.  Accordingly, they have sought to establish guidance and training for  volunteer monitoring programs.

Specifically, EPA has used the data on impaired waters submitted by the  states to create a large database of information, called the TMDL Tracking  System, which is one of the databases used by the Watershed Assessment,  Tracking, and Environmental Results (WATERS) system. Both the TMDL  database and WATERS are used to convey information on EPA\u2019s Web site.  The TMDL database includes data related to states\u2019 listings, the causes of  impairment, court decisions related to the lists, TMDL schedules, and  other information necessary to understand the status of states\u2019 listings and  TMDL programs. The database can be used to generate summary reports  on the impaired waters of a state. The TMDL database is linked to  WATERS, which enables the data to be displayed on maps. WATERS  unites water quality information previously available only on individual  state agency homepages and in several EPA databases that support EPA\u2019s  Web site. In the future, EPA plans to include additional information, such  as no discharge zones and monitoring stations.", "With any such system, the information presented can be only as good as  the data entered into the supporting database. Accordingly,  inconsistencies in the data submitted by states, as well as inaccurate data  in some cases, raise questions about the reliability of the TMDL database  and of WATERS. Of greatest consequence, the variation in states\u2019  standards, monitoring, assessment, and listing practices, as discussed  previously, results in inconsistencies in EPA\u2019s database. For example, the  wide variation in states\u2019 monitoring programs means that states have  widely different bases upon which to make impairment decisions,  resulting in varying numbers of impaired waters among states. Such  inconsistencies help to explain why the numbers of waters identified as  impaired by states range from as low as 37 for one state but exceed 1,000  for several others. These inconsistencies also make it difficult to aggregate  data from individual states into a national picture or to compare the  quality of waters from one state to the next.", "Variations in how states report critical data to EPA for incorporation into  the TMDL database also undermine its reliability. Because states identify  the size of impaired waters differently, EPA\u2019s tally of both the total  number of impaired waters nationwide and the number of TMDLs that  must be established is not reliable. More specifically, some states submit  lists that count several small segments of a river or stream as individually  impaired waters, while others submit lists that count larger segments of a  river or stream as impaired. Illinois, for example, breaks the Mississippi  River into many segments, while Missouri breaks the Mississippi River into  three segments. As another example, Indiana\u2019s impaired water segments  for one river were reported separately by EPA for each impairment, while  Illinois\u2019 impaired water segments for the same river were listed once, with  all impairments noted under the single listing. As a result, according to an  Indiana water official, the state may therefore appear to have more  impaired water segments than it actually does. This variation may be  alleviated by EPA\u2019s Integrated Listing guidance. As recommended by the  National Research Council, the guidance encourages states to use one  georeferencing system, called the National Hydrography Dataset, to define  the waters within their borders.", "Because states currently use a number of different ways to define their  waters, when EPA transfers their data into the WATERS system, errors  may result in the presentation of the information on the Web site.

A Connecticut water quality official  explained that the state\u2019s water quality is inaccurately reflected on EPA\u2019s  Web site as a result of a scaling problem. The official explained that while  there are waters in Connecticut that are impaired for very localized areas,  the EPA Web site depicts that impairment over a much larger area, thereby  overestimating the problem area and giving the public the sense that the  problem is bigger than it truly is. Similarly, Massachusetts uses smaller- scale watersheds to identify impaired waters, and EPA uses larger-scale  watershed data. This results in the waters in Massachusetts being listed at  the aggregate level, thus inappropriately documenting the geographical  extent of the problem. This oftentimes results in giving the sense of a  larger problem than the one conveyed by the state and will mask multiple  problems within a smaller geographical area. EPA officials said that the  agency attempts to present states\u2019 data as submitted to avoid  misrepresenting the information, and that the agency provides states with  the opportunity to review and revise the database information.

States have also developed inconsistent methods and  justifications for removing waters from their lists, based in part, on  inconsistent interpretations of EPA guidance by EPA regions. Moreover,  current EPA policy has allowed wide disparities in how states describe  their methodologies for identifying and listing impaired waters.", "The inconsistency in state approaches is most apparent in bodies of water  that are shared by neighboring states but which are often listed differently  by them. Such inconsistencies can engender doubt about the accuracy of  the listings and states\u2019 abilities to correctly identify impaired waters. If  states cannot correctly identify impaired waters, they cannot efficiently  channel efforts or resources to develop TMDLs for improving water  quality.
