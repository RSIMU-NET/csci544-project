Each cross-functional team pilot consisted of core staff and subject matter  experts from across the Army. To facilitate the rapid approval of  requirements, each cross-functional team pilot was led by a general  officer or a senior civilian official who could communicate directly with the  highest levels of the Army. The goal of staffing these teams was to  ensure that each team had individuals who specialized in acquisition,  requirements, science and technology, test and evaluation, resourcing,  contracting, cost analysis, sustainment, and military operations. The goal  of bringing different experts together was to facilitate collaboration and  immediate opportunities for stakeholders to provide input as opposed to  the more traditional requirements development process, in which input  has typically been provided separately. Officials told us that, while all of  these subject matter experts may have provided input on the  requirements development process in the past, placing them on a single  team offered the promise of streamlining those efforts and could eliminate  the need for multiple reviews.

To do so, the Army has balanced its  modernization efforts by funding the closure of near-term capability gaps,  and identifying long-term needs to be funded. Since announcing the  modernization efforts in 2017, the Army has directed more funding toward  closing near-term capability gaps. For example, as part of the planning for  the fiscal year 2019 budget process, the Army identified 67 high-priority  programs, such as the M-1 Abrams tank and the AH-64 Apache  helicopter, with capability gaps in need of further investment. To support  these priorities, the Army identified a need for $16 billion in increased  funding in fiscal years 2019 through 2023. The 2018 Army Modernization  Strategy report identified the need for additional resources for near-term  efforts, including plans to spend billions of dollars for acquisition of  maneuverable short range air defense capabilities in fiscal years 2020  through 2024. The same report described plans to spend hundreds of  millions of dollars over the same period for prototyping technologies for  the Next-Generation Combat Vehicle, a longer-term capability.", "The Army has also begun to plan research and development efforts for its  long-term modernization needs. The Army identified long-term capabilities  for all of the modernization priorities, as well as dates that science and  technology efforts should transition to programs of record. Army officials  stated that, ultimately, multiple programs of record may be considered for  each capability area. For example, the Army identified science and  technology efforts to develop an advanced powertrain for the Next  Generation Combat Vehicle and identified planned transition dates to the  program in fiscal years 2020 and 2023.

Figure 4 below presents a timeline  for some of the proposed capabilities within each of the six priorities.", "The Army has realigned some resources to support its long-term  modernization priorities. In identifying long-term capabilities, we found  that the Army has evaluated its science and technology portfolio to  determine alignment with the six modernization priorities. For example, as  part of an October 2017 review for the office of the Deputy Under  Secretary of the Army, the eight cross-functional team pilots examined  science and technology investments to identify which efforts contributed  to the priorities and which efforts did not contribute to them. According to  this review and Army officials, the Army realigned over $1 billion in  funding toward the priorities for fiscal years 2019 through 2023, for a total  of $7.5 billion directed at these priorities.

By promoting communication  between industry representatives and warfighters, the cross-functional  teams helped ensure that developer resources better matched end- user needs.", "Planned to prototype capabilities as part of technology and  product development. The Army directive establishing the cross- functional team pilots states that cross-functional teams should  incorporate iterative experimentation and technical demonstrations to  inform capability requirements.

Specifically, we found  that the Army\u2019s October 2017 science and technology review identified a  goal of demonstrating new technologies in a relevant environment, such  as a highly realistic laboratory setting, before transitioning them to specific  platforms or programs. As an example, the Soldier Lethality cross- functional team began maturing technology for the next generation squad  automatic rifle to this level of maturity to prepare it for the transition to  product development, scheduled for the end of fiscal year 2019. Under  leading practices that we identified, prototypes should be demonstrated in  an operational or realistic environment\u2014not simply in a relevant  environment\u2014prior to starting system development to ensure that they  work as intended for the end-user.", "The Army\u2019s choice to start a formal acquisition program at lower levels of  technology maturity raises concerns that are consistent with those we  have raised in the past. Our past work indicates that by demonstrating  technologies only in a relevant rather than an operational environment,  the Army increases the risk that new capabilities will not perform as  intended and require further technological maturation while in system  development. This could raise costs and extend timelines for delivery of  equipment to the warfighter. For example, almost two decades ago in a  1999 report, we recommended demonstrating technologies in an  operational environment prior to system development and DOD  concurred with that recommendation. We have also reported the  importance of achieving this level of maturity on an annual basis since  2003, most recently in 2018, in our assessment of DOD\u2019s major weapon  system acquisition programs. In addition, we again reiterated this leading  practice in 2016 in our technology readiness assessment guide.", "While DOD has a policy, based in statute, that generally requires major  defense acquisition programs to, at a minimum, demonstrate  technologies in a relevant environment before system development, that  policy does not preclude the cross-functional teams from pursuing a  higher level of maturity. Such an approach would be consistent with  leading practices that recommend maturing technologies to a higher  level.

We found that each cross-functional team  pilot charter clearly defined its team\u2019s goals. For example, the Long- Range Precision Fires cross-functional team charter states that it will  rapidly integrate and synchronize the requirements development  process to deliver cutting edge capabilities to the operating force as  the best possible return on investment for warfighters. In addition,  senior Army leadership approved the charters containing each team\u2019s  goals, ensuring that the goals defined for the teams were linked to the  Army\u2019s larger goal of modernization.", "Open and regular communication. Members of all eight cross- functional team pilots shared information with each other, sought  feedback, and communicated with team leaders and senior Army  leadership. For example, officials from the Next Generation Combat  Vehicle cross-functional team told us that ongoing dialogue with  senior Army leadership resulted in numerous rounds of refined  guidance. The cross-functional team took that guidance, reconvened,  assessed options, and then presented another round of updates to  Army senior leadership. Moreover, the directive establishing the  cross-functional team pilots requires that they develop capability  documents, informed by experimentation and technical  demonstrations, to ensure that planned capabilities are  technologically feasible, affordable, and therefore can eventually be  provided to soldiers. According to Army officials, developing such  documents requires open and regular communication between team  members who have expertise in diverse fields such as contracting,  cost analysis, and testing.", "Autonomy. The eight cross-functional team pilots\u2019 charters show, and  interviews with members confirm, that teams are granted substantial  autonomy by senior Army leadership. The cross-functional team  charters give teams the authority to solve internal problems through  market research, prototyping, technical demonstrations, and user  assessments. For example, the Synthetic Training Environment cross- functional team and senior Army leadership stressed to us the  importance of experimentation as an opportunity to \u201cfail early and fail  cheap.\u201d According to cross-functional team members, this allows  cross-functional teams to move on and avoid expensive and time- consuming failures later in the acquisition process, as has happened  with Army in the past. Furthermore, cross-functional teams can reach  out to subject matter experts needed to develop requirements without  having to obtain permission from senior Army leadership.", "Committed team members. All eight cross-functional team pilots  include members with expertise in diverse fields who are committed to  achieving team goals. For example, the Network cross-functional  team charter states that the team should consist of experienced and  committed subject matter experts executing disciplined initiatives and  willing to take prudent risks. In addition, the directive establishing the  cross-functional teams states that they should leverage industry and  academia where appropriate to increase knowledge and expertise.  Staffing information provided by multiple cross-functional teams  demonstrates the diversity of expertise the Army has applied to these  efforts. Cross-functional team members also provided us with multiple  examples of how their teams have leveraged outreach with industry  and academia to improve their understanding of requirements and  technology.", "Additionally, we found that the eight cross-functional team pilots have at  least partially applied the following four leading practices.", "Senior management support. Senior Army leaders, including the  Secretary and the Chief of Staff, have championed the cross- functional team pilots in public statements. Although an Army official  told us that he was aware of a member of a cross-functional team  (who left the team) receiving a civilian achievement award, we did not  find any documentary evidence of senior Army leaders providing  incentives or recognition to members of the eight cross-functional  team pilots. Because many members of cross-functional teams,  including some leaders of these teams, work in a number of different  roles, they do not have a consistent chain of command that can  provide incentives or recognition across all of their activities. The  \u201cdual-hatted\u201d nature of team members\u2014in which they work for their  parent organization as well as the cross-functional team pilot\u2014may  further complicate full application of this leading practice.", "Empowered team leaders. The team leaders of all eight cross- functional team pilots are empowered to make decisions and regularly  interact with senior Army leaders. While an Army official stated that  team leaders and Army leadership provide guidance to cross- functional team members, we did not find any documentary evidence  of these leaders providing feedback to members of those teams.  However, many members of the cross-functional teams, including  directors, are only temporarily assigned to cross-functional team pilots  because they work in other functions simultaneously.", "Well-defined team structure. While most cross-functional team pilots  have established operating procedures and organizational structures,  we found that some have not provided training to their members on  the operations of cross-functional teams and how they relate to other  organizations. Our previous work identified appropriate training as a  key characteristic of a well-defined team structure. Most cross- functional team charters do not address the issue of training. Through  our discussions with the cross-functional teams, we found the  following with respect to training:", "An official from the Soldier Lethality cross-functional team told us  that team members received training and planned to attend further  training to enhance creative and \u201coutside-the-box\u201d thinking.", "The director of the Network cross-functional team told us that,  even though he did not receive training, he was able to leverage  his previous experience leading matrixed organizations.", "The Long-Range Precision Fires cross-functional team told us that  members started their work without any training and this posed a  challenge as they were unfamiliar with each other\u2019s roles and  work.", "Inclusive team environment. The founding documents for the cross- functional team pilots themselves generally did not address attributes  of this leading practice, such as having team members that support  and trust one another. However, discussions with team members  indicate some teams have invested in creating such an environment.  The Soldier Lethality cross-functional team members stated that  working in a cross-functional team as opposed to working as separate  individuals in disparate offices, allowed them write requirements  faster. It also created an atmosphere in which members got to know  each other\u2019s experiences and trust each other\u2019s views. Officials from  the Synthetic Training Environment cross-functional team told us they  spent their first week gaining an understanding of each team  member\u2019s role on the team to foster such inclusivity.", "As previously described, the cross-functional team pilots were an effort to  achieve several goals including to identify ways the Army could increase  efficiency in requirements and technology development. According to  Army officials, the teams have shown initial progress in doing so,  delivering requirements\u2014and in some cases developing capabilities for  delivery in the next two years\u2014to the warfighter in shorter than  anticipated timeframes. However, the Army has not yet definitively  established the cross-functional teams\u2019 roles, responsibilities, and how  they will operate within Army Futures Command. As a result, it is unclear  if the Army will benefit from the experience and expertise of these teams  applying leading practices as they transition into Army Futures Command.", "Until the Army takes formal steps to institutionalize the beneficial  practices used by the cross-functional teams during the pilot phase such  as autonomy, proactive decision making, and access to senior leadership  it will be missing a valuable opportunity to integrate these practices into  the new command."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Army Futures Command Does Not Have a Formal Plan to Identify and Share Lessons Learned from Cross-Functional Team Pilots", "paragraphs": ["The Army directive that established the cross-functional teams directed  each team pilot to capture best practices and lessons learned and report  them to the Army office that oversaw their efforts. Officials from the  cross-functional teams described to us lessons they learned and planned  to pass on to their oversight office for the benefit of Army Futures  Command. For example, officials from the Air and Missile Defense cross- functional team stated that having direct access to the Under Secretary  and the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army is important for obtaining quick  decisions, which save time and money in getting capabilities to the  warfighter.", "While officials from Army Futures Command told us that they intend to  collect lessons learned from the cross-functional team pilots, they do not  yet have a formal plan to identify and incorporate lessons learned. Since  the cross-functional team pilots were established to experiment with new  approaches, it is important that they take steps to capture the lessons  they have learned\u2014positive and negative\u2014so they can be shared as  these teams are integrated into Army Futures Command. If the Army fails  to institutionalize these lessons learned in the new command, it risks  losing the benefits from the experiences of these pilots thereby either  repeating past mistakes or failing to benefit from past practices that  worked well. If it can capture the lessons learned, it has an opportunity to  accelerate the progress these teams made during their pilot phase and  spread the benefits across all the cross-functional teams and across a  wider range of specific military capabilities they are pursuing. In our  discussions with Army Futures Command officials they agreed that  formalizing and implementing a plan to collect and incorporate lessons  learned would be beneficial."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Incorporating Leading Practices for Organizational Transformations Could Benefit Army Futures Command", "paragraphs": ["Army officials told us that the establishment of Army Futures Command  represents a dramatic organizational transformation in how the Army will  develop weapon systems and platforms. In our previous work on mergers  and organizational transformations in federal agencies, we have identified  several leading practices, as shown in table 4 below, that can help  agencies undertaking such transformational efforts.", "As the Army is standing up Army Futures Command, it has begun to  apply some of the leading practices for mergers and organizational  transformations. For example, senior Army officials have provided a clear  and consistent rationale for establishing the new command in official  directives and in public appearances. They have also clearly described  the mission of the Army Futures Command and established a timeline for  its implementation. However, the command has not yet formalized and  institutionalized its authorities, responsibilities, policies and procedures  nor taken steps to apply these or other leading practices.", "While we observed a strong organizational unity of purpose and  collaboration from the current senior leadership in the Army for the Army  Futures Command, this could change as the Army\u2019s leadership changes.  For example, according to law, the tenure of the Chief of Staff of the Army  is generally limited to 4 years and the current Chief of Staff has already  served 3 years. Furthermore, the Secretary of the Army is appointed by  the President, subject to the advice and consent of the Senate, and  therefore may change with new presidential administrations and during  administrations. For example, the past 6 people, prior to the current  secretary, confirmed as the Secretary of the Army served an average of  959 days\u2014about 2 and one-half years. The current secretary has already  served about 1 year. Further, senior Army officials told us that they expect  changes at both top and mid-tier leadership within the new command will  periodically occur as a result of the Army\u2019s normal system of rotations for  officers. For example, a senior military official in Army Futures Command  told us that they expect commanders of components will rotate every 4  years. Therefore, because this modernization effort is expected to span a  decade or longer, continued support from current and future senior Army  officials, such as the Chief of Staff and the Secretary of the Army, will be  essential to ensure the success of the new command into the future.", "We have previously reported in our work on internal controls that it is  important to establish the organizational structure necessary to enable an  entity to plan, execute, control, and assess the organization in achieving  its objectives as well as respond to potential changes in, among other  things, personnel. By fully applying key principles of major mergers and  organizational transformations as the Army completes the process of  establishing the Army Futures Command, the Army can better ensure the  new command realizes its goals for modernization through development  of well-defined requirements, incorporation of mature technologies, and  development of systems that provide the warfighter with the capabilities  needed for future conflicts."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The Army has made substantial changes to how it intends to coordinate  and oversee modernization efforts, due at least in part to the lost years  and billions of dollars from past efforts to modernize. The Army has taken  positive steps to improve its current modernization efforts and has already  seen some initial successes. The creation of the new command, the  integration of the cross-functional teams to better refine requirements and  cultivate technologies, the realignment of several existing organizations,  and the shifting of personnel gives the Army a unique opportunity to take  advantage of leading practices and its own lessons learned.", "The Army, however, faces some key challenges. In particular, the Army\u2019s  intent to transition technologies to weapon systems before technologies  are matured is inconsistent with leading practices, risks delays in  equipping the warfighter, and can potentially lead to cost overruns. In  addition, the cross-functional team pilots have demonstrated some initial  successes in shortening the requirements development process\u2014and,  more generally, in collaborating across the Army\u2014but it is not clear what  steps the Army Futures Command plans to take to incorporate the  experience and expertise of these teams in applying leading practices  and thereby sustain these benefits. Further, the Army lacks a formal plan  to identify and incorporate lessons learned from the cross-functional  teams as Army Futures Command becomes fully operational and could  thereby miss an opportunity to leverage the experience of these teams on  past practices that worked well and those that did not. Finally, as the  Army finalizes the roles, authorities, and responsibilities for the Army  Futures Command it can benefit from applying leading practices related  to mergers and organizational transformations.
