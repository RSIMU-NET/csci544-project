Given that the effective use of information technology (IT) is a critical enabler of this merger, GAO has previously reported on a number of DHS efforts aimed at institutionalizing an effective information and technology governance structure and investing in new IT systems that are intended to better support mission operations. Now that DHS has been operating for over a year, GAO was asked to, based largely on its prior work, describe DHS's progress in meeting its information and technology management challenge."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DHS's overall IT challenge is to standardize and integrate the legacy system environments and management approaches that it inherited from its predecessor agencies, while concurrently attempting to ensure that present levels of IT support for critical homeland security operations are not only maintained but improved in the near term. To accomplish this, the department is in the process of instituting seven information and technology management disciplines that are key elements of an effective information and technology management structure. DHS's progress in institutionalizing these key information and technology management elements has been mixed, and overall remains a work in progress. Such progress is not unexpected, given the diversity of the inherited agencies and the size and complexity of the department's mission operations. Nevertheless, because DHS has not yet fully institutionalized these governance elements, its pursuit of new and enhanced IT investments are at risk of not optimally supporting corporate mission needs and not meeting cost, schedule, capability, and benefit commitments. Accordingly, GAO has previously made recommendations relative to most of these areas to the department's chief information officer and other responsible DHS entities. Lastly, DHS has developed a draft IT strategic plan, which GAO finds lacking in explicit goals, performance measures, milestones, and knowledge of whether it has properly positioned IT staff with the right skills to accomplish these things."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Responding to real and potential threats to homeland security is one of the  federal government\u2019s most significant challenges. To address this  challenge, as you know, the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-296)  merged 22 federal agencies and organizations with homeland security- related missions into the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Since  becoming operational in March 2003, DHS has faced the considerable  challenge of transforming these diverse organizations into a single new  cabinet-level department. The information technology (IT) task related to  DHS\u2019s transformation is complex and critical to the agency\u2019s success.  According to DHS\u2019s Deputy Secretary, to help detect and deter future  terrorist attacks, DHS must rationalize disparate technologies with  conflicting business rules, consolidate data centers and networks, have a  common e-mail system, get the right information to border agents, and  prevent cyber attacks against the department\u2019s mission-critical systems.", "Critical to meeting DHS\u2019s challenge is establishing an effective corporate  information and technology management governance process at the same  time that the department is investing billions of dollars to develop, acquire,  maintain, and operate mission-critical systems. Ideally, DHS\u2019s corporate  governance structure would be in place prior to the department\u2019s making  significant IT investments so that such investment decisions reflect  departmentwide needs and priorities. Yet, the operational reality of starting  a new organization such as DHS is that it must strike a balance between its  pursuit of new and enhanced systems (that in some cases are being  managed using legacy processes) and establishing the means for achieving  a family of systems that optimally support departmentwide operations and  mission performance.", "Since DHS has been operational for over a year, you requested that we  describe the state of DHS\u2019s information and technology management.  Accordingly, our objective is to describe DHS\u2019s progress in meeting its  information and technology management challenge. To address this  objective we reviewed and synthesized our prior reports and those of the  DHS Office of Inspector General on the department\u2019s information and  technology management and specific IT investments. (A list of related GAO  products is included at the end of this report.) We also reviewed relevant  documentation to obtain more up-to-date information on changes to the  department\u2019s processes, particularly as it relates to IT strategic planning  and IT investment management. This documentation included DHS\u2019s draft  information resources management (IRM) strategic plan, draft road maps  related to its eight IT priority areas, and the department\u2019s investment  review management directive and related guidance documents. As part of  reviewing these changed processes and to discuss steps that the  department has taken to address certain of our open recommendations, we  also interviewed appropriate DHS IT officials, including the chief  information officer (CIO), chief technology officer, and the  coordinator for  its top level investment management boards. We performed our work at  DHS in Washington, D.C., in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards between April and July 2004."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In March 2003 DHS assumed operational control of about 209,000 civilian  and military positions from 22 agencies and offices.

As we have previously  reported, such a transformation poses significant management and  leadership challenges, including those associated with coordinating and  facilitating the sharing of information, both among its component agencies  and with other entities, and integrating numerous mission support,  administrative, and infrastructure IT systems. Critical to DHS\u2019s ability to  meet this challenge is the establishment of an effective IT governance  mechanism, including IT plans, processes, and people."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DHS Organizational Structure", "paragraphs": ["The Homeland Security Act of 2002 created DHS by merging agencies that  specialize in one or more interrelated and interdependent aspects of  homeland security, such as intelligence analysis, law enforcement, border  security, transportation security, biological research, critical infrastructure  protection, and disaster recovery. DHS is in the early stages of transforming  and integrating this disparate group of agencies with multiple missions,  values, and cultures into a strong and effective cabinet department. The  effective interaction, integration, and synergy of these agencies are critical  to homeland security mission performance.", "DHS\u2019s mission is to lead the unified national effort to secure America by  preventing and deterring terrorist attacks and protecting against and  responding to threats and hazards to the nation. DHS also is to ensure safe  and secure borders, welcome lawful immigrants and visitors, and promote  the free flow of commerce.  To accomplish this, the Homeland Security Act  established five under secretaries with responsibilities over directorates  for management, science and technology, information analysis and  infrastructure protection, border and transportation security, and  emergency preparedness and response (see fig. 1). In addition to these  directorates, the U.S. Secret Service and the U.S. Coast Guard continue as  distinct entities within DHS. Each DHS directorate is responsible for its  specific homeland security mission area and for coordinating related  efforts with its sibling components, as well as other external entities.", "Within the Management directorate is the Office of the CIO, which is  expected to enhance mission success by leveraging best available  information technologies and technology-management practices, provide  shared services and coordinate acquisition strategies to minimize cost and  improve consistency, support executive leadership in performance-based  management by maintaining an enterprise architecture that is fully  integrated with other management processes, and advocate and enable  business transformation in support of enhanced homeland security. Other  DHS entities also are responsible, or share responsibility, for critical  information and technology management activities. For example, within  DHS\u2019s major organizational offices (e.g., the directorates) are CIOs and IT  organizations. Control over the department\u2019s IT budget is vested primarily  with the CIO organizations within each of its component organizations, and  the component CIO organizations are accountable to the heads of DHS\u2019s  respective organizational components. Moreover, we have previously  reported on the responsibilities held by various DHS directorates to ensure  successful information sharing within the department and between federal  agencies, state and local governments, and the private sector.", "The DHS CIO established a CIO Council, chaired by the CIO and composed  of component-level CIOs, that serves as a focal point for coordinating  challenges that cross agency boundaries. According to its charter, the  specific functions of the DHS CIO Council include   establishing a strategic plan and setting priorities for departmentwide   defining and continuously improving DHS IT governance structures and   advancing DHS IT priorities through well-defined road maps that detail   identifying opportunities for sharing resources, coordinating  multibureau projects and programs, and consolidating activities; and  developing and executing formal communication programs for internal  and external constituencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Key Components of an Effective Information and Technology Management Structure", "paragraphs": ["As we have previously reported, information and technology management  is a key element of management reform efforts that can help dramatically  reshape government to improve performance and reduce costs.  Accordingly, it is critical that agencies manage their information resources  effectively, taking into account the need to address planning, processes,  and people. Key components of an effective information and technology  management structure include (1) IT strategic planning, (2) enterprise  architecture, (3) IT investment management, (4) systems development and  acquisition management, (5) information security management, (6)  information management, and (7) IT human capital management (see fig.  2).", "Morever, effective implementation of information and technology  management recognizes the interdependencies among these processes.  Illustrations of some of these relationships are as follows:  IT strategic planning defines what an agency seeks to accomplish and  identifies the strategies that it will use to achieve desired results. The IT  strategic plan, which is the outcome of this effort, is executed using the  processes established through the other components of the information  and technology structure, such as IT investment management.", "An organization\u2019s IT human capital approach must be aligned to support  the mission, vision for the future, core values, goals and objectives, and  strategies, which may be found in the IT strategic plan and the  enterprise architecture. IT human capital management, in turn, ensures  that the right people are in place with the right skills to perform critical  system acquisition functions.", "The enterprise architecture is an integral component of the IT  investment management process because an organization should  approve only those investments that move the organization toward the  target architecture.", "A critical aspect of systems acquisition and development management is  ensuring that robust information security is built into the projects early  and is periodically revisited.", "Privacy\u2014a component of information management\u2014should be a  consideration when acquiring and developing systems. For example, the  E-Government Act of 2002 requires agencies to conduct privacy impact  assessments before developing or acquiring IT systems that collect,  maintain, or disseminate information that is personally identifiable to an  individual. Such assessments would, in part, include what information is  being collected, why it is being collected, and its intended use. In  addition, ensuring that such personally identifiable data is secured  against risks such as loss or unauthorized access, destruction, use,  modification, or disclosure is an internationally recognized privacy  principle.", "DHS has recognized the importance of information and technology  management to achieving its mission. In February of this year, it issued its  first strategic plan, which outlines seven strategic goals. One of these goals  is organizational excellence, which includes information and technology  management objectives related to privacy and security and electronic  government modernization and interoperability initiatives. In addition, at  its various components, DHS has numerous ongoing major systems  development and acquisition initiatives related to meeting mission needs,  such as the following:  Border and Transportation Security Directorate. The Automated  Commercial Environment (ACE) project is to be a new trade processing  system.", "Border and Transportation Security Directorate. CAPPS II is to  identify airline passengers who pose a security risk before they reach  the passenger screening checkpoint.", "Border and Transportation Security Directorate.

However, DHS\u2019s progress has been mixed in that  some elements are further advanced than others and there is still  considerable work remaining to institutionalize each of the areas across  the department. An example of the former is that DHS established several  key practices related to building an effective IT investment management  process, whereas fundamental activities in the IT human capital area have  not been started. IT strategic planning can serve as an example of the  considerable amount of work remaining within individual elements of the  information and technology management structure. Specifically, although  DHS issued a draft IRM strategic plan this past March, it and other strategic  planning documents do not contain sufficient information regarding the  department\u2019s IT goals, how it will achieve them, and when it expects that  significant activities will be completed.", "DHS\u2019s mixed progress is not unexpected given the diversity of the inherited  agencies and the size and complexity of the department and the daunting  hurdles that it faces in integrating the systems and IT management  approaches of its many organizational components.

To address the risks associated with DHS\u2019s  departmental structures and specific IT investments, we have made  recommendations to the DHS CIO and other responsible entities\u2014such as  the Coast Guard and TSA\u2014to help the department successfully overcome  its information and technology management challenge.

Further, Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130 states  that strategic IRM plans should support agency strategic plans and provide  a description of how IRM helps accomplish agency missions. This plan  serves as a vision or road map for implementing effective management  controls and marshalling resources in a manner that will facilitate  leveraging of IT to support mission goals and outcomes. It should be tied to  and support the agency strategic plan and provide for establishing and  implementing IT management processes.", "DHS\u2019s draft IRM strategic plan dated March 2004, provides a high-level  description of how IT supports the goals of the agency\u2019s strategic plan.  According to the draft plan, although the department\u2019s component agencies  have advanced their separate uses of information technology and services,  serious gaps exist between the current and target environment necessary  to support effective integration of information and collaboration of actions.  The plan goes on to discuss steps taken in the investment management,  enterprise architecture, and security disciplines.", "The draft IRM plan also cites eight DHS CIO Council priorities for 2004;  namely, (1) information sharing, (2) mission rationalization, (3) IT security,  (4) one IT infrastructure, (5) enterprise architecture, (6) portfolio  management, (7) governance, and (8) IT human capital. DHS is in the  process of developing road maps for each of the CIO Council\u2019s priorities.  These road maps are currently in draft and generally include a description  of the current condition of the area, the need for a change, the planned  future state, initiatives, and barriers.", "Currently, neither the draft IRM strategic plan nor the draft priority area  road maps contain sufficient information regarding the department\u2019s IT  goals and performance measures, when the department expects that  significant activities will be completed, and the staff resources necessary to  implement these activities. For example:  Neither the draft IRM strategic plan nor the draft road maps include  fully defined goals and performance measures. Leading organizations  define specific goals, objectives, and measures, use a diversity of  measurement types, and describe how IT outputs and outcomes affect  organizational customer and agency program delivery requirements. In  addition, the Paperwork Reduction Act and the Clinger-Cohen Act of  1996 require agencies to establish goals and performance measures on  how information and technology management contributes to program  productivity, the efficiency and effectiveness of agency operations, and  service to the public.", "The draft IRM plan does not include milestones for when major  information and technology management activities will be initiated or  completed. In addition, the milestones in the draft road maps are  generally vague (e.g., using terms like short term and long term without  defining them or including specific months with no year). Without  milestone information, meaningful measurement of progress is not  possible. This is particularly important since DHS did not always meet  the target dates laid out by the CIO in February 2003. For example, the  CIO planned to introduce a balanced scorecard for the DHS IT  community in the department\u2019s first year. Although the draft IRM  strategic plan states that the DHS CIO Council has endorsed the use of a  balanced scorecard approach, as of mid-July, this scorecard had not  been developed.", "The plan does not address whether, or to what extent, DHS has staff  with the relevant skills to obtain its target environment and, if it does,  whether they are allocated appropriately. This is particularly important  since the DHS CIO Council has targeted IT human capital as a priority  area and, according to the draft road map document associated with this  priority, DHS is facing such issues as an aging IT workforce and too little  investment in continuous learning.", "The DHS CIO noted that the draft IRM strategic plan, the department\u2019s  initial attempt at IT strategic planning, was primarily intended to meet  OMB\u2019s requirements that a plan be developed. He further stated that  through the development of the road maps, DHS is defining the operational  details for its IT priority areas, which, in turn, will be used to update and  improve the next version of the IRM plan. In responding to a draft of this  report, DHS stated that the CIO intends to issue an IT strategic plan before  the end of the calendar year and that, over the next few months, each  priority area will develop goals, performance measures, and time lines for  implementation.", "A key emphasis of version 1.0 of the DHS draft IRM plan is its recognition  of the importance of the department\u2019s integration efforts and its description  of its plan to implement a single IT infrastructure. In particular, to  maximize its mission performance, DHS faces the enormous task of  integrating and consolidating a multitude of systems. This includes  exploiting opportunities to eliminate and consolidate systems in order to  improve mission support and reduce system costs. We recently reported  that DHS is in the process of developing its systems integration strategy  and that, in the interim, the department has taken steps to address ongoing  and planned component IT investments integration and alignment with its  evolving strategic IT management framework. However, we concluded  that while these steps have merit, they do not provide adequate assurance  of strategic alignment across the department. For example, one step simply  continued the various approaches that produced the diverse systems that  the department inherited, while another relied too heavily on oral  communication about complex IT strategic issues that are not yet fully  defined. Thus, DHS has an increased risk that its component agencies\u2019  ongoing investments, collectively costing billions of dollars in fiscal year  2004, will need to be reworked at some future point to be effectively  integrated and to maximize departmentwide value.", "Moreover, we reported that the DHS CIO does not have authority and  control over departmentwide IT spending, even though such control is  important for effective systems integration. According to our research on  leading private and public sector organizations and experience at federal  agencies, leading organizations adopt and use an enterprisewide approach  under the leadership of a CIO or comparable senior executive who has the  responsibility and authority, including budgetary and spending control, for  IT across the entity. To help DHS better manage the risks that it faces, we  made several recommendations, including that the Secretary examine the  sufficiency of IT spending authority vested in the CIO and take appropriate  steps to correct any limitations in authority that constrain the CIO\u2019s ability  to effectively integrate IT investments in support of departmentwide  mission goals.

For a decade, we have promoted the use of  architectures to guide and constrain systems modernization, recognizing  them as a crucial means to a challenging goal: establishing agency  operational structures that are optimally defined in both business and  technological environments. The Congress, OMB, and the federal CIO  Council have also recognized the importance of an architecture-centric  approach to modernization. The Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 mandates that  an agency\u2019s CIO develop, maintain, and facilitate the implementation of IT  architectures. This should provide a means of managing the integration of  business processes and supporting systems. Further, the E-Government  Act of 2002 requires OMB to oversee the development of enterprise  architectures within and across agencies.", "Generally speaking, an enterprise architecture connects an organization\u2019s  strategic plan with program and system solution implementations by  providing the fundamental information details needed to guide and  constrain implementable investments in a consistent, coordinated, and  integrated fashion. An enterprise architecture provides a clear and  comprehensive picture of an entity, whether it is an organization (e.g.,  federal department) or a functional or mission area that cuts across more  than one organization (e.g., homeland security). This picture consists of  snapshots of both the enterprise\u2019s current or \u201cAs Is\u201d operational and  technological environment and its target or \u201cTo Be\u201d environment, as well as  a capital investment road map for transitioning from the current to the  target environment. These snapshots further consist of \u201cviews,\u201d which are  basically one or more architecture products that provide conceptual or  logical representations of the enterprise.", "For the last 2 years, we have promoted the development and use of a  homeland security enterprise architecture. For example, in June 2002 we  testified on the need to define the homeland security mission and the  information, technologies, and approaches necessary to perform this  mission in a way that is divorced from organizational parochialism and  cultural differences. We also stressed that a particularly critical function of  a homeland security architecture would be to establish processes and  information/data protocols and standards that could facilitate information  collection and permit sharing.", "Recognizing the pivotal role that an architecture will play in successfully  merging the diverse operating and systems environments that the  department inherited, DHS issued an initial version in September 2003. Our  recent report on this initial enterprise architecture found that it provides a  partial basis upon which to build future versions. However, the September  2003 version of the enterprise architecture is missing most of the content  necessary to be considered a well-defined architecture. Moreover, the  content in this version was not systematically derived from a DHS or  national corporate business strategy, but rather was more the result of an  amalgamation of the existing architectures that several of DHS\u2019s  predecessor agencies already had, along with their respective portfolios of  system investment projects. Such a development approach is not  consistent with recognized architecture development best practices.", "DHS officials agreed with our content assessment of their initial  architecture, stating that it is largely a reflection of what could be done  without a departmental strategic plan to drive architectural content and  with limited resources and time. They also stated that the primary purposes  in developing this version were to meet an OMB deadline for submitting the  department\u2019s fiscal year 2004 IT budget request and for the department to  develop a more mature understanding of enterprise architecture and its  ability to execute an approach and methodology for developing and using  the next version of the architecture.", "Nevertheless, we concluded that DHS does not yet have the architectural  content that it needs to effectively guide and constrain its business  transformation efforts and the hundreds of millions of dollars it is investing  in supporting systems. For example, the architecture does not (1) include a  description of the information flows and relationships among  organizational units, business operations, and system elements; (2) provide  a description of the business and operational rules for data standardization  to ensure data consistency, integrity, and accuracy; or (3) include an  analysis of the gaps between the baseline and target architecture for  business processes, information/data, and services/application systems to  define missing and needed capabilities.", "Moreover, the architecture does not adequately recognize the  interdependencies with other critical IT management processes since it  does not include (1) a description of the policies, procedures, processes,  and tools for selecting, controlling, and evaluating application systems to  enable effective IT investment management and (2) a description of the  system development lifecycle process for application development or  acquisition and the integration of the process with the architecture. In  addition, although the architecture recognizes the need for a governance  structure and contains a high-level discussion of same, it does not include  an architecture governance and control structure and the integrated  procedures, processes, and criteria (e.g., investment management and  security) to be followed. Without such content, DHS runs the risk that its  investments will not be well integrated, will be duplicative, will be  unnecessarily costly to maintain and interface, and will not effectively  optimize mission performance.", "To assist DHS in developing a well-defined enterprise architecture, our  August report contained numerous recommendations directed to the  architecture executive steering committee\u2014composed of senior  executives from technical and business organizations across the  department\u2014in collaboration with the CIO, that are aimed at ensuring that  the needed content is added and that the approach followed adheres to  best practices.", "Given DHS\u2019s intended purpose of its enterprise architecture, which is to  use it as the basis for departmentwide (and national) operational  transformation and to support systems modernization and evolution, it is  important that individual IT investments be aligned with the architecture.  Moreover, according to the CIO, DHS is developing a process to align its  systems modernization activities with its enterprise architecture. However,  earlier this year, we reported that this alignment had not been determined  for two of the department\u2019s major investments\u2014ACE and US-VISIT\u2014but  the CIO and program officials stated that they planned to address this  issue."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IT Investment Management", "paragraphs": ["Investments in IT can have a dramatic impact on an organization\u2019s  performance.

An IT investment management process provides a systematic  method for agencies to minimize risks while maximizing return on  investment. A central tenet of the federal approach to IT investment  management has been the select/control/evaluate model. During the select  phase, the organization (1) identifies and analyzes each project\u2019s risks and  returns before committing significant funds and (2) selects those projects  that will best support its mission needs. In the control phase, the  organization ensures that the project continues to meet mission needs at  the expected levels of cost and risks. If the project is not meeting  expectations or if problems have arisen, steps are quickly taken to address  the deficiencies. During the evaluate phase, actual versus expected results  are compared after a project has been fully implemented.", "DHS has developed and begun implementing a departmental IT investment  management process. In May 2003 DHS issued an investment review  management directive and IT capital planning and investment control  guide, which provide the department\u2019s component organizations with  requirements and guidance on documentation and review of IT  investments. In February 2004, we reported that DHS\u2019s investment  management process was evolving. Since that time, DHS has changed its  process to reflect lessons learned during the department\u2019s first year of  operation and continuous improvement of the process. Moreover, DHS  issued a new interim IT capital planning and investment control guide in  May 2004 and is in the process of revising the investment review  management directive to reflect the changes that have been made. Among  the changes is a shifting of responsibilities of some of its investment  management boards and increases to the thresholds that determine which  board approves an investment.", "Figure 3 illustrates the governance boards DHS uses to execute its  investment review process. Under this process, DHS has four levels of  investments, the top three of which are subject to review by department- level boards\u2014the Investment Review Board, Joint Requirements Council,  and Enterprise Architecture Board. (App. I provides more specific  information on the boards and their responsibilities.)", "In addition, DHS has established a five-phase review process that calls for  these investments to be reviewed at key decision points, such as program  authorization (see fig. 4).", "With the establishment of the governance boards and the investment  review process, DHS has established several key practices associated with  building the investment foundation as described by our IT investment  management framework. In addition, as part of the selection phase of its  capital planning and investment control process, DHS reviewed component  agency IT investments for its fiscal year 2005 budget submission.  Specifically, according to DHS IT officials, (1) the CIO approved the  department\u2019s IT portfolio and (2) all of the major IT systems submitted to  OMB for the fiscal year 2005 budget were assessed and scored by an  investment review team.", "In addition, earlier this year, as we reported, with the department\u2019s  establishment of the department\u2019s top investment management board, the  ACE and CAPPS II investments met legislative conditions contained in the  Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2004 (P.L. 108-90).  For example, in February 2004 we reported that that creation of the  Investment Review Board satisfied a CAPPS II legislative requirement  associated with the establishment of an oversight board, with the caveat  that the board oversee the program on a regular and thorough basis. In  addition, in May 2004 we reported that DHS satisfied a prior  recommendation of ours to establish and charter an executive body to  guide and direct the US-VISIT program by establishing a three-entity  governance structure, which includes the department\u2019s Investment Review  Board.", "Although DHS has made noticeable progress, it still has much work  remaining to fully implement its IT investment management process,  particularly as it relates to carrying out effective departmental control over  IT investments. For example:  Many of DHS\u2019s IT investments have not undergone control reviews. As  of early July, one or more of DHS\u2019s investment management boards had  reviewed less than a quarter of the major IT investments subject to  departmental review (level 1, 2, and 3 investments). According to the  coordinator of this process, the investments that have undergone  control reviews were considered DHS\u2019s highest priority IT investments  based on criteria such as cost, visibility, or that a key decision point was  forthcoming. In addition, DHS stated that its ability to complete control  reviews in a timely manner is affected by the amount of resources,  people, time, and funding allocated to the department. Nevertheless, our  reviews of several DHS level 1 investments indicate the importance of  such reviews, since we have found cost, schedule, and performance  problems as well as significant management activities that have not  been completed.", "DHS has not established a process to ensure that control reviews of IT  investments are performed in a timely manner. Our February 2004  report recommended that the DHS CIO develop a control review  schedule for IT investments, subject to departmental oversight. DHS  concurred with this recommendation, but has not yet implemented it.  However, for the fiscal year 2006 budget cycle, which is being  formulated now, DHS entities were asked to provide the dates of prior  and future key decision points for each major IT investment. According  to Office of the CIO capital planning and investment control officials,  this is their first step toward building a control review schedule.", "Officials from DHS\u2019s offices of the CIO and chief financial officer  characterized the department\u2019s investment management process as still  maturing. For example, Office of the CIO capital planning and  investment control officials stated that the department will be  concentrating on developing and building a disciplined and structured  control process in fiscal year 2005. Officials from the offices of the CIO  and chief financial officer also described various initiatives that are  being undertaken to improve this process. For example, portfolio  management is a CIO Council priority and, according to the draft road  map for this priority, the planned future environment will have IT  investments aligned and optimized against mission requirements at the  DHS level. DHS has procured an automated portfolio management  system to help in this endeavor. According to Office of the CIO capital  planning and investment control officials, DHS has inserted its fiscal  year 2005 business cases for major investments (also known as budget  exhibit 300s) into this system and plans to add the fiscal year 2006  business cases later this year. In addition, according to these officials,  the department\u2019s Investment Review Team plans to use this system to  perform portfolio analysis to provide additional insight to DHS  investment management boards as they make their investment  selections for fiscal year 2006."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Systems Development and Acquisition Management", "paragraphs": ["Our work and other best-practice research have shown that applying  rigorous management practices to the development and acquisition of IT  systems and the acquisition of IT services improves the likelihood of  delivering expected capabilities on time and within budget. In other words,  the quality of IT systems and services is largely governed by the quality of  the management processes involved in developing and acquiring them.", "DHS has numerous ongoing major systems development and acquisition  initiatives that are critical to meeting its mission needs. Our reviews of  several major DHS systems development and acquisition efforts have found  that these rigorous processes are not always employed. We have made  numerous recommendations that address a variety of system development  and acquisition issues. DHS has generally agreed with these  recommendations and, in some cases, has implemented, or begun to  implement, them. For example:  Process controls for acquiring software-intensive systems. Disciplined  processes for acquiring software are essential to software-intensive  system acquisitions. The Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie  Mellon University has defined the tenets of effective software  acquisition, which identify, among other things, a number of key process  areas that are necessary to effectively manage software-intensive  system acquisitions. In the past, we have reported that such key  processes had not been fully implemented for ACE and US-VISIT.  Consequently, we made recommendations for both of these programs  related to instituting acquisition process controls called for in the  Software Engineering Institute\u2019s SA-CMM\u00ae model. As of May of this  year, the acquisition control recommendation had been implemented by  the ACE program in that the Software Engineering Institute had  assigned the program a level 2 rating, meaning that it had established  basic acquisition management processes. Also in May of this year we  reported that US-VISIT was planning to implement our recommendation  on instituting acquisition process controls.", "Managing and conducting testing. Complete and thorough testing is  essential to providing reasonable assurance that new or modified  systems process information correctly and will meet an organization\u2019s  business needs. According to leading IT organizations, to be effective,  software testing practices should be planned and conducted in a  structured and disciplined fashion. We have expressed concerns about  testing and issued related recommendations for three DHS IT  investments\u2014Rescue 21, CAPPS II, and US-VISIT. For example, in  September 2003 we reported that the Coast Guard planned to compress  and overlap the testing schedules for Rescue 21, which increased its risk  that, for instance, all requirements would not be tested during formal  qualification testing, system integration testing, and operational testing  and evaluation. To mitigate Rescue 21 risks, we made  recommendations to the Coast Guard related to establishing a new  testing schedule and ensuring that milestones are established for  completing test plans and that these plans address all requirements of  the system. The Coast Guard agreed with these recommendations,  which the agency has begun to implement. In the cases of CAPPS II and  US-VISIT, we made recommendations to TSA and the Border and  Transportation Security Directorate, respectively, covering system and  database testing and developing and approving complete test plans  before testing begins, respectively. DHS generally concurred with  these recommendations.", "Measuring the performance of a system. By using comprehensive  performance information, more informed decisions can be made about  IT investments. An effective performance measurement system  produces information that (1) provides an early warning indicator of  problems and the effectiveness of corrective actions, (2) provides input  to resource allocation and planning, and (3) provides periodic feedback  about the quality, quantity, cost, and timeliness of products and services.  We have reported on a variety of performance measure concerns  associated with five DHS IT investments and have made relevant  recommendations. For example, in February 2004, we reported that TSA  had established preliminary goals and measures for CAPPS II but that  they could be strengthened. We also noted that TSA had not fully  established policies and procedures to monitor and evaluate the use and  operation of the system. Similarly, our review of SEVIS, which is  operational, found that several key system performance requirements  were not being formally measured. This is problematic because  without formally monitoring and documenting key system performance  requirements, DHS cannot adequately ensure that potential system  problems are identified and addressed early, before they have a chance  to become larger and affect the DHS mission objectives supported by  SEVIS.", "In addition to our recommendations related to specific DHS IT  investments, we have also issued guidance to assist agencies in improving  their systems development and acquisitions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Information Security Management", "paragraphs": ["Since 1997 we have designated information security as a governmentwide  high-risk issue because of continuing evidence indicating significant,  pervasive weaknesses in the controls over computerized federal  operations. Moreover, related risks continue to escalate, in part due to the  government\u2019s increasing reliance on the Internet and on commercially  available information technology. Government officials are increasingly  concerned about attacks launched by individuals and groups with  malicious intent, such as crime, terrorism, foreign intelligence gathering,  and acts of war. In addition, the disgruntled organization insider is a  significant threat, since such individuals often have knowledge that allows  them to gain unrestricted access and inflict damage or steal assets without  possessing a great deal of knowledge about computer intrusions.", "Based on its annual evaluation required by the Federal Information  Security Management Act of 2002, in September 2003 the DHS Office of  Inspector General reported that DHS had made progress in establishing a  framework for an IT systems security program. For example, DHS has (1)  appointed a chief information security officer, (2) developed and  disseminated information system security policies and procedures, (3)  implemented an incident response and reporting process, (4) initiated a  security awareness training program, and (5) established a critical  infrastructure protection working group.", "However, the inspector general report concluded that still more needs to be  done to ensure the security of DHS\u2019s IT infrastructure and prevent  disruptions to mission operations. For example, DHS did not have a  process to ensure that all plans of action and milestones for identified  weaknesses were developed, implemented, and managed. In responding to  a draft of this report, DHS stated that it has instituted a tool to monitor  each organizational element\u2019s progress in developing and achieving the  milestones identified in the plans of action and milestones.", "In addition, the Office of Inspector General stated that none of the DHS  components had a fully functioning IT security program and a number of  key security areas needed attention. For example, less than half of DHS\u2019s  systems had a security plan and been assessed for risk. Among the Office of  Inspector General\u2019s recommendations were that the CIO (1) develop and  implement a process to identify information security-related material  weaknesses in mission-critical programs and systems, (2) implement an  oversight and reporting function to track the progress of remediation of  material weaknesses, and (3) require DHS information officers to assign  information systems security officers to oversee the security controls of  each major application and general support system.", "More recently, the DHS Office of Inspector General reported that DHS  cannot ensure that the sensitive information processed by its wireless  systems is effectively protected from unauthorized access and potential  misuse. In particular, the Inspector General reported that DHS had not (1)  provided sufficient guidance on wireless implementation to its  components, (2) established adequate security controls to protect its  wireless networks against commonly known security vulnerabilities, and  (3) certified or accredited its wireless networks. The Inspector General  made several recommendations to address the deficiencies cited in the  report, which the DHS CIO agreed to and has taken steps to implement.", "In addition, we have long held that it is important that security be  addressed in the early planning stages of the development of IT systems,  and have reported on security planning in the US-VISIT and CAPPS II  programs. For example, in June 2003 we recommended that the US-VISIT  program manager develop a system security plan and in May 2004 we  reported that this recommendation had been partially implemented.  Specifically, DHS provided a draft security plan, but this plan did not  include (1) specific controls for meeting the security requirements, (2) a  risk assessment methodology, or (3) the roles and responsibilities of  individuals with system access.", "DHS reported four departmentwide information security-related material  weaknesses in its fiscal year 2003 Performance and Accountability  Report. For example, DHS reported that it had (1) limited tracking,  evaluation, and reporting tools necessary to provide oversight over its  information security efforts and (2) insufficient resources, processes,  policies, and guidelines in place to ensure the identification, protection,  and continuity of services to reduce the department\u2019s vulnerabilities and  risks and to sustain mission-critical functions in the event of a man-made or  natural disaster. According to the DHS report, the department plans to take  corrective actions related to these material weaknesses by September 30,  2004.", "The DHS CIO Council has also pronounced information security a priority  area. The draft road map associated with this area includes various short- ,  mid- , and long-term initiatives. Moreover, to lay a foundation for  departmental improvements in information security management, DHS has  developed an information security program strategic plan, which identifies  major program areas, goals, and objectives. According to this April 2004  plan, these major security program areas allow DHS to implement and  maintain information security as part of its capital investment control  process, systems development life cycle, and the enterprise architecture,  and are essential to providing security services that protect the  confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and to provide  accountability for activities on DHS networks and computing platforms."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Information Management", "paragraphs": ["As agencies increasingly move to an operational environment in which  electronic\u2014rather than paper\u2014records provide comprehensive  documentation of their activities and business processes, a variety of  information collection, use, and dissemination issues have emerged. Such  issues are particularly relevant to DHS because the Homeland Security Act  of 2002 and federal policy assign responsibilities to the department for the  coordination and sharing of information related to threats of domestic  terrorism\u2014within the department and with and among other federal  agencies, state and local governments, the private sector, and other  entities.", "Among the information management issues facing DHS are information  sharing, privacy, and compliance with the information collection  requirements. Namely: Information sharing. As we have reported, information sharing is critical  to successfully addressing increasing threats and fulfilling the missions of  DHS. For example, to accomplish its missions, the department must (1)  access, receive, and analyze law enforcement information, intelligence  information, and other threat, incident, and vulnerability information from  federal and nonfederal sources, and (2) analyze such information to  identify and assess the nature and scope of terrorist threats. Further, DHS  must share information both internally and externally with agencies and  law enforcement on such matters as goods and passengers inbound to the  United States and individuals who are known or suspected terrorists and  criminals. It also must share information among emergency responders in  preparing for and responding to terrorist attacks and other emergencies.", "We have made numerous recommendations over the last several years  related to information-sharing functions that have been transferred to DHS,  which are focused on sharing information on incidents, threats, and  vulnerabilities and providing warnings related to critical infrastructures,  both within the federal government and between the federal government  and state and local governments and the private sector. In September 2003  we testified that although progress has been made in addressing our  recommendations, further efforts were needed, such as (1) improving the  federal government\u2019s capabilities to analyze incident, threat, and  vulnerability information obtained from numerous sources and share  appropriate timely, useful warnings and other information concerning both  cyber and physical threats to federal entities, state and local governments,  and the private sector, and (2) developing a comprehensive and  coordinated national plan to facilitate information sharing on critical  infrastructures. More recently, in July 2004 we reported that DHS\u2019s ability  to gather, analyze, and disseminate information could be improved by  developing information sharing-related policies and procedures for its components. In commenting on a draft of this report, DHS provided  planned actions in response to its recommendations.", "The DHS Secretary has recognized the criticality of information sharing in  the department\u2019s strategic plan. In addition, information sharing is one of  the DHS CIO Council\u2019s priorities in 2004. In the draft road map associated  with this priority area, DHS described a future state that includes seamless  access and dissemination of information in real time or near real time, that  information is shared with all constituents, at all levels of government, and  with the private sector, and that there are agreed-upon data standardization  rules. We have issued guidance on information-sharing practices of  organizations that successfully share sensitive or time-critical information,  which could aid DHS in its efforts.", "Privacy. With the emphasis on information sharing, privacy issues have  emerged as a major, and contentious, concern. Since the terrorist attacks of  September 11, 2001, data mining has been seen increasingly as a useful  tool to help detect terrorist threats by improving the collection and analysis  of public and private-sector data. Our May 2004 governmentwide report  on data mining described 14 data mining efforts reported by DHS. Mining  government and private databases containing personal information creates  a range of privacy concerns because agencies can quickly and efficiently  obtain information on individuals or groups by exploiting large databases  containing personal information aggregated from public and private  records. Concerns have also been raised about the quality and accuracy of  the mined data; the use of the data for other than the original purpose for  which the data were collected without the consent of the individual; the  protection of the data against unauthorized access, modification, or  disclosure; and the right of individuals to know about the collection of  personal information, how to access that information, and how to request a  correction of inaccurate information. In April 2003, DHS appointed its first  chief privacy officer. According to this officer, among other things, the DHS  privacy office promotes best practices with respect to privacy, guides DHS  agencies in developing appropriate privacy policies, and serves as a  resource for questions related to privacy and information collection and  disclosure.", "Privacy concerns have also been a critical factor in the development and  acquisition of US-VISIT and CAPPS II. With respect to CAPPS II, the 2004  DHS appropriations act designated privacy as one of eight key issues that  TSA must address before CAPPS II is deployed or implemented. In our  February 2004 report on whether TSA had fulfilled these legislative  requirements, we stated that the agency\u2019s plans appear to address many of  the requirements of the Privacy Act, the primary legislation that regulates  the government\u2019s use of personal information. However, while TSA had  taken initial steps, it had not finalized its plans for complying with the  Privacy Act. We also looked at the TSA\u2019s plans in the larger context of eight  Fair Information Practices, which are internationally recognized privacy  principles that include practices such as data quality and security  safeguards. The TSA\u2019s plans reflect some actions to address each of these  practices. However, to meet its evolving mission goals, the agency also  appears to limit the application of some of these practices. This reflects  TSA\u2019s efforts to balance privacy with other public policy interests, such as  national security, law enforcement, and administrative efficiency.", "Compliance with the information collection requirements of the  Paperwork Reduction Act.

The challenges the federal government faces in maintaining a high- quality IT workforce are long-standing and widely recognized.", "The success of the transformation and implementation of DHS is based  largely on the degree to which human capital management issues are  addressed. We have issued several reports examining how DHS plans to  implement its new human capital system. For example, in June 2004 we  reported that DHS had begun strategic human capital planning efforts at  the headquarters level since the release of the department\u2019s overall  strategic plan and the publication of proposed regulations for its new  human capital management system. However, DHS had not yet  systematically gathered relevant human capital data at the headquarters  level, although efforts were under way to collect detailed human capital  information and design a centralized information system so that such data  could be gathered and reported departmentwide. These strategic human  capital planning efforts can enable DHS to remain aware of and be  prepared for current and future needs as an organization.", "It is important that DHS address its IT human capital challenges  expeditiously since, according to the DHS CIO, the biggest obstacle to the  implementation of a departmentwide systems integration strategy has been  insufficient staffing. More specifically, the CIO said that his office received  substantially fewer staff than he requested when the department was  originally established in 2003. To illustrate his statement, the CIO said that  after studying other comparably sized federal department CIO  organizations, he requested approximately 163 positions. However, he said  that his office received about 65 positions. In addition, CIO officials told the  Office of Inspector General that, given the relatively small staff resources  provided, they have been \u201cbusy putting out fires\u201d and, as a result, have been  hindered in carrying out some critical IT management responsibilities,  including instituting central guidance and standards in areas such as  information security and network management. Lastly, the DHS CIO also  noted the lack of properly skilled IT staff within the component agencies.  Challenges facing DHS in this area, he stated, include overcoming political  and cultural barriers, leveraging cultural beliefs and diversity to achieve  collaborative change, and recruiting and retaining skilled IT workers.", "In addition, we have expressed concerns about human capital issues  related to two of DHS\u2019s major IT investments, ACE and US-VISIT. In May  2002 we reported that the program office managing ACE did not have the  people in place to perform critical system acquisition functions, which  increased the risk that promised system capabilities would not be delivered  on time or within budget. Accordingly, we recommended that a human  capital management strategy be immediately implemented for this office.  Two years later we reported that U.S. Customs and Border Protection is in  the process of implementing this recommendation. In particular, the  program office had developed and begun implementing a human capital  management plan, but the office has continued to experience difficulty in  filling key positions. The ACE program office has begun implementing a  new staffing plan intended to address DHS\u2019s concern that the program  office has insufficient government program management staff. We have  reported on similar IT human capital problems associated with US-VISIT  and recommended that it develop and implement a human capital strategy,  which the department is in the process of doing.", "As mentioned, the DHS CIO Council established IT human capital as one of  its eight priority areas. As with the other priority areas, a component  agency sponsor has been named for human capital. However, unlike the  other priority areas, as of mid-July 2004, an Office of the CIO official had  not been assigned to work in this area. An Office of the CIO official  explained that the person originally assigned this task is no longer with the  department and that the office was determining who would take over this  role. Moreover, in February 2003, the DHS CIO set July 2003 as a milestone  for developing a current inventory of IT skills, resources, and positions,  and September 2003 as the target date for developing an action plan. In  mid-July 2004, the CIO stated that these milestones were not met and  acknowledged that progress in IT human capital has been slow.
