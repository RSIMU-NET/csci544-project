This amount is estimated to grow to about $75 billion for fiscal year 2003.  By statute (10 U.S.C. 2208), working capital funds are devices to effectively control and account for costs of goods and services provided. The department\u2019s financial management regulation states that fund activities will operate in a business-like fashion and incorporate full costs in determining the pricing of their products. The regulation also states that the activities\u2019 cost of operations should break-even over time and that losses can be occasionally funded through appropriations or by transfers from another DOD account. Annual DOD appropriations acts have also contained provisions transferring money from the fund under some circumstances.", "The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 (P.L. 106-398) requires that we review the working capital fund activities to identify any potential changes in current management processes or policies that, if made, would result in a more efficient and economical operation. The act also requires that we review the Defense Logistics Agency\u2019s (DLA) efficiency, effectiveness, and flexibility of operational practices and identify ways to improve services. One such DLA activity, the Defense Energy Support Center, sold about $4.7 billion of various petroleum- related products to the military services in fiscal year 2001. The services primarily use their operation and maintenance appropriations to pay for these products. The basis for the military services\u2019 annual budget request to Congress related to fuel needs is what DOD refers to as the stabilized annual fuel price. The stabilized annual fuel price, along with the services\u2019 estimated fuel requirements, is used to compute budget estimates. Therefore, it is important that the fuel price accurately reflect the full cost as envisioned in the concept. If the price is too high, the fund will receive more funds than required, funds that otherwise could be used to meet other priorities. If the price is too low, the fund will not have sufficient funds to cover the cost of fuel, prompting DOD to either increase prices in future years, request a supplemental appropriation, or transfer funds from another DOD account.", "In response to the mandate, we have undertaken a body of work that will result in a series of reports on working capital fund activities. This report addresses (1) whether DOD\u2019s stabilized annual fuel prices have reflected the full cost of fuel and (2) our views on the process to establish the stabilized annual fuel price.", "To make the pricing assessment, we reviewed the pricing components\u2014- crude oil cost estimates, cost to refine, adjustments, and surcharges\u2014used in determining budget year fuel prices for fiscal years 1993-2003. Figure 1 identifies these components as a percentage of the total price for the fiscal year 2003 stabilized price, which is the amount per barrel that DLA charges its military customers.", "Although the net adjustment shown above was only $0.46 per barrel, it represents positive and negative cash adjustments totaling $16.08 per barrel (or $1.8 billion). Positive adjustments totaling $8.27 per barrel (or $910 million) included a $4.67 per barrel increase to compensate for not receiving an anticipated $514 million appropriation for fiscal year 2002. Negative adjustments totaling $7.81 per barrel (or $860.9 million) included decreasing the price by $6.13 per barrel as a result of an estimated decrease in refined oil prices for fiscal years 2002 and 2003."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["DOD has been trying to successfully implement the working capital fund concept for over 50 years. However, Congress has repeatedly noted weaknesses in DOD\u2019s ability to use this mechanism to effectively control costs and operate in a business-like fashion.", "The Secretary of Defense is authorized by 10 U.S.C. 2208 to establish working capital funds. The funds are to recover the full costs of goods and services provided, including applicable administrative expenses. The funds generally rely on sales revenue rather than direct appropriations or other funding sources to finance their operations. This revenue is then used to procure new inventory or provide services to customers. Therefore, in order to continue operations, the fund should (1) generate sufficient revenue to cover the full costs of its operations and (2) operate on a break- even basis over time\u2013that is, not have a gain or incur a loss. In fiscal year 2001, the Defense Working Capital Fund\u2014which consisted of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Defense-wide, and Defense Commissary Agency working capital funds\u2014was the financial vehicle used to buy about $70 billion in defense commodities including fuel.", "The Defense Energy Support Center, as a subordinate command of DLA, buys fuel from oil companies for its customers. Military customers primarily use operation and maintenance appropriations to finance these purchases. In fiscal year 2001, reported fuel sales totaled about $4.7 billion, with the Air Force being the largest customer, purchasing about $2.7 billion.", "Each year the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) faces the challenge of estimating and establishing a per barrel price for its fuel and other fuel-related commodities that will closely approximate the actual per barrel price during budget execution, almost a year later. The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) establishes the stabilized annual price based largely upon the market price of crude oil as estimated by the Office of Management and Budget, plus a calculated estimate of the cost to refine. To this price is added other adjustments directed by Congress or DOD and a surcharge for DLA overhead and the operational costs of the Defense Energy Support Center. The services annually use these stabilized prices and their estimated fuel requirements based on activity levels (such as flying hours, steaming days, tank miles, and base operations) in developing their fuel budget requests. Figure 2 generally illustrates the process and the main organizations involved in budgeting for fuels.", "The stabilized annual fuel prices computed by DOD have varied over the years, largely due to volatility in the price of crude oil. For example, the stabilized annual fuel price and the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s estimated crude oil price, on which the stabilized price was based for fiscal years 1993 through fiscal year 2003, are shown in figure 3.", "The stabilized fuel price for each budget year remains unchanged until the next budget year, to provide price stability during budget execution. According to DOD\u2019s Financial Management Regulation, differences between the budget year price and actual prices occurring during the execution year should increase or decrease the next budget year\u2019s price. However, according to DOD\u2019s Financial Management Regulation, fund losses can occasionally be covered by obtaining an appropriation from Congress or by transferring funds from another DOD account.  DOD is also authorized to move money out of the fund by annual appropriation acts.  These acts limit the amount of funds that can be moved and the purposes for which the funds can be used.  Specifically, money can only be removed from the fund for higher priority items, based on unforeseen military requirements, than those for which originally appropriated and cannot be used for items previously denied by Congress.  These acts also require the Secretary of Defense to notify Congress of transfers made under this authority."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Fuel Prices Used in Budget Requests Do Not Reflect Full Cost", "paragraphs": ["The stabilized annual fuel prices used in the services\u2019 budget requests to Congress do not reflect the full cost of fuel because of cash movements (adjustments) and inaccurate surcharges. Therefore, the services\u2019 budgets for fuel may be greater or less than needed and funds for other readiness needs may be adversely affected. Based on our review of Office of Management and Budget and Defense Energy Support Center methodologies, the crude and refined oil price components appeared reasonable (see app. I for details). However, in fiscal years 1993-2002, cash movements into and out of the fund (adjustments) amounting to over $4 billion, while disclosed to Congress in DOD budget documents, were used for other purposes rather than to lower or raise prices. Some of the cash was moved at the direction of Congress and some at the direction of DOD. Congress makes such decisions as part of its budget deliberations. While authorized to move funds, DOD did not provide Congress with any rationale for the movements based on the limitations in the applicable appropriations acts. Identifying the rationale for moving these funds would be helpful to DOD and congressional decisionmakers as part of the budget review process. Removing money from the fund, which could be used to reduce future fuel prices, causes future service appropriations to be higher than they otherwise would be. In addition, the estimated surcharge component of the price used in budgeting was consistently higher than actual; it did not contain all costs; and in some cases, the costs were not adequately supported."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Cash Movements Masked the Full Cost of Fuel and Affected the Budget", "paragraphs": ["Substantial cash movements (adjustments) into and out of the fund, while disclosed to Congress in budget documents, have kept prices from reflecting the full cost of fuel and affected the development of future years\u2019 stabilized annual fuel prices. As a result, the fuel-related portion of the services\u2019 operation and maintenance budgets totaled about $2.5 billion too high in 5 fiscal years and about $1.5 billion too low in another. The cash taken out of the fund went for the services\u2019 operation and maintenance and other nonfuel-related expenses. Further, Congress provided a $1.56 billion emergency supplemental appropriation in fiscal year 2000 to help offset a loss due to a worldwide increase in crude oil prices. This was necessary because DOD had established a stabilized price of $26.04 per barrel but the actual cost that year was $48.58 per barrel. This appropriation allowed DOD to avoid recovering the loss through a price increase. Figure 4 shows the various fuel-related cash movements during fiscal years 1993 through 2002.", "Table 1 shows the various cash movements out of the working capital fund from fiscal years 1993 through 2002. In total, about $2.5 billion of fuel-generated funds was removed from the fund. Of this amount, $0.5 billion was used to pay for specific nonfuel-related expenses such as the Counter Drug Effort. The remaining $2.0 billion was used to meet the services\u2019 other operation and maintenance needs.", "In reviewing these cash movements, we noted that DOD had notified Congress.  However, when doing so, DOD did not provide rationale for the cash movements based on the law, which stipulates that the authority for such movements may not be used, unless for higher priority items, based on unforeseen military requirements, and where the item for which the funds are requested has not been previously denied by Congress.  As a good management practice, such rationale, along with other information, such as the impact on future prices, would serve to provide more visibility to cash movements.  In fact, in one instance, the Senate Appropriations Committee disallowed the $125-million request created when DOD moved these funds from the Defense-wide Working Capital Fund to cover Air Force Working Capital Fund losses.  The Senate Appropriations Committee Report on the Department of Defense Appropriation Bill, 2002 and Supplemental Appropriations, 2002, stated that it could not support such a cash movement because it was inconsistent with DOD\u2019s existing policies for recovering working capital fund losses.  As a result, the committee reduced the appropriation to DOD\u2019s working capital fund by that amount.", "Table 2 shows the effect of these cash movements on the stabilized annual fuel price if they had been used to lower or raise future year prices.", "Cash removed in 5 years caused the services\u2019 fuel budgets to be about $2.5 billion higher than necessary because the prices could have been lowered. For example, $800 million removed in fiscal year 2001 caused the stabilized price in fiscal year 2003 to be $7.27 per barrel higher than necessary. As a result, the services\u2019 fiscal year 2003 fuel budgets were overstated by $800 million. However, in fiscal year 2000, a $1.43 billion net cash movement into the fund caused the fiscal year 2002 stabilized price to be $12.99 per barrel lower than necessary to recover the full cost. As a result, the services\u2019 fiscal year 2002 budgets were understated by $1.43 billion.", "While military service comptroller officials responsible for managing fuel costs for each service stated that they were aware that DOD sets the stabilized annual fuel price that they must use in the budget process, they believed any gains in 1 year were being used to lower future fuel prices. These officials were not aware that funds generated from fuel sales in 1 year were being used to pay for nonfuel-related DOD needs. In their view, lower prices would have allowed them to use more of their operation and maintenance funds for other priorities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Surcharge Inaccuracies also Affect Budget Information", "paragraphs": ["The estimated surcharge portion of the price supporting budget requests has not accurately accounted for fuel-related costs consistent with DOD\u2019s Financial Management Regulation.

While DLA has a methodology for allocating its overhead costs to the affected business activities, we could not verify/validate the portion that was assessed to the center. As a result, we could not determine whether the Defense Energy Support Center was charged the appropriate amount. This is of particular concern because in the most recent budget submission for fiscal year 2003, DLA requested a $16.9 million increase in its overhead charges to the center. The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) refused to grant the increase because it did not believe the increase was merited.", "Furthermore, the Defense Energy Support Center could not provide support for the $342 million terminal operations component cost for fiscal years 1997 and 1998.

We disagree. While our report points out that under the working capital fund concept fuel prices should cover gains and loses, it also acknowledges that there have been numerous transfers. Our point is that to ensure fund accountability when such transfers occur, DOD\u2019s fuel pricing practices should include providing Congress a full disclosure of the rationale for the transfer and its impact on the price. Otherwise, the ability of the working fund to effectively control and account for costs of goods and services is compromised.", "DOD\u2019s comments are printed in appendix II.

For the crude oil cost estimate component, we reviewed the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s methodology for estimating crude oil prices. We discussed the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s methodology with the analyst that prepares the forecasted crude oil prices. We also reviewed the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s use of West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures prices and the historical relationships between those prices and domestic, imported, and composite crude oil prices in making crude oil price forecasts. We concluded that this approach was reasonable. For the cost to refine component, we reviewed the Defense Energy Support Center\u2019s methodology for calculating refined costs. In assessing the Defense Energy Support Center\u2019s methodology, we relied on our previous analysis of its regression equation and a suggested change that was adopted.
