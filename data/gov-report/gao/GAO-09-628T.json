The Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 (IPIA) has increased visibility over improper payments by requiring executive branch agency heads, using guidance from the Office of Management and Budget, to identify programs and activities susceptible to significant improper payments, estimate amounts improperly paid, and report on the amounts of improper payments and their actions to reduce them. This testimony addresses (1) progress made in agencies' implementation of IPIA for fiscal year 2008, and (2) several major challenges that continue to hinder full reporting of IPIA information. GAO was also asked to provide an overview of Medicare and Medicaid programs' implementation of IPIA. This testimony is based primarily on GAO products, Office of Inspector General (OIG) audit reports, and agencies' fiscal year 2008 reported improper payment information, including information reported by the Department of Health and Human Service's (HHS) Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). GAO also analyzed fiscal year 2008 governmentwide improper payment information to identify trends and reviewed Medicare and Medicaid programs' reported actions to identify, estimate, and reduce improper payments."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Agencies reported improper payment estimates of $72 billion for fiscal year 2008, which represented about 4 percent of the $1.8 trillion of reported outlays for the related programs. This represents a significant increase from the fiscal year 2007 estimate attributable to (1) a $12 billion increase in the Medicaid program's estimate and (2) 10 newly reported programs with improper payment estimates totaling about $10 billion. (1) Progress made in estimating and reducing improper payments. The governmentwide improper payment estimates rose about $23 billion from fiscal year 2007 to 2008. This represents a positive step to improve transparency over the full magnitude of the federal government's improper payments. Further, of the 35 agency programs reporting improper payment estimated error rates for each of the 5 fiscal years since implementation of IPIA--2004 through 2008--24 programs (or about 69 percent) reported reduced error rates when comparing fiscal year 2008 error rates to fiscal year 2004 error rates. Also, the number of programs with error rate reductions totaled 35 when comparing fiscal year 2008 error rates to fiscal year 2007 rates. (2) Challenges remain in meeting the goals of IPIA governmentwide. The total improper payment estimate does not yet reflect the full scope of improper payments across executive branch agencies; noncompliance issues with IPIA continue; and agencies continue to face challenges in the design or implementation of internal controls critical to identifying and preventing improper payments. The fiscal year 2008 total improper payment estimate of $72 billion reported for fiscal year 2008 did not include any estimate for ten programs--including the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit program--with fiscal year 2008 outlays totaling about $61 billion that were identified as susceptible to significant improper payments. Over half of the agencies' OIGs identified management or performance challenges that could increase the risk of improper payments, including challenges related to effective internal controls. (3) Medicare and Medicaid programs' implementation of IPIA and its challenges. Medicare and Medicaid comprise 50 percent of reported governmentwide improper payments in fiscal year 2008. HHS reported improper payment amounts of $10.4 billion in Medicare Fee-for-Service and $6.8 billion in Medicare Advantage. HHS also reported in its agency financial report that it issued its first full-year Medicaid improper payment rate estimate of 10.5 percent, or $18.6 billion for the federal share of expenditures for fiscal year 2008. This Medicaid improper payment estimate represents the largest amount that any federal agency reported for a program in fiscal year 2008. While CMS has taken steps to enhance its program integrity efforts, further work remains to put in place the internal controls necessary to effectively identify and detect improper payments. For example, GAO's work on Medicare's home health care administration and enrollment of durable medical equipment suppliers found weaknesses that exposed the program to significant improper payments. The magnitude of Medicaid improper payments indicates that CMS and the states face significant challenges in addressing the program's vulnerabilities in estimating national improper payment rates for diverse state-administered programs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to be here today to discuss the  governmentwide problem of improper payments in federal programs and  activities and executive branch agencies\u2019 efforts to address key  requirements of the Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 (IPIA).  Since fiscal year 2000, we have issued a number of reports and testimonies  aimed at raising the level of attention and corrective actions surrounding  improper payments. Our work over the past several years has  demonstrated that improper payments have been a long-standing,  widespread, and significant problem in the federal government. IPIA has  increased visibility over improper payments by requiring executive  branch agency heads to identify programs and activities susceptible to  significant improper payments, estimate amounts improperly paid un those programs and activities, and report on the amounts of improper  payments and their actions to reduce them. As the steward of taxpayer  dollars, the federal government is accountable for how its agencies an d  grantees spend hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars annually and is  responsible for safeguarding those funds against improper payments as  well as having mechanisms in place to recoup those funds when impro payments occur.", "The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has played a key role in the  oversight of the governmentwide improper payments problem by  providing leadership on financial management improvement initiatives.  OMB continues its commitment to address governmentwide improper  payments by establishing guidance for federal agencies on improper  payment reporting, and by working with agencies to establish corrective  action plans and address their root causes. OMB also reports annually on  agencies\u2019 efforts to address IPIA requirements.", "Today, my testimony will focus on three key areas:    progress federal agencies have made in estimating and reducing  improper payments under IPIA for fiscal year 2008, several major challenges that continue to hinder full reporting of  improper payment information, and  an overview of Medicare and Medicaid programs\u2019 implementation of  IPIA.", "My testimony today draws primarily from prior GAO reports and  testimonies conducted in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards. We also reviewed agencies\u2019 fiscal year 2008  performance and accountability reports (PAR), agency financial reports  (AFR), annual reports, and Office of Inspector General (OIG) audit  reports. In addition, we reviewed the Department of Health and Human  Service\u2019s (HHS) AFR and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services\u2019  (CMS) financial report. Further, we analyzed fiscal year 2008  governmentwide improper payment information to identify trends and  reviewed Medicare and Medicaid programs\u2019 reported actions to identify,  estimate, and reduce improper payments. Generally accepted government  auditing standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Progress Made in Estimating and Reducing Improper Payments", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies reported improper payment estimates of $72 billion for  fiscal year 2008, which represented about 4 percent of the $1.8 trillion of  reported outlays for the related programs and a $23 billion increase from the  fiscal year 2007 estimate of about $49 billion. These efforts represent a  positive step to improve transparency over the full magnitude of federal  improper payments so that appropriate corrective actions can be put in place.  This increase was primarily attributable to (1) a $12 billion increase in the  Medicaid program\u2019s estimate for its Fee-for-Service and managed care  payments and payments related to incorrect eligibility determinations; and (2)  10 newly reported programs with improper payment estimates totaling about  $10 billion. Of these 10 programs, we identified 4 that had been required by  OMB to report selected improper payment information beginning with fiscal  year 2003 budget submissions prior to the passage of IPIA. In total, these 4  programs represented $3.1 billion, or 31 percent, of the approximately $10  billion in newly reported programs. Further, we noted that agencies  consistently identified new programs or activities as risk-susceptible after the  first year of IPIA implementation:  fiscal year 2005\u201417 new programs or activities,  fiscal year 2006\u201415 new programs or activities,  fiscal year 2007\u201419 new programs or activities, and  fiscal year 2008\u201410 new programs or activities.", "The $72 billion estimate of improper payments federal agencies reported  in fiscal year 2008 encompasses 78 programs spread among 22 agencies  (see app. I for further details) and represents about 2.4 percent of total  fiscal year 2008 federal executive branch outlays of nearly $3 trillion. In  addition, the majority of the $72 billion of reported improper payments in  fiscal year 2008 is accounted for by ten programs, as shown in figure 1.  Specifically, the ten programs account for about $63 billion or  approximately 88 percent of the total estimate.", "Seven of the 10 programs with the largest improper payment estimates are  either means-tested programs, state-administered programs, or both. A  common control used by these programs to ensure payment accuracy  includes verifying the financial eligibility of the applicant. However, our  previous work has shown that the financial eligibility of an applicant can  be difficult to verify in means-tested programs, increasing the risk of  payment to an ineligible recipient. Specifically, there are differences  related to detailed aspects of the income rules such as whose income in a  household is counted and the types of income included or excluded in  either whole or part. For example, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance  Program (previously Food Stamp Program) considers the income of the  entire household, including children aged 18 and over who are not  students, in calculating income; whereas several other programs either do  not include children\u2019s income or exclude portions of their income from  consideration. Similar differences exist in state-administered programs as  a number of states define additional and unique eligibility requirements  beyond what is required at the federal level. Collectively, these multiple  variations in approaches to identifying recipients\u2019 income for determining  program eligibility are likely contributing factors to the high dollar value of  improper payments that exist within these programs.", "Federal agencies continued to report progress in reducing improper  payments in their programs and activities. Of the 35 agency programs  reporting improper payment estimated error rates for each of the 5 fiscal  years\u20142004 through 2008\u201424 programs, or about 69 percent had reduced  error rates when comparing fiscal year 2008 error rates to the initial error  rates reported for fiscal year 2004.

Labor reported that the leading cause of UI overpayments  resulted from claimants who returned to work, yet continued to claim UI  benefits. Early detection of these overpayments allows agencies to stop  payments sooner and to recover these overpayments more expeditiously.  Labor reported that matching Social Security numbers of UI claimants  with the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 National Directory of  New Hires database is the most effective tool to identify UI program  improper payments and had prevented about $93 million of UI  overpayments during fiscal year 2008."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Challenges Remain in Meeting IPIA", "paragraphs": ["While federal agencies have shown progress, major challenges remain in  meeting the goals of IPIA and ultimately provide reasonable assurance as  to the integrity of payments.

Not all agencies have yet developed improper payment  estimates for all of the programs and activities they identified as  susceptible to significant improper payments. As shown in table 1, the  fiscal year 2008 total improper payment estimate of $72 billion did not  include any amounts for 10 risk-susceptible programs\u2014including the  Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit program\u2014with fiscal year 2008  outlays totaling about $61 billion.", "For fiscal year 2008, a limited number of agency auditors reported on IPIA  implementation compliance issues as part of their financial statement  audit, although such reporting is not specifically required by IPIA.  Specifically, auditors for 4 of the 35 agencies included in our scope  reported on agencies\u2019 noncompliance with IPIA. Agency auditors  reported noncompliance issues related to risk assessments, testing of  payment transactions, development of corrective action plans to reduce  improper payments, recovering improper payments, and inadequate  documentation. Fiscal year 2008 reflected the fifth year that auditors for  the Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Homeland  Security (DHS) reported IPIA noncompliance issues, including not  estimating for all risk-susceptible programs, deficiencies related to testing  of payment transactions, and the lack of corrective action plans. Agency  auditors at the Department of Transportation (Transportation) and DOD  reported noncompliance with IPIA for a third year. For example,  Transportation auditors reported that they had not received sufficient  documentation by the time of PAR issuance to determine if the  department\u2019s sampling plan used to estimate improper payments was  statistically valid. The auditors for DOD reported for fiscal year 2008, that  the department was still in the process of developing procedures to  identify improper payments and that its efforts to manage recovery audit  contracts had been largely unsuccessful.", "As we previously testified before this Subcommittee, separate  assessments conducted by agency auditors provided a valuable  independent validation of agencies\u2019 efforts to implement IPIA.  Independent assessments can also enhance an agency\u2019s ability to identify  sound performance measures, monitor progress against those measures,  and help establish performance and results expectations. Without this type  of validation or other types of reviews performed by GAO and agency  OIGs, it is difficult to reliably determine the full magnitude of deficiencies  that may exist in agencies\u2019 IPIA implementation efforts.", "Agencies continue to face challenges in the design or implementation of  internal controls to identify and prevent improper payments.

Specifically, the Education OIG  cited control issues related to insufficient numbers of personnel with  the necessary skills and ineffective oversight and monitoring of its  programs and participants, placing billions of taxpayer dollars at risk of  waste, fraud, abuse, and noncompliance.", "Department of the Treasury\u2014The OIG cited erroneous and improper  payments as the sixth top management challenge facing the Internal  Revenue Service (IRS). According to the OIG, erroneous and improper  and payments generally involve improperly paid refunds, tax return  filing fraud, or overpayments to vendors or contractors. The Treasury  OIG also reported some tax credits, such as the Earned Income Tax  Credit (EITC) and the Education Credit, provide opportunities for  abuse in income tax claims. The IRS receives a substantial number of  excessive or incorrect EITC claims. According to the OIG, the  exponential growth in fraud in processing year 2007 presented a  challenge for the IRS, which did not have the resources to handle the  volume. The OIG noted that if this trend continues over the next few  years, the IRS might issue an even greater number of improper refunds,  possibly resulting in a significantly increasing annual revenue loss to  the federal government."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Implementation of IPIA in Medicare and Medicaid Programs", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) annually reports on  improper payments in its Agency Financial Report (AFR).

CMS has a long-history of estimating  improper payments for its Medicare FFS program that predate IPIA.  Beginning in 1996, HHS\u2019s Office of Inspector General (OIG) estimated  improper payments in the Medicare FFS program as part of its annual  financial statement audit. In fiscal year 2003, CMS assumed responsibility  for estimating Medicare FFS improper payments and modified the  methodology to improve error detection and provide more detailed  information on the errors. This coincided with the implementation of the  IPIA. For fiscal year 2008, Medicare FFS improper payment estimate  totaled $10.4 billion, or 3.6 percent of benefit payments for the prior year.  As part of its testing, CMS reported it determined whether the claim  payments complied with Medicare coverage, coding, and billing rules.

Fiscal year 2008 marks the first year that CMS reported estimated  improper payments for Medicare Advantage, with an error rate of 10.6  percent or $6.8 billion in estimated improper payments. While HHS\u2019s AFR  states that medical record reviews were performed, they did not  specifically identify the types of attributes tested to identify the improper  payments. The causes of improper payments cited were errors in  transferring data, interpretation of data, payment calculations, and  incorrect diagnoses resulting in incorrect beneficiary risk scores.", "Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit is an outpatient prescription drug  benefit for Medicare beneficiaries who opt to enroll.

Although it was required by OMB to report improper payment information  beginning with its fiscal year 2003 budget submission, CMS began  reporting estimated improper payments for this program in fiscal year  2007. For fiscal year 2008, CMS estimated improper payments for fee-for- service providers, managed care plans, and for ineligible recipients\u2014and  reported an error rate of 10.5 percent or $18.6 billion as the federal share  of these improper payments. Among all federal programs reporting in  fiscal year 2008, Medicaid had the highest estimated dollar value of  reported improper payments. (See figure 1.) To estimate improper  payments for the Medicaid program, CMS developed a multi-faceted  strategy that included obtaining claim payment data from the 50 states and  the District of Columbia, utilizing a three-year state rotation cycle. Using  this methodology, CMS selects 17 states each year to generate and report a  national improper payment estimate for Medicaid. CMS reported that the  most common causes of Medicaid improper payments resulting from its  medical and data processing reviews included insufficient or lack of  documentation (which accounted for 90 percent of the errors), pricing  errors, and non-covered services. As reported in the fiscal year 2008 AFR,  HHS expressed the view that the high percentage of errors related to  insufficient documentation follows a trend similar to the early years of the  Medicare FFS error rate measurement program. From its eligibility  reviews, HHS reported that based on an informal survey of states,  caseworker errors and a lack of internal controls were the causes for the  errors in eligibility determinations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Management Challenges in Meeting IPIA Requirements", "paragraphs": ["While CMS has made efforts to estimate improper payments, challenges  remain to design and implement internal controls to effectively prevent  improper payments and to address fraud, waste, and abuse. Since 1990  and 2003, respectively, we have designated Medicare and Medicaid as high  risk and included them on our High-Risk list. These programs were  designated as high risk in part due to the high level of estimated improper  payments and growing concerns about the quality of fiscal oversight,  which is necessary to prevent inappropriate spending. Although the  Medicare FFS payment error rate has decreased in recent years, HHS OIG  raised concerns that the error rates for certain provider types may be  understated based on its review of additional medical records and  interviews with beneficiaries and providers. CMS has taken steps to  enhance its program integrity efforts, but further work remains to put in  place the controls necessary to effectively identify and detect improper  payments. Our recent work in Medicare continues to identify fraudulent  and abusive practices within the program. For example, our review of  Medicare\u2019s spending on home health care found that home health  agencies\u2019 practice of upcoding (overstating the severity of a beneficiary\u2019s  condition), providing kickbacks, and billing for services not rendered  contributed to Medicare\u2019s home health spending and utilization. We  reported that inadequate administration of the Medicare home health  benefit left the program vulnerable to improper payments. Likewise, our  review of enrollment of Medicare\u2019s durable medical equipment suppliers  found weaknesses in Medicare\u2019s screening process that exposed the  program to potentially paying millions of dollars for medical equipment  and supplies that were not necessary or were not provided to  beneficiaries.", "Similarly, challenges exist for the Medicaid program. In fiscal year 2008,  the HHS OIG reported that the shared oversight and enforcement activities  between multiple federal and state entities create significant challenges to  program oversight and integrity. The HHS OIG also reported that CMS\u2019s  efforts to identify payment errors, their causes, and vulnerabilities in  Medicaid is particularly challenging because of the diversity of state  programs and the variation in their administrative and control systems.", "These findings are consistent with our prior work on federal and state  coordination to estimate improper payments for state-administered  programs, like Medicaid. Specifically, in April 2006, we reported that  communication, coordination, and cooperation among federal agencies  and the states are critical factors in estimating national improper payment  rates and meeting IPIA reporting requirements for state-administered  programs. Further, putting in place a culture of accountability over  improper payments and transparency of the issue helps to reduce fraud  and address the wasteful spending that results from lapses in controls. As  we previously reported, measuring improper payments within the  Medicaid program is critical to recouping and reducing them. The  magnitude of the program\u2019s payment errors indicates that CMS and the  states face significant challenges to address the program\u2019s vulnerabilities.

Nonetheless,  effectively identifying improper payments and designing and implementing  actions to reduce them are not simple tasks or easily accomplished.  Consequently, agencies\u2019 efforts to fulfill the requirements of IPIA will  require sustained top-level attention and commitment.
