From 1941 to 1945, banks were regulated and supervised by two committees: the Standing Committee of Banks, consisting of six bankers and a government representative charged with enacting regulation and taking supervisory measures concerning individual institutions, and the Bank Control Commission, which was responsible for enforcing bank regulations. A banking act passed in 1945 replaced the Standing Committee with the Conseil National de Cr\u00e9dit\u2014National Credit Council (CNC)\u2014with the regulatory responsibilities remaining the same. The Minister of Economics, Finance and Budget chaired CNC, but CNC was staffed by the Bank of France.", "Other categories of financial institutions, such as finance companies, savings banks, or mutual and cooperative banks, were regulated and supervised separately according to special law\u2014in most cases either directly or indirectly by the Treasury Department (Treasury). According to French officials, Treasury is the most influential Department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, then known as the Ministry of Economics, Finance and Budget.", "According to Commission Bancaire (CB), the Banking Commission, officials, by 1984 banks were widely considered to be at a competitive disadvantage compared to other financial institutions as a result of the split in regulatory responsibilities. While prudential regulations for banks had evolved with changes in financial markets, laws and regulations governing institutions such as mutual banks or savings banks remained less stringent. At the same time, these other institutions were expanding their activities, thereby becoming direct and strong competitors of the banks."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The French Banking Act of 1984", "paragraphs": ["The French Banking Act of 1984 (1984 Act) was intended to settle these regulatory inequities by placing all financial institutions deemed to conduct broadly defined banking activities under the same legal framework. In addition, it aimed to resolve the sometimes overlapping responsibilities of CNC and the Bank Control Commission by separating bank regulation and supervision into three distinct areas\u2014authorization, regulation, and supervision\u2014and giving jurisdiction over each of these areas to three separate committees. Thus three new committees were created: (1) the Comit\u00e9 des \u00c9tablissements de Cr\u00e9dit, the Credit Institutions Committee (CEC), was given authority over authorization; (2) the Comit\u00e9 de la R\u00e9glementation Bancaire, the Bank Regulatory Committee (CRB), received jurisdiction over most regulatory issues; and (3) CB was made responsible for bank supervision, replacing the Bank Control Commission. The CNC was not eliminated but its authority was reduced to a purely advisory one.", "The act also strengthened some supervisory weaknesses of the old Bank Control Commission by giving CB broader powers and a wider scope of authority. First, CB was given authority for supervision of all credit institutions. Second, its powers were broadened by mandating that it scrutinize credit institutions\u2019 operations and monitor their financial standing as well as supervise their compliance with regulations. Finally, it was given the authority to inspect (1) bank subsidiaries, (2) the legal bodies directly owning or controlling the bank and their subsidiaries, and (3) overseas branches and subsidiaries of French banks. This increased authority allowed CB to find and address perceived problems in credit institutions as a whole.", "French credit institutions are regulated and supervised almost exclusively to ensure the safety and soundness of individual banks and of the system as a whole. For example, French banking law does not directly address such issues as fair lending practices or community reinvestment requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Banks Experienced Two Waves of Nationalizations as Well as Financial Market Liberalization", "paragraphs": ["The French banking industry experienced some major changes in the post-war era including two waves of nationalizations in which the ownership of most banks was transferred to the French government. The first period of nationalization occurred shortly after the end of the Second World War in 1945. It was intended to prop up the ailing banking industry and to give the French government the power to direct credit to the industries that needed it in order to revive the post-war economy.", "At the same time, the Bank of France, which had been established in 1800 as a private bank at the instigation of Napoleon Bonaparte and, beginning in 1803, was granted the right to issue banknotes, was also nationalized. The Nationalization Act of 1945 transferred the Bank of France\u2019s capital to the State effective on January 1, 1946, and reimbursed the Bank\u2019s previous shareholders with 20-year bonds.", "With the exception of the Bank of France, the banks nationalized in 1945 were gradually privatized by the end of the 1970s under conservative French governments. The second wave of nationalizations occurred in 1982 through 1983 after the election of a Socialist president and a Socialist Assembl\u00e9e Nationale, National Assembly, in 1981. This return of bank ownership to the government was justified by the ruling party as a part of its political program to promote the financing of small- and medium-sized businesses and a stronger industrial policy. These nationalizations were followed by a privatization program implemented by a Conservative government in 1986, which stalled for several years after the election of another Socialist government in 1988. In recent years, however, the election of a Conservative National Assembly has once more prompted a series of privatizations, and the vast majority of French banks are now in private hands. To date, Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais, the country\u2019s largest bank, remains the only large nationalized bank, although there are also a handful of smaller nationalized banks. There are plans that these remaining nationalized banks be privatized within the next five years since both the Socialist and Conservative parties now agree that having nationalized banks conflicts with the premise of a free market that is one of the cornerstones of the EU. For example, Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais\u2014which lost Fr.fr. 6.9 billion in 1993, principally as a result of poor commercial and real estate investments\u2014benefited from a Fr.fr. 4.9 billion bailout in July 1994, raising questions about the role the government plays as the owner of the largest French bank and the effect that has on competition in the French banking industry.", "The 1980s also brought an extensive liberalization of restrictions on some banking and securities activities. Credit restrictions\u2014credit ceilings and interest rate controls\u2014were completely removed by 1987. Foreign exchange controls were eliminated in 1989. Deposit interest rates have been decontrolled, although paying interest on demand deposits held by residents is prohibited by French law to allow banks to maintain free checking services. Securities commissions and fees were also deregulated and new markets, such as the March\u00e9 \u00e0 Terme International de France (MATIF)\u2014the French financial futures market\u2014and the short- and medium-term notes markets, have been organized.", "Overlaying these events has been the development of a unified financial services market in the EU, which has also affected French bank regulation and supervision. Central to the liberalization of financial services under the EU\u2019s Single Market Program is the concept of a \u201csingle passport,\u201d a concept which the French have been influential in helping to develop. Once a financial firm is established and licensed in one EU member country\u2014its home country\u2014that firm can use a single passport to offer financial services in any other EU member state\u2014its host country. Underlying the single market program is an understanding that a minimum level of harmonization in regulation is necessary among the member countries to ensure the safety and soundness of the financial system. For instance, the EU Second Banking Directive requires all EU banks to have a minimum capital base and a minimum level of shareholder disclosure and limits equity participation in nonfinancial firms. Consequently, EU member countries have had to change their banking laws and regulations as necessary to meet the minimum requirements imposed by EU financial services directives. To date, EU directives have not resulted in major changes to the structure of bank regulation and supervision in France.", "The recent independence of the Bank of France is, however, a result of an EU mandate in the Treaty on European Union that all EU member countries have independent central banks. As a result of this mandate, the purpose and structure of the Bank of France were redefined in the 1993 Act on the Status of the Banque de France and the Activities and Supervision of Credit Institutions (the 1993 Act). This act made the Bank of France independent of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in formulating and implementing monetary policy. As a result, the Bank of France \u201cshall neither seek nor accept instructions from the Government or any other person in the performance of its duties\u201d with respect to monetary policy.

In either case, CB is responsible for the supervision of the parent bank and the consolidated entity.

If an insurance company owns a bank, then CCA supervises the consolidated entity, but CB supervises the bank subsidiary.", "According to CB officials, coordination and cooperation between supervisory authorities have grown steadily stronger in recent years in response to the development of financial conglomerates and the increasingly global nature of financial activities. In 1992, for example, secrecy restrictions were lifted between CB and CCA. As a result, periodic meetings now take place between CB and CCA to (1) discuss the situation of individual institutions or financial groups of concern to both authorities, (2) exchange views on problems of common general interest, such as the supervision of financial conglomerates and the transposition of EU directives, and (3) promote mutual understanding of risk evaluation methods and supervisory techniques.", "In addition, the regulators of all financial institutions and markets meet as a group three or four times a year at the Treasury, according to Treasury, CB, and Bank of France officials, to exchange information on the institutions for which they are primarily responsible and on financial markets in general.

Thus membership in the three regulatory and supervisory committees includes the Bank of France, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, representatives of the credit institution industry, and various outside experts. This structure allows for decisions to be based on a broad range of knowledge and experience and acknowledges different points of view. It also takes into consideration the perceived imperative that both the central bank and the government be involved in bank regulation and supervision. The central bank is involved because of its role in financial markets and in developing monetary policy, and the government because of the nationalized sector of the banking industry and the government\u2019s role as a potential financial resource if a large bank were to fail.", "Since the committees have distinct legal powers, they are able to behave independently of the institutions their members represent and thus allow the Ministry and the Bank of France to distance themselves from committee decisions, to a certain degree, if they so desire.

Such a split was intended to (1) avoid giving too much authority to one entity, particularly since the supervisor has very strong enforcement authority, and (2) ensure independent decisionmaking so that conflicts between initial regulatory decisions and future enforcement actions were less likely to arise. For example, if omissions in the licensing process allowed an institution to get into trouble, the supervisor might be less willing to take enforcement actions against the institution for fear of having to acknowledge its own regulatory mistakes.", "While the separation of enforcement and other regulatory actions only necessitated two committees, the regulatory functions were split into two committees, for a total of three, to allow the Bank of France and the Ministry of Economic Affairs to each chair one of the two committees."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "CEC Authorizes Banks", "paragraphs": ["CEC is responsible for authorizing and licensing credit institutions to undertake banking operations. Thus, any bank or credit institution must receive permission from CEC to operate.

For example, it must approve any changes in controlling ownership interest and the crossing of ownership thresholds\u2014purchases of shares that increase ownership to 10, 20, or 33.3 percent. It must also be kept informed of any management changes and may disapprove such changes. In addition, it must approve modifications to the institution\u2019s legal form, business name, location of head office, scope of activities, and branch networks within the European Union (EU). Finally, CEC may grant exemptions provided for in law and regulations to individual institutions.", "In authorizing a bank, CEC is to assess several criteria. First, it must judge whether an institution qualifies for a banking license or whether its license should be limited to that of another type of credit institution. This is a very important part of CEC\u2019s work, since a banking license carries more prestige than a license for a more specialized institution and, consequently, many institutions that do not intend to take deposits and grant loans\u2014one of the principal requisites of a banking license\u2014apply for a banking license. In addition, CEC must ensure that the applying institution meets the minimum required capital standard. Particularly in the case of banks, CEC usually requires start-up capital higher than the minimum requirement because new credit institutions generally lose money in their first year of operation, according to Bank of France officials, and CEC is responsible for ensuring that minimum capital standards are still being met at the end of the first year of business. According to Bank of France officials with whom we spoke, CEC also checks that at least two individuals are responsible for \u201cthe effective direction\u201d of the institution, and that they have \u201cthe necessary integrity and adequate experience for their duties.\u201d", "CEC must also assess the institution\u2019s business program, its technical and financial resources, and the suitability of the individuals investing capital in the institutions and their guarantors, where applicable. If CEC decides that the main shareholder of a proposed bank is not satisfactory, either in terms of experience or financial resources, its policy is to ask that the bank obtain a shareholder who is among the world\u2019s 500 largest banking institutions and operates in France. The bank shareholder must have a seat on the applicant bank\u2019s board and must participate actively in the management of the bank. This is intended to ensure that the applicant bank benefits from the shareholder bank\u2019s experience in the French market as well as from its financial resources, if necessary. CEC requests to banks that they obtain French bank shareholders are made quite frequently, according to Bank of France officials, particularly when the applicant bank is not among the world\u2019s largest 500 banks. When a bank does not have a controlling shareholder, the larger shareholders must sign a written agreement that guarantees their cohesion and their actions should additional financial resources be necessary for the bank. In 1993, CEC authorized 53 new credit institutions.", "In 1993, CEC reviewed approximately 600 total applications, about one-quarter of which concerned credit institutions surrendering their authorizations. A growing proportion of the other applications was made under the provisions of the Second European Banking Coordination Directive dealing with the freedom of EU member banks to provide services anywhere in the EU. In 1993 and 1994, CEC received a total of 22 applications from French credit institutions to open branches in EU countries. Such applications must be approved by CEC before the French institution may open the branch. By EU agreement, once the home country authority\u2014CEC in this case\u2014gives its approval, the host country in which the French bank is expanding has no authority to disapprove the establishment of the branch. In the same time period, CEC also received 149 declarations from French credit institutions that intended to provide cross-border services in other EU countries. The provision of cross-border services does not require CEC approval, although CEC sometimes deems that the services being proposed require a branch, in which case it will request that the bank proposing those services apply to establish a branch. Finally in 1993 and 1994, CEC received 64 notifications from non-French EU banks that they wanted to provide cross-border services in France, and 17 notifications from EU banks that they had received permission from their home country authorities to establish branches in France.", "CEC meets approximately once a month but can be called into session more often when necessary.

The Chairman of the committee does not significantly influence the outcome of the discussions, and unless there is a tie vote, in which case his vote counts double, his vote is no more significant than those of the other five members. However, because CEC staff are all from the Bank of France, and because they present the issues for discussion, prepare the files upon which committee members rely for information and propose specific actions, the Bank of France position on the cases presented does carry significant weight. Nevertheless, the committee sometimes votes contrary to the course of action proposed by the staff, albeit infrequently, according to Bank of France officials with whom we spoke.", "The Minister of Economic Affairs\u2014or his representative\u2014enjoys a unique right not given to the other committee members, namely to ask for adjournment of the committee.

Regardless of who initially drafts and is responsible for the technical work on a regulation, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Bank of France are in close contact before a regulation is proposed and are almost always in agreement on a text before it is sent forward to CRB, according to Bank of France staff. The process for obtaining agreement between the Treasury and the Bank of France is not always an easy one, however, according to CRB and CB staff, primarily because of differences in points of view.", "The other committee members are also consulted before any measure is brought to CRB for its approval because, according to Treasury staff, it is not sufficient to have Ministry and Bank of France approval to get a regulation through CRB. The other committee members must agree with any proposal since they have four of six votes. Finally, CRB and other agency staff involved in the drafting process have created working groups as well as an informal consultative process involving the banking community, the associations that represent banks, and other interested parties such as accounting and law firms. This consultative process between the bank regulators and the industry is viewed by the Association of French Credit Institutions (AFEC) and AFB as one of their primary responsibilities and helps promote cooperation between the regulators and the regulated. However, extensive consultations do not always mean that there is full agreement on proposed regulations by the regulated or other interested parties.", "As a result of the external and internal consultative process, agreement on proposed regulations is usually unanimous among the six CRB members, according to CRB and Treasury staff. Nevertheless, there are occasions when there are serious discussions among the members of CRB, particularly between the Treasury and the Bank of France. Amendments are sometimes made to a proposed regulation as it is being considered by CRB\u2014word changes to address legal uncertainties, for example\u2014but if a regulation is formally proposed to the committee, it generally is passed.", "All regulations proposed by CRB must be stamped and signed into force by the Minister of Economic Affairs, not as Chairman of the CRB, but by virtue of his position as Minister of Economic Affairs. Thus, the Minister has veto power over any regulations proposed through CRB.

As part of this duty, it will issue clarifications and further details on specific regulations that, according to CB officials, credit institutions would regard as seriously as a regulation\u2014even though these clarifications do not have the force of law. Such clarifications are generally of a relatively minor nature, however, since the responsibility for the interpretation of law lies with CRB and the Minister, according to Bank of France officials with whom we spoke.", "There is another agency in France that contributes to the drafting and clarification of banking regulations that specifically address accounting issues.

Its membership of approximately 100 is made up of representatives of the accounting profession, private industry, and government agencies. Its purpose with respect to bank accounting regulations is twofold. First, it is to comment on proposed regulations when asked for its opinion by CRB. Second, and perhaps more significantly, it is to publish its opinion on how accounting standards should be implemented. These opinions are generally used as precedents by courts of law and CNCC, the accounting profession\u2019s association, recommends that its members apply CNC opinions when auditing banks as well as other organizations.

CB officials have described this regulation as one of the most important that it enforces. The regulation requires that bank internal audit systems must be able to ensure an adequate audit trail with respect to information that is contained in published accounts. This audit trail must make it possible to (1) reconstruct operations in a chronological order, (2) support all information with original documents, and (3) account for the movement in balances from one statement to the next. Institutions are also required, at least once a year, to provide CB with a report on how internal auditing is carried out.

Because CB has the ability to take very strong enforcement actions\u2014including replacing bank management or withdrawing a bank\u2019s authorization\u2014credit institutions fully understand that if they do not comply with less forceful actions, such as warnings, they will be subject to stronger actions that will follow. As a result, CB does not have to resort to forceful actions frequently since warnings\u2014both official and unofficial\u2014and injunctions are generally respected by banks.", "Official warnings have been issued at the rate of about 50 a year and are meant to formally bring a CB concern to an institution\u2019s attention without penalizing the institution, and they usually follow at least one, often more, unofficial warnings, according to CB staff. If, for example, an institution is contravening sound banking practices, CB may, after giving management an opportunity to explain the situation, issue an official warning. It can request an institution to increase its provisioning against doubtful loans or to match its funds more closely to lending. CB may also issue a warning if it finds a breach of the industry\u2019s rules of good conduct, something which it has done only once in the last 3 years, although it has issued more unofficial warnings. If an unofficial or official warning is heeded, no further action is taken or sanction imposed by CB.", "If a warning is not heeded, CB can enjoin an institution to take all necessary measures to resolve financial or management problems by a specific deadline. According to CB, this type of injunction is used quite frequently. In the last 3 years, CB has issued 63 injunctions that ordered institutions to (1) transmit periodic documents to CB on time, provide more information on share ownership, strengthen their financial structure, and appoint a second responsible manager, as required under law; (2) institute efficient internal control systems; (3) comply with the rules on risk distribution; (4) provision adequately for losses; (5) amend management methods; and (6) strengthen liquidity ratios.", "Finally, CB may sanction an institution when it has disregarded an injunction or warning, or has contravened a law or regulation.

In addition, CB has the power to impose fines. In the past 3 years, CB has appointed acting managers 23 times and has initiated disciplinary proceedings 36 times.

All credit institutions are to receive a routine inspection at some time, according to Bank of France and CB staff. The timing of such an inspection depends on a number of factors. On average, Bank of France officials said banks will be inspected more frequently than other credit institutions, partially because they are involved in riskier and more extensive activities and partially because many other credit institutions are inspected by their central organizations, as discussed above. Finally, inspection rates depend on the individual institution. Based on information gathered through BAFI or market sources, institutions may be inspected more frequently\u2014up to twice a year\u2014if they are perceived to have financial difficulties; to be expanding into unfamiliar or more risky activities; or to be heavily involved in activities that may be experiencing a market downturn, such as real estate in the past several years.", "According to Bank of France policy, the primary purpose of on-site inspections is to assess the soundness of a bank\u2014to judge its ability to conduct its business without a deterioration in its liquidity, solvency, and profitability. A routine inspection, therefore, is to cover all elements of an institution\u2019s activities including organization, management, internal controls, capital, assets, earnings, and liquidity. Specific areas of a bank\u2019s activities that are to be inspected include the bank\u2019s market activities, electronic data processing (EDP), technology, derivatives activities, mergers and acquisitions, mutual funds, and leasing, among others.

With respect to management quality, inspectors are to assess the results of management strategies and the extent to which management is informed about the bank\u2019s activities. The inspection is to include an assessment of the kind of information management receives\u2014whether it is accurate and concise\u2014and whether management reacts quickly to the information it has. Because the quality of information managers are provided with depends, to a large extent, on the efficiency of the institution\u2019s internal controls, inspectors also are to test internal control procedures.

CB is currently in the process of developing a new methodology for testing EDP for use by Bank of France inspectors.", "An important by-product of an inspection is the checking of the accuracy of the institution\u2019s BAFI reports. Both CB and the Bank of France stressed the significance of these checks since CB relies very heavily on BAFI information in its permanent oversight. Generally, the testing finds that banks submit accurate information, but if a bank is found to be submitting inaccurate information, there is no question that it will be disciplined, according to CB staff.", "During an inspection, inspectors may examine bank subsidiaries\u2014including subsidiaries located in other European Union (EU) countries. How often such subsidiaries are inspected depends on their significance to the institution as a whole\u2014whether they significantly contribute to profits, asset size, or risks. If they do, then they are generally inspected with the parent company, according to Bank of France and CB officials with whom we spoke.", "During an inspection, the facts relevant to the inspection are to be discussed with the institution\u2019s department heads in order to get their agreement on those facts, and the inspection team then writes a draft report.

After a short time\u20142 to 7 days\u2014the inspector is to return to discuss the report with management but is only to change the report if the facts upon which he based his judgments were wrong, or if the bank\u2019s situation has changed since the draft was written\u2014for example, if a unit that was in trouble was sold. The president of the institution gets the final inspection report, which is confidential. CB is to use this report and any other information it has\u2014including information on the general economy or the situation of the banking industry\u2014to send a follow-up letter to the institution telling it what CB expects it to do in response to issues raised in the inspection. This letter is then to be followed up with meetings, additional correspondence, and monitoring of BAFI information to ensure that the institution is taking the recommended actions, according to CB staff.", "Depending on the size of the institution, an inspection could be from 2 months in length with an inspection staff of 2 to 4 for a medium-sized bank, to 4 to 6 months with an inspection staff of 4 to 8 for a larger bank.If a bank has significant credit activities, it requires a larger inspection staff to examine credit files than if it has extensive market operations. No inspectors are located full-time in any bank or other credit institution.", "If a bank is believed to have a problem based on the examination of reports available to CB, a specific inspection is to be conducted by the Bank of France that focuses on the area of the bank believed to have problems. If, for example, a bank\u2019s loan portfolio is thought to be weak, inspectors are to examine the bank\u2019s procedures for granting the loans and its loan administration. They are to also inspect the measures that were taken after a loan was determined to be in trouble, the provisioning taken against the loan, and the operations of the problem loan unit. In addition, they are to review the bank\u2019s management and its internal controls in order to assess the criteria for decisionmaking. Finally, they are to inspect the bank\u2019s loan portfolio, particularly its larger loans, to assess the amount of residual risk. Examinations of banks with problems may occur as often as twice a year.", "The inspectors of the Bank of France may also conduct thematic inspections. In these inspections, the inspectors are to examine a specific area of business or operation\u2014such as derivatives activities, property risks, or the organization of internal auditing. Such inspections would be done across a sample of all institutions if the issue, such as internal controls, were relevant to them all; or across a sample of larger banks in areas such as derivatives activities.

The French deposit protection mechanism does not protect deposits in foreign currencies or interbank deposits. Consequently, French banks were requested by the Bank of France to provide over Fr.fr. 200 million in assistance to Al Saudi, and those who were creditors of Al Saudi were asked to forgive that debt.Because the primary goal of the rescue was to protect the reputation of French markets, foreign depositors and creditors of Al Saudi were completely paid off, while French depositors and creditors were only partially compensated under the terms of the rescue.", "The Bank of France has no specific criteria for using Section 52, preferring some uncertainty about whether a bank will be rescued and how much creditors might lose if a bank fails as a means of encouraging investors to use good judgment in investing their funds.

The amount of the assistance that he requests of stockholders or banks, for example, is completely up to his discretion, as is the extent to which depositors and other creditors are reimbursed under any rescue.", "The Bank of France is able to act in financial crises because it has access to information about individual institutions through its role in the bank regulatory and supervisory structure and in the financial markets."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Payments Clearance", "paragraphs": ["The Bank of France plays a major role in payments clearance, primarily because of its legal responsibility to ensure \u201cthe smooth operation and security of payment systems.\u201d It also has a significant amount of influence over the players in payments clearance since the 1984 Act restricts the right to issue and administer payment media to credit institutions, which the Bank of France helps regulate and supervise.", "The Bank of France is in charge of managing all 102 provincial clearing houses, the computer clearing centers, the interbank teleclearing system accounting system, the regional check record exchange centers, and SAGITTAIRE (automated system for the integrated handling and settlement of foreign transactions by means of telecommunication). It also acts as settlement agent for the members of those systems. In 1992, over 3.7 billion items were presented in the clearing houses, representing a total value of Fr.fr. 55,192 billion. In addition, about 3.3 billion messages representing Fr.fr. 59,219 billion were processed by SAGITTAIRE.", "There is no statutory supervision or regulation of the payment systems operating in France, over and above the supervision of credit institutions undertaken by CB and the general task of oversight of the payment system vested in the Bank of France by its statutes. The regulations on interbank payment and settlement systems have been developed by interbank consultative and standardization groups in which the Bank of France is represented and where its views are given great weight due to its role as central bank and banker of the Treasury.

For example, in 1993, the Bank of France asked some of the larger banks in France to provide lower-rate overnight loans to another large bank that had large liquidity needs but could not afford the high rates that had resulted from government intervention in the currency markets. Such requests for assistance have been made infrequently; however, and the Governor is only to ask banks for assistance if he is confident that they will accede to the request, according to Bank of France staff, since the Governor has no legal authority to enforce his requests.

Although there is no legal requirement that banks join the Mechanism, there is a provision in the 1984 Act that requires all credit institutions to belong to an association or body that is affiliated with AFEC, the umbrella organization for French credit institutions. The AFB is that association for banks, and membership in the Mechanism is a requirement for AFB members. As of July 1, 1995, when the EU deposit insurance directive took effect, all EU banks were required to belong to the deposit protection schemes of their home countries. Consequently, branches of non-French EU member banks are not required to belong to the Mechanism, but all French banks and non-EU banks are legally required to belong, according to AFB officials with whom we spoke.", "The Mechanism is not a deposit insurance system in which banks pay premiums into a fund that is then used to cover insured deposits in failed institutions. Instead, after a member bank fails, the full membership of the Mechanism provides the funds as needed to cover the protected deposits in the failed bank. A determination of the level of funding needed and the burden sharing among the Mechanism\u2019s members is determined by AFB staff. Until recently, the amount each bank was assessed to address a bank failure was based purely on the bank\u2019s deposit size. As a result of complaints by larger banks who argued that they paid the most when a bank failed but were unlikely to fail themselves, the assessment system was changed. Now, only half of the agreed upon payment is based on deposit size. The other half is a per bank distribution divided evenly among the Mechanism\u2019s membership, affecting small banks\u2014and foreign banks who often have very low French franc deposits\u2014in the same manner as large banks.", "French franc deposits, and since the beginning of 1994, EU currencies and European currency unit deposits, in failed banks are protected up to Fr.fr. 400,000 per capita.

However, since the unused funds of the previous 2 years plus the funds of the following 2 years may be used in any 1 year, the actual ceiling for bank failures in any 1 year is Fr.fr. 1 billion. Even this limit is fairly small compared to the size of France\u2019s largest banks and indicates that the Mechanism was meant to cover small banks. If a large bank were to fail, the Bank of France, using Section 52 of the 1984 Act, or the French government would have to determine what action to take.", "Since the Mechanism was established on January 18, 1990, 10 banks have failed, costing the Mechanism\u2019s membership a total of about Fr.fr. 450 billion."], "subsections": []}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
