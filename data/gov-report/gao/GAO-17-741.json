Veterans can use information on this website to compare the performance of VA medical centers (VAMC) and non-VA hospitals on a common set of quality measures. Those measures include patient reports of their experience of care, such as how well doctors and nurses communicated with them, and actual outcomes of care, such as readmissions to the hospital. On its own website, VA reported 110 quality measures, including some of the same measures reported on Hospital Compare . VA also reports quality measures not found on Hospital Compare , such as measures of how long veterans must wait to access care at VAMCs.", "VA reports health care quality measures on two separate webpages of its website. VA launched the Access and Quality webpage in April 2017, which according to VA officials is the primary source of information for veterans on the quality of care at VAMCs. GAO found that this information is generally presented in a way that is accessible and easy to understand. However, GAO also found that the primary webpage provides information from a small subset\u201415\u2014of the 110 measures VA reports on its website as of June 2017. Most of the other measures are available on a second, older webpage that resides elsewhere on VA's website and is generally not easily accessible and understandable. Until VA can provide information on a broader range of health care measures and services and present this information in a way that is easily accessible and understandable, VA cannot ensure that its website is functioning as intended in helping veterans make informed choices about their care.", "Within VA, VA Central Office is responsible for calculating the health care quality measures that VA publicly reports for each of its VAMCs and ensuring that these measures provide accurate information on the VAMCs' quality of care. However, GAO found that VA Central Office has not systematically assessed the completeness and accuracy of the underlying clinical information that is used to calculate these measures. This clinical information is recorded in veterans' medical records and includes diagnoses given and treatments provided. Several studies have found potential problems with the accuracy and completeness of this clinical information at some VAMCs. For example, a 2015 independent assessment conducted by McKinsey & Company found that VA's clinical documentation procedures are below industry standards and that many VAMCs do not have programs in place to improve clinical documentation practices. VA Central Office officials told GAO that they have not systematically assessed the completeness and accuracy of the clinical information across VAMCs and the extent to which this affects the accuracy of its quality measures because they have focused on other priorities. However, the lack of such an assessment is inconsistent with federal standards for internal controls related to information and monitoring. As a result, VA does not have assurance that the quality measures it publicly reports on Hospital Compare and its own website accurately reflect the performance of its VAMCs and provide veterans with the information they need to make informed choices about their care."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that VA 1) report a broader range of health care quality measures in an accessible and understandable way on its website and 2) conduct a systematic assessment of the patient clinical information across VAMCs to ensure its accuracy and completeness.

Comprehensive assessments of VA health  care have found that VAMCs vary significantly in the quality of their care,  just as non-VA operated hospitals do. As a result, the ability of veterans  to make informed choices among VA and non-VA medical facilities  depends in part on having access to valid, accurate, and understandable  information on the relative quality of the care at these facilities.", "Congress passed the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of  2014 (Choice Act) to help ensure, among other goals, greater  accountability and transparency within the VA health care system.

Some measures often require  detailed clinical information obtained from patient medical records, such  as process measures that indicate whether timely and effective care was  provided in a specific situation, for example, or whether stroke patients  received clot-dissolving medication appropriately. Other measures are  designed to use information on patient demographics and diagnoses that  can be obtained from more readily accessible sources, such as claims  data or other administrative data that have already been collected for  other purposes such as billing.

According to VA officials, complying with the existing  process for collecting data for and reporting on HAIs would require  infection control staff at each VAMC to fill out forms with information  on individual patients, whereas VA currently collects its own  information on HAIs based on aggregated data assembled by VA  Central Office staff. VA officials told us that their new data collection  process for reporting HAI measures is intended to meet those  Hospital Compare requirements through automating much of the  required data entry at the VAMCs. However, VA officials noted that  this new reporting process is still in an early stage of development,  and they expressed uncertainty about how long it would take to  implement the process.", "Regarding the 4 additional mortality and readmission measures, CMS  faces challenges in integrating VA\u2019s clinical information into the  Hospital Compare database. According to both VA and CMS officials,  VA has had to implement new readmissions and mortality rate  measures incrementally due to the limited capacity of one of CMS\u2019s  Hospital Compare contractors to develop the programming needed to  calculate these measures using VA patient data. Because the  readmissions and mortality rate measures require complex  programming to implement risk adjustments, based on a number of  different diagnoses recorded in patient medical records over time, VA  and CMS officials agreed to add only two new measures each year  until VA can report all 4 measures.", "There are another 32 measures non-VA hospitals report on the Hospital  Compare website that VA has no plans to report.

For example, VA reports  readmission measures on Hospital Compare and on its website that  compare VAMCs in terms of the proportion of their patients with a medical  condition, such as heart failure, who are readmitted to a hospital within 30  days of an initial inpatient stay. Because VAMCs as well as non-VA  hospitals that treat healthier patients are likely to have lower readmission  rates independent of the quality of care that they provide, these  readmission measures incorporate information about whether a hospital\u2019s  patients have certain other diagnoses that indicate their overall level of  health.

We could not quantify the potential effect of  incomplete and inaccurate clinical information on VAMC assessed quality  performance without conducting an audit of the clinical information  recorded at each VAMC.", "Other components of the independent assessment also highlighted  longstanding issues with VA\u2019s electronic health records (EHR) system,  which stores the clinical information used to calculate VAMC performance  on the quality measures. The summary report for all 12 independent  assessments noted that VA\u2019s EHR system is outdated. The EHRs used at  each VAMC do not consistently use standard data elements and  algorithms for recording clinical information, and this variability in  underlying clinical information from one VAMC to the next has led to an  inability to convey consistent and complete information across the VA  health care system.  In 2016, the Commission on Care determined that  the deficiencies in VA\u2019s clinical documentation were so pervasive that it  recommended that VA procure an entirely new EHR system that would  replace its increasingly obsolete EHR system.", "These findings are similar to other studies conducted by the VA Office of  Inspector General (OIG) that found deficiencies in VAMCs\u2019 operations  that can lead to the recording of incomplete and inaccurate patient  information. For example, in July 2017, a VA OIG investigation of  colonoscopy practices concluded that more accurate and stringent clinical  data collection would enable VA to improve its monitoring of the quality of  providers\u2019 colonoscopies. Additionally, in May 2012, the OIG found that  some VAMCs do not consistently conduct reviews intended to ensure that  their clinicians properly enter information into EHRs, including ensuring  the appropriate use of cut and paste functions. In April 2010, the OIG  also found that VAMC emergency departments do not consistently  document all of the information that they are required to report when  transferring patients to other facilities.", "Furthermore, as one VA official observed to us, because of the way in  which they are funded, VAMCs do not have the same financial incentives  that non-VA hospitals do to ensure that the clinical information stored in  patient medical records is complete and accurate. In addition, because  most of VA health care is funded through direct appropriations, rather  than by payments of claims filed with an insurance company or with  government programs such as Medicare, VA does not routinely produce  the claims-based data on health care services provided to patients that  non-VA hospitals and clinics typically generate in the course of doing  business. Thus, to calculate VAMC performance on quality measures, VA  officials told us that VA has to extract data from its patient medical  records specifically for this purpose. In contrast, non-VA hospitals  routinely collect this information\u2014such as data on readmissions and  mortality\u2014as part of their claims processing and reimbursement from  Medicare and other health care payers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA Central Office Has Not Systematically Assessed the Completeness and Accuracy of Clinical Information in Patient Records and How this Affects Accuracy of Health Care Quality Measures", "paragraphs": ["Within VA, VA Central Office is responsible for calculating and reporting  the health care quality measures that VA publicly reports for each of its  VAMCs and ensuring that these measures provide accurate information  on the quality of care at these facilities. However, while studies and other  evidence we reviewed indicate potential problems with the clinical  information recorded at some VAMCs, VA Central Office has not  determined the extent to which these problems exist across VAMCs and  adversely affect the accuracy of the quality measures VA publicly reports  on Hospital Compare and its own website. Specifically, VA Central Office  has not conducted a systematic assessment of the completeness and  accuracy of the clinical data recorded in VA patient medical records  across VAMCs. (There are models for this type of assessment; see app.  III for examples of methodologies that have been applied to different  types of medical record systems.) When asked why they have not  conducted such an assessment, VA Central Office officials told us that  they have focused instead on improving the accuracy of medical coding  and on specific clinical quality issues identified at individual VAMCs.   However, accurate medical coding depends on the completeness and  accuracy of the underlying clinical information in patient records.", "Moreover, VA Central Office policy assigns responsibility for monitoring  the completeness and accuracy of patients\u2019 clinical information to each  individual VAMC. Each VAMC has a Health Record Review Committee  that is charged with monitoring the clinical documentation practices at that  facility. This committee determines the frequency of medical record  reviews at its facility, decides what focused reviews should occur, and  identifies clinicians that record clinical information poorly until they  improve to an acceptable rate of completeness and accuracy. According  to officials in VA\u2019s Central Office who are responsible for health  information management, the results of individual VAMC Health Record  Review Committee reviews are not reported to VA Central Office. As a  result, VA Central Office lacks information that could help it systematically  determine whether or to what extent VAMCs\u2019 clinical information is  incomplete and inaccurate, and if so, the extent to which these  deficiencies affect VAMCs\u2019 reported performance on the quality measures  VA publicly reports. The results of such a systematic analysis could also  help identify the deficiencies, if any, in the recording of patient clinical  information and what steps, if any, VA Central Office may need to take to  address them.", "VA Central Office\u2019s lack of a systematic assessment of the completeness  and accuracy of clinical information recorded in patient medical records  and the extent to which this affects the accuracy of its quality measures is  inconsistent with federal standards for internal controls related to  information and monitoring. These standards call for agencies to use  accurate information to achieve objectives, and to monitor agency  activities and evaluate results. Without a systematic assessment of the  completeness and accuracy of the clinical information recorded in VAMC  patient medical records and their potential effects on the health care  quality measures VA reports, VA Central Office does not have reasonable  assurance that differences in VAMCs\u2019 performance on VA\u2019s quality  measures reflect true differences in the quality of care and not differences  in the accuracy and completeness of the underlying clinical information.

VA intends for this webpage to be  veterans\u2019 primary source of information on the quality of care at VAMCs,  but the 15 measures reported on the webpage represent only a small  subset of the 110 measures and only a few of the measure categories VA  makes available elsewhere on its website. Until VA can provide  information on a broader range of health care measures and services,  highlight key differences in the quality of clinical care at VAMCs, and  present this information in a way that is easily accessible and  understandable, VA cannot ensure that its website is functioning as  intended in helping veterans make informed choices about their care.", "Second, VA does not have reasonable assurance that the health care  quality measures it reports on Hospital Compare and its own website  accurately assess the relative performance of VAMCs. This is because  the quality measures are calculated using clinical information recorded in  patient medical records, but VA Central Office does not know to what  extent this information has been accurately and completely recorded  across VAMCs. This is because VA has not conducted a systematic  assessment and does not have reasonable assurance about the accuracy  of the information that its quality measures are based on.

A \u201climited\u201d rating indicates that the webpage has  discrete areas where the webpage has implemented the characteristic to  some degree, but those areas are not representative of the webpage as a  whole.

Specifically, the research we  reviewed shows that more effective websites:  1.  Use plain language with clear graphics. Effective consumer  websites use labels and descriptions that make sense to consumers  who typically are unfamiliar with clinical terminology and who often  have difficulty interpreting numerical information. Graphics, including  symbols, can help to readily convey information on relative provider  performance, especially when they are designed to display a  summary assessment of that performance as part of the symbol itself,  for example one that incorporates the words \u201csuperior\u201d or \u201cpoor.\u201d  2.  Explain purpose and value of quality performance ratings to  consumers. Effective consumer websites address prevalent  misleading preconceptions by providing consumers coherent  explanations of how different quality measures relate to the aspects of  quality that consumers find relevant. These explanations work best  when they link individual measures to overarching categories  indicating what is being achieved, such as effectiveness of care,  safety, or patient-focused care.  3.  Summarize related information and organize data to highlight  patterns and facilitate consumer interpretation. Two techniques  that consumer websites can use to help consumers make sense of  large amounts of information are (a) combining information from  multiple related measures into summary or composite scores, and (b)  structuring presentation of the data in ways that make patterns  evident. For example, listing providers in rank order on selected cost  and quality dimensions greatly simplifies identification of high and low  performers.  4.  Enable consumers to customize information selected for  presentation to focus on what is most relevant to them.  Consumers differ in the priority they assign to different aspects of  quality. Websites that enable consumers to customize which quality  information is presented help consumers filter out information of  lesser consequence to them, and hone in on the information that they  find most compelling. For example, one consumer may choose to  focus on providers\u2019 capacity to communicate well with patients, while  another may focus on providers\u2019 rates of complications and infections.  5.  Enable consumers to compare quality performance of multiple  providers in one view. Websites are most effective when they  present side-by-side assessments of providers\u2019 performance on a  given aspect of cost or quality, so consumers can most easily  compare providers.  6.  Enable easy use and navigation of the tool. Unless consumers can  quickly find information of interest to them, they are likely to quickly  dismiss the potential utility of a consumer website and move on.  Extensive testing with consumers can help public and private entities  providing websites to develop intuitive, user-friendly approaches to  website navigation and for manipulating how the data are presented."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Relevance criteria", "paragraphs": ["Seven of the 13 characteristics of effective websites we identified address  the extent to which a website provides substantive quality and cost  information of relevance to consumers. Specifically, the research we  reviewed shows that more effective websites:   1.  Review a broad range of services so that more consumers\u2019  particular needs are included. The more services that are covered  by the website, the more likely it is that the website will have  information relevant to the particular services of interest to any given  consumer. It is especially important to include services that are  predictable and non-urgent, because these services are most likely to  afford consumers the opportunity to evaluate cost and quality  information before receiving the service.   2.  Cover a broad range of providers. Websites that provide  information for all or most of the available providers in a given  geographic area, regardless of network status or practice setting, give  consumers more information about their full range of options. For  example, for procedures that can be conducted in either a hospital  outpatient department or ambulatory surgical center, it helps  consumers to provide comparable information for both settings, so  that consumers can choose from a larger number of providers that  offer those procedures.   3.  Describe key differences in clinical quality of care, particularly  patient-reported outcomes. Assessments of the clinical quality of  care that have been shown to have particular relevance to consumers  are those that relate to long-term outcomes of the care experienced  by other patients. Often this is best addressed by patient-reported  outcomes, which tell consumers the eventual outcome of treatments,  as reported by previous patients of a particular provider. For example,  patients receiving hip replacements can be asked, through such  patient-reported outcomes, to rate their ability to climb stairs both  before and after their procedures, which enables assessments of the  procedures\u2019 effects on patients\u2019 mobility.   4.  Describe key differences in patient experiences with providers.", "Another outcome that matters is patients\u2019 assessment of their  interactions with providers. Effective websites include information on  how past patients have evaluated providers in terms of dimensions  such as how well nurses communicate with patients, or the  responsiveness of clinicians to patients\u2019 needs.  5.  Describe other information related to quality, where appropriate.", "There may be other quality indicators that could have major  significance to consumers for certain types of services. For example,  facility inspection results and staffing levels are of particular relevance  to nursing home care.  6.  Provide timely Information. More recent data are intrinsically more  relevant than data that are several years old. Because consumer  websites necessarily rely on past data to assess likely cost and quality  performance in the future, some lag in collecting, analyzing, and  providing data is inevitable. Data that are no more than two years old  are generally considered timely.  7.  Describe key strengths and limitations of the data. Although the  research we reviewed shows that few consumers are inclined to delve  into the many methodological issues that concern appropriate  techniques for collecting, checking, and analyzing cost and quality  data, effective websites can provide both summary assessments of  strengths and limitations for most consumers, and links to more  complete explanations for those wanting to pursue these issues in  greater detail.
