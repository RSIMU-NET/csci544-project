The bulk of this assistance has gone to General Motors (GM) and Chrysler, who sponsor some of the largest defined benefit pension plans insured by the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC). As part of GAO's statutorily mandated oversight of TARP, this report examines: (1) the impact of restructuring on GM's and Chrysler's pension plans; (2) the impact of restructuring on auto supply sector pension plans; (3) the impacts on PBGC and plan participants should auto industry pension plans be terminated; and (4) how the federal government is dealing with the potential tensions of its multiple roles as pension regulator, shareholder, and creditor. To conduct this study, GAO interviewed officials at GM, Chrysler, a labor union, a supplier association, the Departments of the Treasury and Labor, and PBGC; and reviewed relevant statutes, reports, and documents concerning the automakers' restructuring and pension plan funding. Treasury and PBGC generally agreed with the report's findings. Their technical comments and the technical comments provided by GM, Chrysler, and Delphi, were incorporated as appropriate."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The new GM and the new Chrysler that were established during each company's bankruptcy process in the summer of 2009 assumed sponsorship for all the old companies' U.S. defined benefit plans. Although the pension plans have been maintained, their future remains uncertain. According to current company projections, large contributions may be needed to comply with federal pension funding requirements within the next 5 years. Officials at the Department of the Treasury, which oversees TARP, expect both GM and Chrysler to return to profitability. If this is the case, then the companies will likely be able to make the required payments and prevent their pension plans from being terminated. However, if GM and Chrysler were not able to return to profitability and their pension plans were terminated, PBGC would be hit hard both financially and administratively. In early 2009, prior to the new companies assuming sponsorship, PBGC estimated that its exposure to potential losses for GM's and Chrysler's plans to be about $14.5 billion. Meanwhile, automaker downsizing and the credit market crisis have created significant stress for suppliers and their pensions. During 2009, there was a rise in the number of supplier bankruptcies, liquidations, and pension plan terminations. In July, the nation's largest auto parts supplier, Delphi Corporation, terminated its pension plans with expected losses to PBGC of over $6.2 billion. Across the auto sector as a whole, in January 2009, PBGC estimated that unfunded pension liabilities totaled about $77 billion, with PBGC's exposure for potential losses due to unfunded benefits of about $42 billion, leaving plan participants to bear the potential loss of the $35 billion difference through reduced benefits. Moreover, until Treasury either sells or liquidates the equity it acquired in each of the companies in exchange for the TARP assistance, its role as shareholder creates potential tensions with its role as pension regulator and overseer of PBGC in its role as pension insurer. In particular, tensions could arise if decisions must be made between allocating funds to company assets (thereby protecting shareholders, including taxpayers) or to pension fund assets (thereby protecting plan participants). As GAO reported previously, better communication with Congress and others about TARP interests could help mitigate such tensions."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Domestic auto manufacturers remain sponsors of some of the largest  private defined benefit plans in the United States.

Large numbers of  workers have left employment as product lines are eliminated and plants  are shut down. When workers are forced to leave their jobs before  becoming eligible to retire, the liabilities for their expected future benefits  will usually be less than previously recorded. However, for those workers  who are eligible to retire early and choose to do so under the enhanced  provisions of one of the numerous attrition programs, the liabilities for  their expected future benefits will usually be greater than previously  recorded. In other words, more workers will retire early and with more  benefits than previously anticipated in the company\u2019s valuation of future  benefit obligations.", "GM began its downsizing even before its TARP-related restructuring  efforts reduced the number of its North American brands from eight to  four. According to a GM news release, approximately 66,000 U.S. hourly  workers left the company under a special attrition program between 2006  and 2009. Often the lump-sum payments and buyouts offered by these  programs were paid from company assets, but when these benefits are  paid from pension assets, there can be an impact on the plan\u2019s financial  status. GM noted that the attrition programs implemented between 2006  and 2009 contributed to an increase of estimated plan obligations during  this period and\u2014along with other factors, such as discount rate changes\u2014 played a role in the recent increase in GM\u2019s pension liabilities (see fig. 2).", "Similarly, Chrysler\u2019s downsizing efforts also predate TARP. For example,  its decision to eliminate four models within its three primary brands dates  back to November 2007, and the company has implemented various  attrition programs to accomplish this. Due in part to these programs,  over the past few years, Chrysler\u2019s pension liabilities have fluctuated while  plan assets have been declining (see fig. 3). For example, Chrysler\u2019s UAW  plan reported a $900 million increase in liabilities from 2007 to 2008, and  the plan\u2019s 2008 valuation report noted that the cost of special termination  benefits during 2008 were nearly $390 million. Total liabilities for the  Chrysler Pension Plan increased by a smaller margin overall from 2007 to  2008, but the plan\u2019s 2008 valuation report noted that nearly $195 million in  additional costs were being recorded due to special early retirements,  added service costs, and curtailment loss.", "Other factors that have affected the funded status of both GM\u2019s and  Chrysler\u2019s plans are the special arrangements made with other companies  in conjunction with acquisitions and divestitures. For example, when an   auto parts supplier, the former Delphi Corporation, was spun off from GM  in 1999, the transaction included a negotiated agreement with various  unions for a benefit guarantee for certain employees in the event that  Delphi\u2019s hourly pension plan would be frozen or terminated. When the  company froze its hourly plan on November 30, 2008, as agreed, GM began  providing covered employees with up to 7 years of credited service in the  GM hourly plan while they continued to work at Delphi. Under this  negotiated benefit guarantee, GM also agreed that upon plan termination,  once PBGC determined the benefit to be paid subject to its guarantee  limits, GM would pay eligible covered employees the difference to \u201ctop up\u201d  the benefit to the level provided under Delphi\u2019s hourly plan. Following the  termination of Delphi\u2019s hourly plan in July 2009, GM estimated that the  cost of implementing this benefit guarantee for all covered unions would  be approximately $1.0 billion. In addition to the benefit guarantee for  Delphi employees still in the Delphi hourly plan, in the fall of 2008, GM\u2019s  hourly plan assumed responsibility for $2.7 billion in liabilities and $0.6  billion in assets from Delphi\u2019s plan, thereby increasing the GM plan\u2019s  funding deficit by $2.1 billion.", "When Chrysler was sold by Daimler in 2007, the transaction included an  agreement with Daimler to help protect the funded status of Chrysler\u2019s  pension plans. As part of this transaction, PBGC negotiated an agreement  whereby Daimler provided a $1 billion termination guarantee and Chrysler  made $200 million in additional pension contributions. Subsequently, in  April 2009, this agreement was replaced by a new arrangement requiring  Daimler to begin making annual contributions, even though the plans had  not terminated. Under this arrangement, Daimler agreed to make  payments totaling $600 million to Chrysler\u2019s pension plans over a 3-year  period, with $200 million due in June 2009, 2010, and 2011.

For example, the act included provisions that  raised the funding targets for defined benefit plans, reduced the period for  \u201csmoothing\u201d assets and liabilities, and restricted sponsors\u2019 ability to  substitute credit balances for cash contributions. At the same time, as we  have reported previously, the act did not fully close potential plan funding  gaps, and it provided funding relief to plan sponsors in troubled  industries. In addition, in the face of a weakened economy, the Worker,  Retiree, and Employer Recovery Act of 2008 provided plan sponsors with  further relief from the changes, as did IRS guidance in 2009 concerning  interest rates that could be used to value plan liabilities in some cases.", "Legislative proposals that would make additional changes to funding  requirements are currently being considered.", "Nevertheless, according to GM\u2019s projections utilizing valuation methods  defined under PPA, large cash contributions may be needed to meet its  funding obligations to its U.S. pension plans beginning in 2013 (see fig. 4).  GM officials told us that cash contributions are not expected to be needed  for the next few years because it has a relatively large \u201ccredit balance\u201d  based on contributions made in prior years that can be used to offset cash  contribution requirements that would otherwise be required until that  time. As of October 1, 2008, GM had about $36 billion of credit balance in  its hourly plan and about $10 billion in its salaried plan. However, once  these credit balances are exhausted, GM projects that the contributions  needed to meet its defined benefit plan funding requirements will total  about $12.3 billion for the years 2013 and 2014, and additional  contributions may be required thereafter. In its 2008 year-end report, GM  noted that due to significant declines in financial markets and  deterioration in the value of its plans\u2019 assets, as well as the coverage of  additional retirees, including Delphi employees, it may need to make  significant contributions to its U.S. plans in 2013 and beyond.", "Similarly, Chrysler\u2019s management expects that contributions to meet  minimum funding requirements may begin to increase significantly in 2013,  but are projected to be relatively minimal until then (see fig. 5). Chrysler,  like GM, intends to use credit balances to offset the contribution  requirements for some of its plans. As of end-of-year 2009, Chrysler had  credit balances of about $3.5 billion for its UAW Pension Plan and about  $1.9 billion across the other eight plans for which it provided funding  information. In addition, Chrysler also has $600 million in payments from  Daimler to help meet its funding requirements over the next few years.  Nevertheless, Chrysler\u2019s funding projections reveal that about $3.4 billion  in contributions may be needed to meet its funding requirements over the  2009 to 2015 period.", "In addition, both GM and Chrysler may need to manage the funded status  of their plans in order to avoid incurring an \u201cat-risk\u201d status or triggering  certain benefit restrictions. If a plan\u2019s funding level falls below certain  specified thresholds, then it must use special \u201cat-risk\u201d actuarial  assumptions to determine its minimum funding requirements and, in most  cases, increase its contributions. For example, the most recent annual  funding notice for the GM hourly plan reveals that the plan is in at-risk  status for plan year 2008.", "Also, if a plan\u2019s funding level falls below certain specified thresholds, then  certain restrictions may be placed on the benefits provided by the plan,  such as lump sum withdrawals and plant shutdown benefits (see table 2)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Economic Stress in Auto Industry Has Endangered Auto Supplier Pensions", "paragraphs": ["Automaker restructuring, the credit market crisis, and the global recession  have created significant economic stress across the auto supply industry.

For years, the auto supply sector has felt the  impact of the problems facing the domestic auto market, including  declining vehicle sales, and deep production cuts\u2014resulting in  overcapacity within the industry. In 2004, the Department of Commerce  reported that the possibility of relying on increased auto sales that  automatically translate into increased orders and components for U.S.  suppliers no longer existed because U.S. automobile manufacturers had  shifted from providing a ready market for many domestic suppliers of  parts and components to operating on a global basis. The result of this  shift was that automotive parts suppliers had to find niches in the global  supply chains of U.S. auto companies or their foreign competitors to  succeed.", "Many auto suppliers broadened their sales base to remain competitive.  With the domestic share of the market in decline, these suppliers  diversified their business models to include just-in-time manufacturing  capacity or sold their products to multiple automakers in North America,  Europe, and Asia. For example, at the time it filed for bankruptcy, the U.S.  auto parts supplier, Delphi Corporation, employed more than 185,000  workers in 38 countries in 2004, making it one of the largest suppliers in  the world. Still, according to a 2009 industry report, just 7 of the 29 U.S.- based suppliers listed among the top 100 global suppliers sold the majority  of their products in North America. Suppliers serving the large U.S.  automakers also have considerable overlap, with as many as 80 percent  supplying parts to one or more automaker. For example, Chrysler reported  that 96 percent of its top 100 suppliers also served either GM or Ford.  Similarly, 27 of GM\u2019s top 39 suppliers also served as major suppliers for  Chrysler. While this crossover allowed suppliers to spread their risk  among domestic automakers, the impact of the global economic downturn  affected many suppliers, and left suppliers that sold primarily to GM and  Chrysler particularly vulnerable when the automakers filed for  bankruptcy.", "The recent global credit crisis and the rapid decline in auto sales left many  of the nation\u2019s auto parts suppliers under significant stress with limited  access to credit and facing growing uncertainty about their future business  prospects. For example, GM\u2019s and Chrysler\u2019s decision to slow production  by temporarily shutting down some U.S. operations in late 2008 led to  interruptions in suppliers\u2019 operations and cash flow. As a result, many  suppliers were left with excess inventory, were not paid for products they  had shipped to automakers, and lacked the liquidity needed to settle their  debts with their raw material and component suppliers. Concerns over the  ability of the organizations to continue operations and, among other  things, collect their receivables and pay their bills when due, led some  suppliers to receive a \u201cgoing concern\u201d qualification from their auditors.   Lenders restricted credit and cash flow to suppliers, limiting their liquidity  at the time when it was needed most. With limited cash flow, the suppliers  experienced increasing pressure from their raw material and component  suppliers. According to Chrysler, 43 percent of its suppliers had received  requests from their suppliers for some form of payment term compression.  Chrysler recognized the liquidity shortfall in the supplier network as a  significant threat to its successful restructuring, and identified supplier  insolvencies and supply chain disruptions as key risks to the critical  assumptions in its restructuring plan. Another industry report indicated  that at least 500 suppliers in North America (or 30 percent of the estimated  1,700 direct suppliers in the U.S.) may be at high risk of insolvency due to  the effect of reduced volumes and the lack of credit availability.

Treasury had rejected appeals from the auto  supply sector for direct aid to assist a broader portion of the supplier  industry because, according to Treasury officials, it had become clear that  the vast network of suppliers had to engage in a substantial restructuring  and capacity reduction to achieve long-term viability. The program was to  ensure that GM and Chrysler received the parts and components they  needed to manufacture vehicles and suppliers had access to credit from  lenders.

Its estimates of  exposure are based on companies with credit ratings below investment  grade or that meet one or more of the criteria for financial distress. PBGC  classifies the plans sponsored by these companies as \u201creasonably  possible\u201d terminations. At the end of fiscal year 2009, PBGC estimated  that its exposure from reasonably possible terminations was  approximately $168 billion, up from $47 billion a year earlier. A  significant part of this increase was due to the dramatic increase in  exposure related to manufacturing, which PBGC attributed primarily to  changes in the auto industry, as well as primary and fabricated metals (see  fig. 6).", "In May 2009, PBGC reported that unfunded pension liabilities across the  auto industry as a whole totaled about $77 billion as of January 31, 2009,  and accounted for about $42 billion of PBGC\u2019s total exposure of $168  billion. This means that, should all the auto industry\u2019s underfunded plans  insured by PBGC be terminated and trusteed, PBGC would be required to  cover about $42 billion of the benefit amounts promised, adding to its  deficit. Between the end of fiscal years 2008 and 2009, the deficit in  PBGC\u2019s single-employer insurance program doubled in size from $10.7  billion to $21.1 billion. Should all the underfunded auto industry plans  fail, PBGC\u2019s January 2009 estimate indicated that its end of fiscal year 2009  deficit could triple in size. An increase of this magnitude would have  implications not just for PBGC\u2019s accumulated deficit, but for its overall  funding going forward, as the auto industry is responsible for contributing  a significant portion of PBGC\u2019s premiums each year. According to PBGC\u2019s  most recent data book, the motor vehicle equipment industry accounted  for about 1.2 percent of all insured plans under the single-employer  insurance program in 2007, but 6.1 percent of all insured participants and  7.3 percent of all premiums.", "With respect to PBGC\u2019s exposure for GM\u2019s and Chrysler\u2019s pension plans in  particular, PBGC calculated its potential exposure prior to when the new  companies assumed sponsorship of the plans. Before the change in  sponsorship, PBGC estimated that its exposure for GM\u2019s unfunded  guaranteed benefits would be about $9.0 billion, and that its exposure for  Chrysler\u2019s unfunded guaranteed benefits would be about $5.5 billion (see  table 4).", "Even without the change in sponsorship, actual losses to PBGC could be  substantially different, as estimates of exposure are inherently difficult to  calculate. For example, the significant volatility in plan underfunding and  sponsor creditworthiness over time makes long-term estimates of PBGC\u2019s  expected claims difficult. Moreover, there is a time lag in making these  estimates. Estimates of exposure are generally based on company reports  filed as of December 31 of the previous year. Thus, the dramatic increase  in PBGC\u2019s aggregate reasonably possible exposure between fiscal years  2008 and 2009 depicted in figure 6 was primarily due to the deterioration  of credit quality and poor asset returns that occurred during calendar year  2008. Subsequent changes in economic conditions (such as the steady rise  in equity returns since March 2009) were not yet reflected in these  estimates. In addition, actual losses due to terminated plans depend on  PBGC\u2019s liability only for unfunded guaranteed benefits, but this is not  factored into the estimates because it is difficult to determine the extent  and effect of the limits on guaranteed benefits prior to actual termination.", "However, PBGC\u2019s exposure for unfunded guaranteed benefits in the auto  supply sector has already begun to materialize. Over the past year, the  plans of several large suppliers were terminated and trusteed by PBGC,  and PBGC estimates that the unfunded guaranteed benefits that it will be  required to pay to participants in the plans of these large suppliers will  exceed $6.6 billion (see table 5). The estimate for the pension plans of the  former Delphi Corporation alone is over $6.2 billion.", "To help protect against further exposure, according to PBGC\u2019s 2009 annual  report, the agency was continuing to monitor the auto industry and  negotiate settlements for additional pension protections in several auto- related corporate downsizing cases. For example, in the case of Visteon  Corporation, a large automotive supplier, PBGC negotiated an agreement  in January 2009 that required Visteon to provide over $55 million in  additional protections to workers at closed facilities by making cash  contributions to the plan, a letter of credit to PBGC, and a guaranty by  certain affiliates of certain contingent pension obligations. Similarly, in the  case of Cooper Tire & Rubber Company, PBGC negotiated a deal in August  2009 that required the plan sponsor to strengthen the plan by $62 million,  in connection with a plant closing in Albany, Georgia.

Moreover, in addition to their  sheer size, these plans have many of the characteristics that contribute to  complexity and delays in processing, such as a history of mergers,  complicated benefit formulas, movement of participants and assets across  plans, and large numbers of participants subject to one or more of the  legal limits on guaranteed benefits.", "Among plans terminated and trusteed by PBGC, the average number of  participants per plan is just under 1,000, but most of GM\u2019s and Chrysler\u2019s  plans far exceed this average.

Only two of  Chrysler\u2019s ten plans had less than 1,000 participants. Taken together, the  number of participants in these two companies\u2019 pension plans is equal to  about 40 percent of all the participants in all the plans terminated and  trusteed by PBGC since the agency was established in 1974. Even more  striking, taken together, the amount of assets in these two companies\u2019  pension plans exceeds\u2014by a considerable margin\u2014the total amount of  assets that PBGC is currently managing for all the plans it has trusteed  combined (see fig. 6).", "In addition to their large size, GM\u2019s and Chrysler\u2019s plans have many of the  characteristics that, as delineated in a previous report, contribute to  complexity and delay in processing. For example, both GM and Chrysler  have long histories of acquisitions, mergers, and divestitures, stretching  over the past century (see appendix V). To determine the potential impact  on any current or future retirees or beneficiaries of the plan,  documentation concerning each change must be obtained, along with data  about any affected employees. An employee\u2019s movement from one plan to  another also can cause complexity in benefit calculations. Even within a  plan, tiers can be created that treat some employees differently and make  benefit calculations more complicated.

PBGC guarantees participants\u2019 benefits only up to  certain limits, specified under ERISA and related regulations. Among  GM\u2019s and Chrysler\u2019s plans, certain provisions and characteristics of  participants suggest that many would likely be subject to one or more of  these limits should the plans be terminated, as discussed further in the  next section. Recent changes in the law added new provisions concerning  the treatment of certain events, such as plant shutdowns and attrition  programs (referred to as \u201cunpredictable contingent events\u201d). PBGC has  begun to grapple with some of these complexities following the  termination of the Delphi plans, as many of the benefits provided by the  Delphi plans reflect negotiations with UAW and are similar to benefits  provided by UAW plans across the auto sector.", "In its 2009 annual report, PBGC noted that it has been taking steps to  prepare for the possible trusteeship of large auto industry plans by  defining the changes to its infrastructure that would be needed to handle  the increase in workload.

But in cases involving complex plans with generous benefit  structures such as GM\u2019s and Chrysler\u2019s, large numbers of participants are  likely to have benefits subject to the guarantee limits and, depending on  the extent of plan underfunding at termination, these participants would  be at risk of having their benefits reduced as a result.

Of this $35 billion, about half ($18  billion) was attributable to GM\u2019s plans, and another $5 billion was  attributable to Chrysler\u2019s plans.", "Participants most often affected by the application of guaranteed benefit  limits are high earners whose benefits exceed the maximum limit, those  who take early retirement, and those whose benefits increased due to  recent plan amendments. We were unable to obtain precise data on the  number of GM and Chrysler plan participants whose benefits might be  reduced due to these limits; however, GM and Chrysler pension plans  provide several options for early retirement, with supplemental benefits to  those who retire before age 62 as a bridge to Social Security benefits.  Under one type of guarantee limit (the accrued-at-normal limit), any  supplements being provided to retirees as of the date of plan termination,  and any supplements to be provided to future retirees, would not be  guaranteed. According to PBGC officials, a significant number of GM and  Chrysler participants could be vulnerable to having their benefits reduced  due to this limit should the pension plans be terminated. In addition,  retirees whose benefits reflect increases in the 5 years prior to the date of  plan termination could be subject to another type of guarantee limit (the  phase-in limit). For example, if GM\u2019s and Chrysler\u2019s plans had been  terminated in 2009, this limit would have affected the increases in benefits  provided in the 2007 UAW contracts negotiated with both GM and  Chrysler, causing only a part of those increases to be guaranteed.

This is because when a pension plan is terminated  and trusteed by PBGC, ERISA specifies that the remaining assets of the  plan and any funds recovered for the plan from company assets be  allocated to participant benefits according to a certain priority order (see  appendix VI). Due to this allocation process, if GM and Chrysler plans  were terminated, participants who were retired (or eligible to retire) for at  least 3 years would be most likely to have some or all of their  nonguaranteed benefits paid, while those participants who retired early\u2014 especially those who retired under one of the special attrition programs\u2014 would be most at risk for having their benefits reduced."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Passage of Time Would Shift Termination Losses for PBGC and Plan Participants", "paragraphs": ["The exposure to loss from plan termination would shift over time, but it is  unclear whether PBGC or plan participants would be better off as a result.

For example, plan assets could grow or diminish over  time, depending on investment returns and employer contributions. Plan  liabilities could also grow or diminish over time, depending on interest  rates, ages of participants, and whether benefits are revised in future  years. In addition, more participants could acquire vested benefits over  time, increasing liabilities; while more benefits would have been paid over  time, decreasing liabilities.", "How the losses due to unfunded benefits would be shared between PBGC  (for guaranteed benefits) and plan participants (for nonguaranteed  benefits) could also shift over time. For example, participants\u2019 monthly  amount of guaranteed benefits would increase over time for three main  reasons: (1) more workers would be eligible to retire with more generous  benefits, based on years of service; (2) the maximum limits are updated  each year and thus would increase, and people would grow older, so the  cutbacks due to this limit would grow smaller; and (3) the benefit  reductions due to the phase-in limit would be phased out. This increase in  the monthly amount of guaranteed benefits would tend to shift costs from  participants to PBGC. Meanwhile, over time, more participants will have  been retired (or eligible to retire) for 3 years or more, and thus have  benefits eligible for higher priority status in the asset allocation process.  In addition to shifting the distribution of benefits to be paid among  different groups of participants, this could also cause more of the plan\u2019s  remaining assets to be allocated to guaranteed benefits within this priority  category, with less available to cover nonguaranteed benefits, resulting in  a shift in costs from PBGC to plan participants.", "Taking all these factors into account, it is unclear whether the passage of time  would increase or decrease the overall cost of unfunded guaranteed benefits  to be paid by PBGC compared with the loss of unfunded nonguaranteed  benefits to be borne by plan participants.

On behalf of the  U.S. taxpayer, Treasury has an interest, as a shareholder, in the financial  well-being of the companies, as well as the viability of their pension  plans. These interests may diverge at times. Although Treasury has  established policies designed to separate these interests, the perception of  a conflict could arise, for example, should choices need to be made  regarding the allocation of funds from the companies to their pension  plans."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Treasury Has Established Various Structures to Mitigate Any Risk Related to Conflicts", "paragraphs": ["Under normal circumstances, transparency and disclosures to the public  related to agency actions can often mitigate risks related to conflicts of  interest. But, in this case, because this involves private companies and  business sensitive information, Treasury is less able to rely on transparency  and disclosure in its dealings with the automakers to mitigate any potential  conflicts of interest. Nevertheless, as we have previously reported, what  Treasury\u2019s goals are for its investment in Chrysler and GM, among other  things, is important information for Congress and the public to have.  Although Treasury provides public information on TARP activities,  including AIFP, through its legally mandated monthly reports to Congress,  transaction reports, and others, these reports do not provide information on  the indicators Treasury may use in assessing the goals for its auto  investments and the status of the automakers\u2019 pensions. Identifying these  indicators for Congress, and sharing as much of this information as possible,  while still respecting the sensitivity of certain business information, could  help Congress and the public better understand whether the investment in  the auto companies has been successful and help mitigate potential or  perceived conflicts of interest.", "Recognizing the potential for interested parties to perceive conflicts,  Treasury has taken several other steps to mitigate its risk. First, to guide  its oversight of the investments going forward and limit its involvement in  the day-to-day operations of the companies, Treasury developed four core  principles: (1) acting as a reluctant shareholder, for example, by not  owning equity stakes in companies any longer than necessary; (2) not  interfering in the day-to-day management decisions; (3) ensuring a strong  board of directors; and (4) exercising limited voting rights. According to  Treasury officials, use of these core principles defines the operating  boundaries of the federal role within its ownership context by limiting the  reach and ability of the government to exert its powerful influence on the  business and operational matters of these companies. Officials noted that  the core principle of not interfering in day-to-day decisions has been  particularly helpful in dealing with political pressures related to business  operations. For example, officials said that Treasury\u2019s auto team received  about 300 congressional letters in 2009 regarding day-to-day management  issues involving GM and Chrysler. Several of these letters asked about  company decisions and strategies, or called on Treasury to exert influence  on the companies\u2019 business decisions. Some letters lobbied either in favor  of or against a certain practice or activity. Other letters have been passed  along on behalf of  a particular constituent concern. Treasury officials said  that, because of their core principle, most of the time they can simply  reply to such letters by reiterating their policy of not getting involved with  the companies\u2019 business decisions, and as a result, they have been able to  avoid having to respond to these pressures.", "Second, to implement these core principles, Treasury established a  protective barrier between the Treasury officials (beneath the Secretary  level) who make policy-related decisions with respect to investments in  the automakers and the Treasury officials who are responsible for  regulating pensions or overseeing the operations of PBGC. In theory, this  barrier prevents Treasury in its role as owner from interacting with  Treasury in its role as pension regulator or overseer of PBGC. Treasury  officials stated that, in the management of its investment in GM and  Chrysler, the Treasury auto team does not communicate with the IRS or  PBGC.", "Given the importance of balancing its competing interests as regulator and  part-owner, and mitigating the appearance of conflicts between these  interests, it is essential that Treasury ensure that it has an adequate  number of staff with the appropriate skills and expertise to carry out its  various tasks. Because of earlier reductions in the number of Treasury  staff working on the AIFP and Treasury\u2019s stated plans to disband the team  focused exclusively on managing Treasury\u2019s stake in the auto industry, we  recently recommended that Treasury ensure it has the expertise needed to  adequately monitor and divest the government\u2019s investments in Chrysler  and GM. We believe that ensuring sufficient staffing continues to be  essential, particularly in light of the circumstances discussed here.  Subsequent to our making this recommendation, Treasury officials said  they hired two additional analysts dedicated solely to monitoring  Treasury\u2019s investments in Chrysler and GM, and planned to hire one more."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Despite These Efforts, Tensions May Remain", "paragraphs": ["The steps taken to mitigate any risks likely to result should conflicts of  interest arise\u2014adoption of the core principles and establishment of a  protective barrier\u2014may help, but the tensions inherent in Treasury\u2019s  multiple roles remain. This can be illustrated by the conflicting pressures  that would likely be brought to bear in two critical and interrelated  contexts: (1) how to respond to a decline in pension funding; and (2) how  to decide when to sell the government\u2019s shares of stock.", "Treasury officials told us they expect both GM and Chrysler to return to  profitability. If this is the case, and the companies are able to make the  required contributions to their pension plans as they become due, then  Treasury\u2019s multiple roles are less likely to result in any perceived conflicts.  However, if the funding of any of GM\u2019s or Chrysler\u2019s defined benefit plans  declines below certain funding levels set out in statute, the company may  request a waiver\u2014that is, request permission from IRS (within Treasury) to  reduce its required contributions to its plans over an extended period.  Despite Treasury\u2019s protective barrier and the autonomy of IRS to grant or  refuse such a waiver request apart from any influence from other units  within Treasury, some may still perceive a possible tension between  Treasury\u2019s interest in the value of its shareholder investment and Treasury\u2019s  interest, through its oversight of PBGC, in ensuring the viability of the  pension plans.", "In addition, Treasury has been clear that it wants to divest its shares as soon  as practicable, but it must weigh a variety of factors when making the  decision about when and how this should happen. Treasury officials said that  on the basis of their analysis of the companies\u2019 future profitability, they  believe that both GM and Chrysler will be able to attract sufficient investor  interest for Treasury to sell its equity. However, circumstances that may  appear advisable as to the best time to sell from a shareholder perspective\u2014 that is, which would maximize the return on the taxpayer\u2019s investment\u2014 could be at odds with the best interests of plan participants and beneficiaries.  For example, Treasury could decide to sell its equity stake at a time when it  would maximize its return on investment, but when the companies\u2019 pension  plans were still at risk.", "Finally, in the event that the companies do not return to profitability in a  reasonable time frame, Treasury officials said that they will consider all  commercial options for disposing of Treasury\u2019s equity, including forcing the  companies into liquidation, which would likely mean that the companies\u2019  pension plans would be terminated and decisions would need to be made  about the allocation of remaining company assets. In such circumstances,  although there is a protective barrier preventing Treasury in its role as  shareholder from interacting with Treasury in its role overseeing the PBGC,  it may be difficult for the agency to make certain decisions without some  perceiving a tension between these two separate roles."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["Treasury\u2019s substantial investment and other assistance, as well as loans  from the Canadian government and concessions from nearly every  stakeholder, including the unions, have made it possible for Chrysler and  GM to stabilize and survive years of declining market share and the  deepest recession since the Great Depression. However, because of the  ongoing challenges facing the auto industry\u2014including the still recovering  economy and weak demand for new vehicles\u2014the ultimate impact that the  assistance will have on the companies\u2019 profitability and long-term viability  remains uncertain. This, too, is the case for the companies\u2019 pensions. The  companies\u2019 ability to make the large contributions that would be required  based on current projections is mostly dependent on their profitability.  Treasury officials who oversee TARP expect both automakers to return to  profitability. Ultimately, much of the automaker recovery is not only  dependent on how well the automakers turn their companies around but  also how well the overall economy and employment levels improve.", "The suppliers\u2019 future is even more complex. GM and Chrysler are expected  to continue to reduce the number of suppliers that they use going forward.  Suppliers have diversified their client base to include many other domestic  and international automakers to minimize the impact of such cuts, but this  has caused their viability to be more dependent on a global economic  recovery, which has been slow. As a result, supplier bankruptcies and  pension plan terminations may continue for the near future.", "In light of these conditions, the risks to PBGC and participants in auto sector  pension plans remain significant. PBGC estimated its exposure for unfunded  guaranteed benefits across the sector to be about $42 billion as of January 31,  2009, and the exposure for plan participants for unfunded nonguaranteed  benefits to be about $35 billion. The federal government and its institutions,  the automakers, and the unions have all made a concerted effort to ensure  that GM and Chrysler do not fail. But, should the automakers not return to  profitability, interests may no longer be aligned. Treasury officials said that  they will consider all commercial options for disposing of Treasury\u2019s equity,  including liquidation; this would likely mean terminating the companies\u2019  pension plans, and allocating remaining company assets. In such  circumstances, it would be difficult for Treasury to make any decisions that  would trade off the value of its investment against the expense of the pension  funds, potentially exposing the government either to loss of its TARP  investment or to significant worsening of PBGC\u2019s financial condition. This is  not a choice the government wants to face, but this risk and its attendant  challenges remain real.", "We recently recommended that Treasury should regularly communicate to  Congress about TARP activities, including the financial health of GM and  Chrysler. This would include information on the companies\u2019 pensions as  an integral part of the companies\u2019 financial health. Treasury already  provides some information on its investments in the automakers through  its monthly reports to Congress. In response to our previous  recommendations, Treasury said that it intended to develop an approach  for reporting on its investments in the auto industry that strikes an  appropriate balance between transparency and the need to avoid  compromising the competitive positions of the companies, and that it was  implementing a communication strategy to provide key congressional  stakeholders more current information about its TARP activities. These  reports could provide a vehicle to report publicly available information on  the financial status of the automakers\u2019 pensions. Such disclosure could  help mitigate the potential or perceived tensions that could arise with the  federal government\u2019s multiple roles with respect to the automakers and,  when the time comes, could shed light on how Treasury\u2019s decision to  divest will impact the companies\u2019 pension plans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We obtained written comments on a draft of this report from the  Department of the Treasury (see appendix VIII) and from PBGC (see  appendix IX).

Treasury noted that it already provides \u201ca wealth of  information\u201d about AIFP on its Web site, and also provides periodic  updates to oversight bodies, including GAO. It further noted that it will  provide additional reports on its investments in Chrysler and GM as  circumstances warrant, but that it will not communicate confidential  business information due to the potential to negatively affect the value of  the investments. Treasury concluded that, given its role as a shareholder, it  would be inappropriate for it to report separately on the assets and  liabilities in the automakers\u2019 pension plans to Congress and the public.", "We understand the importance of protecting the automakers\u2019 proprietary  interests. However, as we pointed out in our report, Treasury\u2019s role is  multifaceted, serving not only as a shareholder and creditor for Chrysler  and GM, but also as a regulator of pensions. As a creditor of these  companies, Treasury should know and disclose the pension commitments,  which represent liabilities for these companies. These liabilities must be  taken into account when evaluating the financial status of these  companies. GM and Chrysler are already required to disclose certain  information about the status of their pensions in publicly available reports.  By including this publicly available information on the status of the  automakers\u2019 pension plans in its reports to Congress, Treasury could  provide a more complete picture of the companies\u2019 financial health and  help mitigate any perceived tensions between the various roles that the  Treasury currently plays as shareholder, creditor, and pension regulator  without compromising the companies\u2019 competitive positions.", "Both Treasury and PBGC provided technical comments, which are  incorporated into the report where appropriate.

Delphi evolved as part of General Motors (GM) until it was spun off as a  separate entity in 1999. At the time it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in  2005, the company employed more than 185,000 workers in 38 countries,  making it one of the largest suppliers in the world.", "The former Delphi Corporation sponsored six defined benefit plans for its  U.S.-based workers:  the Delphi Hourly-Rate Employees Pension Plan;  the Delphi Retirement Program For Salaried Employees;  the Packard-Hughes Interconnect Bargaining Retirement Plan;  the Packard-Hughes Interconnect Non-Bargaining Retirement Plan;  the ASEC Manufacturing Retirement Program; and  the Delphi Mechatronic Systems Retirement Program.", "Following Delphi\u2019s spin off from GM in 1999, GM agreed with its unions,  including the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and  Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW), to offer pension  protections for certain employees in the event that Delphi\u2019s pension plans  would be frozen or terminated. Specifically, under the agreement, GM  agreed with three unions to provide certain former GM employees retired  from Delphi certain pension benefits that would otherwise not be paid by  Delphi or by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) upon plan  termination. Salaried and certain other union-represented employees did  not receive similar contractual commitments from GM with respect to  their pensions or other postemployment benefits, and they are suffering  the full impact of their Delphi plans having been frozen and terminated.", "In addition, GM agreed to provide transfer rights for certain Delphi hourly  UAW-represented employees in the United States. Specifically, it provided  these employees with \u201cflowback\u201d opportunities to transfer to GM as  appropriate job openings became available at GM. GM employees in the U.S.  had similar opportunities to transfer to Delphi. The original flowback  agreement provided that, when an employee transferred, the employee  would be eligible for pension benefits which reflected the transferring  employee\u2019s combined years of credited service. The parties did not transfer  pension assets or liabilities in order to accomplish this. Rather, pension  responsibility between Delphi and GM was allocated on a pro-rata basis  based upon the employee\u2019s credited service at each company.", "After Delphi and its U.S. subsidiaries filed for bankruptcy in 2005, there  were extensive efforts involving negotiations between Delphi, GM, and  other stakeholders to keep the pension plans ongoing. On September 30,  2008, the company froze its salaried plan, the ASEC Manufacturing  Retirement Program, the Delphi Mechatronic Systems Retirement Program  and the Packard Hughes Interconnect Non-Bargaining Retirement Plan.  The company also reached agreement with its labor unions allowing it to  freeze the accrual of traditional benefits under its hourly plan, effective as  of November 30, 2008.", "Delphi received the consent of its labor unions and approval from the  court to transfer certain assets and liabilities of Delphi\u2019s hourly plan to  GM\u2019s hourly plan. The first transfer involved liabilities of approximately  $2.6 billion and assets of approximately $486 million (about 90 percent of  the estimated $540 million of assets initially scheduled to be transferred).  It was anticipated that the remaining assets would be transferred by March  29, 2009, upon finalizing the related valuations. In exchange for the first  transfer, Delphi\u2019s reorganization plan released GM from all claims that  could be brought by its creditors with respect to, among other things, the  spin off of Delphi, any collective bargaining agreements to which the  former Delphi was a party, and any obligations to former Delphi  employees.", "Although the first transfer had the effect that no contributions were due  under the hourly plan for the plan year ended September 30, 2008, Delphi  still had a funding deficiency of $56 million for the salaried plan and an  approximate $13 million funding deficiency for its other pension plans for  the plan year ending September 30, 2008. Delphi applied to the Internal  Revenue Service (IRS) for a waiver of the obligation to make the minimum  funding contribution to the salaried plan by June 15, 2009, and requested  permission, instead, to pay the amount due in installments over the  following 5 years. However, Delphi abandoned the waiver request when it  became clear that it could not afford to maintain the salaried plan and that  GM was not going to assume it. \u201c . . . due to the impact of the global economic recession, including reduced global  automotive production, capital markets volatility that has adversely affected our  pension asset return expectations, a declining interest rate environment, or other  reasons, our funding requirements have substantially increased since September 30,  2008.

PBGC assumed responsibility for the plans on August 10, 2009. According  to PBGC, this step was necessary because Delphi had stated that it could  not afford to maintain its pension plans and GM, which itself had  reorganized in bankruptcy earlier in the year, had stated that it was unable  to afford the additional financial burden of the Delphi pensions. PBGC  stated that the Delphi pension plans were $7 billion underfunded when  they terminated the plans. PBGC estimates that it will make up about $6  billion of that shortfall using PBGC funds.

The calculations  assume that plan assets and recoveries are not sufficient to fund  nonguaranteed benefits beyond a portion of those benefits in priority  category 3 (that is, of those retired or eligible to retire for at least 3 years),  and they focus on those who would lose the most under such situations.  Although an early retiree eligible for priority 3 status would lose the least,  all early retirees under age 62 as of the date of plan termination would lose  a sizeable portion of their benefits until age 62 because their supplements  are not guaranteed. The person who retired early under a special attrition  program or plant shutdown benefit would lose even more, as the enhanced  benefits under the special program would also not be guaranteed, reducing  the person\u2019s lifetime benefit by more than half. Finally, the person not yet  eligible to retire would lose the most. Compared to the benefits promised  under the plan, he would not be able to retire for 5 more years and his  payment would be less than a quarter of the amount promised. Over time,  in general, more employees will be eligible to retire and qualify for priority  3 status, and the amount of retirees\u2019 monthly guaranteed benefits will  increase."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VIII: Comments from the Department of the Treasury", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IX: Comments from PBGC", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix X: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contacts named above, Kimberley M.
