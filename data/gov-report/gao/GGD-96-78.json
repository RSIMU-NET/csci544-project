In an August 1993 memorandum, the President directed the Department of the Treasury and ATF to take actions to ensure compliance with federal firearms license requirements. The President pointed out that there were over 287,000 federal firearms licensees (all categories), many of which he stated probably should not have been licensed because they were not engaged in a legitimate firearms business. In late November 1993, Congress passed the Federal Firearms License Reform Act of 1993, which increased the licensing fees for obtaining and renewing a federal firearms dealer license. In December 1993, in response to the President\u2019s memorandum, ATF significantly revised the application process and forms for obtaining and renewing federal firearms licenses, including requiring applicants to submit fingerprints and a photograph as a positive means of identification. ATF began using its revised application form (dated December 1993) in February 1994. In September 1994, Congress passed the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, which added more licensing requirements. Among other provisions, this act required applicants for firearms licenses to certify that their firearms business will comply with the requirements of state and local laws.", "In addition to factors at the federal level that contributed to the decline in the number of federal firearms dealers licensees, state and local agencies\u2019 enforcement of their laws may have resulted in reducing the number of licensees. For example, local agencies\u2019 enforcement of zoning ordinances dealing with businesses operating in residential areas may have resulted in declines in the number of firearms dealer licensees.", "The decline in the number of federally licensed firearms dealers and the factors contributing to the decline are shown in figure 7. A time lag existed between the occurrence of the factors contributing to the decline and when the decline actually began. For example, while the President\u2019s memorandum was issued in August 1993, ATF\u2019s implementation of actions taken pursuant to the memorandum, such as revising the application form, did not occur until late 1993 and early 1994, with resulting declines in the number of dealers occurring thereafter.", "We found no evidence that ATF had a policy, or sought, to reduce the number of licensed dealers by some targeted number. Rather, all of the factors mentioned above, including ATF\u2019s increased enforcement efforts, collectively contributed to declines in the number of dealers in 1994 and 1995. These factors were reiterated by various organizations from whom we obtained views on the reasons for the decline and by our independent survey of randomly selected former firearms dealers."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "ATF Increased Inspections of Firearms Dealer Applicants and Licensees", "paragraphs": ["In January 1993, ATF initiated the National Firearms Program. As part of the program, ATF initiated efforts to screen applicants for federal firearms dealer licenses more thoroughly and increased the number of inspections of applicants and licensees to ensure strict compliance with GCA.", "According to the Chief of the Firearms and Explosives Regulatory Division, the ATF official responsible for managing ATF\u2019s Firearms and Explosives matters, a number of factors led ATF to increase its regulatory enforcement efforts over firearms dealer applicants and licensees. These included rising violence associated with the illegal use and sale of firearms, national media attention on the ease of obtaining a firearms dealer license, administration policies emphasizing increased enforcement of firearms licensing requirements, and our 1992 report on ATF\u2019s firearms inspections suggesting better targeting of inspections.", "In addition, ATF\u2019s Operation Snapshot, an inspection project that was conducted in 1992 and 1993 to obtain information about federal firearms licensees and their business operations, reported that 46 percent of all licensees had sold no firearms in the previous 12 months, and another 34 percent had sold 1 to 10 firearms. According to ATF, these survey results were invaluable in formulating the National Firearms Program.", "As part of ATF\u2019s National Firearms Program, ATF developed a number of regulatory enforcement strategies, including targeting federal firearms dealer applicants and licensees for inspection, especially those in ATF-identified high-crime areas for full field compliance inspections and enhancing coordination with state and local officials. The focus of the inspections was to ensure that applicants and licensees strictly met the statutory requirements of GCA. In early 1993, ATF tasked its district and area offices with conducting preliminary inspections (telephone interviews) of all applicants for new firearms dealer licenses, regardless of geographic location; application inspections (full field, face-to-face inspections) if warranted based on preliminary inspections; and compliance inspections (full field, face-to-face inspections) of all applicants for renewal dealer licenses who were located in the 43 high-crime areas, were due for renewal, and had not been inspected within the past 3 years.", "ATF continued its National Firearms Program in fiscal years 1994 and 1995. In July 1995, ATF expanded its inspections beyond firearms dealer licensees to include other categories of licensees, such as manufacturers and importers, but not collectors of curios and relics. Also, in lieu of preliminary inspections, ATF increased its scrutiny of applicants for new licenses by requiring application inspections (full field, face-to-face inspections) of all applicants regardless of location.", "The number of ATF inspections of federal firearms applicants and licensees (all categories) increased from 19,910 in fiscal year 1992 to a high of 27,031 in fiscal year 1993\u2014the time frame during which the National Firearms Program was initiated. The number of inspections then dropped to 22,529 in fiscal year 1994 and 17,772 in fiscal year 1995.

The number of preliminary inspections conducted in fiscal years 1993, 1994, and 1995 was 25,922, 14,805, and 10,822, respectively. ATF generally did not use preliminary inspections before fiscal year 1993.", "According to ATF, a substantial portion of the 2,527 applications abandoned (see fig. 4) and 7,217 applications withdrawn (see fig. 5) during fiscal year 1993 was directly attributable to the initiation of the preliminary inspections.", "In addition to emphasizing that new and renewal firearms dealer license applicants qualified under GCA, the National Firearms Program also called for continued checks of other dealers for compliance with GCA. Dealers were targeted for compliance inspections on the basis of analysis of firearms tracing data, referrals from law enforcement, and other factors. The over 27,000 inspections of all categories of licensees in 1993, most of which were compliance inspections, resulted in the discovery of 11,149 violations of records and inventory requirements and 17,783 referrals to ATF criminal enforcement and other federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies. According to ATF, referrals increased by 13,030 over 1992 because of increased efforts under the National Firearms Program to coordinate more closely with state and local authorities.", "Also, as a result of ATF\u2019s compliance inspection efforts, a large number of firearms dealer licensees voluntarily surrendered their licenses in fiscal years 1994 and 1995\u20142 years for which the data were collected. For example, when a compliance inspection showed that a dealer was not \u201cengaged in a firearms business\u201d at the location shown on the license, ATF\u2019s National Firearms Program called for advising the dealer to voluntarily surrender the license, prior to implementing a formal revocation action.

The total number of federal firearms licenses revoked was relatively small\u2014less than 1 percent compared to the total number of inspections conducted. Under its National Firearms Program, ATF is to first seek voluntary surrenders of licenses rather than pursuing formal administrative actions to revoke a license to save the time, effort, and expense involved with administrative proceedings.", "To conduct increased firearms regulatory inspections, ATF devoted increased staff to the effort. According to ATF data, the number of ATF inspector staff years devoted to firearms regulatory activities increased from 90 inspector staff years in fiscal year 1992 to 114 inspector staff years in fiscal year 1994 and then dropped to 105 inspector staff years in 1995."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "ATF Revised Application Form and Process in Response to Presidential Memorandum", "paragraphs": ["In an August 1993 memorandum, the President directed the Department of the Treasury and ATF to take actions to ensure compliance with present firearms licensing requirements.

The President cited ATF estimates that 40 percent of licensees conducted no business at all and were persons who used the license to obtain the benefits of trading and buying guns at wholesale. The President listed a number of steps that ATF could take to ensure compliance with present licensing requirements, including revising the application process to require the applicant to supply all information relevant to establishing qualification for a license, and requiring more reliable forms of identification of the applicant, such as fingerprinting. (App. IV contains the President\u2019s Memorandum on Gun Dealer Licensing.)", "In response to the President\u2019s memorandum, ATF implemented a number of actions to improve the thoroughness and effectiveness of screening applicants for federal firearms licenses. For example, in late 1993 and early 1994, ATF significantly revised the firearms licensing process to obtain more information about applicants to determine whether they met the requirements of GCA. For the first time, ATF began doing criminal background checks on applicants applying for renewals of their licenses. Also, ATF substantially revised the application form by adding a number of questions and requirements for supporting information to assist it in determining whether applicants intended to engage in the firearms business. For example, ATF required applicants to (1) submit fingerprints and photographs of themselves, (2) furnish a diagram of the business premises where their firearms inventories were located, and (3) provide a description of their security system for safeguarding firearms inventories. Further, ATF stopped using its short application form previously used for renewing firearms dealer licenses and required applicants applying for renewal of their licenses to use the longer, more detailed application form. ATF\u2019s Firearms and Explosives Licensing Center began mailing out the application form (dated December 1993) in February 1994.", "Concurrent with implementing these substantive changes, ATF officials said they placed more responsibility on applicants to correctly and completely file applications and more emphasis on ensuring that all applicants complied with GCA. For example, ATF licensing examiners were instructed to return incomplete applications for licenses rather than attempt to correct them by telephone.", "As a result of the application form revisions, together with the increased license fees passed in the Federal Firearms License Reform Act of 1993 and new requirements added by the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (discussed below), ATF began experiencing backlogs and delays in issuing firearms dealer licenses. According to ATF, the backlog of applications was due primarily to the large number of incomplete application packages being submitted; approximately 80 percent of the applications were returned due to errors and omissions. In addition, ATF received numerous complaints from applicants about the complicated form and delays in receiving licenses.", "To address this backlog problem and related complaints, in July 1995 ATF again revised the application form for firearms dealer licenses and took steps to expedite the application process. Specifically, ATF reduced the number of questions and the amount of supporting documents and forms required in the application package. For example, ATF eliminated (1) questions requiring a diagram of the premises, a description of the security system, and a description of restrictions and ordinances relating to conducting a business; and (2) the requirement for supporting documents, such as lease agreements.

Under its National Firearms Program, if ATF found an applicant/licensee was not in compliance with state and local laws, ATF inspectors were to advise the applicant/licensee that information on noncompliance would be referred to the appropriate state and local officials.

For example, we noted a memorandum dated June 16, 1993, from ATF\u2019s Associate Director (Compliance Operations) to All Regional Directors (Compliance) providing guidance on implementation of the National Firearms Program that stated \u201cur [ATF\u2019s] mission is not to put federal firearms licensees out of business, but to ensure that all licensees adhere to the requirements of the Gun Control Act (GCA).\u201d", "We interviewed the Chief of the Firearms and Explosives Regulatory Division, who was responsible for developing policy on firearms regulatory matters. We also interviewed ATF officials responsible for implementing ATF policy, including: (1) the Chief of the Firearms and Explosives Licensing Center and licensing examiners; (2) the Directors of the Western, Southwest, Southeast, and Midwest Districts; and (3) Area Office Supervisors and inspectors from the Los Angeles, Dallas, Atlanta, and Detroit Area Offices. These discussions indicated that ATF did not have a policy or an objective to reduce the number of firearms dealers by a targeted number.", "However, partly on the basis of the results of Operation Snapshot, conducted in 1992 and 1993, ATF recognized that its increased enforcement efforts would likely result in declines in the number of firearms dealers not engaged in a firearms business. ATF\u2019s report on Operation Snapshot stated that 46 percent of all licensees had sold no firearms in the previous 12 months, and another 34 percent had sold between 1 to 10 firearms.", "In addition to its own increased enforcement efforts, ATF attributed the declines in the number of firearms dealers to various other factors, particularly the Federal Firearms License Reform Act of 1993 and the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. ATF stated that it received correspondence from a number of applicants who cited increased fees, reluctance to provide fingerprints, and state and local restrictions as reasons for not pursuing new or renewal licenses. ATF also commented that a number of licensees were unwilling or unable to certify compliance with state and local laws, and ATF was therefore unable to issue new or renewal licenses.", "While ATF commented that it did not have empirical data to categorically show why licensees went out of business, it stated that many licensees had obtained licenses only to purchase firearms at a discount to enhance a personal collection. ATF stated that additional licensing requirements, including increased licensing fees and costs associated with compliance with state and local laws, negated the benefits of a license."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Various Organizations\u2019 Views on Reasons for the Decline in the Number of Dealers", "paragraphs": ["To help determine reasons for declines in the number of licensed firearms dealers, we obtained the views of representatives of seven organizations.

(App. VI contains descriptions of these organizations.)", "The firearms industry organizations and the NRA were of the opinion that the primary reason for the decline in the number of dealers was ATF\u2019s December 1993 revised licensing requirements and the related application form. They generally believed that the type and amount of detailed information required by the new form discouraged many persons from applying for or renewing a license. ASSC and NASGD, as well as Handgun Control, Inc., cited the requirements to provide fingerprints and photographs (subsequently enacted in the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994) as a major reason for the declines.", "In addition, IACP, an organization of police executives, also pointed to the overall tightening of the application process as a reason for the decline in the number of dealers. However, it did not believe that this or other additional changes were onerous burdens on legitimate business operations.", "Two of the firearms industry organizations\u2014ASSC and NAFLFD, as well as Handgun Control and VPC\u2014also cited the increased licensing fee authorized by the Federal Firearms License Reform Act of 1993 as a major cause for the decline in the number of dealers.", "Handgun Control and VPC believed other reasons for the decline were (1) ATF\u2019s increased enforcement of already existing laws, particularly the \u201cengaged in the business\u201d provision of GCA; and (2) the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 provision requiring applicant certification of compliance with state and local laws as a condition for federal licensing. IACP also cited this provision as a factor contributing to declines in the number of dealers. In addition, VPC attributed the declines to legislative and enforcement actions by state and local governments and law enforcement agencies to regulate the licensing of firearms dealers in their jurisdictions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Survey of Former Licensees Suggested Multiple Reasons for Declines in the Number of Dealers", "paragraphs": ["We conducted a telephone survey of a sample of former federal firearms dealer licensees to determine why they did not renew their licenses. We randomly selected 80 licensees whose licenses had expired between October 1, 1994, and March 31, 1995. We were able to reach 56 of the 80 (70 percent) former licensees. We asked the respondents for the reasons their licenses had expired, the average number of firearms they had sold a year, and any other comments they had about ATF. Since we asked an open-ended question about the reasons for the expiration of the license, our results are likely to underestimate the frequency of each reason. Also, because we introduced the survey as part of a study of how ATF administers the licensing process, reasons concerning ATF\u2019s role are likely to have been recalled more easily than other reasons. Because we were unable to contact 30 percent of our sample and the size of our sample was limited, the results should be interpreted cautiously. Finally, we cannot be certain that the reasons provided by these dealers would apply to those whose licenses expired at other times. (See app. I for more details on the survey and the sampling errors associated with each estimate; see app. VII for the survey questionnaire.)", "On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that 57 percent of former licensees would list federal licensing fees or other federal requirements as one of the reasons for not renewing their licenses; because of sampling errors, this figure could be as low as 43 percent. Aspects of the federal requirements mentioned include application filing requirements, amount of paperwork, fingerprinting, and diagram of premises. Most licensees who mentioned one of these federal requirements also mentioned at least one other reason for nonrenewal.", "We examined the other reasons provided by our respondents for nonrenewal of their licenses. For example, some licensees went out of business for unrelated reasons, or decided that they could not make a profit selling firearms. Some indicated they just forgot to renew their licenses. We estimated that 79 percent of former licensees believed that there was at least one reason, other than a federal requirement, for not renewing their licenses; because of sampling errors, this figure could be as low as 67 percent.", "As discussed earlier, ATF\u2019s Operation Snapshot reported that as many as 46 percent of dealer licensees were not selling firearms. Our survey results indicated that similar proportions of the former licensees in our sample period were probably not selling firearms. We asked our respondents how many firearms they sold in an average year when they had a license. On the basis of their responses, we estimated that between 27 percent and 55 percent of licensees had not sold any firearms in an average year. In addition, we estimated that at least 50 percent, and as many as 78 percent, of former licensees had sold fewer than six firearms in an average year. We also found that only 2 of the 56 former licensees had sold 100 firearms or more per year.

Handgun Control and VPC expressed concerns that \u201ckitchen dealers,\u201d those who operate out of their homes or vehicles, or at gun shows, were a major source of black market firearms used to commit crimes. The NASGD Executive Director stated \u201creductions in the number of non-legitimate firearms dealers has a direct impact on reducing crime.\u201d", "Several organizations saw declines as advantageous to regulatory enforcement efforts. The Executive Director of ASSC indicated that reducing the number of licensed dealers would allow better use of regulatory resources. The President of NAFLFD stated that with fewer licensed firearms dealers, ATF\u2019s firearms tracing operations should become more efficient and effective. IACP indicated that reducing the number of federally licensed firearms dealers would enable the limited number of [ATF] inspectors to do their jobs. Similarly, Handgun Control and VPC stated that when the number of licensed dealers was about 244,000, ATF could not effectively monitor them. They stated that with fewer licensed dealers, ATF would be able to more efficiently and effectively monitor dealer compliance with federal law. As a disadvantage, the President of NAFLFD raised a concern that reducing the number of licensed dealers too much could lead to an \u201cunderground economy,\u201d an environment where firearms transactions would go unregulated and firearms tracing would be difficult.", "Two firearms industry organizations\u2014NAFLFD and ASSC\u2014expressed concerns that a reduction in the number of retail dealers could negatively affect competition. NRA representatives said they were less concerned with the number of dealers than with ATF artificially reducing the number of dealers due to its policies and enforcement efforts. NRA indicated that as a representative of firearm consumers, it is vitally interested in ensuring that government policies do not have a detrimental effect on the legal supply and availability of firearms. The President of NAFLFD indicated that the smaller firearms dealers did not represent competition for successful storefront dealers; therefore, the elimination of smaller dealers would not affect the availability or prices of legally traded firearms.

We accessed policy and program documents through ATF\u2019s directive system, a computer database containing both current and obsolete policy directives. This database included ATF orders, briefs, and other memoranda. We also reviewed related materials that may have affected ATF\u2019s policies and procedures. For example, we examined a 1993 Presidential Memorandum, a 1994 speech by the Secretary of the Treasury, and various congressional hearings records. We also obtained and reviewed recent legislation dealing with the licensing process and discussed the implications of these laws with ATF officials.", "To obtain information on the number of firearms dealer licenses and the extent and nature of recent declines in the number of firearms dealers, we analyzed ATF data on the number of dealers; the number of applications received; licenses issued, denied, and revoked; and applications withdrawn and abandoned by applicants.

As agreed with the requester, we did not verify license and inspection data provided by ATF because of time limitations.", "To determine the factors likely to have affected declines in the number of firearms dealer licenses, we reviewed ATF documents and analyzed ATF data. We reviewed federal legislation and discussed ATF\u2019s interpretation with ATF officials. We also obtained the views of representatives of seven organizations representing the firearms industry, firearms consumers, law enforcement, and gun control interests. We judgmentally selected the organizations on the basis of our knowledge of their missions and objectives and on suggestions from the Subcommittee staff, ATF officials, and firearms industry representatives in an attempt to obtain a wide range of views. We obtained comments from representatives of the National Alliance of Stocking Gun Dealers, the American Shooting Sports Council, the National Association of Federally Licensed Firearms Dealers, the National Rifle Association, the International Association of Chiefs of Police, Handgun Control Incorporated, and the Violence Policy Center. (These organizations are described in app. VI.)", "To understand how ATF implemented its policies, we visited four ATF district offices, four ATF area offices, and ATF\u2019s Firearms and Explosives Licensing Center. We visited ATF\u2019s Southeast, Southwest, Western, and Midwest district offices and ATF\u2019s Atlanta, Dallas, Los Angeles, and Detroit area offices. We judgmentally selected the eight field offices on the basis of geographic diversity, significant declines in the number of dealer licensees, inclusion of both urban and rural licensees, and availability of our staff to conduct the work. We cannot be certain that our results apply to the other 33 ATF area offices. We also did some limited work at ATF\u2019s area office in New York City.", "During our visits to the ATF field offices, we interviewed both top management and other employees. We discussed actual inspection procedures with available ATF inspectors and supervisors to determine whether their views were shared by others. We obtained any guidelines concerning the licensing and inspection process that had been developed in each field office.", "To determine reasons some former licensees were no longer licensed, we conducted a telephone survey of a random sample of former licensees. We identified a universe of 36,614 licenses that were entered in ATF\u2019s database as having expired in the 6-month period between October 1, 1994, and March 31, 1995. This period was sufficiently distant to ensure that renewal applications were not still being processed, but sufficiently recent to enable respondents to remember why their licenses had expired. We selected a simple random sample of 90 licensees from the population of former licensees. Because of time constraints, we were unable to complete more interviews. Our results do enable us to make estimates to the universe of former licensees, although the small sample requires those estimates to be made with fairly large confidence intervals.", "Of the 90 licenses in the sample, 10 were not eligible for the following reasons: 7 actually had been renewed, 1 had expired more than 5 years earlier, 1 was pending renewal, and 1 was pending denial. After eliminating these 10, we had a sample of 80 to represent the licenses that expired during our 6-month review period. We were able to obtain survey information on 56 of these individuals, for a response rate of 70 percent. We conducted our telephone survey between October 1995 and January 1996.", "The survey consisted of four types of questions. First, we verified that the respondents did have licenses that expired in the period specified in the ATF database. Second, we asked for the reasons why the license had expired or had not been renewed. We asked this question in an open-ended manner and probed for more information or additional reasons. Third, we asked the respondent to provide an estimate of the average number of firearms sold in the years when the license was in effect. And fourth, we asked whether there was anything else the respondent would like to tell us about the licensing or inspection process, or about ATF. (A copy of the questionnaire form appears in app. VII.)", "Several aspects of the survey should be kept in mind in interpreting the results. We cannot be certain that the nonrespondents would have answered our questions in the same way as the respondents. When we compared respondents and nonrespondents using the limited ATF data on size of dealer businesses, we found that most nonrespondents (as most respondents) sold very few firearms. In addition, when we compared the reasons for nonrenewal provided by respondents who were harder to reach with those who were easier to reach, we found no remarkable differences. Despite these similarities, the possibility remains that those we did not reach may differ in other important ways from our respondents.", "In addition, we used an open-ended question to identify reasons for expiration of the license. We adopted this approach because we did not have time to conduct a pretest that could have identified a comprehensive list of reasons for a closed, check-list question. Using open-ended questions (rather than a list of items read to the respondent) is likely to result in an under-reporting of reasons. Therefore, we have not reported an upper bound for estimates of answers to this question. Also, the survey was introduced to the respondents as GAO\u2019s study of ATF. Given this context, it is likely that reasons related to ATF were more completely reported than were other reasons. We tried to partially balance this potential problem by probing for additional reasons after the respondents answered the question. Finally, our results apply only to licenses expiring between October 1, 1994, and March 31, 1995. However, we have no reason to believe that these results would be any different for any other 6-month period since the implementation of the relevant legislative and policy changes.", "In this report the 56 sample interviews have been used to provide estimates of the characteristics of the population of all licenses that expired during this period. All such sample results are subject to sampling error. This occurs because the sample results are likely to differ to some extent from the results that would have been obtained if all individuals in the universe had been contacted. The sizes of sampling errors depend largely on the completed sample size and the amount of variability in the data. In this report, all estimates have 95 percent confidence intervals of no more than plus or minus 14 percent. This means that, if we drew repeated samples from the entire study population, 19 out of 20 samples would produce estimates within 14 percent of the true proportion of the total population.", "In addition to the reported sampling errors, any survey may be subject to nonsampling errors. For example, differences in how a particular question is interpreted, in the sources of information that are available to respondents, or in the types of people who do not respond can introduce unwanted variability into survey results. To minimize nonsampling errors, we took several steps in developing and conducting the survey. We discussed the wording of our questions with ATF officials before finalizing the survey form. Interviewers were told to ask the questions as written, and follow-up questions were provided for the interviewers. In addition, a tentative list of reasons for expiration of licenses was provided on the interview form to facilitate the systematic interpretation of the open-ended responses. The completed survey forms were reviewed by two of our analysts, and all counts of responses were checked independently.", "To obtain information on whether ATF had a policy to reduce the number of firearms dealer licensees, we reviewed ATF documents\u2014memoranda, ATF briefs (which outline annual program requirements), annual operating plans and reports, issue papers, briefing papers, and firearms dealer application forms and standardized letters\u2014and interviewed ATF officials.
