It plans to fully implement the policy in 2024.", "Senate Report 115-262 included a provision that GAO review ongoing challenges in the Air Force RPA community. This report assesses, among other things, the extent to which the Air Force (1) met overall RPA pilot and sensor operator staffing targets and tracked its progress in implementing its combat-to-dwell policy and (2) identified and met instructor staffing levels at its RPA formal training unit. GAO analyzed selected Air Force accession, retention, and instructor staffing data; held non-generalizable focus groups at three RPA military bases; and interviewed officials at various levels of the RPA enterprise."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Air Force does not have enough pilots and sensor operators to meet its staffing targets for its unmanned aircraft\u2014also called remotely piloted aircraft (RPA). It also does not track its overall progress in accessing and retaining enough RPA personnel needed to implement its combat-to-dwell policy, which is intended to balance RPA units' time spent in combat with non-combat activities. Officials stated that to fully implement combat-to-dwell the Air Force needs to access and retain more RPA personnel because since fiscal year 2016 it has had fewer RPA personnel than authorized (see figure for RPA sensor operator example). The Air Force has provided financial incentives to address retention of RPA personnel, but it does not yet have enough historical data to help predict RPA pilot retention trends going forward given the newness of the career field. Officials additionally expressed specific concerns about sensor operator retention particularly due to the possibility of lucrative private-sector jobs. Further, the Air Force does not have a comprehensive metric (or set of metrics) to know whether its accession and retention efforts are on track to generate the additional RPA personnel needed to implement its combat-to-dwell policy by 2024. Without a metric (or set of metrics), it is unclear whether any adjustments are needed to meet its implementation timeframes.", "The Air Force has not fully identified the number of RPA pilot and sensor operator instructor positions needed at its formal training unit and since 2016 has experienced instructor staffing shortages. Specifically, the number of instructor positions required is understated because they are based on a 2009 program of instruction with 49 training days while the current program of instruction is 83 training days. Moreover, since fiscal year 2016, the formal training unit has had fewer assigned instructors than authorized positions even though those numbers of instructor positions are underestimates of actual needs. To help address the effect of the instructor gap, officials temporarily reduced the length of training. Without updated information to inform the number of required instructors, the Air Force does not know the correct number of instructor positions necessary to train RPA aircrews to be ready to complete their mission."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Air Force establish a comprehensive metric (or set of metrics) to track the progress of its efforts to access and retain enough RPA personnel needed to implement its combat-to-dwell policy, and update the number of required RPA instructor positions.

GAO continues to believe the first recommendation is valid, as discussed in the report."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["For about 25 years, the Air Force\u2019s use of various unmanned aircraft,  which it commonly calls Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA), has enabled it to  counter threats by providing intelligence and surveillance 24 hours a day,  seven days a week, as well as delivering weapons on targets as needed.  RPA aircrews consist of two people\u2014a pilot who in most cases is a rated  officer (i.e., an officer possessing aviation expertise) and a sensor  operator who is an enlisted servicemember. The pilot flies the aircraft  and the sensor operator controls the aircraft\u2019s sensors that record video  and other intelligence information. Since the attacks of September 2001,  the demand for RPAs and skilled RPA pilots and sensor operators has  grown dramatically. To meet this personnel demand, the Air Force  depends on a combination of accessing new recruits, training them, and retaining sufficient quantities of pilots and sensor operators with specific  skills and competencies while also addressing their health and wellness.", "In late 2015, the Air Force\u2019s Air Combat Command established the  Culture and Process Improvement Program (CPIP), which identified  concerns and issues affecting units specifically operating the Air Force\u2019s  attack RPAs. The CPIP identified that this RPA workforce lacked an  established requirement for \u201cdwell time\u201d\u2014the time a unit spends in non- combat operations, such as training. Following a state of constant surge  since 2007 and having RPA units engaged in continuous combat  operations, the Chief of Staff of the Air Force in January 2017 approved a  combat-to-dwell policy for specific RPA units that allows a unit to focus  either on combat or training, not both simultaneously. This new policy was  developed because the traditional Department of Defense (DOD)  deployment-to-dwell policy did not apply to the in-garrison combat  operations that the attack RPA units conduct within the United States.  This combat-to-dwell policy will provide these attack RPA units  reconstitution and readiness opportunities, such as mission qualification  training; upgrade training; continuation training; professional military  education; and leave. The Air Force plans to implement this policy fully in  fiscal year 2024.", "Since at least 2013, Congress has expressed concern over various Air  Force RPA personnel issues such as whether the Air Force has an  adequate number of RPA pilots; their education and promotion rates; and  other training-related challenges. Congress has also taken various  legislative actions related to the oversight of RPA personnel issues,  including increasing the maximum amount of aviation financial incentives  for RPA pilots as a result of the National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2016. Further, in July 2017, a congressional committee  directed the Air Force to provide a report explaining actions it was taking  to address RPA pilot retention and the mental health of RPA pilots and  airmen. As of February 2020, the Air Force had not provided us this  report.", "In our prior work, we have noted the high work demands and stress levels  among RPA aircrews and challenges associated with the management of  the RPA career field. In April 2014, we found shortages of RPA pilots and  that the Air Force faced challenges recruiting, developing, and retaining  pilots and building their morale. The Air Force has implemented six of  the seven recommendations we made in our report. Additionally, in May  2015, we reported that the Air Force had staffed its RPA training  squadrons at Holloman Air Force Base at 63 percent of its planned  staffing levels. This shortage was a key reason that the Air Force had  shortages of RPA pilots across the service, according to an Air Force  Headquarters official.", "Further, in January 2017, we found, among other things, that the Air  Force had not fully tailored a human capital planning strategy to address  persistent gaps in the number of RPA pilots. In that report, we directed  three recommendations to the Air Force. Although the Air Force has not  fully implemented any of these recommendations as of February 2020, it  has taken some steps to (1) expand its strategy to address additional  issues affecting RPA pilot shortages; (2) monitor how its efforts to  implement its strategy is achieving the intended goals; and (3) explore the  potential use of additional financial and non-financial incentives that  would enable it to increase the RPA pilot workforce.", "The Senate Armed Services Committee report accompanying a bill for the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 included a  provision for us to review the ongoing challenges in the Air Force RPA  community. In this report, we assessed the extent to which the Air Force  (1) met its overall RPA pilot and sensor operator staffing targets and  tracked its progress in implementing its combat-to-dwell policy; (2)  identified and met its RPA pilot and sensor operator instructor staffing  levels at its RPA formal training unit; and (3) addressed quality of life  issues affecting its RPA workforce.", "While the Air Force targeted its efforts to develop improvements for the  challenges specifically affecting its MQ-1 Predator and MQ-9 Reaper  RPA communities, the Air Force retired its MQ-1 Predator RPA in 2018.  Therefore, we focused our review on the MQ-9 Reaper RPA community.", "As part of our first objective, we evaluated the Air Force\u2019s accession  efforts to obtain sufficient quantities of RPA pilots and sensor operators  and its ability to meet established staffing levels. First, we compared the  number of RPA pilots and sensor operators who entered active duty with  the numbers in the Air Force\u2019s accession targets for fiscal years 2015  through 2019 to determine how consistently the Air Force met those  targets. Additionally, we obtained data on staffing requirements,  authorizations, and numbers of assigned RPA pilots and sensor operators  for fiscal years 2016 through 2019. We compared the number of RPA  pilots and sensor operators assigned to their respective authorizations to  determine how consistently the Air Force met those targets. We also  interviewed officials from Headquarters Air Force to obtain their  perspectives on accession-related issues and officials from Air Combat  Command, and Air Force Special Operations Command to obtain their  perspectives on RPA pilots and sensor operators staffing issues.", "As part of the first objective, we also evaluated the Air Force\u2019s retention  efforts to obtain sufficient quantities of RPA pilots and sensor operators.  Regarding the retention financial incentives the Air Force has offered to  RPA pilots, we analyzed information about the following availabilities for  fiscal years 2015 through 2018: (1) Aviation Retention Pay; (2) Aviation  Career Incentive Pay, also known as Aviator Pay; (3) RPA Assignment  Incentive Pay; (4) Critical Skills Retention Bonuses; (5) Aviation Bonuses;  and (6) Aviation Incentive Pay. Regarding RPA sensor operators, we  analyzed information about the availability of the following financial  incentives: (1) RPA Sensor Operator Incentive Program; (2) Critical Skills  Incentive Pay; (3) Selective Retention Bonuses; and (4) Special Duty  Assignment Pay.", "Further, regarding metrics and other information the Air Force uses to  measure RPA pilot and sensor operator retention, we interviewed  Headquarters Air Force officials regarding any retention goals set for  each group. Next, we analyzed data from the Air Force\u2019s Rated Officer  Retention Analysis reports for fiscal years 2015 through most of fiscal  year 2019 regarding the acceptance rates of aviation retention bonuses  by RPA pilots. Regarding sensor operators, we analyzed sensor operator  reenlistment data for fiscal year 2014 through most of fiscal year 2019  and calculated various measures of sensor operator retention. We also  conducted interviews with officials at Headquarters Air Force; Air Combat  Command; Air Force Special Operations Command; and Air Force  Personnel Center about RPA pilot and sensor operator retention-related  issues.", "As another part of the first objective, we discussed with Headquarters Air  Force officials what metrics or measures they use to track their progress  in implementing the Air Force\u2019s policy to better balance RPA personnel\u2019s  involvement between combat and non-combat operations, known as the  combat-to-dwell policy. We compared the Air Force\u2019s efforts to monitor its  overall progress in balancing its accession and retention efforts to obtain  sufficient quantities of RPA pilots and sensor operators needed to  implement the combat-to-dwell policy against the timeline goal  established by the Air Force. We also compared their efforts to  requirements in the Standards of Internal Control in the Federal  Government, which states that management should review actual  performance, track achievements, and compare them to plans, goals, and  objectives.", "For the second objective, we obtained information describing how the  number of required instructor positions were determined at the Holloman  Air Force Base, New Mexico, training unit and compared that process to  requirements in the Standards of Internal Control in the Federal  Government regarding the importance of management using quality  information to achieve its objectives. Further, we compared the actual  numbers of RPA pilots and sensor operators who were assigned to  instructor positions to the authorized numbers of these positions at the Air  Force\u2019s RPA formal training unit at Holloman Air Force Base for fiscal  years 2016 through 2019. We concentrated our analysis on the number of  instructor positions at Holloman Air Force Base because this location is  the largest MQ-9 Reaper RPA formal training unit in the Air Force.  Additionally, we obtained documentation of training processes for RPA  pilots, sensor operators, and instructors. Further, we interviewed officials  at Holloman Air Force Base officials from the 49th Wing leadership;  training squadron leaders; and pilot and sensor operator instructors and  students to better understand the training process, recent changes to the  process, the adequacy of staffing at the unit, and other issues affecting  the RPA enterprise overall. Further, we interviewed officials from the  Headquarters 19th Air Force RPA Training Branch, Air Force Education  and Training Center, San Antonio, Texas, regarding the overall RPA  undergraduate training process and curriculum.", "To determine the reliability of the data used in the first two objectives, we  assessed the data for errors, omissions, and inconsistencies; and  interviewed officials from Headquarters Air Force operations directorate,  Headquarters Air Force personnel directorate, and the Air Force  Personnel Center who were familiar with the systems from which the data  were extracted. We also used fiscal years 2014 through 2016 pilot  retention reports from our prior work on Air Force fighter pilots and the  applicable reliability assessment information. We determined that the  data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes of reporting overall  accession, staffing, and retention trends for RPA pilot and sensor operator as well as instructor position staffing trends at the Air Force\u2019s  formal training unit at Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico.", "For our third objective, we selected three RPA operational bases to visit  and across those locations, we conducted 14 focus groups with RPA  pilots and sensor operators. During these focus groups, we asked  questions to gain their experiences and perspectives regarding such  topics as training, quality of life issues, health and wellness issues,  availability of base support services, and positive and negative aspects of  being RPA pilots or sensor operators. We selected Cannon Air Force  Base, New Mexico, and Creech Air Force Base, Nevada, because they  have the largest population of MQ-9 Reaper RPA operators in Air Force  Special Operations Command and Air Combat Command, respectively. In  addition, we selected Shaw Air Force Base, South Carolina, to obtain  information from unit leaders and aircrew working at a base with RPA  operations newly established since the beginning of fiscal year 2018.", "The 14 focus groups we conducted ranged in size from five to 11  participants across the three sites, with 105 total participants. We  conducted five focus groups at Shaw Air Force Base; four focus groups at  Cannon Air Force Base; and five focus groups at Creech Air Force Base.  Of the 14 focus groups, eight focus groups were with RPA pilots and six  focus groups were with RPA sensor operators. The participants were  assigned to focus groups based on: (1) occupation as an RPA pilot or  sensor operator, (2) their rank or grade, and (3) for pilots, whether they  had prior experience as a manned aircraft pilot. We conducted a content  analysis of the comments from each of the focus groups by coding them  into a combination of seven primary and 43 sub-categories. Additionally,  following each focus group, we administered a questionnaire to  participants that included questions about such topics as their training  experiences and their perceptions of staffing in their units and the RPA  enterprise. The information that we obtained during the focus groups and  from the questionnaire reflect the opinions provided by a cross section of  RPA pilots and sensor operators who attended the focus groups at the  three locations we visited. However, our findings are not generalizable to  all servicemembers at these locations or to all servicemembers within the  Air Force. Further details about the focus group methodology are included  in appendix I.", "At the three RPA locations we visited, we also observed and recorded the  operating hours for selected base services such as the childcare, dining,  housing, and medical facilities on a data collection instrument to  document the availability of these services. In addition, we interviewed  senior and squadron leaders, health professionals and chaplains, and  base services officials at each of these locations. Further, we interviewed  officials at Headquarters Air Force; Air Combat Command; and Air Force  Special Operations Command about the Air Force\u2019s CPIP in addressing  quality of life issues affecting the RPA community.", "Additionally, through a literature search, we identified 87 separate journal  articles, studies, books, professional and academic publications, and  legislative materials, among other things, published as far back as 2010  that related to issues associated with RPA personnel workforce issues.  By a review of each item\u2019s abstract or full text, we assessed the  publications\u2019 relevance as high, medium or low to our engagement. From  that assessment, we identified 23 publications as highly relevant to our  engagement. We used these publications as background contextual  information to inform our review and, where applicable, in support of  findings related to the quality of life issues affecting RPA personnel.

A combat line is the measure of the capability to provide  near-continuous 24-hour flight presence of an RPA over a specific region  on Earth, to include time flying to and from a specific target area. In doing  so, the RPA can provide air action against hostile targets that are in close  proximity to friendly forces, gather intelligence, or, if necessary, employ its  weapons to strike identified targets. Additionally, the number of combat  flying hours has also increased from calendar year 2000, as shown in  figure 3 below, and reached 4 million cumulative combat hours in March  2019.", "In March 2016, General Herbert J.

To meet the demand for RPA pilots, the  Air Force has pursued efforts to increase the number of RPA pilots. For  example, the Air Force trained traditional manned-aircraft pilots to fly  RPAs and placed graduates of manned-aircraft pilot training into RPA  training rather than in advanced manned-aircraft training. In 2010, the Air  Force created a dedicated RPA pilot career field (i.e., 18X specialty code)  and developed a training program for pilots who specialize in flying RPAs.  In December 2013, there were 1,366 Air Force RPA pilots, of which 249  were dedicated RPA pilots (18 percent).

However, as previously discussed, RPA pilot requirements  have increased about 74 percent in the 5 years from fiscal years 2015  through 2019. Therefore, these Headquarters Air Force officials stated  that use of the 60 to 65 percent target may not be an appropriate target  for RPA pilot retention.", "In the case of RPA pilots, if the Air Force met that target, Air Force  officials said the service would still be understaffed due to the growing  requirements, so the retention target would need to be higher. Further,  they stated that while aviation retention bonus acceptance rates are  leading indicators of retention, they are not measures of actual retention  rates and there are limitations to using this approach. For example, one  limitation is that pilots may choose to stay in the Air Force but not take the  aviation retention bonus to exercise more control and flexibility over their  career. In these cases, actual retention would be higher than the aviation  retention bonus acceptance rate suggests.", "According to the Air Force\u2019s annual Rated Officer Retention Analysis  reports we reviewed, the combined aviation retention bonus acceptance  rates for RPA pilots both with and without previous manned aircraft  experience completing their initial service commitment were  approximately 55 percent in fiscal year 2016, 64 percent in fiscal year  2017, and 60 percent in fiscal years 2018 and 2019. Our comparison of  the aviation retention bonus acceptance rates for RPA pilots with previous  manned aircraft experience to those without that experience suggests  that the pilots without that experience have consistently had lower bonus  acceptance rates, as shown in table 1.", "As far back as April 2014, we reported that there were indications the Air  Force could be facing challenges retaining RPA pilots in the future.  Despite the existence of incentive payments, pilots in seven of the 10  focus groups we conducted at that time indicated that retention of RPA  pilots was or would be a challenge. We recommended that the Air Force  develop a retention strategy that was tailored to the needs and challenges  of the RPA pilots to help ensure the Air Force could meet and retain  required staffing levels to meet its mission. The Air Force took some  steps to address RPA pilot retention, such as expanding RPA operations  to an additional base to increase assignment choices and decreasing the  number of combat lines that RPA aircrews were flying to reduce their  workload. Further, in July 2018, officials said that the Air Force  established a new division at Headquarters to serve as a focal point for  overseeing RPA personnel matters for the service. Because of these  actions to address RPA retention, the Air Force met the intent of our  recommendation.", "However, in our current review, we found indicators of concern regarding  RPA pilot retention. For example, officials in varying leadership positions  in the Air Force raised concerns about RPA pilot retention. Air Combat  Command officials stated that they assume that about 30 percent of RPA  pilots each year will have to be replaced due to attrition. Senior leaders at  one RPA base that we visited told us that not having dwell time as a  break from constant combat operations negatively impacts RPA  personnel resiliency and retention. They said that to get a break from  combat operations, RPA personnel turn to the Air National Guard or  separate. They noted that people join the Air Force to see and do things,  not to be exposed to constant combat operations in less than appealing  locations. Further, according to RPA officials, personnel stated in exit  interviews that they wanted more temporary duty opportunities,  deployments, exercises, and other opportunities for better career  development. Similarly, senior leaders at another location we visited said  that the lack of training and leadership opportunities affects retention.  They noted that there are hundreds of pilots at Creech Air Force Base,  but only one wing commander, and this has a chilling effect given the  limited leadership opportunities available.", "With regard to RPA sensor operators, Headquarters Air Force officials  stated that the Air Force does not have an RPA-specific sensor operator  retention goal, but rather it generally aims to retain about the same  amount as other career enlisted aviator career fields have historically  retained, which is about 70 percent. However, according to a February  2017 memorandum, the RPA sensor operators experienced a steady  decline in retention since 2012. This memorandum requested Special  Duty Assignment Pay for RPA sensor operators stating that airmen in this  career field were placed under enormous personal and professional  demands. It also stated that in a 2-year sample, 2014-2016, the Air Force  Personnel Center reported a 31 percent reenlistment decrease for first  term RPA sensor operators, a 7 percent decrease for second term RPA  sensor operators, and a 16 percent decrease for career RPA sensor  operators.", "Specifically, the memorandum said that in 2016 the reenlistment rates for  RPA sensor operators were 44 percent, 54 percent, and 74 percent for  first-term, second-term, and career RPA sensor operators, respectively.  In comparison, these rates were 19 percent, 22 percent, and 16 percent  lower than the average rate across all Air Force Career Enlisted Aviators.  The Air Force approved this Special Duty Assignment Pay for RPA  sensor operators effective in November 2017. Additionally, effective  October 2018 and again in July 2019 and November 2019, RPA sensor  operators were eligible to receive Selective Retention Bonuses.  Coinciding with the start of these financial incentives in fiscal year 2018,  Air Force data showed increases in RPA sensor operator reenlistment  rates as compared to fiscal year 2017 reenlistment rates (see table 2).", "While Air Force data show improvements in RPA sensor operator  reenlistment rates, officials we spoke with shared concerns about  retention-related issues specifically regarding sensor operators. For  example, a senior leader at one RPA base we visited said that there is an  acknowledged retention problem within the sensor operator community  citing one of the factors being the perception among sensor operators  that private contractors pay more than the Air Force. An Air Force  document justifying the Selective Retention Bonus states that contractors  are targeting experienced RPA sensor operators for six-figure salaries of  greater than $100,000 per year.", "Similarly, a senior leader at one RPA base we visited stated that  contractors are paying sensor operators 2 to 4 times as much as the Air  Force does, essentially making the Air Force a pipeline for RPA  personnel to become government contractors. Moreover, participants in  each of the senior RPA sensor operators (i.e., E5-E9) focus groups that  we conducted told us that they thought the retention bonuses and  financial incentives were too small to matter in their retention decision- making. In a questionnaire we administered to the 105 participants across  the 14 focus groups, nearly half (19 of 41) of the sensor operators  responded they were \u201csomewhat dissatisfied\u201d or \u201cvery dissatisfied\u201d with  their total compensation versus 20 percent (13 of 64) of pilots who  responded they were \u201csomewhat dissatisfied\u201d or \u201cvery dissatisfied.\u201d"], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Air Force Does Not Track Its Progress in Implementing Its Combat- to-Dwell Policy within Its Projected Timeframe", "paragraphs": ["The Air Force does not track its overall progress of accessing and  retaining sufficient quantities of RPA pilots and sensor operators needed  to achieve its goal of implementing the combat-to-dwell policy in fiscal  year 2024.

One senior leader emphasized that  the Air Force made \u201cgetting to dwell\u201d its cornerstone promise.", "Officials stated that pilots and sensor operators are currently only able to  accomplish training that can be done while completing combat missions  because the RPA personnel are currently flying 24/7 combat missions.  The January 2017 combat-to-dwell policy emphasized the need for the  implementation of dwell time within the RPA community to allow these  units to focus on either combat operations or training, but not both at the  same time. This policy states that it is essential for preventing future risk  to the mission and preserving the combat capability of the RPA force.  Headquarters Air Force officials stated that they were hopeful that  implementing the combat-to-dwell policy would improve quality of life and  reduce burnout among RPA personnel by allowing them to take a break  from combat operations to give them time to rest and train.", "Officials acknowledged that poor quality of life conditions for RPA  personnel negatively affects retention. According to an Air Force  instruction related to the RPA community, it is important to build a  sustainable and healthy force and retention affects virtually all aspects of  the Air Force\u2019s effort to meet its goal of attaining the proper number of  aircrew personnel. Further, it states that understanding the connection  between the accession of new recruits, the training and production  requirements of new aircrew members, and the ability of units to absorb  newly trained aircrews into the structure and operations of the forces is  critical to maintaining a healthy aircrew force and to achieve Air Force  goals.", "However, the Air Force does not know its overall progress toward  achieving its goal of having sufficient quantities of RPA pilots and sensor  operators to implement the combat-to-dwell policy in fiscal year 2024 as  planned. Thus far, Headquarters Air Force officials said that the Air Force  has been focused on retaining as many RPA pilots and sensor operators  as possible in an effort to meet the increasing staffing authorizations. The  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that  management should track achievements and actual performance,  compare to plans, goals and objectives and analyze significant  differences. Specifically, officials explained that it does not have a  comprehensive metric (or set of metrics) which allows them to track  changes in the number of its RPA pilots and sensor operators from its  combined accession and retention efforts over a projected timeline. This  prevents the Air Force from being able to compare its progress against its  goal of having sufficient numbers of RPA pilots and sensor operators to  fully implement the policy as planned by fiscal year 2024. The Air Force  RPA officials stated that the Air Force does not have a metric (or set of  metrics) that measures a \u201cglide path to health and stability of the RPA  workforce\u201d by balancing both accessions and retention of RPA personnel  in order to know when changes might be needed over time to achieve the  goal of implementing the combat-to-dwell policy.", "Without such a metric (or a set of metrics), it is unclear whether the Air  Force is on track to have enough RPA pilots and sensor operators to  achieve implementation of its combat-to-dwell policy or to know if  adjustments are needed to its accession and retention efforts or to the  policy\u2019s implementation timeframe. Taking such action is critical for the Air  Force to be able to position itself to address long-standing RPA pilot and  sensor operator shortages and documented challenges in the  management of these communities through its combat-to-dwell policy.

Air Force documentation showed that if 100 percent  of the formal training unit\u2019s currently identified active-duty instructor  positions were filled, they could provide only 47 percent of the total  course instruction currently identified. To provide the rest of the course  instruction, the formal training unit relies heavily on contractors.

In 2015, top senior Air Force leaders  developed the Get Well Plan, and the Secretary of the Air Force and  other top senior leadership helped develop the plan\u2019s two goals to staff  100 percent of the positions for (1) instructors at the RPA pilot school and  (2) combat RPA pilots. In the March 2017 report to Congress, the Air  Force again emphasized that maximum instructor staffing was critical to  generating new RPA pilots and that it had achieved this goal as planned  and it would stabilize and sustain the Get Well Plan\u2019s goals into the  future. We found that both the number of RPA pilot and sensor operator  instructors assigned peaked at the end of 2016 and early 2017 in  accordance with this Air Force goal. However, the assigned numbers of  both RPA pilot and sensor operator instructors have not stabilized or  been sustained and have fallen since that time as shown in figures 8 and  9.", "Specifically, authorized RPA pilot instructor positions within the three RPA  training squadrons at Holloman Air Force Base (i.e., the 6th, 9th, and the  29th squadrons) were filled at 75 percent (110 of 147) as of September  2019. That fill rate is almost 20 percent less than the highest fill rate for  these positions in March 2017 (137 of 147, or 93 percent). Similarly,  authorized RPA sensor operator instructor positions within these same  training squadrons as of September 2019 were filled at 58 percent (82 of  141), down from the highest fill rate of 91 percent (128 of 141) in  November 2016. A training official explained that the inability to maintain  the level of staffing, even when considering it was an underestimation of  the true requirement, is an example of the issues experienced in the RPA  community. He stated that when RPA pilots and sensor operators at  squadrons leave the Air Force that means there are fewer of them overall  available to conduct the missions and to be sent to the formal training unit  to serve as instructors. Fewer instructors at the training unit means a  greater workload on the instructors already there, which affects the  morale of the instructors and may result in those individuals leaving the  Air Force. It also limits the ability of the formal training unit to meet the  expectations of producing newly trained aircrews that are supposed to fill  the staffing need at the squadrons. Overall, this cycle contributes to the  challenge the Air Force faces in being able to retain and produce RPA  pilots and sensor operators.", "Moreover, the gap in instructor staffing is compounded by a majority of  instructors arriving at the Holloman formal training unit not having prior  operational squadron-level instructor experience, according to training  officials. According to an Air Force instruction regarding RPA training, any  aircrew member designated for instructor duties at a formal training unit  should already be an instructor in the applicable aircraft. However, for  example, at Holloman\u2019s formal training unit, officials told us that for the  training session from August 2019 to May 2020, 17 of 25 of the new  incoming instructors did not have previous squadron-level instructor or  evaluator experience.", "In these instances, they said the new instructors would need additional  training to qualify them fully to teach certain classes. According to training  officials, being an instructor at a formal training unit is not the same as  being an instructor at an operational squadron. For example, in an  operational squadron, an instructor is expected to take an individual that  is fully qualified in the aircraft and get them up to speed on the squadron\u2019s  specific mission and to assist in increasing the squadron\u2019s overall level of  efficiency through continued supervised training. At the formal training  unit, however, instructors are laying the foundation for new aircrew  students that are not familiar with the aircraft, its operation, or its various  mission sets. Officials stated that because the formal training unit is  receiving inexperienced instructors rather than fully qualified ones, the  training unit must provide more upgrade training to these student  instructors to qualify them to teach any classes. While the instructors are  going through the upgrade and any other training needed to become fully  qualified, they are filling an instructor staff position but not fully  contributing to the development of new RPA pilots or sensor operators.", "Air Force training officials acknowledge that staffing at its Holloman  formal training unit is a concern and that they need more instructors. They  said that shortening the length of training was one approach to  addressing the instructor gap and, in June 2019, the commander of the  19th Air Force (Air Education and Training Command) directed syllabus  modifications. According to training officials, the modifications suspended  about 15 percent of the training and thereby, shortened the length of the  course.

This effort collected nearly 2,500 inputs  from the RPA community through surveys and in-person engagement.  Following this input, the Air Force developed over 140 initiatives to  address concerns in eight different areas, such as missions, quality of life,  locations and basing options, and training. These initiatives varied widely  in scope and specificity and they addressed the RPA enterprise, such as  pilots, sensor operators, intelligence personnel, and maintainers across  active-duty personnel and the Reserve component. In February 2018, the  Air Force briefed Congress, reporting that 57 percent of CPIP initiatives  were complete and 43 percent were ongoing. According to Air Force  officials, examples of initiatives completed include: expanding RPA combat operations to Shaw Air Force Base, South  Carolina, to provide additional assignment options; establishing an advanced weapons instructor course specifically for  redesignating MQ-9 Reaper RPA squadrons from \u201cReconnaissance\u201d  to \u201cAttack;\u201d establishing a medal to specifically recognize the contributions of  personnel that operate and support the RPA enterprise; and, authorizing RPA aircrews to log combat time when flying an aircraft  within designated hostile airspace, regardless of the aircrew\u2019s physical  locations.", "The CPIP report finalized just over a year later in June 2019 states that  the Air Force had achieved \u201can almost 90 percent solution\u201d and the most  significant of the initiatives had been accomplished.

However, we  found that while these services may exist at RPA bases, they are not  always accessible to RPA personnel or their families for a variety of  reasons, as we discuss below; an initiative to provide childcare support for workers performing 24/7  operations, although we found childcare was not available at certain  facilities we visited; and, an initiative to make Creech Air Force Base its own installation, add a  Missions Support Group, and improve base infrastructure and  services. Creech did receive its own command authority and is no  longer an auxiliary facility under Nellis Air Force Base and a Mission  Support Group was established in July 2019.

For example, during our visit to Shaw Air Force Base in  May 2019, a medical technician stated that Shaw had two medical  technicians for the RPA community though staffing documents state they  are supposed to have six medical technicians and two doctors. At Creech  Air Force Base, we visited the medical and dental facility and learned that  a psychologist position had been unfilled for 9 months as of our visit in  August 2019.", "We also found that the hours of available medical services are limited and  not convenient for shift workers such as RPA aircrews. For example,  officials at Creech stated occupational therapy is offered only once a  month, optometry twice a month, and nutrition on an as-needed basis. In  addition, Creech has two family health personnel, a behavioral health  officer who is available every Wednesday and Friday, and one flight  surgeon who comes over from Nellis Air Force Base is available twice a  week. A 2018 internal assessment done for Creech leadership estimated  that 20,714 man-hours are wasted each year due to personnel needing to  obtain medical services, the equivalent of losing 11.5 people in a given  year.", "To address health issues, Creech Air Force Base has a Human  Performance Team that includes chaplains, religious affairs airmen, a  psychologist, a mental health tech, and a physiologist. While team  members are physically located at Creech, they told us that they are also  responsible for RPA units at all the bases under the same wing, including  Creech, Ellsworth Air Force Base, South Dakota; Whiteman Air Force  Base, Missouri; and Shaw Air Force Base, South Carolina. Further, at  Shaw Air Force Base, a religious affairs airman made similar comments  about serving a large variety of military personnel, not just the RPA  community and a chaplain at Cannon Air Force Base said that he can be  assigned responsibility for up to as many as 2,000 to 3,000 people at a  time.", "Childcare is not limited for 24/7 shift workers at certain facilities although  a CPIP initiative called for childcare support for workers performing 24/7  operations, citing the Missile Care childcare program offered at Minot Air  Force Base. To this end, the Air Force established two programs, RPA  Care and RPA 2 Care. The RPA Care program provides additional care  outside the normal work hours at no additional cost to members who are  already purchasing full-time care from the Child Development Center.  However, in 12 of 14 focus groups we conducted, participants said that  they found childcare services were of low quality or limited for 24/7 shift  workers. For example, Cannon Air Force Base has two Child  Development Centers, but they operate Monday through Friday from 6  a.m.to 6 p.m., and focus group participants noted a long waiting list for  admission. At Creech Air Force Base, there is no childcare on base and  at Shaw Air Force Base, participants said it was difficult finding available  childcare to aid RPA personnel working shiftwork. For example, one RPA  aircrew member was permanently assigned to the day shift because of  childcare issues.", "Spouse and Family Support Issues  RPA personnel have complained about the issues associated with  working at remote location, such as the Creech Air Force Base, Nevada,  and Cannon Air Force Base, New Mexico, locations. In 9 of 14 focus  groups, participants made various comments regarding the limited  spousal opportunities and family support issues such as the following:  \u201cI got orders to Cannon\u2026. The problem is I\u2019ll be bringing my wife  there who has no job opportunities. There will be a lot of military  spouses competing for jobs. I\u2019ve already decided I\u2019ll leave at the end  of my contract and then will go to the Guard. I\u2019ve told my wife I\u2019ll get  out because I don\u2019t want to hurt her quality of life.\u201d  \u201cI loved the mission at Cannon, but the facilities and area and schools  are absolutely terrible.\u201d  \u201cI\u2019m fed up with Cannon and this area in general.\u201d", "RPA bases vary in housing available for personnel with Cannon and  Creech Air Force Bases reporting inadequate housing situations. At  Cannon, officials stated that lack of dormitory space was forcing first-term  Airmen off base. During our visit in June 2019, Cannon housing officials  provided a report that stated that the shortfall in dormitory space  continues to put Airmen and the Air Force Special Operations Command  mission at risk. The report said that the locations off base where first-term  Airmen can afford to live are usually in the worst crime-ridden parts where  there is a far greater propensity for trouble. This can create morale issues  and a distraction from the mission, according to the report.", "Additionally, Creech Air Force Base does not have any permanent on- base housing. At Creech, unaccompanied first-term Airmen must live in  the dormitories on Nellis Air Force Base, which is approximately 50 miles  away. The remoteness of Creech Air Force Base and the lack of basic  services offered only at Nellis Air Force Base creates an unusual level of  stress brought on by the added time, effort, and expense Creech Airmen  experience that those at almost every other continental United States  installation do not. In fact, a 2018 internal assessment for Creech  leadership calculated that a junior airman who must live at Nellis Air  Force Base would have a one-way commuting time of 63 minutes if they  drive a personal vehicle or 105 minutes if they take the shuttle. To help  address the housing and access to medical facilities, Creech Air Force  Base senior officials said that a plan to create officer and non- commissioned officer housing and a medical facility on the northwest side  of Las Vegas has been approved, but it is not expected to be completed  until between fall 2021 and fall 2022.", "Many of the RPA workforce issues we identified at the time of our 2014  review continue to exist today. These workforce issues include the  challenges to the RPA workforce\u2019s quality of life due to stressful working  conditions, including work shifts that frequently rotate, long hours, and  increased workloads. In 2017, we recommended that the Air Force should  monitor the extent to which its RPA human capital efforts are achieving  the Air Force\u2019s overall programmatic goals. The Air Force had not  implemented this recommendation as of February 2020. Because long- standing RPA quality of life and workforce management issues affecting  RPA personnel continue to exist, we believe that this recommendation is  still valid and would aid the Air Force in its efforts to address many of the  challenges facing this career field. Therefore, we are not making any  additional quality of life related recommendations."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["A healthy RPA workforce is one that balances supply with demand and  addresses quality of life conditions to motivate and sustain performance  and retention. Successful efforts to assess, train and retain RPA pilots  and sensor operators would allow the Air Force to grow sufficient  quantities of its RPA workforce to meet its goal of implementing its  combat-to-dwell policy. While the total number of Air Force RPA pilots  and sensor operators has increased between 2015 and 2019, the number  of positions required to meet the constant demand is increasing at a  faster pace. Additionally, the Air Force has not achieved its accession  targets for pilots and sensor operators for most of those years. Moreover,  the inability to use standard retention metrics due to the newness of the  RPA pilot career field is hindering the Air Force\u2019s ability to determine  accurately if sufficient quantities of RPA personnel are remaining in the  service to grow its RPA workforce. Further, the Air Force currently does  not have a comprehensive metric (or set of metrics) to track the overall  progress toward having sufficient numbers of RPA personnel through its  accessions and retention of RPA personnel to meet its prescribed  timeline for implementing its combat-to-dwell policy. This policy is  intended to balance the time RPA units spend in combat with non-combat  activities, to provide relief from those combat operations that it has  conducted constantly for many years, to improve the quality of life of  these RPA aircrew members. Without a metric, it is unclear whether the  Air Force is on course to achieve implementation of its combat-to-dwell  policy. As such, the Air Force cannot know if adjustments are needed  specifically to that policy and its implementation timeline or to its overall  personnel management efforts to access, train and retain sufficient  numbers of RPA personnel.", "Further, the Air Force previously prioritized having maximum instructor  staffing at the training units to help increase the production of new RPA  aircrews. However, the number of instructor positions required at the RPA  formal training unit at Holloman Air Force Base is out-of-date and does  not reflect what is needed to teach the current training curriculum.  Additionally, this formal training unit has consistently experienced staffing  shortages since fiscal year 2016. As such, without updated information,  the Air Force does not know the number of instructor positions necessary  for sufficiently training RPA aircrews and it may not fully address the  challenges affecting the training unit\u2019s staffing and ability to produce the  needed number of aircrews to support the continued demand for RPAs  and the implementation of the combat-to-dwell policy as planned.", "The Air Force developed initiatives with its 2015 Culture and Process  Improvement Program to address quality of life issues and other  challenges affecting the RPA community, but has not fully implemented  them. We also identified workforce management challenges in our  previous work. We believe that our prior recommendation that the Air  Force monitor its human capital efforts would help address these  challenges. We believe the Air Force should implement our prior  recommendation to aid the Air Force in its attempts to improve the quality  of life issues that still exist within the RPA community."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following two recommendations to the Secretary of  the Air Force.", "The Secretary of the Air Force should ensure that a comprehensive  metric (or set of metrics) is established to track the progress of its  combined accession and retention efforts to obtain sufficient quantities of  RPA pilots and sensor operators needed to achieve its objective of  implementing the combat-to-dwell policy as planned.

In  written comments reproduced in appendix III, the Department of the Air  Force partially concurred with our first recommendation and concurred  with our second recommendation.

Additionally, it expects that standard retention metrics used in  other rated career fields will provide increased utility as the RPA career  field matures. The Air Force acknowledges in its comments, however,  that these efforts could be better integrated to allow for greater analysis,  to include tracking progress in meeting the combat-to-dwell policy by  2024. We continue to believe that in developing a specific metric (or set of  metrics) the Air Force would be in a better position to evaluate the status  of its combined accession and retention efforts to obtain the proper  number of RPA personnel to achieve its combat-to-dwell implementation  goal.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of the Air Force.

These locations were: Shaw Air Force Base,  South Carolina; Cannon Air Force Base, New Mexico; and Creech Air  Force Base, Nevada. We selected Cannon and Creech Air Force Bases  because they have the largest population of RPA operators in Air Force  Special Operations Command and Air Combat Command, respectively. In  addition, we selected Shaw Air Force Base to obtain the perspectives of  RPA pilots and sensor operators working at a base with newly  established RPA operations since 2018.", "To obtain a balance of perspectives from RPA pilots and sensor  operators with varying levels of experience and responsibilities, we  conducted focus group sessions with active-duty MQ-9 Reaper RPA  pilots and sensor operators who were divided by their occupation, Air  Force Specialty Code, and rank at the selected locations. Specifically,  we used the following categories as shown in table 3 for the formation of  the focus groups.", "The 14 focus groups we held ranged in size from five to 11 participants  across the three sites with 105 total participants. We conducted five focus  groups at Shaw Air Force Base; four focus groups at Cannon Air Force  Base; and five focus groups at Creech Air Force Base. Of the 14 focus  groups, eight focus groups were with RPA pilots and six focus groups  were with RPA sensor operators. These sessions involved structured  small-group discussions designed to gather in-depth information that is  not easily obtained from other methods.", "We requested that our point of contact at each location gather  approximately 8 to 12 participants to attend the five pre-defined focus  groups. We conducted focus groups with RPA pilots and sensor  operators separately because they have different roles and  responsibilities and to encourage active participation and minimize the  risk of participants being the same group as immediate supervisors. We  segmented our groups by this characteristic in order to compare and  contrast their perspectives on training, retention, and quality of life issues  and to identify meaningful similarities and differences.", "Participants in the focus groups were not randomly selected by using a  probability sampling method, but recruited by unit leadership based on  shift availability and correspondence with the characteristics we  requested. Because scheduling availability was the primary factor  affecting participation, coupled with the fact that questions for focus group  sessions were not shared in advance, we considered the risk of  leadership selectively picking participants to be minimal.  Methodologically, focus groups are not designed to (1) demonstrate the  extent of a problem or to generalize results to a larger population, (2)  develop a consensus to arrive at an agreed-upon plan or make decisions  about what actions to take, or (3) provide statistically representative  samples or reliable quantitative estimates. Instead, they are intended to  generate in-depth information about the reasons for the focus group  participants\u2019 attitudes on specific topics and to offer insights into their  concerns about and support for an issue.", "A facilitator who used a standard script and list of questions to guide the  discussion and encourage participants guided the focus group  participants to share their thoughts and experiences. We confirmed at the  start of each session that participants met the inclusion criteria for the  respective group. Due to the low numbers of 18X pilot participants at the  O3-O5 rank and 11U/12U pilot participants at Cannon Air Force Base, we  conducted a focus group of the available participants together instead of  separately. Additionally, at Creech Air Force Base, we encountered three  situations where participants were currently full-time Reserve pilots, but  because all had former active-duty experience and dismissing them  would result in too few participants in the group, we allowed them to stay  in the focus groups in order to have a sufficient number of participants.  This situation occurred in the O1-O2 18X pilot focus group, the O3-O5  18X pilot focus group, and the E5-E9 1U0XX sensor operator focus  group. The core questions that the GAO facilitator asked during each of  the focus groups are listed in table 4.", "During the focus group meetings, three GAO members independently  took separate sets of detailed notes to document the participants\u2019  comments. Afterward, each member\u2019s notes were compiled into one final  official record documenting the comments made in each of the focus  groups we conducted. Then, these records were consolidated into one  database to be used for coding each comment and to facilitate the team\u2019s  content analysis of all the comments. To identify common categories and  themes from the participants\u2019 comments across all focus groups, the team  met, reviewed and discussed the official record of each of the 14 focus  groups. From that meeting, the team identified 43 categories across  seven areas of inquiry; see table 5 for a list of the categories and themes.", "Using the categories and themes identified, the team conducted a pre- test by having two groups of two coders independently code an identical  subset of the comments to determine their levels of coding consistency  and accuracy before attempting to code all 1,848 individual recorded  comments. After the pretest, the two groups split the list of comments in  half and each coder independently coded the comments contained in  their list into the categories and themes under which the coder believed  the comment fell. Once completed, the coders within each group met to  discuss any discrepancies in each of their coding and to make any  necessary adjustments in the coding. Where discrepancies could not be  resolved between coders, an independent third team member determined  which code would be used. Once the coding of all 1,848 comments was  finalized, the team\u2019s methodologist prepared a report that presented all  comments that fell within each of the categories and themes. The team  used this information as the basis for frequency tabulation and qualitative  analysis of focus group comments.", "In addition to discussing the RPA pilots\u2019 and sensor operators\u2019  perspectives in a focus group setting, we administered a questionnaire to  each participant at the end of each session before the participants were  dismissed. All participants completed the questionnaire. A GAO  methodologist with a social science background and knowledge of small  group methods and survey administrations reviewed the focus group  script and the questionnaire.
