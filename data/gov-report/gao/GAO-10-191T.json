USPS was not able to cut costs fast enough to offset declining mail volume and revenues resulting from the economic downturn and changing mail use. Facing an unprecedented cash shortfall, USPS stated that it would have insufficient cash on hand to make its mandated $5.4 billion payment to prefund postal retiree health benefits that was due by the end of the fiscal year. In July, 2009, GAO added USPS's financial condition to the list of high-risk areas needing attention by Congress and the executive branch to achieve broad-based transformation. GAO stated that USPS urgently needs to restructure to address its current and long-term financial viability. GAO also stated that USPS needs to use its flexibility to generate revenue through new or enhanced products. This testimony will (1) update USPS's financial condition and outlook, (2) describe changes made by the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act (PAEA) of 2006 that provided USPS with greater flexibility to generate revenues, (3) outline USPS's revenue-generation actions and results using this flexibility, and (4) discuss options for USPS to generate increased revenues in the future. This testimony is based on GAO's past and ongoing work."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["USPS's financial condition for fiscal year 2009 and its financial outlook continue to be challenging: (1) In fiscal year 2009, mail volume declined about 28 billion pieces, or about 14 percent, from the prior fiscal year, when volume was about 203 billion pieces; revenue declined from about $75 billion to about $68 billion. (2) A looming cash shortfall necessitated last-minute congressional action to reduce USPS's mandated payments to prefund retiree health benefits by $4 billion. In the absence of congressional action, USPS was on track to lose about $7 billion. (3) USPS debt increased at the end of fiscal year 2009 by the annual statutory limit of $3 billion, bringing outstanding debt to $10.2 billion. At this rate, USPS will reach its total $15 billion statutory debt limit in fiscal year 2011. (4) USPS projects annual deficits over $7 billion in fiscal years 2010 and 2011, and continuing large cash shortfalls. PAEA and implementing regulations gave USPS more flexibility to set prices, test new postal products, and retain earnings. USPS has broad latitude to set rates that take effect unless the Postal Regulatory Commission finds the rates would violate legal requirements, such as a price cap that generally limits rate increases for most mail to the rate of inflation. Except for annual rate increases, USPS revenue-generation actions since PAEA was enacted have generally achieved limited results compared to USPS's deficits. To its credit, USPS has taken actions to use its pricing flexibility to address the pressing need for additional revenue. These actions generated some revenues, although their positive impacts were overwhelmed by the recession--with its cutbacks in consumer spending and corporate advertising--and ongoing diversion of mail to electronic alternatives. Looking forward, USPS has opportunities to continue pursuing the flexibilities provided by PAEA to help generate additional revenue from postal products and services. However, results will continue to be constrained by the economic climate and by changing use of the mail. Mail volume has typically returned after past recessions, but much of the recent volume decline may not return. Increasing postal rates may provide a short-term revenue boost but would risk depressing mail volume and revenues in the long-term, in part by accelerating diversion of mail to electronic alternatives. USPS has asked Congress to change the restrictions established by PAEA so that it could offer new nonpostal products and services such as banking and insurance. Allowing USPS to compete more broadly with the private sector could lose money, and fair competition issues would need to be considered. Thus, in addition to its revenue-generation initiatives, USPS will need to continue making significant reductions in its workforce and network costs. When we recently added USPS's financial condition to our high-risk list, we said that restructuring will require USPS to align its costs with revenues, generate sufficient earnings to finance capital investment, and manage its debt."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to participate in this oversight hearing on  the U.S. Postal Service\u2019s (USPS) revenue-generation initiatives and  opportunities.

PAEA abolished the former ratemaking  structure that involved a lengthy, costly, and litigious process. Under the  new structure, USPS has broad latitude to announce rate changes that are  implemented in a streamlined process unless PRC determines these rates  would violate legal requirements. Key requirements and flexibilities  provided in the law include:    A price cap based on the Consumer Price Index generally applies to  market-dominant classes of mail, such as First-Class Mail and Standard  Mail. This means that in general, USPS has the flexibility to increase some  individual rates either above or below the rate of inflation as long as the  average rate increase for each class of mail does not exceed the cap.", "USPS can request that PRC approve a rate increase that exceeds the price  cap on the basis of extraordinary or unexpected circumstances (postal  stakeholders refer to this as an \u201cexigent\u201d rate increase).

In addition, competitive products must collectively cover what PRC  determines to be an appropriate share of USPS\u2019s overhead costs. PRC has  determined this share to be 5.5 percent of USPS\u2019s overhead costs. Within  these constraints, USPS was given broad pricing flexibility for its  competitive products, which are not subject to a price cap.

Although these actions generated some revenues, their positive  impacts were overwhelmed by the recession\u2014with its cutbacks in  consumer spending and corporate advertising\u2014and ongoing diversion of  mail to electronic alternatives. Further, the potential of some actions was  limited because they applied to types of mail that generate only a small  fraction of USPS revenues. Other actions, such as targeted sales for some  types of mail, were implemented this year with little advance notice, which  may have limited mailer response. Key USPS revenue-generation actions  since PAEA was enacted are summarized below.", "Rate Increases for Market-Dominant Mail: Under the ratemaking system  established by PAEA, USPS annually increased rates in 2008 and 2009 for  market-dominant classes of mail at virtually the maximum allowable  amount under the price cap. To put this into context, historically, rate  increases have been a key action that USPS has taken to remain financially  viable.", "Volume-Based Incentives for Specific Types of Market-Dominant Mail:  USPS has recently implemented three targeted rate incentives to stimulate  additional mail volume and take advantage of its excess operational  capacity.", "First, a 2009 \u201csummer sale\u201d for Standard Mail offered lower rates for  volumes that exceeded specific thresholds, with the goal of increasing  mail volume during a typically slow period.", "Second, an ongoing \u201cfall sale\u201d for First-Class Mail aimed at commercial  mailers is providing lower rates for volume over specific thresholds.", "Third, an ongoing Saturation Mail incentive program also is providing  lower rates for volume over specific thresholds.", "Negotiated Service Agreements (NSA) for Market-Dominant Products:  According to USPS data, its seven NSAs for market-dominant products  collectively did not generate any net revenue in fiscal years 2007 and 2008  combined. These NSAs generally offered mailers lower rates for volumes  that exceeded specific thresholds. Mailers also agreed to actions to reduce  some USPS costs, such as the substitution of electronic notices in lieu of  USPS returning undeliverable advertising mail.", "Rate Changes and Contract Rates for Competitive Products: Under the  ratemaking system established by PAEA, USPS annually increased rates in  2008 and 2009 for competitive products such as Priority Mail and Express  Mail. USPS also made product and pricing changes to enhance their  competitiveness, such as a new small flat-rate box for Priority Mail and the  introduction of zone-based rates for Express Mail. USPS has introduced  volume discounts for Express Mail, Priority Mail, and bulk Parcel Post.  USPS has also introduced lower rates for electronic postage used for some  competitive products such as Express Mail and Priority Mail. In addition,  USPS has entered into close to 90 contracts with mailers of competitive  products that included Priority Mail, Express Mail, bulk Parcel Post,  Parcel Return Service, and various types of bulk international mail. These  contracts are generally volume based and have provisions intended to  lower USPS\u2019s mail handling costs.

However, USPS has not presented a business plan which details what  markets it might enter, its prospects for profitability, and what specific  legislative changes would be needed.  Allowing USPS to compete more  broadly with the private sector would raise risks and concerns.

He explained: \u201cWhile increasing prices might have  generated revenue for the Postal Service in the short term, the long-term  effect could drive additional mail out of the system.\u201d Similarly, increasing  rates for competitive products such as Express Mail and Priority Mail may  provide a short-term revenue boost but risk long-term losses in mail  volume, revenues, and USPS competitiveness. Further, the short-term  impact of increasing competitive rates would likely be limited because  competitive products and services generate about 12 percent of USPS  revenue. USPS has not announced whether it will increase rates for  competitive products in 2010.", "Whether USPS should be allowed to engage in nonpostal activities should  be carefully considered, including its poor past performance in this area,  as should the risks and fair competition issues.

Questions include:    Should USPS be allowed to compete in areas where there are already  private-sector providers, and if so, on what terms?", "What laws should be applied equally to USPS and its competitors, such as  anti-trust and consumer protection laws?", "What transparency and accountability mechanisms would be needed for  any new nonpostal products and services to prevent unfair competition  and inappropriate cross-subsidization from postal products and services?", "Should USPS be subject to the same regulatory entities and regulations as  its competitors if it could compete in banking, insurance, and retail  services? Would the PRC have an oversight role for any new nonpostal  activities?", "If USPS used existing retail presence of 37,000 facilities to offer new  nonpostal products and services\u2014such as leasing or subleasing excess  capacity in its facilities\u2014would this be an unfair competitive advantage?", "How would USPS finance its nonpostal activities, considering its difficult  financial condition? Would USPS be allowed to borrow at Treasury rates  more favorable than those available to other businesses?", "In conclusion, when we recently added USPS\u2019s financial condition to our  high-risk list, we stated that USPS urgently needs to restructure to achieve  short-term and long-term financial viability. USPS has not been able to  cut costs fast enough or generate sufficient revenue to offset the  accelerated decline in mail volume and revenue. USPS restructuring will  require aligning its costs with revenues, generating sufficient earnings to  finance capital investment, and managing its debt.
