The Navy uses different maintenance approaches at each location depending on the number and type of ships based there and the Navy and private contractor industrial base available to provide maintenance support. For example, to support the 12 surface ships based in Yokosuka, Japan, the Navy uses both private contractors and its Ship Repair Facility and Japan Regional Maintenance Center, which is subsidized by the government of Japan. In Rota, Spain, the Navy relies on one Spanish contractor to maintain the four ships based at that location.", "Maintenance on surface ships based overseas took longer than planned for 50 of the 71 maintenance periods\u2014or about 70 percent\u2014started during fiscal years 2014 through 2018. More than half of these maintenance delays lasted a month or longer, which reduced the ships' availability for training and operations. Various factors contribute to delays, such as discovery that unanticipated additional repairs are needed, missed planning milestones, or shortages of key staff. However, the Navy's efforts to understand delays often solely focus on individual maintenance periods and result in steps to improve specific issues related to maintenance timeliness. The Navy has not conducted a comprehensive analysis of maintenance delays to systematically identify and address their root causes. Without such an analysis, the Navy cannot effectively target corrective actions, and risks continuing to underestimate maintenance needs and the time and resources required to address them.", "The Navy has developed a new maintenance approach for ships in Japan, but has not assessed the risks associated with this approach or analyzed the overseas maintenance requirements for a growing fleet. The new maintenance approach calls for ships to obtain all required maintenance in the United States before and after going overseas, among other things. The Navy decided to implement this approach in Japan based on use of the approach in Spain\u2014where ships have experienced few maintenance delays. However, the Navy has not assessed the risks posed by differences between the operating environments in Spain and Japan, or by shortfalls in maintenance capacity at U.S. facilities. The Navy also plans to replace aging ships in Bahrain as it grows the fleet to 355 ships, but it did not analyze or include overseas maintenance requirements in its long-range plan. Without assessing the risks challenges may pose to the success of its new maintenance approach in Japan or analyzing the requirements of a growing fleet, the Navy could be hindered in its ability to ensure these ships are ready and available for operations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making five recommendations, including that the Navy comprehensively analyze and address maintenance delays, and assess the risks and analyze requirements of future overseas maintenance efforts.

However, our prior work has shown that the Navy  has faced persistent challenges in maintaining its fleet. We found in 2015  that some ships based overseas had consistently deferred maintenance  that degraded their material condition, jeopardizing their ability to reach  their full service lives. We also found that the material condition of ships  based overseas worsened slightly faster than that for U.S.-based ships  over the preceding 5 years.", "In 2017, the Navy experienced four significant mishaps at sea, including  two collisions involving ships based in Japan, which resulted in the loss of  17 sailors\u2019 lives and serious damage to its ships. Subsequent Navy  reviews found that the Navy faced challenges balancing high operational  demands, training, and maintenance. Following these incidents, we  reported that the Navy continued to experience challenges and persistent  delays in maintaining its fleet. For example, in December 2018 we  reported that the Navy completed only 30 percent of submarine, aircraft  carrier, and surface ship maintenance on time from fiscal year 2012  through 2018, resulting in thousands of days that ships were unavailable  for training or operations.", "House Report 115-676, accompanying a bill for the John S.

The other amphibious ships based in Sasebo receive depot-level  maintenance that has been planned from about 2 to as long as nearly 9  months, but this does not include dry-dock maintenance. A unique  maintenance consideration in Sasebo is the deployment schedule of the  amphibious ships based there. These ships typically deploy three at a  time with U.S. Marines based in Okinawa on board. As a result, there are  times when all ships are in port and require maintenance, so the  detachment tries to stagger the work with the MCMs and closely  coordinate with contractors there in an effort to manage workload,  according to SRF-JRMC officials.

The Navy designed the maintenance approach for these ships with the  understanding that they would not require access to Navy- or contractor- operated dry docks during the time they are based in Spain, according to  Navy officials. The Navy initially expected these destroyers to be in Spain  for about 6 years and to receive maintenance every 2 years. However, in  2015 the Navy updated its maintenance strategy for these ships to  provide shorter, but more frequent maintenance periods to support a  longer time basing them in Spain.

According to maintenance officials in Bahrain and Japan, the  discovery of the need for additional maintenance and repair work after the  work planned for the maintenance period has been finalized is a key  driver of maintenance delays. This additional work can be in the form of  growth in the magnitude of planned work, or identification of the need for  new work that was not previously planned. For example, maintenance  officials in Japan attributed maintenance delays they experienced on  ships at both Yokosuka and Sasebo during fiscal years 2016 through  2018 to this growth in planned work or new work. Similarly, officials in  Bahrain said that growth and new work is one of many contributing  factors to maintenance delays for the aging MCMs and PCs based there.  For example, officials from Commander, Naval Surface Squadron Five  that track their ships\u2019 depot maintenance identified that additional work to  stern tubes on the USS Squall, which is homeported in Bahrain, resulted  in the ship\u2019s maintenance schedule being extended by 137 days. Navy  officials also stated that the reason growth and new work is such a key  driver of delays is that it can add further delays beyond that needed to  complete the repair, due to time required for additional contract actions  and ordering parts that are needed to conduct the added work. A  number of factors can cause or further exacerbate growth and new work,  according to Navy officials. For example, the Navy has made efforts to  catch up on backlogs of deferred maintenance and improve the health  and condition of the ship, so the Navy may decide to extend the  maintenance period to ensure all identified maintenance has been  completed rather than deferring it to a subsequent maintenance period.  Additionally, officials pointed to ships\u2019 complex propulsion,  communication, and weapons systems that have complicated  maintenance and modernization requirements that cannot always be fully  anticipated.", "Missing or late maintenance planning milestones. The Joint Fleet  Maintenance Manual emphasizes the importance of meeting planning  milestones to identify, estimate, and schedule the work to be done in the maintenance period. These milestones include steps to guide advanced  planning of initial maintenance requirements and schedules, and to  further refine and develop the work, cost, and schedule estimates for  each maintenance period. For example, these milestones include  assessments of the ship\u2019s condition and other ship checks to identify and  validate planned work intended to minimize growth and new work; to  identify and mitigate risks to planned schedules; and to provide deadlines  for developing and awarding contracts to do the work. Adherence to these  planning milestones becomes more critical as the planned start of the  maintenance period approaches to ensure work can be contracted and  begun on time. The final contract is awarded about 2 months prior to work  beginning, and the Navy finalizes the planned duration and schedule of  the maintenance period about a month before maintenance is scheduled  to begin.", "According to Navy officials, missing or late planning milestones can  contribute to maintenance delays. For example, NAVSEA and overseas  maintenance officials emphasized that getting on board a ship at various  points in the planning process to assess the ship\u2019s condition and validate  planned work is critical to developing accurate work scope, cost  estimates, and schedules\u2014otherwise, growth and new work or other  issues can emerge once maintenance is underway. According to the Joint  Fleet Maintenance Manual, ship checks are needed to inform specific  planning milestones, to validate planned work, and should be done as  early in the planning process as possible. The Navy requires this  validation to ensure needed maintenance work is sufficiently defined,  problems are accurately diagnosed, and feasible resolutions are  recommended. However, even though ship condition assessments are  important milestones to limit growth and new work, NAVSEA officials part  of Surface Team One said that these assessments and other checks are regularly postponed, which can prevent work from being identified with  sufficient time to plan for it. Similarly, maintenance officials in Japan said  that, due to the operational tempo in Yokosuka and Sasebo, ships are  often not available for required ship checks until the ship arrives in port at  the start of its maintenance period.", "Though officials could not provide the frequency that such milestones are  missed, they said missing assessments and other milestones can  contribute to schedule delays and result in maintenance periods  exceeding planned resources. For example, the Naval Inspector General  found that the shortage of personnel at the FDRMC and Fleet Logistics  Center in Bahrain resulted in contracting milestones being routinely  missed for ships based there, and once these ships were in maintenance,  the growth in work to be completed grew by an average of $830,000 for  maintenance periods in fiscal years 2017 and 2018.", "Shortages of experienced and skilled personnel for planning,  management, and oversight. According to NAVSEA and overseas  maintenance center officials, shortages of U.S. personnel that perform  maintenance planning, contracting, and oversight roles, particularly staff  with critical skills and experience, can affect ship maintenance and  contribute to delays. For example:", "Personnel shortages hinder staffing of project teams. FDRMC Bahrain  officials said that due to personnel shortages, they are often unable to  assign staff to the project teams until the maintenance period starts.  According to the Joint Fleet Maintenance Manual, a project team is  assigned to manage an individual maintenance period, and is  composed of personnel with specific skills and responsibilities.  Additionally, according to CNRMC Instruction 4790.4B, the project  team is responsible for key maintenance planning and execution  activities and related milestones from as early as a year before the  maintenance begins. CNRMC Instruction 4790.4B also states that  such maintenance planning milestones are to aid in developing  project plans, identifying and mitigating risks, and tracking progress of  planning. Project teams are also responsible for overseeing  contracted maintenance work and ensuring it meets quality standards.  For example, prior to the start of the maintenance period, project  teams are responsible for identifying and mitigating risks to  completing maintenance within the planned schedule and budget.  However, officials in Bahrain stated that as a result of persistent  staffing shortages, they have been unable to staff these project teams  until the maintenance period begins, and have also been unable to  provide sufficient oversight of the contractors\u2019 performance during the  maintenance period, which has resulted in maintenance delays.", "Shortages of personnel with relevant experience affect management  and oversight of maintenance. Officials in Japan and Bahrain stated  that insufficient numbers of personnel with ship maintenance  experience can negatively affect maintenance timeliness. For  example, the Fleet Logistics Center in Bahrain\u2014which manages the  contracting process for ships based there\u2014had only eight of 18  authorized U.S. civilian contracting-related positions filled, as of March  2019, according to officials. Additionally, of the filled positions, only  one contracting officer had prior experience with ship maintenance  contracting, according to Fleet Logistics Center officials. Officials in  Japan said that experience levels of U.S. civilians at SRF-JRMC have  decreased as a result of high turnover in recent years with the  average amount of work experience for U.S. civilians managing ship  maintenance in Sasebo declining from over 5 years in 2014 to 3 years  in 2017.", "Staff shortages on ships affect crews\u2019 ability to conduct maintenance.", "Navy officials also emphasized the importance of ship crews in  identifying and providing needed maintenance work, but noted that  ship crew shortages negatively affect on-board ship maintenance.  This can increase the amount of work required during depot-level  maintenance periods. In May 2017, we reported that reduced crew  sizes contributed to maintenance being deferred and increased  maintenance costs, and Navy officials and ships\u2019 crews we spoke to in  Japan and Bahrain stated that ships there continue to experience  manning shortages. For example, from September 2018 through  February 2019, nearly 30 personnel from Bahrain-based Navy  organizations were temporarily assigned to ships based in Bahrain to  fill manning shortages, according to Navy officials and information,  including for maintenance-specific positions.", "According to maintenance officials overseas and in the United States,  other factors also can add to the complexity of maintenance planning and  contribute to delays including the length of time it takes to obtain spare  parts overseas, availability of obsolete parts, and other challenges  associated with maintaining aging ships, such as the MCMs and PCs,  which are at or beyond their original service lives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Navy Collects Information on Overseas Maintenance at Individual Homeports, but Its Analysis of Factors Contributing to the Delays Is Limited", "paragraphs": ["The Navy uses a number of mechanisms to monitor the planning and  execution of individual maintenance periods to track progress and  mitigate possible risks.

Maintenance centers overseas and  in the United States monitor the planning and progress of individual  maintenance periods. SRF-JRMC officials in Yokosuka, Japan,  monitor ongoing and recently completed maintenance periods and  may identify technical causes for ship delays. For example, new work  was identified on the main reduction gear of the USS Barry that was  not in the planned work package and led to delays, according to  officials. Additionally, Commander, Naval Surface Squadron Five in  Bahrain tracks instances of growth and new work during the depot- level maintenance periods for the PCs and MCMs based there,  including tracking the specific number of delayed days attributed to  certain issues.", "NAVSEA conducts regular meetings to report status of  upcoming and ongoing maintenance. NAVSEA collects information  on and monitors the progress of individual maintenance periods,  including at overseas homeports, through a variety of regular  meetings and briefings. For example, NAVSEA 04 and CNRMC each  conduct biweekly meetings with their respective maintenance centers  to monitor advanced planning of upcoming maintenance periods and  the progress of ongoing maintenance periods for the ships under their  responsibilities, according to officials. Information shared during these  briefings can include tracking whether certain planning milestones are  met and identifying risks to the on-time completion of individual ships\u2019  maintenance periods.

According to the Navy\u2019s maintenance manual and related  guidance, the collection and sharing of lessons learned from individual  maintenance periods is to be part of certain planning milestones,  including to inform the maintenance schedule and work estimates. For  example, CNRMC Instruction 4790.4B directs that maintenance  completion conferences with relevant stakeholders are to provide a  detailed review of the maintenance period, including lessons learned  that can be used to plan future maintenance periods, such as to  revise specific work items. According to CNRMC and NAVSEA 04  officials, lessons learned are collected at the end of each  maintenance period and can be shared with other project teams. The  Joint Fleet Maintenance Manual also states that while the lessons  learned process is owned by the type commanders\u2014for surface  ships, these are Commander, Naval Surface Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet  for ships in Japan and the western United States, or Commander,  Naval Surface Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet, for ships in Spain, Bahrain,  and the eastern United States\u2014the lessons learned process is part of  the Surface Team One structure.

CNRMC tracks the costs  associated with growth and new work discovered during maintenance  periods by the regional maintenance centers it manages, including at  overseas detachments in Bahrain and Spain. The costs that are  tracked do not include information on any related delays, however,  and do not include these costs for the ships in Japan.", "Other recent Navy efforts have begun to examine issues related  to delays. According to Navy officials, several Navy entities are  beginning efforts to improve the execution of surface ship  maintenance. For example, in fiscal year 2019 the Navy began a  broad effort to improve Navy surface ship, submarine, and aviation  readiness, as well as public shipyards. This effort, called Performance  to Plan, designates Commander, Naval Surface Forces, and  Commander, NAVSEA, to improve performance of ship maintenance  in private and public shipyards. According to Navy officials, the effort  to improve surface ship maintenance consists of a pilot program  examining how to better execute maintenance periods for destroyers,  improve forecasts of maintenance period duration and assessments  of ship condition, planning for growth and new work, and adherence to  planning milestones. However, officials said this effort is still in the  early stage and does not specifically assess maintenance delays for  ships based overseas. NAVSEA\u2019s SURFMEPP and Surface Team  One also have recently begun related efforts. For example,  SURFMEPP officials said they recently began an effort to examine  and correct causes of growth and new work by analyzing changes to  contracts or work items that result in more than $100,000 of additional  cost. However, while officials said in July 2019 that this effort has  been underway for about 9 months, they could not provide additional  information on how it relates to delays. According to NAVSEA officials  that co-chair Surface Team One, it has begun an effort to improve  how adherence to key planning milestones is tracked across surface  ship maintenance periods. To support this effort, in October 2018 the  Navy updated the Joint Fleet Maintenance Manual to include  additional requirements for meeting maintenance milestones and to  document any changes, including reasons for those changes.  However, according to officials, these efforts are in their early stages,  and the Navy has not used the information to analyze maintenance  delays for overseas ships.", "Although a number of different Navy entities conduct a variety of activities  through which information on maintenance delays is collected and  analyzed, these efforts are limited as the existing analysis is not  comprehensive and systematic in nature. Specifically, the Navy has not  positioned itself well to address the factors contributing to the  maintenance delays because it has not (1) designated an individual entity  responsible for conducting a single, comprehensive systematic analysis  of overseas surface ship maintenance delays; and (2) developed a plan  based on that analysis to address these delays.", "First, this is in part because the responsibilities for managing surface ship  maintenance overseas is shared among NAVSEA 21, CNRMC, and  NAVSEA 04, which use somewhat different processes for their work,  according to officials. For example, NAVSEA 04 has responsibility for the  maintenance of aircraft carriers and submarines at naval shipyards, while  CNRMC focuses on surface ships. In addition, until SRF-JRMC was  brought under control of NAVSEA in October 2018, CNRMC was not  regularly including maintenance periods in Japan as part of its tracking  and monitoring of days of maintenance delay. According to officials, an  operating instruction to align roles, responsibilities, and processes for  surface ship maintenance in Japan between CNRMC and NAVSEA 04 is being developed, but as of September 2019, this instruction had not yet  been finalized. Further, CNRMC and NAVSEA 04 officials pointed to  NAVSEA 21 or Surface Team One as more appropriate entities to  conduct a comprehensive systematic analysis of ship maintenance delays  given their broad, enterprise-wide roles for managing and improving  surface ship maintenance.", "Surface Team One officials said that it could be an appropriate entity to  conduct such analysis, and according to its charter, one of the entity\u2019s  purposes is to measure performance of the planning and execution of  surface ship maintenance periods and to manage and improve schedule,  cost, and quality. However, officials said they have not conducted such a  systematic analysis of maintenance period performance or developed a  comprehensive plan to address them, in part due to inconsistent  organizational leadership and personnel turnover. According to officials,  since its founding in 2009, Surface Team One has been re-chartered  twice and is in the process of further reorganizing under a fourth version  of its charter. Part of the reason for this reorganization, according to  officials, is to resource and structure Surface Team One to conduct more  systematic, enterprise-wide analyses of issues affecting surface ship  maintenance, for which they hope to develop a plan by the end of 2019.  However, officials said these efforts did not specifically include analysis of  maintenance delays for ships based overseas. Additionally, while Navy  officials said that Performance to Plan efforts could help inform overseas  maintenance delays, this effort is in the early stages of a pilot effort  looking only at destroyer maintenance, and does not specifically analyze  maintenance delays for ships based overseas.", "Second, as a result of there being no single, comprehensive analysis of  overseas surface ship maintenance delays, there is no plan for the Navy  to improve the timeliness of its maintenance in a holistic way. Instead,  individual organizations and maintenance centers have identified  improvements for individual ships\u2019 maintenance or have undertaken  efforts to address certain contributing factors to delays. While these  efforts are important, given the interrelated challenges related to  maintenance across the Navy, and that the Navy is dependent upon  synchronized and timely maintenance to provide ships for operations to  meet national security needs, the Navy would benefit from a plan of  action that was comprehensive in nature.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state that  management should assign responsibility to achieve objectives and  remediate deficiencies; compare actual performance against planned  performance; and evaluate deficiencies on both an individual basis and in  the aggregate. Further, OMB Circular No. A-123, Management\u2019s  Responsibility for Enterprise Risk Management and Internal Control,  emphasizes that when developing corrective actions, agencies should  perform a root-cause analysis of the deficiency and ensure that  subsequent strategies and plans address the root of the problem and not  just the symptoms. Additionally, our past work on results-oriented  management cites a number of key practices that can strengthen the use  of performance information for process improvements. These practices  include aligning agency-wide goals and measures, and building analytic  capacity to use the information. Our past work has further shown this  information should then be incorporated into improvement plans that  include identifying analytically based goals; results-oriented metrics to  measure progress; required resources, risks, and stakeholders to achieve  those goals; and regularly reporting on progress.", "While several different Navy entities have a variety of efforts underway  related to issues associated with ship maintenance delays, without  designating an entity to conduct a comprehensive, systematic analysis to  identify and understand the underlying causes maintenance periods grow  beyond planned schedules, the Navy risks continuing to underestimate  maintenance needs and the time and resources required to address  them. Further, without conducting such an analysis to understand the  underlying, interrelated causes of these delays, and incorporating this  analysis into a comprehensive results-oriented plan to address them, the  Navy cannot effectively target corrective actions to improve timely  completion of ship maintenance to ensure ships are available for the  critical training crews need and operations to support U.S. military and  national security goals."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Navy Has Not Assessed and Mitigated Risks That Challenges Pose to Implementing Its New Maintenance Approach or Included Overseas Maintenance in Its Plans to Grow Fleet", "paragraphs": ["The Navy is in the process of updating the maintenance approach for  cruisers, destroyers, and amphibious ships based in Japan, but it has not  assessed and mitigated risks that several challenges may pose to its  successful implementation.

Specifically, the Navy  developed a new maintenance approach for the four destroyers it began  to deploy to Rota, Spain, in 2014 and 2015 that includes generally  shorter, but more frequent, maintenance periods. According to  maintenance center and other Navy officials, the Navy developed this  approach to avoid conducting dry-dock maintenance overseas so that the  Navy could maximize the time the ships were available for operations.", "According to officials, the Navy tailored this approach to the specific  ships, mission, and maintenance resources available in Rota. For  example, the four destroyers in Rota conduct patrols two ships at a time  with predictable patrol schedules. With such specific operational and  maintenance schedules officials said there is little margin for changes,  and adjustments or delays could affect the ships\u2019 operational availability  to support their ballistic missile defense mission. Under this approach, the  Navy completed the majority of its maintenance on these four ships  during fiscal years 2014 through 2018 on time\u2014with only 20 total days of  maintenance delay, equating to a relatively low overall delay rate of 2.2  percent.", "Navy officials said that the new maintenance approach in Rota has been  successful because the Navy:  selected four ships with a high degree of commonality; for example,  the ships were of similar age, systems, and equipment configuration,  which helped facilitate planning for and conducting maintenance; ensured the ships received all needed maintenance and  modernization before being sent to Spain, and arrived from the United  States in good condition, which reduced the likelihood that they would  require unexpected maintenance while overseas; designed the maintenance center and its staffing around the  maintenance approach for the four destroyers; and  coordinated with the contractor in Spain to ensure it had sufficient  workforce and resources, including capacity to surge resources if  additional work is discovered so that it can be completed on time.", "Based on the performance of the maintenance approach for destroyers in  Spain, officials stated that the Navy began to develop a similar approach  in 2016 for its ships in Japan. NAVSEA officials identified that shorter,  more frequent maintenance could help ensure that its ships based in  Japan received the maintenance they need, while also meeting their high  operational demands. The Navy finalized a new maintenance approach  for cruisers and destroyers in Yokosuka in December 2018, and was in  the process of finalizing the maintenance concept for the amphibious  ships in Sasebo, according to NAVSEA officials in June 2019. For  example, like in Spain, the Navy has adjusted the schedules for the  planned periods in Yokosuka to be shorter, but more frequent. Planning  documents show that under the new approach for the destroyers in  Yokosuka, the Navy plans to provide them with eight maintenance  periods over approximately 8 years overseas before rotating the ships  back to the United States. Previously, the Navy planned for destroyers in  Japan to receive eight maintenance periods over an estimated span of  over 16 years overseas under the prior approach. Under the new  approach, the surface ships in Japan are expected to receive all required  maintenance, including completing most or all backlogged maintenance  according to officials, in the United States before relocating the ships to  Japan. Additionally, while officials expect ships in Yokosuka to receive  some dry-dock maintenance during their rotation overseas, the  amphibious ships in Sasebo generally will not\u2014similar to the  arrangement for destroyers in Spain. As a result, the new maintenance  approach expects that ships in Sasebo will accrue maintenance backlogs  that must be resolved upon return to the United States."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Several Challenges Pose Risks to Successful Implementation of New Maintenance Approaches Overseas", "paragraphs": ["The Navy has decided to apply its new maintenance approach for  cruisers, destroyers, and amphibious ships in Japan and in 2018 began  initial implementation on certain ships already based there, but a number  of challenges may pose risks to successful implementation of the  strategy. Based on information from planning documents and officials,  successful implementation relies on several planning assumptions that  may be optimistic when compared to actual experience maintaining  surface ships overseas and in the United States. Specifically, the new  approach in Japan assumes that:", "Ships will receive robust, deep maintenance and modernization in the  U.S. and meet their life-cycle health requirements prior to overseas  assignment.", "Ships will receive and complete planned maintenance on time while  overseas to maximize operational availability.", "Ships will rotate back to receive full maintenance in the United States  after no longer than 9 years of overseas assignment.", "However, Navy officials and our analysis identified several challenges: (1)  U.S. industrial base maintenance capacity limitations, (2) maintenance  delays in the United States and overseas, (3) the ability of the overseas  contractor industrial base to support future workload in Japan, and (4)  differences in the operating environments between Spain and Japan.  These challenges, which are discussed below in more detail, could pose  risks to the successful implementation of the new maintenance approach.", "U.S. industrial base maintenance capacity limitations. Implementing  the new maintenance approach in Japan assumes that the ships  identified for deployment will receive all required maintenance and  modernization in the United States prior to being based overseas.  However, the Navy has been challenged to do this in the past due to  limited domestic maintenance capacity. For example, the Navy deferred  maintenance assessments of the condition of the USS Barry and USS  Milius that were to take place in the United States before moving the  ships to Japan. As a result, Navy officials said these assessments had to  be done in Japan. Additionally, upon arriving in Japan in November 2017,  the USS Barry had to begin immediate unscheduled maintenance to  correct various issues, and as of our visit in February 2019, was still  undergoing maintenance. According to U.S. Pacific Fleet and  maintenance center officials, in fiscal year 2014 the USS Curtis Wilbur  received modernization in Japan due to lack of capacity in the United  States.", "Further, Navy planning documents identified U.S. commercial dry-dock  capacity shortfalls that may hinder the Navy\u2019s ability to support the future  maintenance workload in the United States. For example, the Navy\u2019s  Long-Range Plan for the Maintenance and Modernization of Naval  Vessels for Fiscal Year 2020 identified limited U.S. dry-dock capacity in  the United States as posing a significant challenge to maintenance of  U.S.-homeported ships and that this situation reduces the margin for  schedule changes. According to the Navy\u2019s analysis, demand for surface  ship maintenance in the United States will exceed available maintenance  resources for fiscal years 2019 through 2026. During this time, the Navy  will be rotating ships based in the United States to exchange with those  currently based in Japan and Spain. Navy officials said the capacity  shortfall in the United States negatively affects ship condition and  maintenance of ships sent to Japan. However, the Navy\u2019s analysis does  not account for the need to perform deep maintenance and modernization  on ships in the United States before and after sending them to overseas  homeports, as required by the new maintenance approach for ships  bound for Japan, as well as Spain.", "Maintenance delays in the United States and overseas. Maintenance  delays at both U.S. and overseas homeports may also affect the Navy\u2019s  implementation of its new maintenance approach. Successful  implementation of the new approach depends in part on ships receiving  all required maintenance on time prior to moving overseas, as well as  receiving timely maintenance during their time based abroad. Our  analysis of Navy surface ship maintenance periods that started in fiscal  years 2014 through 2018 found that about 60 percent of maintenance  periods in the United States ran 31 or more days beyond schedule.  Additionally, our analysis shows that ships homeported at both U.S. and  overseas locations experienced an average rate of delay of about 25  percent (see fig. 7). Additionally, rates of delay in Sasebo, where the  Navy plans to implement one of its new maintenance approaches, exceed  30 percent.", "According to Navy officials, the new maintenance approach for ships in  Japan is intended to provide more frequent maintenance periods, in an  effort to improve ship maintenance and to maximize ships\u2019 availability for  operations. However, the approach also relies on most of these  maintenance periods being shorter\u2014and being completed on time. Given  the Navy\u2019s history of persistent maintenance delays in Japan, this could  be a challenge. Further, Navy officials said that maintenance delays  experienced in the United States could also affect the maintenance that  ships bound for and returning from overseas homeports may receive, and  pose a risk that maintenance will be deferred to overseas homeports.", "Challenges with overseas contractor industrial base meeting future  workload in Japan. Navy maintenance officials in Spain said that  successful implementation of the new maintenance approach there relied  on sufficient contractor capacity overseas, and that the Navy involved the  contractor in the development of the maintenance approach to ensure  they could implement it.", "In contrast, Navy officials in Japan stated that current contractor capacity  may not meet expected future workload. For example, Navy  documentation shows that contractors performed almost two-thirds of  ship maintenance in Sasebo in fiscal year 2018. Additionally, the  documentation shows that maintenance planned for fiscal year 2020 is  expected to increase beyond existing Navy and contractor capacity.  Maintenance in Sasebo relies on a number of smaller contractors, and  these contractors have experienced challenges planning for the  unpredictable maintenance workload there, according to officials.  Specifically, the amphibious ships based in Sasebo typically deploy as a  group of three. As a result, Navy officials said the workload in Sasebo  can be uneven. When all three ships return to port, they require  maintenance at the same time. The Navy found that contractors have  difficulty planning for this uneven workload, among other issues, which  can deter contractors from bidding on work. For example, in fiscal year  2015, the Navy found that they were unable to award over 25 percent of  work planned for contractors in Sasebo because no contractor bid on the  work. The Navy plans to add a fifth amphibious ship in Sasebo in fiscal  year 2020, in part to provide a more stable workload there, according to  officials. The Navy expects the additional ship will also result in a  forecasted increase in overall maintenance workload there.", "Navy officials also expressed concerns about the continuity of the existing  industrial base in Yokosuka to be able to support future Navy needs.  According to Navy documentation, in fiscal year 2018, about one-third of  ship maintenance in Yokosuka was conducted by contractors, and,  according to officials, the Navy relied on one main contractor to conduct  much of this work. However, Navy maintenance center officials in Japan  stated they have concerns about the continuity of the contractor to  support this workload. The Navy has begun efforts to consider conducting  maintenance at contractor facilities outside the ships\u2019 homeports of  Yokosuka and Sasebo. Specifically, the Navy has begun to consider  using contractor facilities located outside the Yokosuka area, as far as 2  hours away from where the ships are currently based. For example, Navy  officials told us that they conducted market research and outreach to  potential contractors, and have awarded a small contract for a short  continuous maintenance period to a new contractor about 30 minutes  outside the Yokosuka area. However, maintenance and contracting  officials stated these efforts face their own challenges. For example,  conducting weeks or months of maintenance on a ship as far as 2 hours  outside a ship\u2019s homeport\u2014where crews and families live\u2014could require  additional travel, housing, and other costs. Additionally, maintenance and  contracting officials in Yokosuka stated that the substantial regulatory,  legal, and Navy requirements that private companies must adopt to  contract with the U.S. government might serve as disincentives for  prospective Japanese contractors, and developing these contractors will  take time.", "Differences in the operating environments in Japan and Spain.  According to NAVSEA officials, the decision to apply the approach in  Japan was based on its timely performance in Spain, but the ships,  missions, and operating environment in Yokosuka and Sasebo differ  substantially from the environment in Spain. For example:", "Greater diversity and number of ships in Japan. Navy officials told us  that the four destroyers sent to Rota in 2014 and 2015 were  specifically chosen with similar age, configuration, and condition,  which made it easier to sustain the maintenance approach, since  issues and lessons from one ship could be easily applied to the next.  The ships in Japan in fiscal year 2019 consisted of a more diverse set  of ships\u2014eight destroyers and three cruisers in Yokosuka, and  various classes of amphibious ships in Sasebo. According to officials,  these ships are of different configurations and capabilities.", "Greater workload and staffing challenges in Japan. Navy officials  have attributed the persistent maintenance delays experienced in  Japan to insufficient U.S. maintenance prior to deployment,  insufficient estimation of the maintenance work package, missed  planning milestones, staffing challenges, and other causes, that are  not currently being experienced in Rota.", "Less predictability in operational tempo in Japan. According to Navy  officials in Rota, the four ships based there have the same mission,  regular and predictable patrol schedules, and do not go above Navy  deployment limits. Additionally, officials said the patrol schedules  allow for some additional maintenance to be conducted when ships  are in port, if needed. As a result, Navy officials in Rota said that they  are able to meet key maintenance planning milestones such as  conducting ship checks and other assessments.", "In Japan, however, Navy officials and operational commanders  described operational tempo as more unpredictable, and that ships  can be unavailable due to the operational demands of the varied  missions with different timeframes for ships in Seventh Fleet\u2019s area of  responsibility. For example, according to Seventh Fleet officials, the  cruisers and destroyers in Yokosuka are expected to serve a number  of different missions, including conducting patrols around Japan or  Guam; providing ship presence in the East China Sea; or escorting  the carrier as part of the strike group. Additionally, according to Navy  officials, operational tempo in Japan continues to be high, and in 2015  we reported that to meet increasing demands overseas, the Navy has  extended deployments and increased operational tempo.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state that it is a  key responsibility of management to analyze and respond to identified  changes and related risks, and to monitor program effectiveness.

However, maintenance center officials in Bahrain stated that as of  March 2019, plans for the overseas maintenance of littoral combat  ships remained uncertain, even though officials expect the initial  deployments of littoral combat ships to Bahrain to begin as early as  2020. Additionally, the Navy has not developed deployment timelines  and overseas maintenance requirements for littoral combat ships in  the Middle East and Western Pacific areas of operation, even though  the USS Montgomery arrived in Singapore to begin its overseas  rotational deployment in July 2019.

According to NAVSEA  officials, future iterations of long-term maintenance planning are to  include analysis of the Navy\u2019s overseas maintenance capacity, which  Navy officials said could begin in March 2020. As the Navy continues its  long-term maintenance planning, it will be important for the Navy to  conduct and include analysis of anticipated overseas maintenance  requirements given that substantial growth of surface ships is expected  through 2034\u2014including destroyers and amphibious ships, two types of  ships currently based overseas. Without analyzing maintenance needs  and requirements for ships based overseas, including any projected  growth or other force changes, in its long-range plans, the Navy cannot  ensure it is sufficiently planning for the total needs\u2014and resulting  readiness and health\u2014of the future fleet."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The Navy bases and maintains 38 surface ships\u2014such as destroyers,  cruisers, and amphibious ships, among others\u2014at homeports outside of  the United States. The 2018 National Defense Strategy has prioritized  military readiness, which depends in part on ships completing  maintenance on time, to ensure that the United States is positioned to  respond to events quickly all over the world. Ship maintenance is a  complex process involving numerous Navy and private industry  stakeholders that devote substantial time and effort to ensure that ships  receive the maintenance they need. Yet we have previously reported on  the persistent delays and other challenges the Navy faces in completing  maintenance on time both for ships in the United States and overseas.  While a number of entities in the Navy have different efforts underway to  examine individual ship maintenance issues, a comprehensive,  systematic understanding of the underlying and interrelated causes for  these delays is essential to implementing corrective actions to ensure  these strategically based ships are able and ready for operations when  needed.", "The Navy has also taken steps to adjust its maintenance strategies to  improve ship maintenance while balancing the high operational demands  for ships based in Japan. Additionally, the Navy has begun planning to  grow the fleet, but the expected increase in the fleet and associated  maintenance requirements for ships based and visiting overseas were not  included in the recent long-range plans. Also, the Navy\u2019s plans to  implement updated maintenance strategies overseas, as well as to grow  the total fleet, were developed without accounting for risks that challenges  may pose to these strategies, as well as analysis of the necessary  overseas maintenance requirements to sustain the Navy\u2019s strategically  important ships homeported or visiting overseas locations. Ensuring the  Navy\u2019s maintenance plans and capacity for the total fleet align with its  plans for substantial future fleet growth will enhance the Navy\u2019s ability to  conduct timely maintenance of its overseas surface fleet, which, in turn, is  essential to the Navy achieving its strategic goals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["We are making a total of five recommendations to DOD.", "The Secretary of the Navy should assign responsibility to an entity to  conduct a single, comprehensive systematic analysis of overseas surface  ship maintenance delays.

These ships comprised 38 of the 40 ships based overseas  during the time period we analyzed, and consisted of the following ship  classes: guided-missile cruisers (CG 47 class), guided-missile destroyers  (DDG 51 class), mine countermeasures ships (MCM 1 class), patrol  coastal ships (PC 1 class), amphibious assault ships (LHD 1 class),  amphibious transport dock ships (LPD 17 class), dock landing ships (LSD  41 class), and an amphibious command ship (LCC 19 class). These  ships were based overseas at homeports located in Japan, Spain, and  Bahrain as of the end of fiscal year 2018.", "For objective one, to describe existing capacity and maintenance  approaches the Navy uses for the regularly scheduled depot-level  maintenance periods for the 38 surface ships based overseas during the  time of our review, we reviewed Navy documents and information on the  Navy\u2019s overseas maintenance centers\u2019 physical capacity and authorized  workforce, local contractor industrial base and capacity, and other Navy  organizations and commands responsible for planning, managing, and  overseeing the maintenance of these ships. To examine physical  capacity, we analyzed Navy information on U.S. and contractor facilities  and equipment such as dry docks and information on future planning or  improvements. We reviewed NAVSEA information and data on ship  maintenance periods, as well as information and documentation on  historic and forecasted workloads at each homeport, including the  number and type of ships that have received maintenance at those  shipyards. We also reviewed Navy maintenance plans and guidance that  document Navy maintenance approaches and organizations at overseas  homeports. We conducted site visits to three overseas homeports\u2014 Yokosuka and Sasebo, Japan, and Manama, Bahrain\u2014where the Navy  bases a majority of the surface ships overseas. We observed the physical  capacity and operations of the maintenance centers and shipyards there,  as well as the Forward Deployed Regional Maintenance Center (FDRMC)  headquarters in Naples, Italy. We interviewed cognizant officials at Navy  commands, numbered fleets, and maintenance centers, including officials  at all the overseas maintenance centers responsible for ships based  overseas: the U.S. Naval Ship Repair Facility and Japan Regional  Maintenance Center (SRF-JRMC) in Yokosuka, Japan, and its  detachment in Sasebo, and the FDRMC headquarters in Naples, Italy, as  well as its two detachments\u2014in Rota, Spain, and Manama, Bahrain.", "For objective two, to assess the extent to which maintenance schedules  are completed as planned, we analyzed Navy data on regularly  scheduled, depot-level maintenance periods for surface ships\u2014including  those maintained at overseas homeports and in the United States.  NAVSEA collects and manages data on these maintenance periods\u2014 known as Chief of Naval Operations maintenance availabilities\u2014for  surface ships, submarines, and aircraft carriers. We obtained the data on  surface ship depot-level maintenance periods used by NAVSEA\u2019s Surface  Maintenance Engineering Planning Program and the Commander, Navy  Regional Maintenance Center (SURFMEPP). We used Navy data to  identify depot-level maintenance periods conducted at each homeport  starting in fiscal years 2014 through 2018 and to assess the extent to  which maintenance schedules for ships based overseas were executed as planned from fiscal year 2014 through 2018, and the delays  experienced.", "To assess the reliability of this data, we interviewed cognizant NAVSEA  officials to understand system operating procedures, organizational roles  and responsibilities, and any data limitations. NAVSEA provided  information based on our questions regarding data reliability, including an  overview of the data, data-collection processes and procedures, data  quality controls, and overall perceptions of data quality. NAVSEA also  provided documentation of how the systems are structured and what  written procedures are in place to help ensure that the appropriate  information is collected and properly categorized. We interviewed officials  from SURFMEPP and CNRMC to obtain further clarification on data  reliability, discuss how the data were collected and reported, and explain  how we planned to use the data. Some of these data were used in prior  reports, and their reliability had previously been assessed. In addition, we  also assessed the reliability of the data by checking: (1) for missing data  entries, (2) for duplicate records, and (3) to ensure the data was  formatted consistently. We determined that the data were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of summarizing surface ship maintenance  periods and related information at homeports both overseas and in the  United States, including reporting on the duration of maintenance periods  and the number of days of maintenance delays.", "Because maintenance periods may cross over one or more fiscal years,  to be able to report on days ships spent in maintenance periods from  fiscal years 2014 through 2018, we analyzed data on maintenance  periods that began in fiscal years 2012 through 2018 for all surface ships  included in the data, including those based at overseas and U.S.  homeports. Specifically, we used the dates of the planned and actual  durations of the maintenance periods in our data set to determine the  total number of days ships spent in maintenance in fiscal years 2014  through 2018 and by how many days the maintenance periods were  extended beyond their planned number of days\u2014which the Navy refers to  \u201cdays of maintenance delay.\u201d To determine the total number of days  ships spent in maintenance in each fiscal year, we allocated the number  of days spent in maintenance periods according to the fiscal year in which  the maintenance days occurred. After we calculated the number of days  each maintenance period went beyond the planned duration, we allocated  these days of maintenance delay to the fiscal years in which they  occurred. To compare ship maintenance delays experienced at different  homeports while accounting for the varying workload at each, we  calculated days of maintenance delay as a percentage of the total  number of days ships spent in maintenance periods each location, which  resulted in a rate of delay that we could compare across homeports. In  addition, we analyzed the number of maintenance periods that were  completed on or ahead of time or were completed later than planned, and  we examined these maintenance durations by the fiscal year in which the  maintenance periods started.", "We interviewed officials to understand the reasons they identified for  delays. We reviewed the actions the Navy has taken to identify, evaluate,  and resolve these delays, including information in Navy policies,  guidance, and documentation on the planning, management, and  oversight of overseas ship maintenance.
