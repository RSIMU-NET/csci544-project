Often  referred to as the replacement to Hubble, the JWST is more of a next  generation telescope\u2014one that scientists believe will be capable of seeing  back to the origins of the universe (Big Bang). The JWST will have a large,  segmented primary mirror\u20146.5 meters (about 21 feet) in diameter\u2014which  is a leap ahead in technology over the last generation of mirrors. The  observatory requires a sunshield approximately the size of a tennis court  to allow it to cool to the extremely cold temperature (around 40 degrees  Kelvin, or minus 388 degrees Fahrenheit) necessary for the telescope and  science instruments to work. The mirror and the sunshield\u2014both critical  components\u2014must fold up to fit inside the launch vehicle and open to  their operational configuration once the JWST is in orbit. In addition, the  observatory will house science instruments\u2014such as a near-infrared  camera, a near-infrared spectrograph, a mid-infrared instrument, and a  fine guidance sensor\u2014to enable scientists to conduct various research  activities.", "The JWST is an international collaboration among the United States, the  European Space Agency (ESA), and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA).  ESA will provide the near-infrared spectrograph science instrument, the  optical bench assembly of the mid-infrared instrument, and the launch of  the JWST by means of an Ariane 5 expendable launch vehicle. CSA\u2019s  contribution will be the fine guidance sensor to enable stable pointing.", "Recently, the JWST program recognized significant cost growth and  schedule slippage. In March 2005, NASA identified about $1 billion cost  growth, which increased the JWST\u2019s life-cycle cost estimate from   $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion. In addition, the program\u2019s schedule slipped  nearly 2 years. As a result, the program began a series of re-baselining  efforts to revise its acquisition strategy. In summer 2005, NASA  Headquarters chartered two independent review teams\u2014an Independent  Review Team from NASA\u2019s Independent Program Assessment Office and a  Science Assessment Team\u2014to evaluate the program. The Independent  Review Team was charged with examining the program\u2019s new  cost/schedule/ technical baseline and reported in mid-April 2006 that   (1) the JWST\u2019s scientific performance met the expectations of the science  community, (2) the technical content was complete and sound, and (3) the  Goddard Space Flight Center and contractor teams were effective.

The team recommended relaxing some science  requirements and simplifying other aspects of the mission, such as  integration and testing, to reduce the program\u2019s cost risk. For example, the  team recommended relaxing the contamination requirements, allowing the  project to test the mirrors using an innovative approach that will reduce  costs.

Although the  program began risk reduction activities early to develop and mature some  technologies, such as the lightweight segmented folding mirror, the  program is challenged with maturing some of its other critical  technologies. For example, the sunshield, which consists of five layers of  membranes, must be folded for launch but then unfurled to its operational  configuration\u2014with enough tension to prevent wrinkle patterns that could  interfere with the telescope\u2019s mirrors, but not so much tension to cause  tears in the fabric. The sunshield must also be aligned with the rest of the  observatory so that only the top layer of the sunshield is visible to the  primary mirror and a correct angle between the observatory and the sun  and other heat-radiating bodies is maintained to enable the telescope and  science instruments to preserve the very cold temperature\u2014about   40 degrees Kelvin\u2014critical for achieving the JWST\u2019s mission. In addition,  using passive cooling devices, such as heat switches, to allow specific  areas of the telescope to cool down, represent additional challenges since  these items will be used in new configurations. NASA also recently  substituted the cryo-cooler used for the mid-infrared instrument for a  lower technology component to save mass. According to JWST officials,  the program recently awarded the development contract for the cryo- cooler. In addition, the micro shutter array, which will allow the JWST to  program specific patterns of the electromagnetic spectrum for viewing, is  a new technology being developed by the Goddard Space Flight Center  and is still at a relatively low level of maturity. JWST officials acknowledge  that they are concerned about maturing the cryo-cooler and the micro  shutter array.", "In addition, the program also faces design challenges related to the launch  vehicle and the observatory\u2019s stability. For example, program officials told  us that they may need to request a waiver because the telescope will not fit  within the criteria limits of the launch vehicle\u2019s envelop without making  design modifications. Furthermore, due to the late selection of the launch  vehicle, the project office and prime contractor are just beginning to  discuss interfaces, transportation at the launch site, and the additional  space issue with Ariane 5 officials. Also, the project faces the unresolved  problem of finding the best way to keep the observatory stable. The large  sunshield, observatory attitude changes, and other effects conspire to  produce unbalanced torques, which can make the observatory unstable.  The project continues to look at ways to resolve this problem, including  thrusters to rebalance the observatory, but project officials say this will  continue to be a challenge.", "Another overriding concern is NASA\u2019s inability to test the entire  observatory in its operational environment, since there is no test facility in  the United States large enough to perform this test. The plan is to  incrementally test components and subsystems on the ground in  laboratories simulating the observatory\u2019s operational environment and to  make extensive use of modeling and simulation. According to the  memorandum summarizing the January 2006 System Definition Review, a  key concern is that the JWST is pushing the limits of ground test facilities  and cannot be tested at the observatory level; therefore, requiring  complicated integration and testing with a series of subsystem tests and  analyses.

About half of the cost growth was due to  schedule slippage\u2014a 1-year schedule slip because of a delay in the  decision to use an ESA-supplied Ariane 5 launch vehicle and an additional  10-month slip caused by budget profile limitations in fiscal years 2006 and  2007. More than a third of the cost increase was caused by requirements  and other changes. An increase in the program\u2019s contingency funding  accounted for the remainder\u2014about 12 percent\u2014of the growth.", "Despite an increase in the program\u2019s contingency funding, the  Independent Review Team found that the contingency funding is still  inadequate. In its April 2006 assessment of the JWST program\u2019s re- baselining, the Independent Review Team expressed concern over the  program\u2019s contingency funding, stating that it is too low and phased in too  late. According to the team, the program\u2019s contingency from 2006 through  2010 of only $29 million, or about 1.5 percent, after \u201cliens\u201d and \u201cthreats\u201d is  inadequate. The team also stated that a 25 percent to 30 percent total  contingency is appropriate for a program of this complexity. The  program\u2019s total contingency is only about 19 percent. The team warned  that because of the inadequate contingency, the program\u2019s ability to  resolve issues, address program risk areas, and accommodate unknown  problems is very limited. Therefore, the team concluded that from a  budget perspective, the re-baselined program is not viable for a 2013  launch.

Over the last several years, we have undertaken a body of  work on how leading developers in industry and government use a  knowledge-based approach to deliver high quality products on time and  within budget. A knowledge-based approach to product development  efforts enables developers to be reasonably certain that, at critical  junctures or \u201cknowledge points\u201d in the acquisition life cycle, their products  are more likely to meet established cost, schedule, and performance  baselines and therefore provides them with information needed to make  sound investment decisions.

Further, although NASA policy does  require project managers to establish a continuum of technical and  management reviews, the policy does not specify what these reviews  should be nor does it require major decision reviews at other key points in  a product\u2019s development. These best practices could be used to further  reduce program risks.", "In order to close the gaps between NASA\u2019s current acquisition  environment and best practices on knowledge-based acquisition, we  recommended that NASA take steps to ensure that NASA projects follow a  knowledge-based approach for product development. Specifically, we  recommended that NASA (1) in drafting its systems engineering policy,  incorporate requirements for flight systems and ground support projects  to capture specific product knowledge by key junctures in project  development and use demonstration of this knowledge as exit criteria for  decision making at key milestones and (2) revise NASA Procedural  Requirements 7120.5C to institute additional major decision reviews  following the NAR for flight systems and ground support projects, which  result in recommendations to the appropriate decision authority at key  milestones.

To achieve TRL 6, technology maturity must be  demonstrated in a relevant environment using a prototype or model.   (See app. II for a detailed description and definition of TRLs and test  environments.)", "A knowledge-based approach also involves the use of incremental markers  to ensure that the required knowledge has been attained at each critical  juncture. For example, exit criteria at KP1 should include demonstrated  maturity of critical technologies, completed trade-offs and finalized  requirements, and initial cost and schedule estimates using results from  the preliminary design review. The approach ensures that managers will  (1) conduct activities to capture relevant product development knowledge,  (2) provide evidence that knowledge was captured, and (3) hold decision  reviews to determine that appropriate knowledge was captured to allow a  move to the next phase.

For instance, the schedule called for convening the NAR before the  end of preliminary design. NASA policy indicates that the NAR and  Preliminary Design Review (PDR) should be aligned. Even at the pre- NAR in July 2003, the plan had been to have the NAR before the PDR,  although the two reviews were closer together than the more recent plan.", "During our review, we discussed these shortfalls with NASA officials. To  their credit, they revised their acquisition strategy to conform to NASA  policy. Currently, the mission NAR\u2014upon which the program start  decision will be based\u2014will be aligned with the mission PDR (scheduled  for March 2008). We believe this is a positive step, since it will ensure that  a preliminary design\u2014a key element for matching needs to resources\u2014is  established before program start. The revised strategy also splits the NAR  into two parts\u2014a technical NAR and a mission NAR. The purpose of the  technical NAR (scheduled for January 2007) will be to determine whether  the project has successfully retired its invention risk, i.e., critical  technologies have achieved TRL 6, according to a NASA official.  Technology issues will not be revisited after the technical NAR unless  problems arise. However, it is unclear if the critical technologies will be  demonstrated to a level of fidelity required by best practices at the  technical NAR. Furthermore, the strategy does not fully incorporate a  knowledge-based approach that could address the program\u2019s risks by  ensuring\u2014through the use of exit criteria\u2014that resources match  requirements in terms of knowledge, time, and money before program  start. For example:    Under a knowledge-based approach, adequate testing is required to  demonstrate that key technologies are mature\u2014at TRL 6\u2014prior to  program start. This is particularly important for the JWST, given the  program\u2019s challenges with testing restrictions and the fact that the  observatory cannot be serviced in space. In some cases, such as the  sunshield, backup technologies do not exist, thus increasing the  importance of adequately maturing and testing critical technologies. If  key components\u2014like the sunshield\u2014fail, then the entire observatory  will be lost. This requires greater fidelity in the testing, even as early as  demonstrating the maturity of key technologies prior to program start.", "To achieve TRL 6 (the maturity level required by best practices for  program start), technology maturity must be demonstrated as a  representative model or prototype\u2014which is very close to the actual  system in form, fit, and function\u2014in a relevant environment. However,  there is risk that the current JWST technology development plan will  not result in the appropriate demonstration of technology maturity. For  example, the half-scale thermal vacuum test of the entire observatory  at Johnson Space Center is currently planned for September 2008, and  so the knowledge gained regarding the maturity of the sunshield\u2019s  thermal and dynamic performance is pushed out 6 months beyond the  PDR/NAR/program start date of March 2008. When JWST program  officials briefed us in August 2005, the TRL levels for thermal and  dynamic performance of the sunshield were both assessed to be at TRL  4, and the plan to get to TRL 6 was to test these subsystems during this  half-scale thermal vacuum test. However, in fall 2005 program officials  reviewed the technology development plan and concluded that only the  materials for the sunshield\u2019s membrane are technology development  items, while other items affecting the configuration and deployment of  the sunshield\u2014such as thermal and dynamic performance\u2014are  considered engineering challenges. JWST officials stated that earlier  testing of sample materials demonstrated the sunshield\u2019s thermal  performance and a demonstration using a 1/10th scale model  demonstrated dynamic performance and satisfied TRL 6 requirements.  However, we have found in our best practices work that demonstrating  a technology to a TRL 6 typically involves demonstrating that a  prototype\u2014close to the form, fit, and functionality intended for the  product\u2014has been demonstrated in an environment that closely  represents the anticipated operational environment. In our past review  of development programs, we have found that if this level of maturity is  not demonstrated before a product development effort is launched, a  program increases the likelihood of cost growth and schedule delays as  it tries to close the knowledge gap between the technologies\u2019 maturity  level and the product\u2019s design requirements.", "The JWST program\u2019s inadequate contingency runs contrary to another  premise of a knowledge-based approach\u2014having sufficient resources  in terms of funding available to ensure a program\u2019s success.

The contract states that until the project achieves the  implementation milestone, contract spending is limited to formulation  activities, except for long-lead items and other activities approved in  writing.

These markers should include, but not  be limited to    schedules that demonstrate the maturity of all critical  technologies prior to program start;    criteria to ensure the validity of test articles;    criteria to demonstrate that mature component designs being  used in new configurations meet form, fit, and function  standards; and    criteria to ensure that sufficient contingency funding can be  provided and phased appropriately.", "Instruct the JWST program to continue to adhere to NASA acquisition  policy and base the program\u2019s go/no-go review (NAR) decision not  only on adherence to that policy, but also on (1) the program\u2019s ability  to demonstrate whether it is meeting the knowledge markers outlined  earlier and (2) whether adequate funds are available to execute the  program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on a draft of this report, NASA concurred with our  two recommendations and outlined actions that the agency plans to take  to implement such recommendations. NASA said that it endorses the  knowledge-based approach recommended and that it believes the current  JWST program plan is consistent with that approach.  NASA\u2019s recognition  of the value of obtaining knowledge prior to moving to subsequent  acquisition phases and acknowledgment that it plans to use exit criteria as  knowledge markers for other JWST mission-level reviews are welcome  steps toward establishing an agency-wide risk reduction culture. Now, it  will be critical for NASA decision makers to enforce adherence to the  discipline of the knowledge-based approach and ensure that critical  product knowledge is indeed demonstrated before allowing the JWST  program to proceed. In the years ahead, NASA decision makers will likely  face pressures to grant waivers for going forward with immature  technologies, allow programs to be restructured, and thus marginalize  accountability. For a program such as the JWST, whose investment is  already substantial and successful outcome eagerly anticipated by the  science community, adherence to such knowledge-based principles will  need to be strictly enforced. As identified in this report, NASA would be  well served by applying its own technology readiness standards (reprinted  in appendix II) as part of its exit criteria, and demonstrating that critical  technologies are at the TRL 6 level prior to program start using a  representative model or prototype\u2014which is very close to the actual  system in form, fit, and function\u2014in a relevant environment. Emphasis by  decision makers on the application of \u201cform, fit, and function standards\u201d  and \u201cvalidity of test articles\u201d as exit criteria for the JWST program start  and entry into Phase C will help address our concern that the current  JWST technology development plan may not result in the appropriate  demonstration of technology maturity prior to program start.
