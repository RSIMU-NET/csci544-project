Therefore, if unchanged, beginning January 1, 2000, these systems would interpret 2000 as 1900 and thus would seriously jeopardize critical tax processing and collection operations. Although 2000 is less than 2 years in the future, IRS has less than 1 year to complete all of the work that it believes is necessary to reach its goal of having all of its systems Year 2000 compliant by January 1999. IRS established this goal to help ensure that it can accurately process tax returns and other tax data through multiple systems by the start of the 1999 filing season.", "Our objectives were to (1) assess IRS\u2019 progress in converting its systems according to the guidelines in our Year 2000 assessment guide, (2) identify the risks IRS faces to completing the Year 2000 effort on time, and (3) identify risks to the continuity of IRS operations in the event of Year 2000-induced system failures."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The enormous challenge involved in making information systems Year 2000 compliant is managerial as well as technical.

The outcome of these efforts will also depend on the extent to which agencies have institutionalized key systems development and program management practices, as well as on their ability to execute large-scale software development or conversion projects.", "To assist agencies with these tasks, our Year 2000 assessment guide discusses the scope of these challenges and offers a structured, step-by-step approach for reviewing and assessing an agency\u2019s readiness to handle the Year 2000 problem. The assessment guide states that the Year 2000 program should be managed as a single, large information systems project. The assessment guide describes in detail the five phases of a Year 2000 conversion process (i.e., awareness, assessment, renovation, validation, and implementation). Each of these phases represents a major Year 2000 program activity or segment. To successfully address the Year 2000 problem, effective program and project management is required for all five phases. Appendix I contains a description of these phases.", "To make its information systems Year 2000 compliant, IRS must (1) convert existing systems by modifying application software and data and upgrading hardware and systems software, if needed; (2) replace systems if correcting them is not cost-beneficial or technically feasible; or (3) retire systems if they will not be needed by 2000.", "IRS\u2019 Chief Information Officer (CIO) established several parallel efforts to help ensure that IRS achieves Year 2000 compliance by January 1999. These efforts include creating the Century Date Change Project Office, which is responsible for coordinating the conversion of most existing information systems that can be made Year 2000 compliant as well as ensuring that all systems are converted in accordance with the same standards. The Century Date Change Project Office adapted our Year 2000 conversion model phases and established a 14-step process to track the progress of its Year 2000 conversion efforts. Some of the steps involved in converting existing systems include (1) converting applications; (2) upgrading hardware and/or systems software for mainframes, minicomputers/file servers, and personal computers; (3) upgrading telecommunications networks; and (4) ensuring that external data exchanges are Year 2000 compliant.", "The other parallel Year 2000 efforts are 2 major replacement efforts: (1) the replacement of the Distributed Input System (DIS) and the Remittance Processing System (RPS) with the Integrated Submission and Remittance Processing (ISRP) system and (2) the consolidation of the mainframe computer processing operations at 10 service centers to 2 computing centers. IRS personnel use DIS to input taxpayer data and RPS to input remittance data. According to IRS, these systems are old, and it is not cost-beneficial to make them Year 2000 compliant. Therefore, IRS decided to replace DIS and RPS with ISRP. A two-phase pilot of ISRP is under way during 1998 at IRS\u2019 Austin Service Center. Nationwide implementation is scheduled for January 1999.", "As a part of its mainframe consolidation effort, IRS is to (1) replace and/or upgrade service center mainframe hardware, systems software, and telecommunications infrastructure; (2) replace about 16,000 terminals that support frontline customer service and compliance operations; and (3) replace the communication replacement system that provides security functions for on-line taxpayer account databases. Replacements of the terminals and the communication replacement system are critical to IRS\u2019 achieving Year 2000 compliance.", "IRS is undertaking the non-Year 2000 aspects of mainframe consolidation because it concluded that consolidation would satisfy the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s Bulletin 96-02, which directs agencies to consolidate information processing centers; be consistent with IRS\u2019 planned modernization architecture; and save an estimated $356 to $500 million from fiscal years 1997 through 2003.", "IRS\u2019 original mainframe consolidation schedule called for moving mainframe computer processing operations and the communication replacement system from 10 service centers to 2 computing centers between December 1997 and December 1998.

In May 1997, IRS began assessing the date dependencies of applications for information systems that were controlled by either field offices or business functional areas (hereafter referred to as field/customer systems). As a result of the CIO and field/customer system assessments that were completed as of March 31, 1998, IRS had identified 127 mission-critical systems, including 7 telecommunications systems.", "As of April 24, 1998, IRS reported that it had completed the first 12 steps of its 14-step conversion process on applications for about 46 percent (59 systems) of its 127 mission-critical systems. In doing so, IRS fell short of its goal of having the applications for 66 systems converted by January 31, 1998. IRS\u2019 schedule calls for completing the first 12 steps for the remaining 54 percent (68 systems) of the mission-critical systems by January 1999. IRS officials said that they believe they are on track for meeting that goal.", "IRS is still in the initial steps of its 14-step conversion process for most of its systems software, hardware, and telecommunications network components. IRS is also still in the initial stages of converting its external data exchanges. Appendix II provides additional information on the status of the conversion process for each of these areas. Of these infrastructure areas, according to IRS, telecommunications networks present the most significant conversion challenge and may be at the highest risk for not being done by January 1999. According to IRS, the capability to exchange information, both voice and data, between various computer systems is the backbone of IRS\u2019 ability to perform all of its tax processing and customer service functions.", "IRS uses a telecommunications network that is supported through the Department of the Treasury and additional networks that are unique to IRS. As of March 10, 1998, IRS had an inventory of the components that are included in Treasury\u2019s network and was verifying a preliminary inventory of the components in the networks unique to IRS. At the time of our review, a contractor was doing a risk assessment to help develop a conversion schedule so that the most important work would be scheduled first to minimize adverse impacts if IRS is not able to complete all of its telecommunications work by January 1999.", "IRS\u2019 systems replacement efforts (i.e., ISRP and mainframe consolidation) are experiencing some delays. For example, certain ISRP software development that was to be completed in April 1998 is now scheduled to be done by June 16, 1998. As a result, the time available for testing before the start of the second phase of the pilot has been reduced. ISRP project office officials still anticipate that ISRP will be implemented nationwide by December 1998. The completion schedule for consolidating the data processing portion of service center operations has been extended from December 1998 until after June 1999. According to IRS officials, the need for this extension stems from numerous factors, including field office concerns about the ambitious schedule and expanded business requirements for security, disaster recovery, and testing. At the time we were finalizing this report, IRS officials said they were assessing various technical alternatives for meeting the expanded business requirements. They said they expect a revised business case and budget estimates that reflect the impact of both the schedule and requirements changes to be completed in June 1998. IRS officials said they expect to complete the Year 2000 portions of mainframe consolidation (i.e., terminal replacement and the communication replacement system) by the original completion date of December 1998.

According to our assessment guide, a master conversion and replacement schedule should be a part of an agency\u2019s Year 2000 program plan. This schedule could be used to (1) establish the sequential relationships among all of the tasks associated with all Year 2000 activities; (2) identify how much a task\u2019s milestone completion date could slip without affecting other tasks; (3) help determine whether programming and testing resources will be available when needed, given the concurrent milestone completion dates for various tasks; and (4) provide a tool for assigning programming and testing resources that are essential to the success of all efforts in the most efficient manner.", "Understanding the schedule and resource interdependencies of all the key activities that are needed to make its systems Year 2000 compliant is imperative if IRS is to make its mission-critical systems Year 2000 compliant on time. For example, IRS\u2019 mainframe consolidation project is behind schedule because of start-up delays and problems with implementing the systems software that is being used to consolidate one of the mainframe platforms. As a result of the problems with the commercial off-the-shelf software, additional testing is being done that was not initially expected. This testing requires staff from IRS\u2019 Information Systems Office of Technical Support, which is also supporting the Century Date Change Project Office in other efforts. A master schedule showing both task and resource requirements should help identify whether any of the individual Year 2000 efforts will require the same staff for the same time period.", "Recognizing that several major and complex projects, including application software changes that are needed to implement recent tax legislation, must be completed before the 1999 filing season, in November 1997, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue announced the establishment of an executive steering committee. This committee is to identify risks to the 1999 filing season and the entire Year 2000 effort and take actions to mitigate those risks. As a part of this effort, IRS developed a Century Date Change Project Schedule for its Year 2000 activities. While the project schedule identifies the tasks for major Year 2000 activities, their corresponding start and finish dates, and the primary organizations responsible for them, the schedule does not yet establish a link between related tasks or analyze how the timing of the various tasks may affect resource availability. Until these actions are complete, IRS cannot project whether resources will be available when needed for concurrent tasks. Thus, IRS faces the risk that resources may not be available when needed.", "On February 12, 1998, IRS issued a statement of work for a contractor to provide program management support to the Commissioner\u2019s newly established executive steering committee. One of the support activities that IRS identified in the statement of work was the development of an integrated schedule identifying (1) the interfaces and dependencies among Year 2000 projects and (2) efforts to implement legislative changes for the 1999 filing season. IRS expects this schedule, along with related tasks and dependencies, to be available in June 1998. If properly developed, this schedule should meet the intent of the master conversion and replacement schedule called for in our assessment guide. The contractor is to work closely with IRS staff who are responsible for the various Year 2000 efforts to assess resource needs for new requirements or resource shortages for existing requirements.

The Century Date Change Project Office has established criteria to identify such projects. For these projects, IRS is to initiate a business function impact analysis. Once that analysis is complete, technical and business owners evaluate available alternatives, including using any existing contingency procedures, such as manual procedures, or an alternative technological solution, such as commercial off-the-shelf software. IRS plans to use a similar approach for initiating contingency plans for business functions when the conversion of infrastructure areas, such as systems software, external data exchanges, and telecommunications network components, falls behind schedule.", "IRS\u2019 \u201cCentury Date Change Contingency Management Plan\u201d does not address the likelihood that information systems that are converted on schedule may experience system failures.

Among other things, the exposure draft states that agencies need to do a business impact analysis to determine the effect of mission-critical system failures on the viability of agency operations. This analysis is to include examining business priorities; dependencies; service levels; and, most important, the business process dependency on mission-critical information systems. According to our exposure draft, the business impact analysis triggers the development of contingency plans for each core business process, including any information system components that support that process. Contingency plans would also address the actions IRS may take, for example, to notify taxpayers in the event that Year 2000 failures cause significant delays in processing tax returns and issuing refunds. IRS has undertaken efforts in the past to identify its core business processes as a part of various reengineering efforts that could be the starting point for a business impact analysis.

As an additional contingency measure, according to IRS, it is building redundancy into telecommunications networks to provide limited access if a portion of the network fails due to Year 2000 compatibility issues."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "External Data Exchanges", "paragraphs": ["IRS hopes to complete its assessment of external data exchanges by June 30, 1998. IRS, like most organizations, exchanges data in an electronic format with other organizations for a variety of purposes. These data exchanges involve both other government agencies as well as private sector organizations. For example, IRS (1) transmits information electronically to the Treasury\u2019s Financial Management Service (FMS) for the purposes of reporting revenue receipts and the issuance of refund checks and (2) receives wage information (W-2) from the Social Security Administration (SSA) to verify the accuracy of individuals\u2019 reported income. IRS also receives interest income data from banks and provides information to many states to assist them with taxpayer compliance activities.", "In September 1997, IRS initiated a plan to identify (1) all of its external data exchange organizations and (2) the actions needed to ensure that data exchanges are not adversely impacted by the Year 2000 problem. IRS has notified these organizations that Treasury has adopted a four-digit date field. IRS reports that as part of its application conversion efforts it has already converted more than 50 percent of the more than 300 data files that it exchanges with more than 400 organizations. A key portion of the remaining work involves contacting each of the organizations and verifying that it is aware of the IRS\u2019 plans for conversion and it has taken steps to ensure the continued receipt and transmission of data.", "IRS has also identified a group of organizations whose external data exchanges are most critical to IRS\u2019 operations and plans to commit additional attention and resources to these organizations to ensure that Year 2000 data exchange issues are thoroughly addressed. These organizations include government agencies, such as FMS, SSA, and the Federal Reserve, as well as private firms that are involved in activities such as the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System for federal employment tax deposits and banks that provide \u201clockbox\u201d processing of $170 billion in remittances annually. To ensure that these most critical areas are thoroughly addressed, IRS has hired a contractor to conduct site visits to validate that the systems that receive/provide these data are on track to be Year 2000 compliant. At the time of our review, IRS was validating its inventory of external data exchanges and obtaining agreements regarding the organizations\u2019 plans for converting their systems so that data exchanges can be made Year 2000 compliant."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Minicomputer/File- Server Hardware and Systems Software", "paragraphs": ["For the most part, IRS has completed its assessment of its minicomputer/file-server hardware and systems software. In the last 10 to 15 years, IRS has developed a number of information systems that use minicomputer and file-server technologies, rather than the mainframe-based technology that it has used for the past 30 years. IRS has identified 39 mission-critical systems that use minicomputer and file-server technologies. These systems support a variety of programs, including electronic filing, customer service, returns processing, fraud detection, criminal investigation, and compliance research activities. Many of these systems input data to IRS\u2019 mainframe-based systems and, as such, are key elements of IRS\u2019 tax processing system.", "Because organizational control over these systems is scattered across various project offices within IRS\u2019 information systems organization and business or functional units, IRS has taken longer to identify and assess these systems than it has taken for its mainframe-based systems. The lack of an accurate inventory has also hindered progress in completing the assessment of these systems.", "IRS is relying on vendors to provide the Year 2000 solution for 12 platforms (i.e., a combination of computer hardware and systems software). These platforms currently support 39 mission-critical systems and several other important applications. According to the Commissioner\u2019s Executive Steering Committee documents, IRS established March 15, 1998, as the date by which IRS wanted some assurance by the vendors that a Year 2000 solution existed for these platforms. Of the 12 platforms, 2 will be retired (1 of which will be replaced when ISRP is implemented nationwide.) IRS has determined that two platforms cannot be made Year 2000 compliant, and, at the time of our review, IRS was still evaluating its replacement options for them. As of April 10, 1998, IRS had either received or was about to receive the eight remaining platforms. IRS had identified a relational database as its greatest risk for its minicomputers and file servers because it supports 15 mission-critical systems, and IRS is the vendor\u2019s only customer for this product. IRS officials told us that as of May 8, 1998, the vendor had provided a version of this database to IRS for testing. IRS officials said that once testing is completed, they will take the necessary steps to procure this database and make it available to the various users.", "Despite having identified the Year 2000 solutions for various minicomputer/file-server platforms, as of May 8, 1998, IRS had not yet completed a plan for migrating business or functional organizations from their current minicomputer/file-server platforms to the ones that are Year 2000 compliant.

IRS has identified 134,000 personal computers that it must assess to determine if the hardware and/or the associated systems software is Year 2000 compliant or must be converted.
