The triad comprises the sea-based leg (submarine-launched ballistic missiles), ground-based leg (intercontinental ballistic missiles), and airborne leg (nuclear-capable heavy bombers). As a result of arms control agreements and strategic policies, the number of U.S. nuclear weapons and strategic delivery vehicles has been reduced substantially; however, the strategic triad has remained intact. DOD and the Department of Energy are planning to invest significant resources to recapitalize and modernize the strategic triad in the coming decades. The departments projected in 2015 that the costs of maintaining U.S. nuclear forces for fiscal years 2016 through 2025 would total $319.8 billion, and DOD expects recapitalization and modernization efforts to extend into the 2030s.", "GAO was asked to review DOD's analysis of the decision to retain all three legs of the strategic triad.

The advantages DOD identified include the survivability of the sea-based leg, the intercontinental ballistic missiles' contribution to stability, and the ability of the nuclear-capable bombers to visibly forward deploy. The 2010 Nuclear Posture Review Report states\u2014and DOD officials also told GAO\u2014that the administration has considered various options for the U.S. nuclear force structure, including options in which DOD would eliminate one leg of the triad. For example, Strategic Command, Air Force, and Navy officials told GAO that they had analyzed alternative strategic force structures in preparation for the 2010 Nuclear Posture Review. DOD officials also told GAO that the department had assessed nuclear force reductions as part of reviews conducted after the Nuclear Posture Review, including during the development of the President's 2013 nuclear employment guidance, the 2013 Strategic Choices Management Review, and DOD's 2014 plan to implement the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) with Russia.

Since the 1960s, the United States has deployed nuclear  weapons on three types of strategic delivery vehicles. These three types  of vehicles\u2014together with the warheads they carry\u2014are collectively  referred to as the strategic triad. The triad comprises the sea-based  strategic deterrent (submarine-launched ballistic missiles carried on  ballistic missile submarines), the ground-based strategic deterrent  (intercontinental ballistic missiles), and the airborne strategic deterrent  (nuclear-capable heavy bombers). The strategic triad has played an  essential role in U.S. policy for deterring potential adversaries and  assuring U.S. allies and other security partners that they can count on  U.S. security commitments. The United States has maintained its nuclear  deterrent capability while decreasing numbers of weapons in response to  arms control agreements and strategic policies. In 1991, the U.S. nuclear  weapon stockpile totaled approximately 13,000 weapons; as of February  2011, it had been reduced to fewer than 4,500, according to the  Department of Defense (DOD). In his April 2009 speech in Prague, the  President spoke of the U.S. commitment to seeking a world without  nuclear weapons. The 2010 Nuclear Posture Review Report (NPR report)  outlined the administration\u2019s approach to maintaining the nuclear  deterrent capability while pursuing further reductions in nuclear  weapons. The number of U.S. nuclear weapons and strategic delivery  vehicles has fallen substantially, but the core model for U.S. strategic  force structure\u2014the strategic triad\u2014has remained intact. The 2010 NPR  report stated that DOD had considered a wide range of force structure  options before concluding that it would retain the strategic triad.", "The strategic delivery vehicles and nuclear weapons that comprise the  strategic triad are aging and being deployed beyond their intended  service lives. DOD and the Department of Energy are planning to invest  significant resources to recapitalize and modernize the strategic triad in  the coming decades, including developing a new long-range strike  bomber with nuclear capabilities, a replacement or upgrade for the  current fleet of intercontinental ballistic missiles, a new class of ballistic  missile submarines, and an upgrade to some of the missiles and  warheads that will be carried on these delivery vehicles. This is part of an  extensive, multifaceted effort by DOD and the Department of Energy to  sustain and modernize U.S. nuclear weapons capabilities, including the  nuclear weapons stockpile; the research and production infrastructure;  and the nuclear command, control, and communications system. DOD  and Department of Energy estimates show that nuclear sustainment and  modernization efforts are expected to cost billions of dollars over the next  decade. As we have previously reported, DOD and the Department of  Energy projected in 2015 that the costs of maintaining U.S. nuclear forces  for fiscal years 2016 through 2025 would total $319.8 billion, and DOD  expects recapitalization and modernization efforts to extend into the  2030s.", "You asked us to review DOD\u2019s analysis of the decision to retain all three  legs of the strategic triad. This report describes the processes DOD used  in supporting that decision. This report is a public version of a classified  report that we issued in May 2016 and omits information that DOD  deemed classified on warhead levels, specific advantages of each leg of  the triad, and some of the analyses of alternatives that were considered.  Although the information in this report is more limited, it addresses the  same objective as the classified report. The overall methodology for both  reports is also the same.", "To describe DOD\u2019s process for assessing the strategic triad, we reviewed  relevant documentation and interviewed officials from the military services  and DOD offices that participated in the key reviews the department  carried out in analyzing its strategic force structure from 2009 to 2014,  including the 2010 NPR. We used this documentation and testimonial  evidence to understand DOD\u2019s process for determining a need to  maintain the triad and DOD\u2019s consideration of alternatives to the triad.

The 2010 NPR was the third  comprehensive assessment of U.S. nuclear policy and strategy  conducted by the United States since the end of the Cold War; previous  reviews were completed in 1994 and 2001. The Office of the Secretary of  Defense and the Joint Staff led the effort in consultation with the  Departments of State and Energy. Other organizations participated,  including the military departments, the combatant commands, the  Departments of Homeland Security and Treasury, the Office of the  Director of National Intelligence, and the National Security Council and its  supporting interagency bodies. The 2010 NPR report focused on five  objectives:  1.  preventing nuclear proliferation and nuclear terrorism;  2.  reducing the role of U.S. nuclear weapons in the U.S. national security  3.  maintaining strategic deterrence and stability at lower nuclear force  4.  strengthening regional deterrence and reassuring U.S. allies and  5.  sustaining a safe, secure, and effective nuclear arsenal.", "The third of these objectives\u2014maintaining strategic deterrence and  stability at reduced nuclear force levels\u2014emphasizes the importance of  bilateral and verifiable reductions in strategic nuclear weapons in  coordination with Russia. In support of this objective, the United States  signed a new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with Russia\u2014known as  New START\u2014on April 8, 2010, which entered into force on February 5,  2011.", "New START gives Russia and the United States 7 years to reduce their  strategic delivery vehicles and strategic nuclear warheads\u2014under the  counting rules outlined in the treaty\u2014and will remain in force for 10  years. According to DOD\u2019s April 2014 report on its plan to implement  New START, DOD plans to maintain 400 deployed intercontinental  ballistic missiles; 240 deployed submarine-launched ballistic missiles; and  60 deployed heavy bombers. The 60 heavy bombers consist of B-52s  and B-2s. Taken together, these add up to 700 deployed delivery vehicles  and fall within the New START limits that go into force in 2018. DOD and  military service officials told us these numbers reflect DOD\u2019s current  planned strategic force structure for implementing New START. Figure 1  shows DOD\u2019s planned deployed strategic force structure for implementing  New START, including the number of delivery vehicles for each leg of the  triad.", "In 2011, the President directed DOD to conduct a follow-on analysis to  the NPR, which reviewed U.S. nuclear deterrence requirements. The  review resulted in the development of the President\u2019s nuclear  employment guidance and a DOD report on this nuclear employment  guidance, which was completed in June 2013. The review was led by  DOD and included senior-level participation by the Office of the Secretary  of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Strategic Command, the Department  of State, the Department of Energy, the Office of the Director of National  Intelligence, and the National Security Staff (now known as the National  Security Council). As indicated in DOD\u2019s 2013 report on the President\u2019s  nuclear employment guidance, the review assessed what changes to  nuclear employment strategy could best support the five key objectives of  the 2010 NPR and a sixth objective: achieve U.S. and allied objectives if  deterrence fails.", "In June 2013, DOD completed a Strategic Choices Management Review,  which, according to DOD officials, considered reductions in nuclear  forces, among other things. According to the Secretary of Defense, the  purpose of the Strategic Choices Management Review was to understand  the effect that further budget reductions would have on the department  and to develop options to deal with these reductions.
