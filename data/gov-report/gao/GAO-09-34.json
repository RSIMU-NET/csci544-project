It recommended numerous changes, in particular focusing on employment through a new Five-Track service delivery model and increasing program capacity. Since then, VR&E has worked to implement these recommendations. To help Congress understand whether VR&E is now better prepared to meet the needs of veterans with disabilities, GAO was asked to determine (1) how the implementation of the Five-Track Employment Process has affected VR&E's focus on employment, (2) the extent to which VR&E has taken steps to improve its capacity, and (3) how program outcomes are reported. GAO interviewed officials from VR&E, the 2004 Task Force, and veteran organizations; visited four VR&E offices; surveyed all VR&E officers; and analyzed agency data and reports."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["By launching the Five-Track Employment Process, VR&E has strengthened its focus on employment, but program incentives have not been updated to reflect this emphasis. VR&E has delineated its services into five tracks to accommodate the different needs of veterans, such as those who need immediate employment as opposed to those who need training to meet their career goal. However, program incentives remain directed toward education and training. Veterans who receive those services collect an allowance, but those who opt exclusively for employment services do not. While VR&E officials said they believed it would be helpful to better align incentives with the employment mission, they have not yet taken steps to address this issue. VR&E has improved its capacity to provide services by increasing its collaboration with other organizations and by hiring more staff, but it lacks a strategic approach to workforce planning. Although there have been staff increases, many of VR&E's regional offices still reported staff and skill shortages. The program is not addressing these workforce problems with strategic planning practices that GAO's prior work has identified as essential. For example, VR&E officials have not fully determined the correct number of staff and the skills they need to serve current and future veterans. VA does not adequately report program outcomes, which could limit understanding of the program's performance. Specifically, it reports one overall rehabilitation rate for veterans pursuing employment and those trying to live independently. Computing each group's success rate for fiscal year 2008, GAO found a lower rate of success for the majority seeking employment and a higher rate of success for the minority seeking independent living than the overall rate. GAO also found that VR&E changed the way it calculates the rehabilitation rate in fiscal year 2006, without acknowledgments in key agency reports. VA noted the change in its fiscal year 2006 performance report, but did not do so for its fiscal year 2007 and 2008 reports, or for its fiscal year 2008and 2009 budget submissions. Such omissions could lead to misinterpretation of program performance over time."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Vocational Rehabilitation and  Employment (VR&E) program helps veterans who have service-connected  disabilities and employment barriers obtain employment or live  independently if employment is not currently feasible.

Many are surviving  with multiple serious injuries and illnesses, including amputations,  traumatic brain injury, and post-traumatic stress disorder. While some  servicemembers will be able to remain on active duty, others will need  comprehensive services as they transition into civilian life and work.

Since then, we, along with others  who have reviewed the program, have repeatedly raised concerns about  the ability of VR&E to fully meet this charge. In 2004, a VR&E Task Force,  chartered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, issued a comprehensive  report with more than 100 recommendations. Key concerns included  VR&E\u2019s lack of emphasis on employment early in the rehabilitation  process and its limited capacity to manage its workload. To refocus  VR&E\u2019s organization and make it responsive to the needs of 21st century  veterans, the Task Force recommended, among other actions, that VR&E  implement a new service delivery approach through a Five-Track  Employment Process to focus on employment early in the rehabilitation  process and give veterans five different program options to achieve  employment based on their individual needs. The Task Force also  recommended expanding collaboration with other organizations and  increasing staffing levels at the central and regional offices to increase  capacity.

To assess how the Five-Track process  has affected VR&E\u2019s focus on employment and the extent to which VR&E  has taken steps to improve its capacity, we evaluated VR&E\u2019s  implementation of key recommendations from the 2004 Task Force by  interviewing VR&E officials, Task Force members, and veteran service  organization representatives as well as reviewing agency documents. We  also conducted site visits to four of VA\u2019s regional offices\u2014Houston, Tex.;  Pittsburgh, Pa.; Seattle, Wash.; and St. Petersburg, Fla.

VR&E officials said  that their past workload projections had not been far off and, according to  VR&E data, since 2004 their projections have been within 8 percent of  actual program participation. However, new factors may be impacting  enrollment because in fiscal year 2008 the program underestimated the  number of program participants for the first time in several years.", "Further, VR&E staffing projections do not account for the numbers of  veterans whose status will likely require more staff time, such as veterans  who need an extended evaluation to determine if employment is currently  feasible. Staff are allocated to the regional offices based, in part, on the  number of veterans whose status will likely take more of a counselor\u2019s  time. However, when VR&E prepares its annual budget request for staff, it  considers only total program participants and does not take into  consideration the growing number of cases that require more staff time  due to their complexity. Yet, since the wars began in Afghanistan and Iraq,  the number of veterans who required an extended evaluation increased by  121 percent.

Likewise, information on separate success rates would enable  those overseeing the program to understand that the minority of  participants seeking independent living have a much higher success rate  than the reported overall rate.", "Both the Task Force and VA\u2019s Office of Inspector General (OIG) have also  noted the need for separate employment and independent living  measures. The Task Force recommended the use of separate outcome  measures because very different services are often required to serve those  seeking employment versus those seeking independent living. For  example, veterans seeking employment may need career training and  placement, while veterans trying to live independently may need to learn  to use a wheelchair or communicate with an assistive device. VR&E  officials did not implement the recommendation because, according to  officials, the existing rehabilitation rate reflected the outcomes of all  veterans in the program. For its part, VA\u2019s OIG specifically recommended  in 2007 that VA performance and accountability reports include the  numbers of veterans who achieve employment and independent living,  given that such outcomes are used for budget and resource allocation and  in testimony to Congress. In its 2007 Performance and Accountability  Report, VA provided the absolute numbers of veterans who had found  employment (8,252) or achieved independent living (2,756), but did not  offer a separate rate for each program goal, which would have allowed for  a better assessment of VR&E\u2019s progress. During our review, a senior VR&E  official acknowledged the merit of examining separate employment and  independent living rates and said that the program had recently begun  internally tracking separate rates. Another VR&E official told us that the  program is considering developing and reporting separate performance  measures for independent living and employment, but did not have a  specific time frame for when that decision will be finalized."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA Altered Its Performance Measure without Adequately Disclosing the Change", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2006, VR&E changed its rehabilitation performance  measure\u2014the way it calculates the overall rehabilitation rate\u2014without  adequately disclosing this change in several subsequent reports even  though the change substantially increased the rate. VA noted the change in  its fiscal year 2006 Performance and Accountability Report, but did not do  so for its subsequent fiscal year 2007 and fiscal year 2008 Performance and  Accountability Reports, or for its fiscal year 2008 and fiscal year 2009  budget submissions to Congress. These reports included tables and  graphics showing a 10-point increase in the rehabilitation rate from fiscal  year 2005 to fiscal year 2006. While federal agencies may change their  performance measures, we believe that not acknowledging the change in  subsequent reports could allow for some misinterpretation of the  program\u2019s performance over time. Our prior work on federal performance  measures found it useful to acknowledge such a change to provide a  complete picture of program performance.", "Prior to fiscal year 2006, VR&E calculated the rehabilitation rate by  comparing the number of veterans who had a rehabilitation plan and  achieved their goal with the total number of veterans who had a  rehabilitation plan and either achieved their goal or discontinued the  program. In fiscal year 2006, VR&E began excluding from the total those  veterans who discontinued from the program for reasons considered  beyond VR&E\u2019s control (see fig. 5). Specifically, VR&E excludes veterans  from the calculation who accept a position incompatible with their  disability; those they consider employable, but who are no longer seeking  employment; and those they consider unemployable due to medical or  psychological reasons.", "Prior to the calculation change, VR&E was having limited success  improving its rehabilitation rate and achieving its performance goals (see  fig. 6). Changing the calculation enabled VR&E to show a 14-point increase  (from 62 percent in fiscal year 2004 to 76 percent in fiscal year 2008) in the  rehabilitation rate trend in its fiscal year 2008 Performance and  Accountability Report. According to our analysis, the increase would have  been 6 points (from 62 percent in fiscal year 2004 to 68 percent in fiscal  year 2008) without a change to the performance measure. Furthermore,  the calculation change enabled VR&E to meet its annual performance goal  in fiscal years 2006, 2007, and 2008.

Given the current incentive structure, veterans who most need  immediate employment services, but could also benefit from some level of  financial assistance, may be at a disadvantage. Moreover, the incentive  structure may result in some veterans not choosing the track that is best  for them and, therefore, foregoing early integration into the civilian  workforce.", "VR&E has improved its capacity to serve veterans by stepping up its  collaboration with other organizations and by adding staff. However, the  lack of information about staffing needs could limit VR&E\u2019s ability to  provide quality services to veterans returning from the wars in Afghanistan  and Iraq, as well as to veterans from prior conflicts. Without a strategic  workforce planning process that collects and uses relevant data to ensure  the right number of staff with the appropriate skills, the VR&E program  will continue to face challenges serving current veterans and could fall  short in responding to the needs of future veterans.", "Finally, the lack of transparency in how VA calculates and reports  program performance is detrimental to effective oversight and VR&E\u2019s  ability to manage the program.

With regard to collecting and using information on  the critical skills and competencies needed by staff, VA noted that it has  already defined the critical skills and competencies needed for VR&E  counselors by requiring them to hold a master\u2019s degree in rehabilitation  and has provided training to VR&E staff. While we acknowledge the value  of these efforts, the fact that many regional offices reported skill shortages  on our survey indicates that more needs to be done in this area, especially  given the increasingly complex needs of the veterans now applying for  services.

We assessed VR&E\u2019s implementation of completed  recommendations and reviewed recommendations it had not yet  completed.

To evaluate the  number of veterans in each case status over time, we used BDN fiscal  year-end national reports from fiscal year 2001 to fiscal year 2007 to  capture changes since the beginning of the conflicts in Afghanistan and  Iraq. We also analyzed BDN and Corporate WINRS data to determine the  change in the average length of time between a veteran receiving an initial  disability rating and applying for VR&E services from fiscal year 2002 to  fiscal year 2007. We began our analysis with fiscal year 2002 because an  agency official told us that regional office data were uploaded into the  Corporate WINRS database in fiscal year 2001 making data prior to fiscal  year 2002 less reliable. For performance outcomes reporting, we analyzed  data from fiscal year 2004 through fiscal year 2008, as these were the years  of data reported in the agency\u2019s fiscal year 2008 Performance and  Accountability Report.", "To assess the reliability of this data, we performed the following steps:   (1) reviewed the existing information about the data and the system that  produced them, (2) observed data entry and reviewed input controls,   (3) performed electronic testing of required data fields, and   (4) interviewed agency officials knowledgeable about the data and  systems. For BDN data, we also reviewed the programming logic that was  used to produce selected workload data and applied the same logic  contained in the programming against a file of raw data. We were able to  replicate two workload indicators that we chose to examine. This gave us  reasonable assurance that the automated BDN reports were reliable.", "Agency officials said there are two sources of data that contain  information about VR&E participant case histories. This information is  contained in both the BDN and in Corporate WINRS. Corporate WINRS is  the interface that VR&E counselors use and that data updates BDN data in  most cases. To determine rehabilitation rates, VR&E uses three variables  indicating whether a case is rehabilitated, discontinued, and/or has  achieved a maximum rehabilitation gain (MRG). These three designations  are derived for each VR&E applicant based on Corporate WINRS case  history and then stored in a summary file. This summary data is then used  to calculate rehabilitation rates. We usually choose to examine raw data  instead of summary data. In this case, an ideal test would be to examine  the raw Corporate WINRS data and see if we came up with the same  designations evidenced in this summary level data. However, complexities  associated with the business rules used to establish the key designations  in the summary data (as rehabilitated, discontinued, and/or MRG)  prevented us from calculating the rehabilitation rate using the full case  history data. For this reason, we requested that VR&E provide us the  summary data that it used to calculate its rehabilitation rate. We then used  this summary data to verify its rehabilitation rate reports and to calculate  (1) the success rates of veterans who had a plan to achieve independent  living or had a plan to become employed and (2) how the agency would  have performed if it had not changed its rehabilitation rate calculation.", "To verify the summary data, we discussed with agency officials the  algorithms they used to create the case-level summary data. In addition,  we drew a random sample of 65 summary data records and looked at the  raw case history data for each to see if the designations contained in the  summary data complied with the algorithms VR&E described. During this  examination, we found one case where the raw data did not support the  summary-level data designation. This allowed us to conclude with   95 percent confidence that these problems represent no more than a   7.1 percent rate of error in the summary data. In addition, although the  Corporate WINRS data for this case did not have the correct reason code  to support the MRG designation, an examination of BDN data (the  alternate data source that contains participant case information) did  contain the correct reason code and supported the MRG designation.
