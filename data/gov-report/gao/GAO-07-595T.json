The shuttle  manifest currently consists of 16 flights\u201415 to complete assembly and  integration of the ISS and a servicing mission to the Hubble Space  Telescope. The first new space vehicles currently are targeted to begin  operating no later than 2014\u2014thereby creating a potential gap in U.S.  human space flight. Congress has voiced concern over the United States  not having continuous access to space. NASA has made it a priority to  minimize the gap to the extent possible.", "NASA has begun planning for the retirement of the shuttle, scheduled for  2010, by identifying best practices in closing facilities and the transitioning  of capabilities. Specifically, NASA has conducted a number of  benchmarking studies of previous closures and realignment of large  programs, including the Titan IV rocket fly-out, the F/A-18 C/D fighter  production close, and the Navy Base Realignment and Closure activities.  The benchmarking efforts have highlighted to NASA the importance of  having a plan, effective communication, human capital management, and  effective program management tools. NASA\u2019s benchmarking effort also  showed that closing and transitioning facilities, equipment, and people is  expensive and time consuming. Among the lessons learned is that,  historically, it has taken 3.5 years to close down an installation and  another 3 years to complete the transition of the property. NASA\u2019s Office  of the Inspector General has recently reviewed NASA\u2019s plan for the space  shuttle transition and recommended, among other improvements, that the  two affected space directorates finalize and implement the Human Space  Flight Transition Plan.", "Development of the Orion crew capsule, Ares I launch vehicle, and other  exploration systems needed to implement the Vision is dependent on a  \u201cgo as you can afford to pay\u201d approach, wherein lower-priority efforts will  be deferred, descoped, or discontinued to allow NASA to stay within its  available budget profile. In recent testimony, the NASA Administrator said  that the cost associated with returning the shuttle to flight, continued  shuttle operations, and recent budget reductions had the combined effect  of increasing the gap by delaying the first manned Orion test flight by   6 months.", "In an effort to address the gap in U.S. capability to resupply the space  station following retirement of the shuttle, NASA is investing in  commercial space transportation services. NASA\u2019s expectation is that by  acquiring domestic orbital transportation services it will be able to send  cargo and, in the future, transport crews to the ISS in a cost-effective  manner. NASA refers to this as the Commercial Orbital Transportation  Services project. The project is in the early stages of development. Should  these commercial services prove to be unreliable or more costly than  anticipated, NASA will need to purchase space transportation from its  international partners to meet obligations to the ISS until the new Orion  spacecraft become operational."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NASA Faces Significant Challenges in Retiring the Space Shuttle Program and Transitioning to Exploration Activities", "paragraphs": ["We have undertaken a substantial body of work over the past 3 years that  has highlighted the significant challenges that NASA will face as it retires  the shuttle and transitions to exploration activities.

Another key challenge will be developing the Orion Crew  Exploration Vehicle within cost, schedule, and performance goals.  Additionally, our ongoing work has identified a number of other areas that  may present challenges during the transition period.

The shuttle workforce currently consists of approximately   2,000 civil service and 15,000 contractor personnel, including a large  number of engineers and scientists. In 2005, we reported that NASA had  made limited progress toward developing a detailed strategy for sustaining  a critically skilled shuttle workforce to support space shuttle operations.  We reported that significant delays in implementing a strategy to sustain  the shuttle workforce would likely lead to larger problems, such as  funding and failure to meet NASA program schedules. Accordingly, we  concluded that timely action to address workforce issues is critical given  their potential impact on NASA-wide goals such as closing the gap in  human spaceflight.", "When we performed our work several factors hampered the ability of the  Space Shuttle Program to develop a detailed long-term strategy for  sustaining the critically skilled workforce necessary to support safe space  shuttle operations through retirement. For example, at that time, the  program\u2019s focus was on returning the shuttle to flight, and other efforts  such as determining workforce requirements were delayed. In our report,  we recommended that NASA begin identifying the Space Shuttle  Program\u2019s future workforce needs based upon various future scenarios.  Scenario planning could better enable NASA to develop strategies for  meeting future needs. NASA concurred with our recommendation. It has  acknowledged that shuttle workforce management and critical skills  retention will be a major challenge for the agency as it progresses toward  retirement of the space shuttle and has taken action to address this issue.  For example, since we made our recommendation, NASA has developed  an agencywide strategic human capital plan and developed workforce  analysis tools to assist it in identifying critical skills needs. NASA has also  developed a human capital plan specifically for sustaining the shuttle  workforce through the retirement and, then transitioning the workforce.", "Additionally, in March 2006, the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on  Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies, and NASA asked the  National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA) to assist the agency in  planning for the space shuttle\u2019s retirement and transition to future  exploration activities. In February 2007, a NAPA panel recommended that  the Space Shuttle Program adopt a RAND model for projecting a core  workforce because of its emphasis on \u201clong-term scheduling projections,  quantification of core competencies and proficiencies, and analysis of  overlapping mission needs.\u201d Under the RAND model, an organization  maintains a core capability for any competency that will be needed in the  future. According to NAPA, this model is useful where a given expertise is  not immediately required, but is likely to be needed in the future\u2014in this  case, for the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Developing New Exploration Systems", "paragraphs": ["In July 2006, we reported that NASA\u2019s acquisition strategy for the Orion  Crew Exploration Vehicle placed the project at risk of significant cost  overruns, schedule delays, and performance shortfalls because it  committed the government to a long-term contract before establishing a  sound business case. Our past work has shown that developing a sound  business case\u2014one that matches requirements to available and reasonably  expected resources before committing to a new product development  effort\u2014reduces risk and increases the likelihood of successful outcomes.  For a program to increase its chances of success, high levels of knowledge  should be demonstrated before significant commitments are made   (i.e., they should be following a knowledge-based approach to product  development).", "At the time of our report, NASA had yet to develop key elements of a  sound business case, including well-defined requirements, mature  technology, a preliminary design, and firm cost estimates that would  support its plans for making a long-term commitment. Without such  knowledge, NASA cannot predict with any confidence how much the  program will cost, what technologies will or will not be available to meet  performance expectations, and when the vehicle will be ready for use.  NASA acknowledged that it would not have these elements in place until  the project\u2019s Preliminary Design Review scheduled for fiscal year 2008. As  a result, we recommended that the NASA Administrator modify the  agency\u2019s acquisition strategy for the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle to  ensure that the agency does not commit itself, and in turn the federal  government, to a long-term contractual obligation prior to establishing a  sound business case at the project\u2019s Preliminary Design Review.", "Although it initially disagreed with our recommendation, NASA  subsequently took steps to address some of the concerns we raised.  Specifically, NASA modified its acquisition strategy for the Orion project  and changed the production and sustainment portions of the contract into  options. The agency will decide whether to exercise these options after  the project\u2019s critical design review in 2009. While these changes are in line  with our recommendation and a step in a positive direction, we continue  to believe NASA\u2019s acquisition strategy is risky because it does not fully  conform to a knowledge-based acquisition approach. Attempting to close  that gap by pushing forward development of the Orion Crew Exploration  Vehicle without first obtaining the requisite knowledge at key points could  very well result in the production of a system that not only does not meet  expectations but ends up costing more and actually increases the gap.", "Since we last testified on this subject in September 2006, NASA has  successfully completed its first major milestone for the Orion project. It  has completed the Systems Requirements Review. This was a major step  toward obtaining the information critical for making informed decisions.  According to NASA\u2019s Orion contracting officer, NASA is also in the  process of renegotiating the Orion contract to extend the Initial  Operational Capability date of the system to 2014. Further, while this  change will increase contract costs, the increase has already been  accounted for in the Orion budget because the agency has been planning  the change for over a year. In addition, risks associated with schedule,  cost, and weight continue to be identified for the Orion project.", "As we have previously testified, sound project management and oversight  will be key to addressing the risks that remain for the Orion project as it  proceeds with its acquisition approach. To help mitigate the risks, we have  recommended in the past that NASA have in place markers (i.e., criteria)  to assist decision makers in their monitoring of the project at key  junctures in the development process. Such markers are needed to provide  assurance that projects are proceeding with and decisions are being based  upon the appropriate level of knowledge and can help to lessen project  risks. NASA has recently issued its updated program and project  management requirements for flight systems in response to our  recommendation. Changes to the policy, including the incorporation of  key decision points throughout the project development life cycle, should  provide an avenue for decision makers to reassess project decisions at key  points in the development process to ensure that continued investment is  appropriate. However, it should be noted that implementation of the  policy in a disciplined manner will ensure success, not the existence of the  policy itself.", "Currently, we are evaluating the development of NASA\u2019s latest human- rated launch vehicle\u2014the Ares I Crew Launch Vehicle. When completed,  the Ares I vehicle will be capable of delivering the Orion spacecraft to low  earth orbit for ISS missions and for exploration missions to the moon. As  initially conceived by NASA in the Exploration Systems Architecture Study  completed in 2005, the Ares I design would rely on the existing solid  rocket boosters and main engines from the space shuttle as major  components of its two stages. The current design for the Ares I, however,  diverges from the initial design set forth in the architecture study and now  includes elements from the Apollo-era Saturn V launch vehicle. Current  plans are for Ares I to evolve the solid rocket boosters from the Space  Shuttle Program from four segments to five segments and to build a new  upper-stage engine based on an original Saturn V design. NASA maintains  that these changes are necessary to increase commonality between the  Ares I and the planned Ares V cargo launch vehicle and to reduce overall  development costs for implementing the Vision. As NASA\u2019s design for the  Ares I continues to evolve, careful planning and coordination between the  Orion and Ares I development teams will be critical to ensuring that  current developmental efforts result in hardware that satisfies the future  requirements of these systems. Subsequently, any development problems  on either of these systems could result in increasing the gap.", "Our ongoing work is aimed at assessing whether NASA\u2019s acquisition  strategy for Ares I reflects the effect of changes to the Ares I design  incorporated since the Ares I was first conceived in the Exploration  Systems Architecture Study as a shuttle-derived alternative. Also, we are  evaluating the extent to which NASA\u2019s Ares I acquisition strategy  incorporates knowledge-based concepts designed to minimize technical  and programmatic risk.", "The Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle and the Ares I Crew Launch Vehicle  are the first in a series of new systems to be developed in support of  exploration activities. NASA\u2019s careful management of these projects must  preclude historical instances of cost and schedule growth. Indeed, while  NASA has had many successes in the exploration of space, such as landing  the Pathfinder and Exploration Rovers on Mars, NASA has also  experienced its share of unsuccessful missions, unforeseen cost overruns,  and difficulty bringing a number of projects to completion. For example,  NASA has made several attempts to build a second generation of reusable  human spaceflight vehicle to replace the space shuttle, such as the  National Aero-Space Plane, the X-33 and X-34, and the Space Launch  Initiative, that never accomplished its objective of fielding a new reusable  space vehicle. We estimate that these unsuccessful development efforts  have cost approximately $4.8 billion since the 1980s. The high cost of these  unsuccessful efforts and the potential costs of implementing the Vision  make it important that NASA achieve success in developing new systems  for its new exploration program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Managing the Supplier Base Throughout Retirement and Transition", "paragraphs": ["NASA\u2019s plans to retire the shuttle have the potential to greatly impact the  supplier base that has been supporting that program for the last several  decades, as well as mold the future supplier base needed for its  exploration program. Over the next few years, NASA will be making  decisions about its supplier base needs, including which suppliers will be  required for the remainder of the Space Shuttle Program, which will no  longer be required for the program, and which will be needed to support  exploration efforts. One concern is that NASA will be unable to sustain  suppliers necessary to support the exploration program during the period  between the shuttle\u2019s retirement and resumption of human space flight.  Also of concern is that those suppliers determined by NASA as not needed  for the exploration program will prematurely end their services, thus  jeopardizing the safe and efficient completion of shuttle activities. In  addition, issues such as obsolescence\u2014already being experienced by  some shuttle projects\u2014could have an impact on the exploration program  given the planned use of heritage hardware for some components of the  Constellation projects. In an attempt to address these potential issues,  NASA has been developing and implementing plans and processes to  manage the transition of its supplier base.", "We are in the process of assessing how well NASA is positioning itself to  effectively manage its supplier base to ensure both sustainment of the  Space Shuttle Program through its scheduled retirement in 2010 and  successful transition to planned exploration activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Providing Logistical Support to the International Space Station", "paragraphs": ["The shuttle is uniquely suited for transporting crew and cargo to and from  the ISS.

To fill this gap, NASA plans to rely on its international  partners and commercial services to provide ISS logistics and crew  rotation.", "Two recent studies have raised serious concerns about whether future ISS  operations can be continuously supported. A 2006 report by the National  Research Council noted that the capabilities, schedules, and funding  requirements for NASA, international partners, and commercial cargo and  crew vehicles were not yet firm enough to give the panel confidence that  ISS exploration mission objectives have a high likelihood of being  fulfilled. A February 2007 report by the International Space Station  Independent Safety Task Force, which was required by the NASA  Authorization Act of 2005, noted that the transition from the space shuttle  to post-shuttle systems for logistical support to the ISS will require careful  planning and phasing of new capabilities. Specifically, care must be taken  to ensure adequate logistics and spares are provided to maintain a viable  station. The task force report went on to say that if a commitment is  made to an emerging logistics delivery capability and the capability does  not materialize, then logistical support to the ISS could be lost for some  time, seriously decreasing the utility of the space station and possibly  resulting in its abandonment.", "We are reviewing NASA\u2019s plans for meeting ISS logistics and maintenance  requirements after the shuttle retires, identifying the main risks to meeting  ISS logistics and maintenance requirements, and assessing NASA\u2019s plans  for addressing the risks."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Disposing of Property and Equipment", "paragraphs": ["NASA has not developed a comprehensive cost estimate for transitioning  or disposing of Space Shuttle Program facilities and equipment. This poses  a financial risk to the agency. As NASA executes the remaining missions  needed to complete the assembly of and provide support for the ISS, it will  simultaneously begin the process of disposing of shuttle facilities and  hardware that the Space Shuttle Program will no longer need, or,  transitioning such facilities and hardware to the other NASA programs.  As the ninth largest federal government property holder, NASA owns more  than 100,000 acres, as well as over 3,000 buildings and 3,000 other  structures totaling over 44 million square feet. Currently, the Space Shuttle  Program uses 654 facilities valued in excess of $5 billion. The Space  Shuttle Program also manages equipment dispersed across government  and its contractors valued at more than $12 billion. NASA is in the process  of evaluating its Space Shuttle Program facilities and equipment  requirements and identifying existing facilities and equipment that will no  longer be needed to support shuttle operations. Constellation and other  NASA programs will determine whether they need any of the facilities or  equipment released by the Space Shuttle Program. According to NASA  officials, assessments currently project that only 70 to 80 of the existing  facilities are needed to support the development or operation of future  exploration systems. In cases where facilities or equipment are no longer  required by the Space Shuttle Program, no other use is identified, or it is  selected for disposal, it will transition to the resident NASA field center for  disposition.", "It is worth noting that even before the retirement of the shuttle, over   10 percent of NASA\u2019s facilities are underutilized or not utilized at all. One  option NASA has is to lease underutilized facilities in exchange for cash  and/or in-kind consideration, such as improvement of NASA\u2019s facilities or  the provision of services to NASA. As directed by the NASA Authorization  Act of 2005, we recently reported on NASA\u2019s Enhanced Use-Leasing  Program. Congress authorized NASA to employ enhanced-use leasing at  two demonstration centers. This allowed the agency to retain the proceeds  from leasing out underutilized real property and to accept in-kind  consideration in lieu of cash for rent. The act allows NASA to deposit the  net proceeds (i.e., net of leasing costs) in a no-year capital account to use  later for maintenance, capital revitalization, and improvement of the  facilities, albeit only at the demonstration centers\u2014Ames Research Center  and Kennedy Space Center. However, unlike other agencies with  enhanced-use leasing authority, NASA is not authorized to lease back the  property during the term of the lease. Furthermore, we found that the  agency does not have adequate controls in place to ensure accountability  and transparency and to protect the government. We recommended that  the NASA Administrator develop an agencywide enhanced use leasing  policy that establishes controls and processes to ensure accountability and  protect the government\u2019s interests including developing mechanisms to  keep the Congress fully informed of the agency\u2019s enhanced use leasing  activity. NASA concurred with our recommendations. After not receiving  additional authority in the NASA Authorization Act of 2005, the agency is  again requesting that the Congress extend enhanced use leasing authority  to at least six NASA centers. NASA currently has other leasing authorities,  but they require the agency to return to the U.S. Treasury any amounts  exceeding cost. Further, NASA has indicated that it is preparing a package  of legislative and administrative tools to help in the transition from the  Space Shuttle Program to the Constellation Program. For example, in  addition to requesting authority for increased use of enhanced use leasing,  a NASA official informed us that one tool the agency might consider  pursuing is the ability to keep the funds within NASA from the sale of  facilities and equipment, rather than returning such funds to the Treasury."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Completing Environmental Clean Up", "paragraphs": ["NASA does not have a comprehensive estimate of the environmental clean  up costs associated with the transition and disposal of Space Shuttle  Program facilities and equipment.

Although NASA has an approach for identifying environmental  risks, in our report on major challenges facing the nation in the 21st  century, we pointed out that progress in cleaning up sites frequently does  not meet expected time frames and the costs dramatically exceed  available funding levels. For example, it cost the Titan IV program  approximately $300 million over six years on cleaning facilities,  equipment, and tools. At this time, the extent of the Space Shuttle  Program\u2019s environmental liabilities is not yet fully known.
