These high-risk areas relate to DOD's major business operations. DOD's failure to effectively resolve these high-risk areas results in billions of dollars of waste each year, ineffective performance, and inadequate accountability. At a time when DOD is competing for resources in an increasingly fiscally constrained environment, it is critically important that DOD get the most from every defense dollar. DOD has taken several positive steps and devoted substantial resources toward establishing key management structures and processes to successfully transform its business operations and address its high-risk areas, but overall progress by area varies widely and huge challenges remain. This testimony addresses (1) DOD's progress in developing a strategic, integrated, enterprise-wide business transformation plan and its related leadership approach, (2) the extent to which DOD has complied with legislation that addresses business systems modernization and improving financial management accountability, and (3) selected additional DOD high-risk areas that highlight the need for continued attention."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DOD has made some progress in its overall approach to business transformation, which GAO has designated as high risk. Yet, GAO still believes DOD needs an integrated, enterprisewide strategic plan and chief management official (CMO) to guide and oversee these efforts. DOD has developed a revised business enterprise architecture and enterprise business transition plan. However, this plan does not go far enough to constitute a strategic plan for the overall business transformation effort. DOD also established the Defense Business Systems Management Committee (DBSMC), as DOD's primary transformation leadership and oversight mechanism, and the Business Transformation Agency (BTA) to support the DBSMC. However, these organizations do not provide the sustained leadership needed to successfully achieve business transformation. Also, the BTA still faces challenges to become operational, such as filling a number of key positions to oversee the transformation process. DOD continues to take steps to comply with legislative requirements to improve business systems modernization, designated as a high-risk area. It has updated its business enterprise architecture and enterprise transition plan and issued its annual report to Congress. This report describes steps taken and planned that address several of the missing elements GAO previously identified relative to legislative provisions concerning the architecture, transition plan, budgetary reporting of business system investments, and investment review. While these steps certainly reflect progress, DOD continues to face challenges relative to ensuring that the department's key business system investments are managed in a way to deliver promised system capabilities and benefits on time and within budget. Further, in late December 2005, DOD issued its Financial Improvement and Readiness Plan to guide its financial management improvement efforts. Ensuring effective transformation of other defense areas that GAO has identified as high risk will require continued attention over many years. These other high-risk areas include weapon systems acquisition, contract management, supply chain management, personnel security clearances, and support infrastructure management. In the area of weapons system acquisition, recurring problems with changing requirements, cost overruns, and schedule delays have resulted in a reduction of buying power of the defense dollar at a time when the nation is struggling with a large and growing structural deficit. While it has made some progress in addressing its supply chain management problems, DOD faces challenges in successfully implementing its planned changes and measuring progress. Problems with the personnel security clearance program continue, although DOD has taken steps to address the financial costs, delays, and other risks associated with the program. Finally, much work remains for DOD to transform its support infrastructure to improve operations and achieve efficiencies so that infrastructure costs adequately fund but no longer consume a larger than necessary portion of DOD's budget."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["It is a pleasure to be back before this Subcommittee to discuss the  progress the Department of Defense (DOD) has made in transforming its  business processes. Since the first financial statement audit of a major  DOD component was attempted almost 20 years ago, we have reported  that weaknesses in business management systems, processes, and internal  controls not only adversely affect the reliability of reported financial data,  but also the economy, efficiency, and effectiveness of DOD\u2019s and the  federal government\u2019s operations. In fact, DOD currently bears  responsibility, in whole or in part, for 14 of our 25 high-risk areas. Eight of  these are specific to DOD and include DOD\u2019s overall approach to business  transformation, business systems modernization, financial management,  the personnel security clearance process, supply chain management,  support infrastructure management, weapon systems acquisition, and  contract management. In addition, DOD shares responsibility for six  governmentwide high-risk areas. Collectively, these high-risk areas relate  to DOD\u2019s major business operations which directly support the warfighter,  including how they get paid, the benefits provided to their families, and  the availability and condition of the equipment they use both on and off  the battlefield.", "DOD\u2019s business area weaknesses result in reduced efficiencies, ineffective  performance, and inadequate accountability to Congress and the American  people, wasting billions of dollars each year at a time when DOD is  competing for resources in an increasingly fiscally constrained  environment. As a result, it is important that DOD get the most from every  dollar it invests. Our nation is not only threatened by external security  threats, but also from within by growing fiscal imbalances due primarily to  our aging population and rising health care costs. These trends are  compounded by the near-term deficits arising from new discretionary and  mandatory spending as well as lower revenues as a share of the economy.  If left unchecked, these fiscal imbalances will ultimately impede economic  growth, have an adverse effect on our future standard of living, and in due  course affect our ability to address key national and homeland security  needs. These factors create the need to make choices that will only  become more difficult and potentially disruptive the longer they are  postponed. Among these difficult choices will be decisions about the  affordability and sustainability of the continued growth in defense  spending. We believe DOD\u2019s recently issued Quadrennial Defense Review  (QDR) did not result in a long-term, integrated and resource constrained  investment strategy. In fact, the gap between wants, needs, affordability,  and sustainability seems to be greater than ever.", "I continue to believe that DOD\u2019s senior leadership is committed to  transforming the department and DOD has taken a number of positive,  albeit overdue steps to begin this effort. In fact, because of the impact of  the department\u2019s business systems and processes on its warfighters, DOD  recognizes now, more than ever, the need to transform its business  operations and provide transparency in this process. Indeed, Secretary  Rumsfeld was very clear in his speech on September 10, 2001, when he  identified business transformation as a top priority. However, DOD\u2019s  ability to focus on this priority was overshadowed by the events of  September 11, 2001, and the ensuing Global War on Terrorism, including  military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Clearly, these events have  required considerable emphasis and have become the department\u2019s  primary focus. As a result, progress on the full range of DOD\u2019s business  transformation challenges has been inconsistent.", "Congress, under the leadership of this Subcommittee, passed legislation  that codified many of our prior recommendations related to DOD business  systems modernization. Since then, the department has devoted  substantial resources and made important progress toward establishing  key management structures and processes to guide business systems  investment activities. DOD\u2019s current approach is clearly superior to its  prior approach; however, a number of challenges remain.", "Today, I would like to provide my perspectives on actions DOD has taken  to date to address the eight high-risk areas for which it bears sole  responsibility. Specifically, I will provide my perspective on (1) DOD\u2019s  progress in developing a comprehensive, integrated, enterprisewide  business transformation plan and its related leadership approach, (2) the  extent to which DOD has complied with legislation that addresses  business systems modernization and improving financial management  accountability, and (3) the five additional DOD-specific high-risk areas  related to business transformation that need continued attention. In  addition, you asked me to discuss two provisions contained in Senate Bill  2766 (the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007), as  reported by the Senate Armed Services Committee.", "My statement is based in large part on previous GAO reports and some of  our current, ongoing efforts.

To support DOD\u2019s operations, the department performs an  assortment of interrelated and interdependent business functions\u2014using  more than 3,700 business systems\u2014related to major business areas such  as weapon systems management, supply chain management, procurement,  health care management, and financial management. The ability of these  systems to operate as intended affects the lives of our warfighters both on  and off the battlefield. For fiscal year 2006, Congress appropriated  approximately $16 billion to DOD, and for fiscal year 2007, DOD has  requested another $16 billion in appropriated funds to operate, maintain,  and modernize these business systems.", "Transformation of DOD\u2019s business systems and operations is key to  improving the department\u2019s ability to provide DOD management and  Congress with accurate, timely, reliable, and useful information for  analysis, oversight, and decision making. This effort is an essential part of  the Secretary of Defense\u2019s broad initiative to \u201ctransform the way the  department works and what it works on.\u201d The savings resulting from an  effective business transformation effort could be significant. The Secretary  himself estimated that the department could save 5 percent of its annual  budget, which for fiscal year 2006 would have been about $21 billion,  through effective business transformation. Until DOD can successfully  transform its operations, it will continue to confront the pervasive,  decades-old management problems that cut across all of DOD\u2019s major  business areas.", "During the past year DOD has embarked on a series of efforts to transform  its business operations, including issuing an enterprise transition plan for  implementing its business enterprise architecture. In addition, in February  2005, DOD chartered the Defense Business Systems Management  Committee (DBSMC) to oversee transformation and ensure it meets the  needs and priorities of the warfighter. As the senior most governing body  overseeing business transformation, the DBSMC is comprised of senior  leaders who meet monthly under the personal direction of the Deputy  Secretary of Defense to set business transformation priorities and  recommend policies and procedures required to attain DOD-wide  interoperability of business systems and processes. In October 2005, DOD  also established a Business Transformation Agency (BTA) intended to  advance defense-wide business transformation efforts in general but  particularly with regard to business systems modernization. DOD believes  it can better address managing defense-wide business transformation\u2014 which includes planning, management, organizational structures and  processes related to all key business areas\u2014by first transforming business  operations that support the warfighter while also enabling financial  accountability across DOD. The BTA reports directly to the vice chair of  the DBSMC\u2014the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology  and Logistics\u2014and includes an acquisition executive who is responsible  for 28 DOD-wide business projects, programs, systems, and initiatives.

DOD\u2019s efforts to plan and organize itself to achieve  business transformation are continuing to evolve. Critical to the success of  these efforts will be top management attention and structures that focus  on transformation from a broad perspective and a clear, comprehensive,  integrated and enterprisewide plan that, at a summary level, addresses all  of the department\u2019s major business areas. This strategic plan should cover  all of DOD\u2019s key business functions; contain results-oriented goals,  measures and expectations that link institutional, unit, and individual  performance goals and expectations to promote accountability; identify  people with needed skills, knowledge, experience, responsibility, and  authority to implement the plan; and establish an effective process and  related tools for implementation. Such an integrated business  transformation plan would be instrumental in establishing investment  priorities and guiding the department\u2019s key resource decisions.", "While DOD has not yet developed a comprehensive, integrated,  enterprisewide business transformation plan, its leaders have recognized  the need to transform its business operations. In September 2005, DOD  issued a business enterprise architecture and an enterprise transition plan  for modernizing its business processes and supporting information  technology assets. The business enterprise architecture provides a  foundational blueprint for modernizing business operations, information,  and systems, while the enterprise transition plan provides a roadmap and  management tool that sequences business system investments in the areas  of personnel, logistics, real property, acquisition, purchasing, and financial  requirements. However, the enterprise transition plan does not go far  enough to constitute a strategic plan for the overall business  transformation efforts since it is more focused on business systems.  Business transformation is much broader and encompasses not only the  supporting systems, but also the planning, management, organizational  structures, processes, and accountability mechanisms related to all of  DOD\u2019s major business areas. Such areas include support infrastructure  management, human capital management, financial management, planning  and budgeting, and supply chain management. DOD officials acknowledge  that the enterprise transition plan may not have all of the elements of an  overarching business transformation plan as we envision it. However, they  consider the business enterprise plan to be an evolving plan.", "DOD\u2019s key strategic documents also highlight the need for business  transformation. For example, the National Defense Strategy issued in  March 2005 and the February 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review both state  that DOD must transform the way the department works and what it  works on, including its capabilities for defending the nation by  revolutionizing management, technology, and business practices to  support the needs of the combatant commanders. Nevertheless, these are  high level documents that do not contain supporting details such as key  metrics, milestones, and mechanisms to guide and direct business  transformation efforts.

Due to the  complexity and long-term nature of DOD\u2019s business transformation  efforts, we continue to believe DOD needs a chief management officer  (CMO) to provide sustained leadership and maintain momentum. Without  formally designating responsibility and accountability for results, choosing  among competing demands for scarce resources and resolving differences  in priorities between various DOD organizations will be difficult and could  impede DOD\u2019s ability to transform in an efficient, effective, and reasonably  timely manner. In addition, it may be particularly difficult for DOD to  sustain transformation progress when key personnel changes occur. The  CMO would serve as the Deputy Secretary of Defense or Principal Under  Secretary for Management and as the strategic integrator for DOD\u2019s overall  business transformation effort. This position would elevate, integrate, and  institutionalize the attention essential for addressing key stewardship  responsibilities, such as strategic planning, enterprise architecture  development and implementation, information technology management,  and financial management, while facilitating the overall business  management transformation effort within DOD. I would also like to  articulate what this position would not do. The CMO would not assume  the responsibilities of the undersecretaries of defense, the service  secretaries, or other DOD officials for the day-to-day management of the  department. Instead, the CMO would be responsible and accountable for  planning, integrating, and executing the overall business transformation  effort. The CMO also would develop and implement a strategic plan for the  overall business transformation. I understand that DOD has been  legislatively mandated to study the feasibility of a chief management  official position in DOD. It is also my understanding that the Defense  Business Board has recommended the creation of a Principal Under  Secretary of Defense to serve as a CMO.", "The Secretary of Defense, Deputy Secretary of Defense, and other senior  leaders have clearly shown a commitment to business transformation and  addressing deficiencies in the department\u2019s business operations. During  the past year, DOD has taken additional steps to address certain  provisions and requirements of the Ronald W. Reagan National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005, including establishing the DBSMC  as DOD\u2019s primary transformation leadership and oversight mechanism,  and creating the Business Transformation Agency (BTA) to support the  DBSMC, a decision making body. However, these organizations do not  provide the sustained leadership needed to successfully achieve business  transformation. The DBSMC\u2019s representatives consist of political  appointees whose terms expire when administrations change.  Furthermore, it is important to remember that committees do not lead,  people do. Thus, DOD still needs to designate a person to provide  sustained leadership and have overall responsibility and accountability for  this effort.", "In addition, we testified in November 2005 that DOD\u2019s BTA offers potential  benefits relative to the department\u2019s business systems modernization  efforts if the agency can be properly organized, resourced, and  empowered to effectively execute its roles and responsibilities and is held  accountable for doing so. However, the department has faced challenges  in making the BTA operational. For example, we previously testified that  there are numerous key acquisition functions that would need to be  established and made operational for the BTA to effectively assume  responsibility for 28 DOD-wide projects, programs, systems, and  initiatives, and our experience across the government shows that these  functions can take considerable time to fully implement on each and every  program.  While we have reported that the department has established  certain system investments and processes that are consistent with recent  legislation and our prior recommendations, the fundamental question that  remains is the extent to which these management controls are actually  being implemented on both the 28 enterprise-level investments, but also  the hundreds of other system investments that are being managed at the  component level. We are working with this Subcommittee\u2019s staffs to  answer this question.", "Moreover, BTA has yet to fill a number of key positions for overseeing the  transformation process. According to DOD officials, BTA currently has  several unfilled leadership and expert positions. Moreover, BTA still does  not have an empowered senior level manager, such as a CMO, to ensure  the success of its transformation efforts. Without qualified individuals in  these positions, particularly at this formative stage of the BTA, its ability to  effectively support the DBSMC will be limited.", "To assist the department, the Congress enacted a provision in the Fiscal  Year 2004 National Defense Authorization Act that gives DOD the  authority to hire up to 2,500 highly-qualified experts from outside the civil  service and uniformed services without going through the normal civil  service hiring system. Specifically, it is our understanding that since DOD  received this hiring authority, only 10 individuals have been hired across  the department to fill critical BTA positions under this authority.  According to DOD officials, this is due to internal DOD policy that restricts  the use of the new authority, such as a provision prohibiting experts hired  under the provision from performing \u201ccontinuing department functions,  including work of a policy, decision-making, or management nature.\u201d As a  result of these restrictions, the newly established agency remains  understaffed, and thus constrained in its ability to perform its  transformation mission.", "According to the Deputy Secretary of Defense, the department is  reviewing its policy and plans to issue clarifying guidance that would  expand the use of the authority over the next several months.

These  steps address several of the missing elements we previously identified  relative to the legislative provisions concerning the architecture, transition  plan, budgetary reporting of business system investments, and investment  review. Further we testified, that in late December 2005 DOD had issued  its Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) plan, a third major  component of its business transformation strategy, to guide financial  management improvement and clean audit opinion efforts within the  department.

For example, the architecture now has much of the information needed, if  properly implemented, to achieve compliance with the Department of the  Treasury\u2019s United States Standard General Ledger, such as the data  elements or attributes that are needed to facilitate information sharing and  reconciliation with the Treasury. In addition, the architecture continues to  specify DOD\u2019s Standard Financial Information Structure (SFIS) as an  enterprisewide data standard for categorizing financial information to  support financial management and reporting functions. Thus far, the  department has completed Phase I of the SFIS initiative, which is focused  on standardizing general ledger and external financial reporting  requirements, and has incorporated associated definitions in the  architecture.

Program officials acknowledged that the  architecture does not include this profile and stated that they are working  with the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Networks and Information  Integration)/Chief Information Officer (ASD(NII)/CIO) to address this in  future versions. Furthermore, the architecture does not address other  limitations we previously reported. For example, it is not yet adequately  linked to military service and defense agency component architectures  and transition plans, which is particularly important given the  department\u2019s federated approach to developing and implementing the  architecture. In its March 15, 2006, report to Congress, the department  stated that integration with these component architectures will be an  ongoing goal. To accomplish this goal, program officials told us that a  federation strategy is being developed and will be implemented in future  versions of the architecture and transition plan.", "We support DOD taking an incremental approach to developing the  business enterprise architecture, recognizing that adopting such an  approach is a best practice that we have advocated.

For example, in an effort to improve visibility into personnel  activities, DOD reported that, for the Defense Civilian Personnel Data  System, it met the milestone to deploy a data warehouse capability to  facilitate data sharing. It also reported that, for this system, it has set a  September 2008 milestone for developing an implementation strategy for  integrating modules supporting functionality that is currently provided by  stand-alone applications. In addition, DOD continues to validate the  inventory of ongoing IT investments that formed the basis for the prior  version of the transition plan. Specifically, DOD intends future updates to  the plan to continue to introduce the results of ongoing and planned  analyses of gaps between its current and target architectural  environments, in which capability and performance shortfalls are  described and investments (such as transformation initiatives and  systems) that are to address these shortfalls are clearly identified.", "However, the transition plan does not identify, for example, all legacy  systems that will or will not be part of the target architecture, nor does it  include explicit strategies for modifying those legacy systems identified in  the plan\u2019s system migration diagrams.

For example, program officials stated that the  Defense Information Systems Agency\u2019s IT infrastructure investments will  not be reflected in the enterprise transition plan because the capabilities  that these investments are intended to deliver are reflected in the Global  Information Grid rather than in the business enterprise architecture. As we  previously reported, exclusion of Defense Information Systems Agency  investments is particularly limiting, given that this agency and its  investments provide key IT infrastructure services that business systems  will use. Without including information on the timing and content of these  investments, the critical relationship between infrastructure and systems  becomes blurred in many ways.

For example, one business system investment that has  been eliminated is the Forward Compatible Payroll system (FCP). In  reviewing the program status, it was determined that FCP would duplicate  the functionality contained in DIMHRS, and it was unnecessary to  continue investing in both systems. According to the department\u2019s fiscal  year 2007 IT budget request, approximately $33 million was sought for  fiscal year 2007 and about $31 million was estimated for fiscal year 2008  for FCP.

For example, the Navy requested funding  of about $19 million for fiscal years 2006 to 2011 for its Military Sealift  Command Human Resources Management System, but the amount  approved was approximately $2 million for the first 6 months of fiscal year  2006. According to Navy officials, this system will be reviewed to ascertain  whether it has some of the same functionality as the Defense Civilian  Personnel Data System. Funding system initiatives for shorter time periods  can help reduce the financial risk by providing additional opportunities for  monitoring a project\u2019s progress against established milestones and help  ensure that the investment is properly aligned with the architecture and  the department\u2019s overall goals and objectives.", "The Act also directs that DOD establish five IRBs, each responsible and  accountable for controlling certain business system investments to ensure  compliance and consistency with the business enterprise architecture.  Four of the five designated IRBs have been established, the exception  being an IRB chaired by the ASD(NII)/CIO. According to the Act and the  Deputy Secretary of Defense\u2019s March 19, 2005, memorandum, the  ASD(NII)/CIO-chaired IRB is to be responsible and accountable for any  business system that primarily supports IT infrastructure or information  assurance activities. According to ASD(NII)/CIO officials, this IRB has not  been established because the CIO does not have direct control and  accountability over any such business systems. CIO officials further noted  that since a representative of the ASD(NII)/CIO office is a participant in  each of the other four IRBs, any infrastructure related matters could be  addressed as part of these boards\u2019 deliberations.", "The Act\u2019s requirement that modernizations costing more than $1 million  must be certified by a designated \u201capproval authority\u201d and subsequently  approved by the DBSMC prior to funds being obligated applies to both  business systems that deliver applications and functional capabilities in  each of the identified functional areas, as well as infrastructure that  support these systems. Our analysis of the department\u2019s detailed fiscal  year 2007 budget request documents disclosed that 8 infrastructure  modernizations, costing more than $1 million, are designated by DOD in  those documents as in support of the business mission area.

Examples of these system investments are the Defense Integrated Military  Human Resources System (DIMHRS), Defense Travel System (DTS), the  Army Logistics Modernization Program (LMP), the Navy Tactical  Command Support System (NTCSS), and the Transportation Coordinators\u2019  Automated Information for Movements System II (TC-AIMS II). The  challenges that the DBSMC and the BTA face relative to each of these  systems are discussed below.", "Since our report, DOD has made some progress in addressing concerns,  however significant challenges remain. Specifically, the DBSMC  established a steering committee to ensure timely and cost effective  implementation of DIMHRS, and according to its charter, the committee  will include representatives from the services. The Defense Business  Systems Acquisition Executive (DBSAE) also recently hired a program  manager who has prior experience in implementing an integrated  personnel and payroll system. Further, the Army and the Air Force have  completed assessments of the commercial-off-the-shelf product selected  for DIMHRS that has resulted in both services concluding that the product  can be used to meet their needs under certain conditions. The Army and  the Air Force are currently working to identify all user requirements and  to identify functionality gaps within the product and potential solutions to  address these gaps. The Navy also recently completed its assessment, but  has yet to release the results. According to the DBSAE, the Marine Corps  will conduct a similar assessment in spring 2007. According to DOD  officials, the Army currently expects to deploy DIMHRS by April 2008 with  the Air Force to begin deploying a month later.", "Nonetheless, much remains to be done before this can occur and before  DOD can be optimistic about the program\u2019s outcome or success. Some of  the challenges that DOD has to overcome are ensuring that (1) the  department fully addresses our recommendation with respect to the  quality of DIMHRS\u2019 requirements (e.g., ensuring that user requirements are  complete and unambiguous), (2) all the legacy systems DIMHRS will  replace and the termination dates for these systems are identified,            (3) system interfaces are defined and built, and (4) legacy system data are  ready to be converted in accordance with the deployment schedule. Until  DOD resolves these challenges, it will not be effectively positioned to  correct known weaknesses, including shortcomings in its ability to  properly pay military personnel and to monitor and track them to, from,  and within their duty stations.", "As we reported in January 2006, DTS continues to face implementation  challenges, particularly with respect to testing key functionality to ensure  that the system will perform as intended. Our analysis of selected  requirements for one key area disclosed that system testing was not  effective in ensuring that the promised capability was delivered as  intended. For example, we found that DOD did not have reasonable  assurance that flight information was properly displayed. This problem  was not detected prior to deployment of DTS because DOD did not  properly test the system interfaces through which the data are accessed  for display. As a result, those travelers using the system may not have  received accurate information on available flights, which could have  resulted in higher travel costs. The report also identified key challenges  facing DTS in becoming DOD\u2019s standard travel system, including  developing needed interfaces and underutilization of DTS at sites where it  has been deployed. While DTS has developed 36 interfaces with various  DOD business systems, it will have to develop interfaces with at least 18  additional business systems\u2014not a trivial task. Additionally, the continued  use of the existing legacy travel systems at locations where DTS is already  deployed results in underutilization of DTS and affects the savings that  DTS had planned to achieve. Under the statutory authority of the  Comptroller General, we are performing additional audit work on DTS and  will provide you the results of our audit upon its completion.", "We have reported that the Army faces challenges in developing and  implementing LMP. While LMP has not been designated an enterprise- level system, DOD considers this system to be extremely important to  achieving key enterprise priorities, such as asset visibility. For example,  we reported that LMP will not provide total asset visibility over DOD\u2019s  billions of dollars of inventory. We also reported that implementation  problems precluded the Tobyhanna Army Depot from accurately reporting  on its financial operations, which, in turn, adversely affects the depot\u2019s  ability to set prices for work performed. At your request, we will be  undertaking a series of audits directed at DOD\u2019s efforts to resolve  longstanding financial management problems over the visibility of its  assets that will include follow-up work on LMP.", "In December 2005, we reported that DOD needed to reassess its planned  investment in the NTCSS, which is a system intended to help Navy  personnel effectively manage ships, submarines, and aircraft support  activities. We reported that this program was not being managed in  accordance with key aspects of the department\u2019s policies and related  guidance, including federal and recognized best practice guidance. For  example, the Navy had not economically justified its ongoing and planned  investment in NTCSS; invested in NTCSS within the context of a well- defined DOD or Navy enterprise architecture, which is necessary to guide  and constrain NTCSS in a way that promotes interoperability and reduces  redundancy with related and dependent systems; effectively performed  key measurement, reporting, budgeting, and oversight activities; and  adequately conducted requirements management and testing activities.  Without this information, we concluded that the Navy could not determine  whether NTCSS as defined, and as being developed, is the right solution to  meet its strategic business and technological needs.", "We reported in December 2005 that TC-AIMS II\u2014a joint services system  with the goal of helping to manage the movement of forces and equipment  within the United States and abroad\u2014had not been defined and developed  in the context of a DOD enterprise architecture. Similar to DIMHRS and  DTS, TC-AIMS II is intended to be an enterprise-level system. However, the  Army\u2014DOD\u2019s acquisition agent for TC-AIMS II\u2014had pursued the system  on the basis of an Army logistics-focused architecture. This means that TC- AIMS II, which is intended to produce a departmentwide military  deployment management system, is based on a service-specific  architecture and not a DOD-wide architecture, thus increasing the risk that  this program, as defined, will not properly fit within the context of future  DOD enterprisewide business operations and IT environments. In  addition, the Army had not economically justified the program on the basis  of reliable estimates of life-cycle costs and benefits, and as a result, the  Army does not know that investment in TC-AIMS II as planned is  warranted, represents a prudent use of limited DOD resources, and will be  interoperable with and not be duplicative of related systems."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Specific High-risk Program Areas Highlight the Need for Continued Attention to Ensure Effective Transformation", "paragraphs": ["I would like to discuss the five remaining high-risk areas within DOD.  These include weapon systems acquisitions and contractor oversight;  supply chain management; personnel security clearance program; and  support infrastructure management."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Management of DOD\u2019s Weapon Systems Acquisitions and Contractor Oversight", "paragraphs": ["Two interrelated high-risk areas are the management of DOD\u2019s major  weapon systems acquisitions and its contractors due to recurring  problems with cost overruns and scheduling delays. DOD\u2019s new weapon  systems programs are expected to be the most expensive and complex  ever and will consume an increasingly large share of DOD\u2019s budget. These  costly current and planned acquisitions are running head-on into the  nation\u2019s unsustainable fiscal path. In the past 5 years, DOD has doubled its  commitment to major weapon systems from $700 billion to $1.4 trillion,  but this huge increase has not been accompanied by more stability, better  outcomes, or more increased buying power for the acquisition dollar.  Rather than showing appreciable improvement, programs are  experiencing recurring problems with cost overruns, missed deadlines,  and performance shortfalls. A large number of the programs included in  our annual assessment of weapon systems are costing more and taking  longer to develop than estimated. It is not unusual to see development  cost increases between 30 percent and 40 percent and attendant schedule  delays. The consequence of cost and schedule growth is manifested in a  reduction of buying power of the defense dollar, at a time when the nation  is struggling with a large and growing structural deficit. This causes DOD  to either cut back on planned quantities or capabilities, or to even scrap  multi-billion dollar programs, after years of effort. If these systems are  managed with the traditional margins of error, the financial consequences  can be dire, especially in light of a constrained discretionary budget.", "It is within this context that we must engage in a comprehensive and  fundamental reexamination of new and ongoing investments in our  nation\u2019s weapon systems. Success for acquisitions means making sound  decisions to ensure that program investments are getting promised  returns. In the commercial world, successful companies have no choice  but to adopt processes and cultures that emphasize basing decisions on  knowledge, reducing risks prior to undertaking new efforts, producing  realistic cost and schedule estimates, and building in quality to deliver  products to customers at the right price, time, and cost. However, this is  not happening within DOD. The department has tried to embrace best  practices in its policies and instill more discipline in requirements setting,  among numerous other actions, but it still has trouble distinguishing wants  from true needs. While DOD\u2019s policy supports a knowledge-based,  evolutionary approach to acquiring new weapons, its practice of making  decisions on individual programs often sacrifices knowledge and  executability in favor of revolutionary solutions. In an important sense,  success has come to mean starting and continuing programs even when  cost, schedule, and quantities must be sacrificed.", "Our reviews have identified a number of causes behind the acquisition  problems just described, but I would now like to discuss three of these  underlying causes. The first I would refer to as \u201cbig A\u201d, or acquisition with  a capital \u201cA.\u201d What I mean by this is that DOD\u2019s funding, requirements, and  acquisition processes are not working synergistically. DOD does not  clearly define and stabilize requirements before programs are started. Our  work has shown that DOD\u2019s requirements process generates more demand  for new programs than fiscal resources can support. DOD compounds the  problem by approving many highly complex and interdependent programs.  Moreover, once a program is approved, requirements can be added along  the way\u2014significantly stretching technology, creating design challenges,  exacerbating budget overruns, and accountability challenges. For  example, in the F-22A program, the Air Force added a requirement for air- to-ground attack capability. In its Global Hawk program, the Air Force  added both signals intelligence and imagery intelligence requirements.  Both programs have experienced schedule delays and significant unit cost  increases. Customers often demand additional requirements fearing there  may not be another chance to get new capabilities because programs can  take a decade or longer to complete. Yet, perversely, such strategies delay  delivery to the warfighter, often by years.", "The second cause I would refer to as \u201clittle a\u201d or the acquisition process  itself. DOD commits to individual programs before it obtains assurance  that the capabilities it is pursuing can be achieved within available  resources and time constraints. Funding processes encourage this  approach, since acquisition programs attract more dollars than efforts  concentrating solely on proving out technologies. Only 10 percent of the  programs in our latest annual assessment of weapon systems had  demonstrated critical technologies to best practice standards at the start  of development; and only 23 percent demonstrated them to DOD\u2019s  standards. The cost effect of proceeding without completing technology  development before starting an acquisition can be dramatic. For example,  research, development, test and evaluation costs for the programs  included in our review that met best practice standards at program start  increased by a modest average of 4.8 percent more than the first full  estimate, whereas the costs for the programs that did not meet these  standards increased by a much higher average of 34.9 percent more than  the first full estimate. The bottom line is that these consequences are  predictable and, thus, preventable.", "The third cause has to do with the lack of accountability. Contractors and  responsible DOD officials are not always held accountable when programs  go astray. In December 2005, we reported that DOD gives its contractors  the opportunity to collectively earn billions of dollars through monetary  incentives. Unfortunately, we found DOD programs routinely engaged in  practices that failed to hold contractors accountable for achieving desired  outcomes and undermined efforts to motivate contractor performance,  such as    evaluating contractor performance on award-fee criteria that are not  directly related to key acquisition outcomes (e.g., meeting cost and  schedule goals and delivering desired capabilities to the warfighter);   paying contractors a significant portion of the available fee for what  award-fee plans describe as \u201cacceptable, average, expected, good, or  satisfactory\u201d performance, which sometimes did not require meeting  the basic requirements of the contract; and   giving contractors at least a second opportunity to earn initially  unearned or deferred fees.", "As a result, DOD has paid out an estimated $8 billion in award fees on  contracts in our study population, regardless of whether acquisition  outcomes fell short of, met, or exceeded DOD\u2019s expectations. For  example, we found that DOD paid its contractor for a satellite program\u2014 the Space-Based Infrared System High\u201474 percent of the award fee  available, or $160 million, even though research and development costs  increased by more than 99 percent, and the program was delayed for many  years and was rebaselined three times. In another instance, DOD paid its  contractor for the F-22A aircraft more than $848 million, 91 percent of the  available award fee, even though research and development costs  increased by more than 47 percent, the program had been delayed by more  than 2 years and rebaselined 14 times. Despite paying billions of dollars in  award and incentive fees, DOD has not compiled data or developed  performance measures to evaluate whether the validity of its belief that  award and incentive fees improve contractor performance and acquisition  outcomes.", "There are many factors that play a role in causing weapons programs to go  astray. They include workforce challenges, poor contractor oversight,  frequent turnover in key leadership, and a lack of systems engineering,  among others. Moreover, many of the business processes that support  weapons development\u2014strategic planning and budgeting, human capital  management, infrastructure, financial management, information  technology, and contracting\u2014are beset with pervasive, decades-old  management problems, including outdated organizational structures,  systems, and processes. In fact, all of these areas\u2014along with weapon  systems acquisition\u2014are on GAO\u2019s high-risk list of major government  programs and operations.", "Our work shows that acquisition problems will likely persist until DOD  provides a better foundation for buying the right things, the right way. This  involves making tough tradeoff decisions as to which programs should be  pursued and, more importantly, not pursued, making sure programs are  executable, locking in requirements before programs are started, and  making it clear who is responsible for what and holding people  accountable when these responsibilities are not fulfilled. These changes  will not be easy to make. They require DOD to reexamine the entirety of  its acquisition process and to make deep-seated changes to the setting,  funding, and execution of program requirements. In other words, DOD  would need to revisit who sets requirements, strategy, monitors  performance and what factors to consider in selecting and rewarding  contractors. It also involves changing how DOD views success, and what  is necessary to achieve success. I am encouraged by DOD\u2019s recent efforts  to improve the collaboration and consultation between the requirements  and acquisition communities. The tests of these efforts will be whether  they produce better decisions. If they do, it is important that they are  sustained by more than the force of personality.", "Buying major systems is not the only area where DOD needs to improve its  acquisition practices. In fact, DOD\u2019s management of its contracts in  general has been on GAO\u2019s high-risk list since 1992. Contract management  remains a high-risk area at DOD to this day, in part, because DOD is  unable to assure that it is using sound business practices to acquire the  goods and services needed to meet the warfighter\u2019s needs, creating  unnecessary risks and paying higher prices than justified. In this regard, in  March 2005 we reported that deficiencies in DOD\u2019s oversight of service  contractors placed DOD at risk of paying the contractors more than the  value of the services they performed. In other reports, we identified  numerous issues in DOD\u2019s use of interagency contracting vehicles that  contributed to poor acquisition outcomes. Additionally, earlier this year,  we reported that the Army acquired guard services under authorized sole- source contract at 46 of 57 Army installations, despite the Army\u2019s  recognition that it was paying about 25 percent more for its sole-source  contracts than for those it had previously awarded competitively.", "Until the department devotes sufficient management attention to address  these longstanding issues, DOD remains at risk of wasting billions of  dollars and failing to get the goods and services it needs to accomplish its  missions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Supply Chain Management", "paragraphs": ["Since the January 2005 update of the high-risk series, DOD has made some  progress toward addressing supply chain management problems. With the  encouragement of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), DOD has  developed a plan to show progress toward the long-term goal of resolving  problems and removing supply chain management from our list of high- risk areas within the department. DOD issued the first iteration of the plan  in July 2005 and, since then, has regularly updated it. Based on our initial  review of the plan, we believe it is a solid first step toward improving  supply chain management in support of the warfighter. For example,  DOD\u2019s plan identifies three key areas\u2014supply requirements forecasting,  distribution of material, and asset visibility\u2014that we believe are critical to  DOD\u2019s efforts to improve supply chain management. The plan highlights  selected DOD supply chain initiatives, including key milestones in their  development. Within the last few months, for example, DOD has made  some progress in streamlining the storage and distribution of defense  inventory items on a regional basis as part of its Joint Regional Inventory  Materiel Management initiative. DOD has completed a pilot for this  initiative in the San Diego region and, in January 2006, began a similar  transition for inventory items in Oahu, Hawaii. Notwithstanding this  positive first step, the department faces challenges and risks in  successfully implementing its proposed changes across the department  and measuring progress. It will be important for DOD to sustain top  leadership commitment and long-term institutional support for the plan;  obtain necessary resource commitments from the military services, the  Defense Logistics Agency, and other organizations; implement its  proposed initiatives across the department; identify performance metrics  and valid data to use in monitoring the initiatives; and demonstrate  progress toward meeting performance targets. We have been holding  monthly meetings with DOD and OMB officials to receive updates on the  plan and gain a greater understanding of the ongoing initiatives. In  addition, we are continuing to review DOD\u2019s progress in implementing its  supply chain management plan, the extent the plan is strategically linked  to other logistics strategies, and the performance measures DOD is using  to track the plan\u2019s progress in resolving supply chain problems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Personnel Security Clearance Program", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s personnel security clearance program is another area that we  continue to assess because of the risks it poses.

For example, at the turn of the century, we  documented problems such as incomplete investigations, inconsistency in  determining eligibility for clearances, and a backlog of overdue clearance  reinvestigations that exceeded 500,000 cases. More recently in 2004, we  identified continuing and new impediments hampering DOD\u2019s clearance  program and made recommendations for increasing the effectiveness and  efficiency of the program. These longstanding delays in competing  hundreds of thousands of clearance requests for servicemembers, federal  employees, and industry personnel as well as numerous impediments that  hinder DOD\u2019s ability to accurately estimate and eliminate its clearance  backlog led us to declare DOD\u2019s personnel security clearance program a  high-risk area in January 2005.

Inefficient management practices and outdated business processes have  also contributed to the problem.", "While DOD has made progress and expects to continue making  improvements in its support infrastructure management, DOD officials  recognize they must achieve greater efficiencies. To its credit, the  department has given high-level emphasis to reforming its support  operations and infrastructure since we last reported on this high-risk area,  including efforts to reduce excess infrastructure, promote transformation,  and foster jointness through the 2005 base realignment and closure  (BRAC) process. Also, DOD is updating its Defense Installations Strategic  Plan to better address infrastructure issues, revise its installations  readiness reporting to better measure facility conditions, establish core  real property inventory data requirements to better support the needs of  real property asset management, and continues to modify its suite of  analytical tools to better forecast funding requirements for installation  management services.

While  DOD offered many proposed actions in the 2005 round, these actions  were more related to business process reengineering and realignment  of various functions and activities than base closures and actual facility  reductions. Moreover, sizable savings were projected from efficiency  measures and other actions, but many underlying assumptions had not  been validated and could be difficult to track over time. We have  ongoing work monitoring actions emanating from the 2005 BRAC  process and assessing costs and savings from those actions, and will be  able to comment further on the status of these initiatives over the next  several years as implementation actions progress.", "In June 2005, we reported that hundreds of millions of operation and  maintenance dollars designated for facilities sustainment, restoration,  and modernization and other purposes were moved by the services to  pay for base operations support (BOS) due in part to a lack of a  common terminology across the services in defining BOS functions, as  well as the lack of a mature analytic process for developing credible  and consistent requirements. While such funding movements are  permissible, we found that they were disruptive to the orderly  provision of BOS services and contributed to the overall degradation of  facilities which adversely affects the quality of life and morale of  military personnel.

In general, a MAIS is a major DOD IT  program that is not embedded in a weapon system (e.g., a business system  investment).", "The reporting requirements proposed in Section 804 are in many ways  similar to those for Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAPs), which  are typically weapon systems, including the cost increase reporting  mechanism commonly referred to as Nunn-McCurdy. For example,  Section 804 specifies cost increase percentage ranges that would prompt  congressional reporting and, if applicable, certification. However, there  are some major differences in the reporting requirements proposed for  MAIS programs as compared to those for MDAPs. For example, the  proposed language in Section 804 includes schedule delay thresholds, and  provides more specificity regarding performance changes by creating  criteria for either a \u201csignificant\u201d or a \u201ccritical\u201d change. While subjective in  the case of performance parameters, this added guidance is a positive step  towards increased visibility into the performance and progress of DOD  MAIS programs.", "Another difference is that the proposed amendment does not include  enforcement language similar to that contained in the Nunn-McCurdy  provision, which states that, should the required reports not be submitted  to Congress as required for an MDAP, appropriated funds may not be  obligated for a major contract under the program.", "There are two other provisions in the proposed language that the  Subcommittee may want to review. First, the proposed language mentions  the original information submitted to Congress as the basis for assessing  program changes. That would seem to mean the initial cost, schedule, and  performance \u201cbaseline\u201d submitted when the program is first reported to  Congress. However, there is a risk that any cost, schedule, and  performance variances would be reduced if the latest annual cost,  schedule, and performance information is instead used by DOD as the  \u201cbaseline.\u201d In effect, unless the proposed language is clarified, an  argument could be made that, given the annual requirement to submit the  MAIS program estimates, such programs could effectively be rebaselined  every year.", "Second, the terms \u201coriginal estimate\u201d or information \u201coriginally submitted\u201d  would also seem to mean the initial cost, schedule, and performance  \u201cbaseline\u201d for an entire MAIS program (i.e., total program estimate).  However, a best practice for acquiring large and complex business system  investments, preferred under the Clinger-Cohen Act and federal guidance,  is to define, design, develop, and deploy a given system in incremental  parts. Each increment should have its own set of cost, schedule, and  performance (and benefit) baselines that are used to justify investment in,  and measure performance and progress of, each increment. This practice  is intended to spread the risk of managing large and lengthy investments  across a progression of several smaller and shorter investments. The  proposed legislative language does not recognize this practice. Our work  has shown that even though major business system programs have known  shortfalls in meeting incremental baselines, shortfalls against total  program baselines are not similarly visible."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["Let me close where I began. DOD\u2019s senior leaders have demonstrated a  commitment to transforming the department and have taken several  positive steps to begin this effort. However, for a long time now, we\u2019ve  been saying that DOD needs a comprehensive, integrated, and  enterprisewide approach to decisionmaking and more sustained  leadership at the top.", "The long-term fiscal pressures we face as a nation and the size and trend  of our projected longer term deficits will intensify the need for DOD to  make disciplined and strategic investment decisions that identify and  balance risks across a wide range of programs, operations, and functions.  While DOD has established an enterprise architecture and transition plan  and governance organizations to facilitate transformation across the  department, we recognize that this is a large undertaking and we are still  monitoring DOD\u2019s efforts in this area.", "I continue to believe that DOD needs a chief management officer, because,  in part, no single individual, no matter how talented or experienced, can  effectively address all that needs to be addressed at DOD including  conducting the Global War on Terrorism, transforming the military and  tackling long-standing, systemic, business transformation challenges.  Without the strong and sustained leadership provided by a CMO, DOD will  likely continue to have difficulties in maintaining the oversight focus and  momentum needed to implement and sustain the reforms to its overall  business operations.", "Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee, this concludes my  prepared statement.
