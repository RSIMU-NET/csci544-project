The Year 2000 computing crisis has rightly received much attention in recent months; virtually every organization, public and private, that uses computers is at risk. The upcoming change of century is a sweeping and urgent challenge; for this reason, we have designated the Year 2000 computing problem a high-risk area for the federal government, and have published guidance to help organizations successfully address the issue. To date, we have issued over 60 reports and testimony statements detailing specific findings and recommendations related to the Year 2000 readiness of a wide range of federal agencies.", "In addition to reporting on the status of Labor\u2019s 61 mission-critical systems, I will, as requested, (1) focus on specific Year 2000 issues facing two elements of Labor\u2019s Employment and Training Administration and (2) discuss the Year 2000 efforts of the Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs (OWCP) and of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Finally, I will provide observations on the Year 2000 readiness of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC). In each case, I will highlight the status of these organizations\u2019 efforts and the specific risks associated with their key systems.", "In brief, the Department of Labor and its agencies have made progress, but are still at risk in several areas. These areas include making benefits payments to laid-off workers, collecting labor statistics, and ensuring accurate accounting for pension benefits. Several of the systems supporting these business areas are at risk; some could fail as early as January 1999\u2014less than 4 months away\u2014because they involve calculations a year into the future.

Established as a department in 1913, Labor is responsible for the administration and enforcement of over 180 federal statutes covering nearly 10 million employers and over 100 million workers. Labor administers and enforces a variety of federal laws guaranteeing workers\u2019 rights to a workplace free from safety and health hazards; a minimum hourly wage and overtime pay; family and medical leave; freedom from employment discrimination; unemployment insurance; and other income support, such as workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Labor also protects workers\u2019 pension rights; provides job training programs; helps workers find jobs; works to strengthen free collective bargaining; and keeps track of changes in employment, prices, and other national economic measures.", "For fiscal year 1998, Labor had an estimated budget of $34.6 billion and is authorized 16,700 staff. About three quarters of Labor\u2019s budget is composed of mandatory spending on income maintenance programs. The department\u2019s diverse functions are carried out by different offices in a decentralized structure: 24 component units, with over 1,000 field offices, to support its various functional responsibilities.", "Labor\u2019s five major areas of statutory responsibility include employment and training, employment health and safety, pension and welfare benefits, employment standards, and labor statistics. It has six major program agencies to carry out these responsibilities: the Employment and Training Administration, the Employment Standards Administration, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Mine Safety and Health Administration, and the Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation is a government corporation that administers the guaranteed retirement pension system.", "Labor\u2019s program activities fall into two major categories: enhancing workers\u2019 skills through job training and ensuring worker protection. In addition, it develops economic statistics, such as the consumer price index, used by business, labor, and government in forming fiscal and monetary policy and in making cost-of-living adjustments. Labor also provides temporary income support for laid-off workers seeking jobs and serves to assist workers in finding new jobs under federal-state partnerships."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Labor\u2019s Risks Require Strong Management Approach", "paragraphs": ["To perform its mission, Labor makes extensive use of complex information technology to support programmatic requirements, departmentwide communications, administrative functions, and office automation. It has identified 61 mission-critical systems for which it must ensure Year 2000 compliance. Without these systems, Labor has determined, it cannot effectively carry out numerous mission-critical functions, including (1) providing income security to millions of workers through a variety of benefits programs, (2) administering nationwide employment and training programs and services, (3) generating vital statistics on the U.S. economy, such as unemployment rates and the consumer price index, and (4) providing vital information to the public on a variety of employment issues, such as the security of pension plans, occupational injuries and illnesses, and employment rights.", "If Labor\u2019s systems are not Year 2000 compliant on or before January 1, 2000, the potential impact could be significant. For example, according to Labor officials, billions of dollars in benefits payments to Americans, such as unemployment insurance and workers\u2019 compensation, would be at significant risk of disruption, and accurate labor statistics on the economy used by both public and private organizations may not be produced. Further, the ability to manage the billions of dollars in assets for pension benefit guarantees for over 40 million workers could be hampered.", "The Year 2000 program is likely the largest and most complex project management and systems conversion activity ever to be undertaken by many federal agencies. It requires the disciplined, coordinated application of scarce resources to an agencywide system conversion that must be completed by a fixed date, and an understanding of the wide range of dependencies among information systems. To succeed, Labor must manage the Year 2000 program as a large systems development activity.", "An organization can mitigate its risk of Year 2000 complications through a structured approach and rigorous program management. One generally accepted approach, outlined in our Year 2000 Computing Crisis: An Assessment Guide (GAO/AIMD-10.1.14), includes five phases: awareness \u2014 defining the problem and gaining executive-level support; assessment \u2014 inventorying and analyzing systems, and prioritizing their renovation \u2014 converting, replacing, or eliminating selected systems; validation \u2014 ensuring that all converted or replaced systems and interfaces will work in an operational environment; and implementation \u2014 deploying Year 2000-compliant systems and components, and implementing contingency plans, if necessary."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Year 2000 Compliance Is Now a Departmental Priority", "paragraphs": ["Labor recognized several years ago that the upcoming change of century posed significant challenges to the agency, and in May 1996 reported to Congress that it had initiated Year 2000 activities. By late 1996, Labor\u2019s Year 2000 activities had increased, and it reported to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) that it completed the Year 2000 awareness phase in December 1996. During this time period, the Chief Information Officer (CIO) designated a Labor project manager for the Year 2000 effort, and together the CIO and the project manager held a series of briefings with executive staff, administrative officers, and information technology managers to ensure that Labor\u2019s executive and senior management levels were fully aware of the importance of the Year 2000 issue.", "In May 1997, Labor reported to OMB that its CIO had directed that each Labor component agency designate a Year 2000 project manager.

In August 1997, the department reported to OMB that it had completed the Year 2000 assessment phase using a three-tiered structure to evaluate and rank its systems to prioritize its Year 2000 compliance efforts. For example, it assigned the highest priority to the mission-critical systems that would have a direct impact on the public; enforcement activities; or financial systems, such as its benefits payment systems.", "In a memorandum dated December 31, 1997, the Secretary of Labor made Year 2000 compliance a top departmental priority, and directed steps to accelerate progress in reaching the department\u2019s target goals. The Deputy Secretary has also made the agency\u2019s Year 2000 progress a priority item in monthly meetings with each agency head. In February of this year, Labor established a monthly exception reporting system, requiring its component agencies to report any deviations from their Year 2000 plans. Labor uses this report as an early warning of potential issues needing attention.", "In August, Labor reported to OMB that 24 of its 61 mission-critical systems were compliant; table 1 shows the reported Year 2000 status of Labor\u2019s mission-critical systems as of August 1998."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Risks Facing Labor Components Affect Many Critical Workforce Issues", "paragraphs": ["The public relies on the Department of Labor and its components for assistance when unemployed, for protection and compensation in the workplace, for statistics on which many of the nation\u2019s critical economic indicators are based, and for ensuring the security of private pension plans.

Enacted over 60 years ago as part of the Social Security Act of 1935 as a federal-state partnership, the Unemployment Insurance Program has been a major source of temporary income support for laid-off workers seeking work. The Employment Services Program, which was established by the Wagner-Peyser Act of 1933, as amended, has assisted workers in finding new jobs. State Employment Security Agencies (SESA) operate the programs in accordance with their own state priorities and unemployment compensation laws; therefore, each state has substantial control over provided services, eligibility requirements, and benefits levels. SESAs provide three distinct benefits: unemployment insurance, employment services, and state administration of the Job Training Partnership Act.", "The department and the states share responsibility for administration of the Unemployment Insurance Program. Labor\u2019s UIS is responsible for establishing broad guidelines (including some eligibility conditions), general oversight, and administrative funding. SESAs pay unemployment compensation benefits from the Unemployment Trust Fund to eligible workers and collect state unemployment taxes from employers.", "Today, 97 percent of all wage earners are covered by this program. Unemployment insurance will pay an estimated $24 billion to approximately 8 million workers in compensation benefits and allowances from the Unemployment Trust Fund in fiscal year 1999. During this same period, SESA staff will handle over 6 million employer tax accounts, 20 million initial unemployment claims, almost 137 million \u201cweeks claimed,\u201d and 1 million appeals. In fiscal year 1998, SESAs collected $22 billion in state unemployment insurance taxes.", "Because each of the 53 SESAs (one for each state and the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands) has its own system, Labor\u2019s UIS reported only one mission-critical system to OMB\u2014the UIS itself, which collects information from numerous state sources to measure and monitor state unemployment insurance performance and workload and budgeting activities. According to Labor reports, the expected implementation date for this system is February 1999.", "According to Labor\u2019s contingency planning guidance issued to SESAs, if SESA benefits systems were to become inoperable, benefits payments could be jeopardized; if its tax system failed, tax collections could suffer. Successful operation of the benefits and tax functions depend heavily on complex information systems, a wide range of internal and external products and services, and the uninterrupted operation of the major information technology infrastructure.", "Many SESA systems are already at risk of date problems due to Year-2000 related failures occurring as early as January 1999. The SESAs\u2019 unemployment insurance benefits systems are vulnerable to this because of benefit year date calculations used in determining claimant eligibility. These projected date calculations are relied upon throughout state benefits systems, and can cause systems failures as early as January 1999, if not corrected. For example, if a claim is filed January 4, 1999, it will have a benefit year ending date of January 3, 2000. If states\u2019 benefits system have not been repaired, Labor expects these systems to fail as early as January 1999\u20143 and a half months from today\u2014because they would not properly recognize dates beyond 2000.
