In  2013, an estimated 43.8 million adults (18.5 percent) had a mental health  condition\u2014including 10 million adults (4.2 percent) with a serious mental  illness\u2014and 20.3 million (8.5 percent) had a substance use condition.  Concerns about the availability of behavioral health treatment, particularly  for low-income individuals, have been longstanding. Medicaid, a joint  federal-state program that finances health care coverage for low-income  and medically needy individuals, is the largest payer for behavioral health  treatment in the nation. However, research has shown that individuals  enrolled in Medicaid experience a higher rate of behavioral health  conditions than those with private insurance, and may have difficulty  accessing treatment. Moreover, the demand for behavioral health  treatment is likely to increase as 29 states have chosen to expand  eligibility for Medicaid as allowed by the Patient Protection and Affordable  Care Act (PPACA). Under PPACA, states are permitted to expand  eligibility for Medicaid to certain adults with incomes up to 138 percent of  the federal poverty level (FPL). PPACA requires states that expand  Medicaid to provide newly eligible enrollees with health care coverage  that includes behavioral health benefits. Expansions of Medicaid,  coupled with high rates of need among low-income individuals, raise  questions about the capacity of states that expanded Medicaid to handle  the increased demand for behavioral health treatment. For states that  have not expanded Medicaid, additional questions arise about what  treatment options states are able to provide for low-income, uninsured  adults with behavioral health conditions.", "Given the potential challenges states may face in providing behavioral  health treatment to low-income adults, you asked us to provide  information about access to and utilization of behavioral health treatments  among low-income adults newly eligible for Medicaid, as well as options  for behavioral health treatment for low-income, uninsured adults not  eligible for Medicaid in states that have not expanded the program. This  report describes (1) what is known about how many low-income,  uninsured adults may have a behavioral health condition; (2) what options  exist for low-income, uninsured adults to receive behavioral health  treatment in selected states that have not expanded Medicaid; and   (3) how selected Medicaid expansion states provide behavioral health  coverage for newly eligible enrollees, and how enrollment in coverage  affects treatment availability.", "To describe what is known about how many low-income, uninsured adults  may have a behavioral health condition, we obtained national and state- level estimates of low-income, nonelderly adults who may have a  behavioral health condition from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health   Services Administration (SAMHSA). Low-income refers to individuals  who are at or below 138 percent of the FPL, which reflects those who  may be newly eligible for Medicaid in states that chose to expand their  programs under PPACA. However, these estimates are based on the  total low-income population in the state and do not differentiate between  previously eligible and newly eligible adults. Furthermore, the methods  used to produce the estimates do not account for variation in uptake rates  for the Medicaid program, which is the proportion of eligible individuals   After reviewing the data sources and  who ultimately choose to enroll.methods used to produce these estimates and checking for obvious  errors, we determined that the estimates were sufficiently reliable for our  purposes. For these estimates, we limited behavioral health conditions to  substance use conditions and serious mental illnesses, as opposed to the  more inclusive definition of behavioral health conditions used for the  remainder of this report, which comprise substance use conditions and all  mental health conditions. To examine the options that exist for low- income, uninsured adults to receive behavioral health treatment in  selected states that have not expanded Medicaid, we selected four states  (Missouri, Montana, Texas, and Wisconsin) to obtain variation among  states in total population size, adult Medicaid enrollment, percent change  in Medicaid enrollment from 2013 to 2014, per capita number of  behavioral health professionals, and geographic region. We reviewed  documentation and conducted interviews with officials from state  behavioral health agencies (BHA), which also play a role in funding   To determine how states that expanded  behavioral health treatment.Medicaid provided behavioral health coverage and the extent to which  Medicaid coverage affected the availability of treatment, we selected six  states (Connecticut, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Nevada, and West  Virginia). We chose to select more expansion states than non-expansion  states because of the greater policy and enrollment changes taking place  in those states as they implemented the expansion of Medicaid. We  selected expansion states to achieve variation in the same characteristics  we used to select non-expansion states, with one additional  characteristic, which was the delivery system (e.g., fee-for-service (FFS)  or managed care) used in their Medicaid programs. For each state, we  reviewed documentation regarding their state Medicaid programs, and  conducted interviews with Medicaid and state BHA officials. The reported  experiences of expansion and non-expansion states cannot be  generalized to all states. To obtain contextual information about  behavioral health treatment in both expansion and non-expansion states,  we interviewed representatives from behavioral health professional and  advocacy groups, and spoke with a behavioral health benefits manager,  an organization that manages benefits for state Medicaid programs.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2014 through June 2015  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Behavioral health treatment can  help individuals reduce their symptoms and improve their ability to  function. However, research suggests that a substantial number of  individuals with behavioral health conditions may not receive any  treatment or less than the recommended treatment, even among those  with serious conditions. For example, in 2013, SAMHSA estimated that  there were 3.9 million adults aged 18 or older with a serious mental  illness who perceived an unmet need for mental health care within the  last 12 months. This number includes an estimated 1.3 million adults with  a serious mental illness who did not receive any mental health services.

Some state officials raised  concerns about having enough state BHA funding for individuals who  would remain uninsured or underinsured following expansion, including  individuals who are eligible but do not enroll or re-enroll in Medicaid,  immigrants, and certain individuals under 65 who are enrolled in  Medicare because of a disability. Officials from two states also  expressed concerns about the adequacy of funding for wraparound  services\u2014services that are not covered by their states\u2019 Medicaid  programs, such as supportive housing\u2014for Medicaid enrollees. Officials  from the four states that reported BHA budget reductions noted that there  were subsequent adjustments to their budgets to lessen the impact of the  reductions based on these concerns. For example, Michigan\u2019s BHA  received an additional $25 million for fiscal year 2015 to address  behavioral health needs in certain populations that remain ineligible for  Medicaid. (See appendix II for more information on expansion-related  changes in state BHA budgets.) Despite concerns about budget  reductions, officials from two states noted that when additional Medicaid  funds from the expansion were considered as part of the behavioral  health budget, much more funding was available overall.", "Other continuing access problems mentioned by state officials related to  inpatient behavioral health treatment.", "Nevada officials said that lack of psychiatric inpatient capacity has led  to patients who were considered a risk to themselves or others being  kept in emergency rooms for up to several days before they could  secure a bed in a psychiatric hospital. Officials said that an average of  90 to 110 patients per day, predominately Medicaid enrollees, were  waiting in emergency rooms. Nevada has made efforts to address the  problem, for example, by sending teams of psychiatrists to emergency  rooms to assess psychiatric patients to determine whether they could  be discharged and treated on an outpatient basis. However, officials  noted that discharging such patients carries risks and has led to poor  outcomes in the past.", "Kentucky officials said that they were working to expand capacity for  residential treatment programs for substance use. Officials said that  given Medicaid\u2019s exclusion of payment for treatment for adults at  \u201cinstitutions for mental disease\u201d with 16 or more beds, they were  encouraging providers to design any new residential substance use  programs to be under that limit. However, they noted that doing so  can prevent providers from taking advantage of economies of scale  and may make it more difficult to operate some residential treatment  programs shown to be effective for substance use conditions. Officials  said that the state was working to develop alternatives to inpatient  care for Medicaid enrollees, such as transitional housing combined  with an intensive outpatient program."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Department of Health and Human  Services for review.
