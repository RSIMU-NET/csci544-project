Officials from AFRICOM's subordinate commands stated that applying OCS concepts would be helpful to avoid duplication of work and increased costs. One structure that the Department of Defense (DOD) has introduced is an OCS Integration Cell, an entity with dedicated personnel to provide staff integration and promote coordination on OCS issues; such a cell could help identify and address gaps at AFRICOM's commands, especially in a joint environment like Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa, where contracting officials stated that some military tenants have arrived without informing responsible officials about the number of contractors accompanying them. AFRICOM has also developed a scorecard to assess OCS management capabilities at the subordinate commands against certain standards, but these assessments have not always been accurate because the standards have not been clearly defined or consistently applied. Without clearly defined assessment standards, AFRICOM cannot accurately assess the OCS actions taken by subordinate commands.", "AFRICOM does not have a complete picture of the number of contractor personnel supporting its operations in the region. AFRICOM uses two primary sources\u2014daily personnel status reports and the Synchronized Predeployment and Operational Tracker, a DOD contractor personnel accountability database\u2014to collect contractor personnel accountability information, but neither source provides comprehensive accountability or visibility of DOD contractor personnel on the continent because the total number of local national contractor personnel are not being included in either, and the numbers of U.S. citizen and third country national contractor personnel vary between the two. Without clear guidance on how to comprehensively account for contractor personnel, it will be difficult for AFRICOM to ensure that it has full visibility over who is supporting its operations.", "AFRICOM conducts some limited vetting of potential non-U.S. contractors, also referred to as vendors, but it has not established a foreign vendor vetting process or cell that would preemptively identify vendors who support terrorist or other prohibited organizations. AFRICOM has not yet established a foreign vendor vetting cell because while DOD guidance discusses the benefit of a cell, it does not require it or specify under what conditions it would be appropriate. Additionally, DOD sites in Africa use background investigations to determine the trustworthiness of contractor employees with access to DOD facilities. However, not all AFRICOM sites are incorporating additional screening measures, such as biometric screening or counterintelligence interviews, based on the specific risks at each site. As a result, AFRICOM is at risk of not exercising the appropriate level of vendor vetting or contractor employee screening on the African continent to protect DOD personnel from insider threats."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO made recommendations to DOD regarding types of contractor personnel to account for, foreign vendor vetting process development, and guidance for contractor accountability and employee screening, among others.

OCS is the process of planning for and obtaining supplies,  services, and construction from commercial sources in support of joint  operations. In our body of work on OCS, we have reported that DOD  has long experienced challenges in managing OCS. For example, in our  2015 report highlighting high risk issues in the federal government, we  reported that DOD continues to face capacity shortfalls and lacks  performance measures to address operational contract support issues.  In February 2013 we reported that, with the exception of the Army, the  military services had not issued comprehensive service-specific guidance  that described roles, responsibilities, and requirements to help integrate  OCS into their planning efforts for contingency operations. Further, in  June 2010 and again in September 2012 we testified on the need for a  cultural change in DOD that emphasizes an awareness of OCS  throughout the department to address the challenges faced in  contingency operations.

This reliance on contractors was  highlighted in September 2014 when AFRICOM supported the U.S.  Agency for International Development and Liberia under Operation United  Assistance in responding to the largest Ebola epidemic in history.  AFRICOM reported having approximately 5,600 personnel on the  African continent in October 2014, of whom 569\u2014approximately 10  percent\u2014were U.S. citizen contractor personnel. Moreover, the dollar  value associated with DOD contracts in AFRICOM\u2019s area of responsibility  more than doubled, from $147 million in fiscal year 2009 to $463 million in  fiscal year 2014. While the dollar value associated with these contracts  decreased in most regions from fiscal year 2013 to fiscal year 2014 (see  figure 1), AFRICOM officials expect the need for contract support to  increase as regional instability and responsibilities for protecting U.S.  personnel and facilities continue."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "OCS Functions", "paragraphs": ["OCS is the process of planning for and obtaining supplies, services, and  construction from commercial sources in support of joint operations.

Additionally, staff assistance  visits help AFRICOM officials to gain a better understanding of OCS  procedures and challenges at the subordinate commands. Common  observations that have been made during such visits include noting a lack  of standardized OCS organization at the subordinate command levels,  noting constrained subordinate command resources for managing OCS,  and noting a lack of OCS training.

As a result,  operations might be delayed or might be carried out without sufficient  equipment or support services. An OCS Integration Cell or similar  structure with dedicated OCS personnel at the other service component  commands could help identify contract support issues early in the  requirements development process, thereby enabling the commands to  avoid delays. For example, U.S Army Africa\u2019s dedicated OCS personnel  and the 414th Contracting Support Brigade have corrected potential  issues regarding poor coordination of contracts. U.S. Army Africa officials  stated that an Army unit may fail to inform contracting officials about what  equipment they are bringing along on deployment, or may disregard  training on how to properly draft a performance work statement.

As of  January 2015, according to officials, Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of  Africa had two officials in the contingency contracting office and one  logistics official who received OCS training. Officials further stated that  Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa plans to dissolve its  contingency contracting office entirely by the end of fiscal year 2016, as it  transitions to a more enduring presence at Camp Lemonnier, Djibouti.  DOD officials stated that there are plans to create two dedicated OCS  positions within the Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa\u2019s logistics  directorate. As dedicated personnel, these officials could carry out some  OCS coordinating tasks and could frequently communicate with logistics,  operations, and planning officials about OCS issues. However, an OCS  Integration Cell would provide a permanent centralized coordination point  within the joint environment at Camp Lemonnier. Furthermore, this type of  coordination will be increasingly important in the future, as DOD develops  a more enduring joint presence at Camp Lemonnier.", "At the subordinate joint force command level, joint guidance provides that  an OCS Integration Cell should normally exist, depending on mission  conditions, but the guidance does not specify those conditions. As a  result, there is no clear guidance directing Combined Joint Task Force- Horn of Africa or Special Operations Command Africa to establish an  OCS Integration Cell. An OCS Integration Cell or similar structure would  be particularly useful in a joint environment due to the number of military  service contracting elements operating at one location with potentially  limited resources. According to Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa  contracting officials, applying OCS concepts such as establishing an OCS  Integration Cell at Camp Lemonnier would be helpful to avoid duplication  of work and increased costs. For example, there are multiple car rental  contracts for different service components located at Camp Lemonnier,  Djibouti. Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa contracting officials  stated that if they had all contracted with one vendor they would have  gotten a better price. As another example, officials at Camp Lemonnier  stated that some military service tenants have arrived without previously  informing the Navy as the Lead Service for Contracting at Camp  Lemonnier about the number of contractor personnel accompanying  them. Without prior coordination, Navy officials do not know how much  housing, food, and fuel they require at the base.

For example, one  component task is to incorporate OCS-specific tasks into exercises.  AFRICOM assessed Air Force Africa as compliant on this task. However,  Air Force Africa officials stated that they did not participate in any  exercises during the assessment time period, so they did not incorporate  OCS tasks into exercises. In another example, Special Operations  Command Africa officials stated that they had processes for awarding  contracts, but they lacked standard processes for incorporating OCS into  planning and requirements determinations. However, AFRICOM listed  Special Operations Command Africa as possessing standardized  processes for support units and activities because the scorecard does not  specify that these processes should specifically involve the incorporation  of OCS into planning and requirements development.", "Furthermore, AFRICOM applied different standards of compliance to  different subordinate commands. For example, one component task  focuses on contractor accountability through the utilization of SPOT, a  contractor personnel accountability database.

AFRICOM also reported approximately 350 U.S.  contractor personnel at Camp Lemonnier, Djibouti, in October 2014  through its daily personnel status reports. These contractor personnel  performed a number of functions, including transportation, engineering,  and construction.", "AFRICOM officials expect the number of contractor personnel on the  continent to continue to increase. Plans for expansion at Camp  Lemonnier in 2015 include numerous projects to increase capacity such  as expansion of emergency troop housing, taxiway extension, living and  working quarters, aircraft loading areas, and upgrades to existing power  plant capabilities. Although AFRICOM officials stated that they expect the  number of contractors at Camp Lemonnier to decrease over time as  construction is completed, they also stated that they expect the total  number of contractor personnel on the African continent to continue to  increase and shift from location to location as missions evolve,  particularly with regard to special operations. For example, officials from  Special Operations Command Africa stated that they are experiencing a  significant increase in contracting actions for Combined Joint Task Force- Horn of Africa and that plans are in place to add 10 contingency  contracting officers to Special Operations Command Africa for fiscal year  2016. Officials stated that it is extremely important to integrate OCS into  planning for the base\u2019s expansion.

According to  AFRICOM guidance, military service components, joint task forces, sub- unified commands, and forward operating sites in the AFRICOM area of  responsibility are responsible for accounting for all military, DOD civilian,  and DOD contractor personnel assigned, attached to, or under their  operational control, and they must submit a daily personnel status report  to AFRICOM personnel officials via email.

These reports generally account for  U.S. contractor personnel, but they do not consistently include local or  third country national contractor personnel, or certain U.S. citizen  contractor personnel not directly assigned to a U.S. installation. For  example, the 414th Contracting Support Brigade in Uganda accounts for  local and third country national contractor personnel in its daily personnel  status report, but daily personnel status reports from the Air Force in  Niger do not.

AFRICOM  officials stated that they interpreted this guidance as directing them to  account only for U.S. citizen contractor personnel in the daily personnel  status reports. Conversely, service component officials at some forward  operating sites included both third country and local national, as well as  U.S. citizen, contractor personnel in their personnel status reports sent to  AFRICOM. AFRICOM guidance indicates that personnel status reports  should include all military, civilian, and contractor personnel assigned,  attached, or under the operational control of the service component, sub- unified command, joint task force, or forward operating site commander.  However, AFRICOM guidance does not specify whether these contractor  personnel include third country or local national contractor personnel such  as linguists, or U.S. citizen contractor personnel who are under the  operational control of the local commander but do not live on the  installation. In addition, AFRICOM officials stated that while they receive  daily personnel status reports from all of the services, they do not have  complete information on how each of the services is collecting this  information.

DOD contracting officials subsequently modified the primary base  services contract for Camp Lemonnier to include a SPOT accountability  requirement specific to Djibouti. Officials from the primary base services  company at Camp Lemonnier stated that they have plans to report U.S.  citizen and third country national employees in SPOT, but they did not  provide a timeframe for doing so. In addition, according to Camp  Lemonnier officials, construction contractors building facilities at the site  do not account for their U.S. citizen, third country, and local national  contractor personnel in SPOT and do not have plans for doing so.", "Various provisions in guidance cover the use of SPOT to account for  contractor personnel. In December 2014 AFRICOM issued an interim  policy for the use of SPOT to account for and maintain visibility of  contractor personnel in the AFRICOM area of responsibility. The  guidance states that AFRICOM requires the use of SPOT, or its  successor, to account for contractor personnel in all phases of operations.  It states that SPOT is to be used for all U.S. citizens and third country  nationals deploying to the area of responsibility, regardless of contract  dollar amount. SPOT is also to be used to report an aggregate count of all  local nationals on a monthly basis for contracts employing these  personnel with periods of performance longer than 30 days. AFRICOM\u2019s  OCS annex to the theater campaign plan indicates that SPOT should be  utilized to account for contractor personnel deploying to the area of  responsibility and that contracting agencies will direct contractors to input  required information, although it does not specify what type of contractor  personnel should be registered in SPOT in these provisions. In addition,  guidance issued by DOD directs the use of clauses that would require  contractors to use SPOT to account for certain contractor personnel  supporting DOD operations in Djibouti and in Operation United  Assistance. However, we found that many of the contracts identified by  DOD as involving performance in Djibouti or in support of Operation  United Assistance did not contain the clauses. Although DOD guidance  directs the inclusion of the clauses for new contracts providing supplies or  services in Djibouti and for Operation United Assistance, and modification  of existing contracts to the extent feasible, in some cases there may be a  good reason for omitting the clause. For example, if the contract is for  hotel lodging, it may not make sense to have hotel employees registered  in SPOT. In other contracts where the personnel will be directly  supporting operations at DOD facilities, such as those for construction or  base support, requiring the contractor to register its personnel in SPOT  would help AFRICOM to identify who is supporting its operations and for  whom it may be responsible in the event of an emergency.", "AFRICOM personnel accountability guidance is unclear. As stated earlier,  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff guidance does not specify what  types of contractor personnel, such as U.S. citizen, third country national,  or local national, should be included in joint personnel status reports.

Without clarification and deconfliction of  guidance, AFRICOM and its subordinate commands will not know what  types of contractor personnel to include in personnel status reports and in  SPOT, and they could continue to account for these personnel  inconsistently. As a result, commanders are at risk of not having  comprehensive visibility over who is supporting DOD operations in the  area of responsibility. In addition, the AFRICOM area of responsibility lies  in an increasingly high threat environment. The Department of State has  identified 15 high threat posts on the continent.

In  addition, officials from all of AFRICOM\u2019s service components stated that  in their contracting process they use a list of vendors vetted by the local  U.S. embassy. However, U.S. Embassy and Department of State  headquarters officials stated that vendors on these lists are not vetted for  security risks or to determine whether they are connected to or supporting  any prohibited organizations; rather, they are vetted only for their ability to  provide the required services. As a result, AFRICOM\u2019s current vetting  process is limited in its ability to ensure that DOD is not funding prohibited  organizations in high risk areas.", "Current DOD guidance is not clear on what vendor vetting steps or  process should be established at each combatant command to mitigate  the risk of contracting with terrorist or other prohibited organizations. Joint  Publication 4-10 discusses the benefit of establishing a cell, when  circumstances warrant, to vet foreign vendors for possible security  concerns and avoid awarding contracts to companies that have ties to  insurgents. However, the guidance does not require the establishment  of a vendor vetting cell or specify under what conditions it would be  appropriate. Two combatant commands\u2014U.S. Transportation Command  and U.S. Central Command\u2014have established foreign vendor vetting  cells for this purpose. Although AFRICOM does not have its own foreign  vendor vetting cell, during AFRICOM\u2019s most recent contingency  operation\u2014Operation United Assistance\u2014AFRICOM requested  assistance from U.S. Transportation Command\u2019s foreign vendor vetting  cell to provide threat assessments on all of the vendors that had been  awarded AFRICOM contracts. Although U.S. Transportation Command  was able to take on this additional workload, AFRICOM does not have a  written agreement to use that command\u2019s vetting capability, and it may  not be able to leverage U.S. Transportation Command\u2019s capabilities for  future contingencies.", "In addition, AFRICOM may not be fully prepared to avoid contracting with  vendors who may also be supporting the enemy should it become actively  engaged in hostilities. In response to recent statutory provisions regarding  contracting with the enemy, DOD has issued guidance for geographic  combatant commands (with the exception of U.S. Northern Command) to  identify persons or entities who directly or indirectly provide funds,  including goods and services, received under covered contracts to person  or entities that are actively opposing U.S. or Coalition forces in a  contingency operation in which the armed forces are actively engaged in  hostilities. According to DOD officials, the list of identified persons and  entities is integrated into the System for Award Management. As noted  above, the guidance also requires contracting officers to check this  database to ensure that contracts are not awarded to prohibited or  restricted persons or entities. According to officials, U.S. Central  Command is the only combatant command that is currently required to  proactively identify these vendors, organizations, and people and add  them to the prohibited entities list because it is the only combatant  command currently engaged in hostilities in a contingency environment.  Although AFRICOM does not currently have any declared contingency  operations involving active hostilities, it operates in a high threat  environment in which hostilities could quickly arise. Without having a  foreign vendor vetting process in place, it will be difficult for AFRICOM to  recognize and thereby avoid instances of contracting with the enemy.", "AFRICOM officials agree that a foreign vendor vetting process would  reduce the risk that they would contract with prohibited entities, and they  have drafted guidance on establishing a foreign vendor vetting cell.  However, AFRICOM officials stated that they would need specific  guidance from the Office of the Secretary of Defense or Joint Chiefs of  Staff specifying the conditions under which combatant commands should  establish a vendor vetting cell to effectively implement this process.

In 2011 we recommended that U.S. Central  Command consider a risk-based approach in identifying and vetting the  highest-risk foreign vendors. In response to our recommendation, U.S.  Central Command established a formalized risk-based vetting program.  Its vetting process is designed to ensure that DOD funds are not used for  illicit purposes and to provide a risk management tool to identify foreign  vendors that have ties to the insurgency or that are involved in nefarious  activities. While the establishment of a foreign vendor vetting cell may not  be appropriate for all operations, published DOD guidance specifying  under what circumstances and how a vetting cell should be established  would better position AFRICOM and other commands to avoid contracting  with the enemy in high threat areas or in the event that they become  actively engaged in hostilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "AFRICOM Sites That GAO Visited Use Background Investigations to Screen Contractor Employees but Lack Risk-Based Guidance for Incorporating Additional Screening Measures", "paragraphs": ["AFRICOM generally operates in a high threat area of responsibility, and  the screening of non-U.S. personnel entering AFRICOM facilities protects  DOD personnel, equipment, and installations from acts of espionage,  sabotage, or other intelligence activities.

In August 2009  AFRICOM issued a Biometrics Concept of Operations stating that, to the  maximum extent allowable under policy and law, persons requiring  access to DOD installations in the AFRICOM area of responsibility will be  enrolled into a biometrics database. However, Camp Lemonnier,  Djibouti, is the only site we visited that has fully incorporated biometrics  screening into its contractor employee screening process.

We  found that Camp Lemonnier, Djibouti, was the only site of the three we  visited that had clearly outlined contractor employee screening processes  in local base security guidance. The Air Force\u2019s site in Niamey, Niger, has  base security guidance, but it does not describe its contractor employee  screening process.", "One reason cited by officials for not developing local contractor employee  screening procedures and policies was that AFRICOM has not yet  specified what measures should be incorporated into the sites\u2019 contractor  employee screening processes. DOD Instruction 2000.12, providing  guidance for the DOD Antiterrorism Program, states that combatant  commands shall establish antiterrorism policies and programs for the  protection of all DOD elements and personnel in their areas of  responsibility. One of the minimum elements of an antiterrorism  program is risk management. Antiterrorism risk management includes the  determination of how best to employ given resources and force protection  measures to deter, mitigate, or prepare for a terrorist incident. Those  measures could include contractor employee screening measures.  AFRICOM drafted contractor employee screening guidance in November  2014, which it subsequently updated. As of June 2015, AFRICOM  officials stated that the guidance was under review, but they did not  provide a timeframe for its issuance.

The enhanced capabilities  offered by OCS can be a significant force multiplier in every phase of joint  and coalition operations in Africa. Conversely, the inability to effectively  manage and plan for OCS could yield unintended consequences such as  higher costs and inadvertent contracting with vendors that have ties to  violent extremist organizations that could complicate or even undermine  operational objectives. While AFRICOM has taken steps to manage and  plan for OCS, challenges remain in areas such as development of OCS  structures, assessments of subordinate command capabilities, accounting  of the total number of contractor personnel, and contractor vetting.  Several of AFRICOM\u2019s subordinate commands\u2014service component and  joint force commands\u2014lack organizational structures, such as OCS  Integration Cells, with dedicated personnel to manage and plan for OCS.  A structure such as an OCS Integration Cell would be particularly useful  in a joint environment, such as Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of  Africa, due to the number of military service contracting elements  operating at the same location, with potentially limited resources.  Additionally, clearly defined assessment standards could help AFRICOM  to more accurately assess the OCS actions taken by subordinate  commands. Furthermore, AFRICOM cannot comprehensively account for  DOD contractors on the continent because AFRICOM and joint staff  guidance is unclear regarding the types of contractors who should be  accounted for and by which personnel accountability process. Clear  guidance could help AFRICOM to determine how many contractors  support DOD operations in the region, providing commanders with  greater visibility over who is supporting DOD operations in the area of  responsibility.

Moreover, there is no guidance clarifying when  combatant commands should develop procedures for transmitting names  of vendors identified through such a vendor vetting process for inclusion  in prohibited entities lists. Finally, not all of the AFRICOM forward  operating sites we visited are incorporating additional screening  measures according to the specific risks at each site.

Moreover, an OCS Integration Cell or  similar structure could help identify contract support issues early in the  requirements development process, thereby enabling the service  component commands to avoid delays in receiving needed equipment or  services.

AFRICOM further stated that it had scheduled a staff assistance visit to  Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa to assess and develop a plan  for establishing an OCS Integration Cell. We acknowledge that  AFRICOM\u2019s statement in its comments clarifies that an OCS Integration  Cell should be established at a subordinate joint force command, and  believe that the scheduling of a staff assistance visit to Combined Joint  Task Force-Horn of Africa is a positive first step toward establishing a cell  there. However, we also believe that providing that clarification in  AFRICOM guidance would better ensure the establishment of such a cell  at various types of subordinate joint force commands. As we noted in the  report, an OCS Integration Cell was established at AFRICOM\u2019s  subordinate joint force command supporting Operation United Assistance  in 2014, but not at the Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa in  Djibouti, or Special Operations Command Africa.

Guidance clarifying  under what conditions a subordinate joint force command should  establish an OCS Cell, if fully implemented, would meet the intent of our  recommendation.", "DOD partially concurred with the third recommendation, that AFRICOM  clarify the scorecard process, including assessment standards, for OCS  Readiness Scorecards to ensure that evaluators can accurately assess  subordinate commands\u2019 OCS capabilities. DOD stated that the scorecard  is a command initiative designed to drive discussion about OCS issues  with subordinate commands, but is not a replacement for the Defense  Readiness Reporting System to report OCS. We agree that the scorecard  is not such a replacement. However, as noted in the report, AFRICOM  officials stated that they plan to incorporate OCS scorecards into the  Defense Readiness Reporting System, the system used to gauge  readiness across DOD. This recommendation was intended to ensure  that OCS scorecard assessment standards are clearly defined so that  AFRICOM can accurately assess OCS actions taken by subordinate  commands. Without improvements, either full or partial incorporation of  the scorecard assessments into DOD\u2019s readiness reporting system could  compromise the integrity of that system by capturing an inaccurate picture  of OCS readiness.", "DOD concurred with our fourth recommendation, that the Secretary of  Defense, in coordination with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,  direct Joint Staff to clarify what types of contractor personnel should be  accounted for in its guidance on personnel status reports. In its  comments, DOD stated that Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Manual  3150.13C, Joint Personnel Reporting Structure-Personnel Manual  provides policy and guidance on what types of contractor personnel to  account for in personnel status reports, but that additional training and  amplifying local procedures issued by AFRICOM\u2019s personnel directorate  may be needed to fully implement its provisions and ensure consistent  interpretation of the guidance. As we noted in the report, the Chairman of  the Joint Chiefs of Staff guidance identifies SPOT as the designated web- based contractor database and lists the types of contractor personnel  included in SPOT\u2014including U.S., local national, host nation, and third  country national\u2014but it does not clearly specify the types of contractor  personnel to report in the daily personnel status report, and as a result,  service component officials at some forward operating sites inconsistently  included various types of contractors in personnel status reports. While  we believe that additional guidance provided by AFRICOM\u2019s personnel  directorate would provide further clarification on this issue, we continue to  believe that clarifying Joint Staff guidance to clearly specify the types of  contractor personnel to be accounted for in joint personnel status reports  would provide AFRICOM better assurance that its staff consistently  provides it with comprehensive information.", "DOD did not concur with the fifth recommendation, that the Secretary of  Defense, in coordination with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,  direct AFRICOM to develop area of responsibility-wide contractor  personnel accountability guidance on or before December 2015, when  the current guidance expires, that clarifies which types of contractor  personnel should be accounted for using SPOT and when SPOT  accountability requirements should be incorporated into contracts. DOD  stated that there is not a requirement for the Secretary of Defense to  direct AFRICOM to develop this guidance. We agree that it may not be  necessary for the Secretary of Defense to direct this action and  accordingly adjusted the language of the recommendation directly to  AFRICOM. Additionally, DOD stated it is coordinating a draft class  deviation to the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement on  accountability requirements for contractor personnel performing in the  AFRICOM area of responsibility, which it expects to be approved and  published by December 2015. We acknowledge that this class deviation,  when completed, may provide further clarity on the types of contractor  personnel to include in SPOT. However, we continue to believe that  AFRICOM could benefit from developing and issuing contractor personnel  accountability guidance for its area of responsibility. Specifically, as we  noted in the report, there have been no changes to the Defense Federal  Acquisition Regulation Supplement to date on this topic, DOD has not  issued a Class Deviation, and AFRICOM\u2019s existing interim guidance  expires in December 2015. Thus, we continue to believe that clear  accountability guidance would enable AFRICOM to more consistently and  comprehensively determine how many contractor personnel support DOD  operations in the region.", "DOD concurred with our sixth recommendation, that the Secretary of  Defense, in coordination with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,  develop guidance that clarifies the conditions under which combatant  commands should have a foreign vendor vetting process or cell in place  to determine whether potential vendors actively support any terrorist,  criminal or other sanctioned organizations, including clarifying when  combatant commands should develop procedures for transmitting the  names of any vendors identified through this process for inclusion in  prohibited entities list in the appropriate federal contracting databases,  such as the System for Award Management. In its comments, DOD  stated that OSD has established a joint working group to identify key  stakeholders and develop DOD policy requiring combatant commands to  develop foreign vendor vetting processes. When fully implemented, we  believe these actions would meet the intent of our recommendation.", "DOD concurred with our seventh recommendation, that AFRICOM  continue to complete and issue guidance that specifics the standard of  contractor employee screening for forward operating sites, based on  factors such as the number of DOD personnel on base, type of  operations, and local security threat. In its comments, DOD stated that  AFRICOM has completed the staffing of a draft instruction that will  provide guidance and specify the standards for contractor employee  screening for forward operating sites, including a risk-based approach to  contractor employee screening based on applicable mitigating factors that  include the type of contractor, operations and local security threat. While  we have not seen an updated version of this draft guidance that includes  a risk-based approach to screening, if it is fully implemented as described  above, it would meet the intent of our recommendation.", "We are providing copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of  Staff and the AFRICOM Commander.

The focus of this review was on AFRICOM  and its subordinate commands, including the service component  commands, as well as Special Operations Command Africa in Europe,  and the Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa at Camp Lemonnier in  Djibouti. Further, in terms of our review of AFRICOM contractor personnel  accountability and contractor vetting, our scope included only contract  support on the African continent, excluding contract support located at  AFRICOM headquarters.", "To determine the extent to which AFRICOM has an organizational  structure in place to manage, plan for, and assess operational contract  support, we gathered information from and conducted interviews with  officials at AFRICOM headquarters, as well as the AFRICOM service  component command headquarters in Europe. To determine the extent to  which AFRICOM assesses OCS capabilities, we evaluated the OCS  readiness scorecards created by AFRICOM J4 (Logistics Directorate) to  measure its service components\u2019 OCS capabilities in 2014. In its  assessment of the component commands, AFRICOM J4 rated each  service component as compliant, partially compliant, or non-compliant  with OCS tasks for four performance measure categories: planning,  policy, operations/exercises/security cooperation, and administration. We  evaluated the ratings that J4 applied to the service components in these  categories to determine whether they were accurate. Specifically, to  evaluate the accuracy of the scorecard ratings, we validated the ratings  using evidence gathered from the service components and compared  ratings of the service components with similar conditions against one  another to determine whether they received the same ratings. To  evaluate the extent to which AFRICOM plans for OCS, we reviewed OCS  annexes\u2014Annex W\u2019s\u2014to AFRICOM\u2019s theater campaign plan and its  regional campaign plans to determine the extent to which they included  key OCS concepts outlined in DOD and joint staff guidance.", "To determine the extent to which AFRICOM accounts for contractor  personnel, we reviewed DOD, AFRICOM, and Joint Staff personnel  accountability guidance and interviewed AFRICOM J1 officials, as well as  military service officials with personnel accountability responsibilities at  the AFRICOM forward operating sites we visited. In addition, we reviewed  contracts with place of performance in Djibouti from March 2013 to  February 2014, as well as Operation United Assistance (OUA) contracts  from December 2014 to February 2015 listed in the All Government  Contract Spend data, to determine whether they included clauses to  register employees supporting the contracts in the Synchronized  Predeployment and Operational Tracker (SPOT). The different  timeframes used for the selection of those contracts were based, in part,  on the timing of various DOD requirements to use clauses that included  SPOT-related provisions. Finally, we reviewed monthly SPOT data from  2011 to 2015 provided by AFRICOM personnel officials to determine  whether the numbers of contractor personnel had increased or decreased  within the past 5 years. We conducted a data reliability analysis of this  information, including corroborating the data with agency officials to  ensure that it is accurate, up-to-date and reasonable. We determined the  data to be sufficient and reliable for the purposes of this report.", "To determine the extent to which AFRICOM vets contractors and  contractor employees we reviewed DOD and military department  contracting, anti-terrorism, and physical security guidance and compared  it to information gathered from AFRICOM J2X (counterintelligence) and  three forward operating sites concerning their vendor vetting and  contractor employee screening processes. In addition, we observed  contractor screening and base access procedures at the forward  operating sites in Djibouti, Niger, and Uganda. We selected these  locations based on variations in the military services represented, the  types of contractors (U.S., third country, and local national), and the types  of contract services provided. The information gathered from these three  sites, while not generalizable to all AFRICOM sites, provides valuable  insights about personnel accountability, contractor vetting, and contractor  employee screening processes in the AFRICOM area of responsibility."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Department of the Air Force", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Department of the Army", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Department of the Navy", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Department of State", "paragraphs": ["Office of Acquisitions Management, Washington, D.C.", "Office of Logistics Management, Washington, D.C.", "Bureau of African Affairs, Washington, D.C.", "Bureau of Diplomatic Security, Washington, D.C.", "U.S. Embassy, Djibouti, Djibouti", "U.S. Embassy, Niamey, Niger", "U.S. Embassy, Kampala, Uganda  We conducted this performance audit from June 2014 to December 2015  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
