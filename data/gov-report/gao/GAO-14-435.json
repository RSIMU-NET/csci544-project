The participants meet in six working groups, four task forces, and various expert groups to produce such documents as scientific assessments and guidance. For example, the Council has produced assessments of Arctic climate change impacts and shipping. As Arctic issues have emerged, the Council has expanded and broadened its work to address them. For example, since the Council's was established in 1996, the number of ongoing projects has increased from about 30 to 80.", "Six key federal agencies hold leadership roles in the Arctic Council and other agencies participate through the Council's working groups and task forces.

In collaborating on Council work, the agencies face challenges by not having a clear direction or specific resources for their work. For example, key agency officials said that the agencies do not have a strategy that guides and aligns their Council work. Without a clear direction or specific resources for the collaborative effort, the agencies face challenges prioritizing the work, delivering unified messages to other Arctic States, and consistently participating in the Council. GAO previously reported that agencies can enhance and sustain collaborative efforts by engaging in various practices, such as establishing joint strategies and identifying necessary resources.", "Federal agencies have acted on some voluntary recommendations that the United States and other Arctic States have adopted through the Council. However, State does not review or track progress made on these actions and faces challenges implementing the voluntary recommendations. Specifically, State informally discusses the recommendations with other agencies during monthly meetings but does not have a process to review and track progress the agencies have made toward implementing them. State officials said that the agency may need to more formally assess such progress because, without such a process, State does not know the status of recommendation implementation and faces challenges planning for and prioritizing future actions to address Arctic issues. In addition, the United States\u2014with State as the lead agency\u2014and other Arctic States face challenges implementing the Council's broad and numerous recommendations. To address these challenges, State officials said that the Council needs to more clearly specify and prioritize recommendations, but the Council does not have guidelines for doing so.

In particular, agency officials said federal  funding and staff time for Council activities come from general program  budgets, which creates challenges when Council work must compete with  other agency priorities for funding. For example, NOAA officials said their  agency focuses mainly on domestic issues, which limits funding for  international activities such as Council work even though this work relates  to NOAA\u2019s mission. State officials also said the United States does not  have specific funding for Council work because it had not formerly  prioritized Council participation.

First, Alaska officials said the  state\u2019s Arctic priorities sometimes differ from those of the federal  agencies, making it challenging for the state to have its perspectives  incorporated into agencies\u2019 Council work. For example, Alaska officials  said they tried to have their interests reflected in a report by the Council\u2019s  Ecosystem Based Management expert group, but could not do so  because the U.S. delegation working on the report had different priorities  than the state of Alaska. Second, state of Alaska officials said State does  not provide enough information on the process used to make policy  decisions regarding the Council. Without this information, Alaska state  officials said it is difficult to know which federal agency they should  contact to provide their input and when to do so. In particular, Alaska  officials said that federal agencies leading U.S. participation in Council  working groups have a considerable amount of autonomy to direct  participation and ability to affect project outcomes, which may not align   Third, Alaska officials said the state had limited  with Alaska\u2019s priorities.resources to engage with the federal agencies and participate in Council  projects. Because of limited information on the process used for federal  decision making regarding the Council and resources for Alaska\u2019s  participation, Alaska state officials said they could not participate as fully  as desired to ensure that the Council addresses their interests. Overall,  an Alaska state official said that increasing collaboration between the  state and federal government would help address some of these  challenges.", "With respect to incorporating the perspectives of Alaska Natives, some  federal agency officials leading U.S. participation in the Council said they  consider Alaska Natives\u2019 interests through engagement with the four  Permanent Participant groups that represent Alaska Natives. For  example, State officials said they primarily consult with Permanent  Participant representatives prior to SAO meetings on an as-needed basis  to discuss items on upcoming meeting agendas. Officials from other  agencies said they work with the Permanent Participant representatives  during Council meetings.

To help address these issues, State provides annual travel funding to the four Alaska-based Permanent Participant groups. Without State funding, the groups would have a more difficult time  maintaining their Council participation, according to a Permanent  Participant representative.

Findings from our report based on stakeholder perspectives are not  generalizable.", "In addition, to identify how the Council is organized and addresses  environmental and economic development issues, we attended a Council  Senior Arctic Officials meeting in Stockholm, Sweden, in March 2013, and  we analyzed Council documents, academic publications, and the  Council\u2019s website. We also reviewed Arctic State publications, peer- reviewed academic literature, and nongovernmental organization reports  published from 2008 to 2013. We determined these sources were  sufficiently sound for our purpose. Furthermore, we focused on Arctic  environmental and economic issues because the Council\u2019s mission  outlines these as issues to address. We did not assess the effectiveness  of the Council.", "In addition to conducting interviews with key U.S. federal agency officials  to determine how they participate in the Council and identify any  associated challenges, we reviewed relevant agency and Council  documents. We also conducted site visits to the Arctic Alaskan  communities of Barrow, Kivalina, Kotzebue, and Wainwright. We met with  community leaders to learn their perspectives on environmental and  economic issues facing their community and how, if at all, key federal  agencies considered their interests in their Council work. We selected  these four communities based on the following factors: (1) stakeholder  referrals, (2) location above the Arctic Circle, (3) representation of a range  of community sizes and perspectives, and (4) accessibility in order to  accommodate GAO\u2019s allotted staff and financial resources. Findings from  these site visits cannot be generalized to those we did not include in our  nonprobability sample. In addition to these four locations, we visited  Anchorage, Alaska, where we interviewed knowledgeable Alaska state  officials, key Arctic stakeholders, and two Permanent Participant group  representatives to help inform our objectives.", "Finally, to identify and assess the actions that State and other federal  agencies take to implement and manage voluntary recommendations the  United States has adopted through the Council, we first analyzed Council  ministerial declarations from 1998 to 2013 to develop a list of statements  that directed actions to Arctic States. To create the list, two analysts  independently identified these statements, compared results, and  resolved any differences. We then asked State officials to review our list  and identify which statements they viewed as Council recommendations  to Arctic States. We also analyzed Council reports endorsed in the  recommendations and the two multilateral agreements negotiated through  the Council. Finally, we selected examples of actions agencies took to  implement Council recommendations and multilateral agreements.", "This report will contribute to a multilateral audit of the Council led by the  Supreme Audit Institutions of Norway and Russia, also with participation  by Denmark, and Sweden.Finland, and Iceland observed the multilateral audit.", "The Supreme Audit Institutions of Canada,  We conducted this performance audit from November 2012 to May 2014  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
