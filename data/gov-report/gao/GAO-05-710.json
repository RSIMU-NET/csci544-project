For example, section 609(e) of the amended FCRA gives identity theft victims the right to obtain records of fraudulent business transactions, and section 609(d) requires the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to develop a model summary of identity theft victims' rights. This report provides information on (1) outreach efforts to inform consumers, businesses, and law enforcement entities about section 609(e); (2) the views of relevant groups on the provision's expected impact; and (3) FTC's process for developing its model summary of rights and views on the summary's potential usefulness."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Some efforts to educate consumers, business entities, and local law enforcement officials about their rights and obligations under section 609(e), which grants identity theft victims access to fraudulent business transaction records, were under way as of June 2005--notably by the FTC, U.S. Postal Inspection Service, International Association of Chiefs of Police, and National Credit Union Administration. For example, FTC had a number of outreach efforts on section 609(e) including coverage in conferences and presentations as well as information available through its Web site, toll-free hotline, and identity theft publications. While many of the other federal regulators and law enforcement agencies have undertaken outreach efforts on identity theft, most did not specifically include information on section 609(e). FTC staff indicated that the public education campaign on identity theft prevention mandated to be implemented by December 2005 by the FACT Act will also include coverage of section 609(e). According to FTC, law enforcement agency officials, and consumer advocacy group representatives we spoke with, section 609(e) should help victims to remedy the effects of identity theft more quickly. Other cited benefits include allowing victims to build stronger cases that could assist law enforcement agencies in developing intelligence data for their investigations. However, due to the limited experience with victims attempting to obtain business records, it is too early to assess the actual effectiveness of the section 609(e) provisions. Consumer groups and state agencies identified some potential problems with the timeliness of business transaction data and the extent of documents needed to verify a victim's identity theft claim. Given the newness of the provision, additional experience is needed to verify the validity of these potential concerns or other concerns not yet anticipated. FTC staff told us that as part of their overall FACT Act outreach efforts, they intend to monitor the implementation of section 609(e) to determine whether the provision is working as intended. Most of the agencies and groups we spoke with had favorable views of FTC's process to develop the model summary of identity theft victim rights mandated under section 609(d). FTC published its final form of the summary on November 30, 2004, and as required by FTC's guidance, the three national credit reporting agencies told us they began distributing a summary to consumers who contacted them with identity theft concerns before January 31, 2005. While most of the groups that we contacted felt that FTC had been responsive to their comments, consumer advocacy groups identified two potential concerns. These potential concerns center on the limited availability of a Spanish version of the summary of rights and the clarity of the model summary of rights to the general population. However, due to the limited time that the summary has been available, it is too early to determine the extent of any implementation issues."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Recent thefts of customer information from several large commercial  databases have reinforced widespread concerns about identity theft. The  Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has reported that identity theft  represented about 40 percent of all the consumer fraud complaints it  received during each of the last 3 calendar years. Identity theft generally  involves the fraudulent use of another person\u2019s identifying information\u2014 such as a Social Security number, date of birth, or mother\u2019s maiden name\u2014 to establish credit, run up debt, or take over existing financial accounts.  According to identity theft experts, individuals whose identities have been  stolen can spend months or years and thousands of dollars clearing their  names. Some individuals have lost job opportunities, been refused loans, or  even been arrested for crimes they did not commit as a result of identity  theft.", "To help address the difficulties victims often encounter in trying to recover  from identity theft, Congress added various provisions to the Fair and  Accurate Credit Transactions (FACT) Act of 2003. In particular,  recognizing that the amount of damage done to an individual\u2019s name,  financial or otherwise, can be mitigated by how quickly the identity theft is  discovered and addressed, Congress included a provision to help victims  obtain records of alleged fraudulent business transactions. This  provision\u2014section 609(e) of the amended Fair Credit Reporting Act  (FCRA)\u2014established the right of identity theft victims to obtain, within 30  days, copies of business records involved in transactions alleged to be the  result of identity theft. Further, the FACT Act requires that FTC develop a  model summary of rights to be distributed to consumers who believe that  they are victims of identity theft\u2014including the right to obtain information  available to them under section 609(e). Additionally, the act requires FTC  to establish and implement a public media and distribution campaign on  identity theft prevention by December 2005.", "The FACT Act also required GAO to evaluate the effectiveness of section  609(e) and issue a report to Congress by June 2005. Because of the short  period of time that had elapsed since the June 2004 effective date of the  provision, we informed the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and  Urban Affairs and the House Committee on Financial Services that we  would be unable to assess the effectiveness of the provision. Consequently,  to satisfy the mandate, we agreed with the two committees that this report  would (1) provide information on outreach efforts to consumers,  businesses, and local law enforcement agencies on the provision; (2)  describe the views and opinions of relevant federal agencies, private  business entities, and consumer groups on the expected impact of the  provision; and (3) discuss the process that FTC used to develop the model  summary of rights mandated by the FACT Act and the opinions of groups  that commented on the model summary.", "To address these objectives, we obtained and analyzed information and  interviewed officials from groups that have a role in implementing section  609(e) and the FACT Act. Specifically, we contacted and obtained  information from representatives of FTC and five federal law enforcement  agencies, met with officials from the five federal banking regulators,  attempted to contact six organizations or individuals representing business  entities, held meetings with the three national credit reporting agencies  (CRAs), and met with five consumer advocacy groups identified as being  active on identity theft issues. We reviewed literature used in outreach  efforts, FTC\u2019s model summary of identity theft victim rights and public  comments on it, Web site information, and state identity theft laws similar  to the FACT Act. Appendix I contains a more complete description of our  scope and methodology. We conducted our work in Washington, D.C., and  San Francisco from September 2004 through June 2005 in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act of 1998 made identity  theft a federal crime. Although FTC does not have the authority to bring  criminal cases, the act established FTC as the federal clearinghouse for  identity theft complaints. FTC is required to keep a log of such complaints  and to notify consumers that their complaints have been received. In  response to this requirement, in November 1999 FTC established the  Identity Theft Data Clearinghouse to gather information from consumers  who file complaints or inquire about identity theft. FTC inputs this  information into its Consumer Sentinel database, which is used by more  than 1,000 law enforcement agencies. According to FTC, the number of  identity theft complaints it has received has steadily risen each year\u2014 climbing from 31,000 in 2000 to 247,000 in 2004. FTC staff noted that the  increase in reported instances of identity theft may in part reflect enhanced  consumer awareness and willingness to report such crimes. However, not  all identity theft victims contact FTC.", "No single federal law enforcement agency has primary jurisdiction over  identity theft crimes. Identity theft is not typically a stand-alone crime but  rather a component of one or more crimes such as bank fraud, credit card  fraud, social program fraud, tax refund fraud, and mail fraud. For example,  a fraudster might steal another individual\u2019s personal identifying  information in one city and use the information to commit credit card fraud  and mail fraud in another city or state. Consequently, a number of federal  law enforcement agencies can have a role in investigating identity theft  crimes, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Internal  Revenue Service, U.S. Postal Inspection Service, U.S. Secret Service, and  the Social Security Administration\u2019s Office of the Inspector General. The  Department of Justice (DOJ) prosecutes federal identity theft cases.", "The FACT Act of 2003, among other things, strengthened victims\u2019 rights  with respect to identity theft and gave FTC and businesses a larger role in  dealing with identity theft crimes. The act also highlighted the need for law  enforcement agencies to assist victims in documenting their identity theft  crime. Section 609(e) requires business entities to provide victims of  identity theft with information on fraudulent business transactions\u2014for  example, copies of applications for credit or records of purchases. In the  past, businesses have been reluctant to provide such information, fearing  their potential exposure to lawsuits for the inappropriate disclosure of  sensitive personal financial information. To address this concern, Congress  added a provision protecting businesses from civil liability claims for  disclosing such information. In addition, the FACT Act reinforces the need  for police to assist victims in taking official reports. These reports can then  be used to substantiate claims of identity theft when alleged victims  request, for example, copies of business records involving instances of  potential fraud.", "The FACT Act also requires that FTC develop a model summary of rights  for consumers who believe that they are victims of identity theft (see app. II). CRAs are required to provide a substantially similar version of  the model summary of identity theft victim rights to any consumer who  \u201ccontacts a consumer reporting agency and expresses a belief that the  consumer is a victim of fraud or identity theft.\u201d As previously mentioned,  the act mandated that FTC launch a public campaign on how to prevent  identity theft by December 2005, but did not specifically require that  section 609(e) be included in the campaign."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Efforts to Increase Awareness of Section 609(e) Were Under Way as of June 2005", "paragraphs": ["At the time of our review, some efforts to educate consumers, business  entities, and local enforcement officials about their rights and obligations  under section 609(e)\u2014notably efforts undertaken by the FTC, U.S. Postal  Inspection Service, International Association of Chiefs of Police, and  National Credit Union Administration\u2014were under way. We found that  while most of the federal agencies and law enforcement agencies and other  groups that we contacted were engaged in outreach related to identity theft  issues, those efforts generally did not have a component specifically  addressing section 609(e). In particular, FTC staff told us that outreach for  section 609(e) would be part of broader efforts to educate the public,  business entities, and law enforcement officials about identity theft and  FACT Act provisions and that outreach on 609(e) would increase beginning  in December 2005 as part of its public identity theft campaign. As of June  2005, outreach efforts by a variety of interest groups, including businesses  and their trade groups, federal law enforcement agencies, and banking  regulators, were also just beginning. Most of these groups saw FTC as  having primary responsibility for outreach."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FTC\u2019s Outreach Initiatives on the FACT Act Provisions Are Ongoing and Expected to Increase", "paragraphs": ["FTC staff told us that they have undertaken a number of outreach efforts to  educate the public, law enforcement, and others on the FACT Act,  including section 609(e). However, FTC staff explained that section 609(e)  is only one tool in the resources available to victims for remedying the  effects of identity theft and that FTC\u2019s first priority is to make those  affected aware of all of the relevant provisions contained in the FACT Act.  Since 2004, FTC in conjunction with federal law enforcement agencies has  cosponsored six conferences and presentations geared directly to local law  enforcement, which included a discussion on the FACT Act. In addition,  since January 2004 FTC has participated in more than 50 conferences,  seminars, and presentations on the FACT Act involving attorneys, bar  associations, business trade groups, financial institutions and state  regulators. FTC staff told us that these outreach efforts addressed  increasing the awareness of section 609(e) provisions, as appropriate to the  particular audience.", "Other FTC outreach efforts on section 609(e) include links on FTC\u2019s Web  site at www.consumer.gov/idtheft to its model summary of identity theft  victim rights and other information on identity theft, a toll-free hotline  (1-877-IDTHEFT) offering counseling to help consumers who want or need  more information about dealing with the consequences of identity theft,  and FTC\u2019s Consumer Response Center and Distribution Office that  provides publications on identity theft, among other topics. For example,  FTC recently updated its identity theft booklet, renamed Take Charge:  Fighting Back Against Identity Theft, to incorporate the FACT Act  requirements, including section 609(e). Further, FTC has included section  609(e) in the mandated summary of identity theft victim rights that the  CRAs began distributing in January 2005. At the time of our review, this  summary was the primary mechanism for providing consumers with  information on their right to obtain business records on potentially  fraudulent transactions. According to FTC staff, FTC\u2019s Web site on identity  theft included links to section 609(e) as of its effective date of June 1, 2004,  which was subsequently integrated into an updated identity theft Web site.  According to FTC staff, section 609(e) will also be incorporated into the  public education campaign that FTC is required by the FACT Act to  implement by December 2005 which will help increase outreach on the  provisions.", "FTC staff told us that the agency has conducted outreach on privacy,  consumer reporting, identity theft, and related legislation and regulations  for several years and that the initiatives target consumers, businesses, and  law enforcement agencies. FTC conducts its identity theft education  campaign through its Web site, printed publications, conferences and  presentations, syndicated news articles and newscasts, training sessions,  communications with state attorneys general, and visits to high school and  college campuses. It also holds seminars for small businesses that may not  be active with trade groups. Additionally, the agency provides counseling  over the telephone to consumers who contact FTC with complaints or  inquiries about identity theft. FTC staff explained that the agency attempts  to leverage its resources to conduct outreach\u2014that is, it relies on  consumers, law enforcement agencies, and businesses to spread the  relevant information it provides among one another.", "FTC staff stated that the mandated public education campaign would build  upon and become a component of FTC\u2019s ongoing consumer and business  education campaigns. FTC staff stated that the mandated campaign will be  under way by the December 2005 deadline and will include coverage of  section 609(e). The staff told us that in terms of its identity theft outreach  to consumers, FTC\u2019s priority is for consumers to know that FTC is the  organization that consumers should contact if they need information or  assistance with identity theft problems. They added that requesting  business transaction records under section 609(e) is not the first step an  identity theft victim takes to restore his or her credit. According to FTC  staff, the campaign will focus on all aspects of identity theft prevention and  remediation as well as informing consumers, businesses, and law  enforcement agencies about the new rights and responsibilities discussed  in section 609(e) and other provisions that are useful to consumers. At the  time of our review, FTC could not provide us with information on the exact  extent of coverage that section 609(e) would receive in FTC\u2019s outreach  materials to consumers and businesses. FTC did provide us with a copy of  its identity theft public education solicitation dated June 1, 2005. According  to the solicitation, one of the expected targets of the campaign are identity  theft victims with the goal of assisting those victims in the recovery process  by teaching them the steps to take to reclaim their good names.", "FTC plans to evaluate the effectiveness of the public outreach campaign  using various means. According to the solicitation, the program plan for the  public education campaign is expected to include strategies for monitoring  and evaluation of program results. FTC staff also told us that they also  intend to monitor and evaluate the results of this contract through traffic to  the identity theft Web site, publications distribution, and identity theft  complaints to the FTC."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Identity Theft Outreach Efforts by Others Are Also Under Way, but Few Specifically Address Section 609(e)", "paragraphs": ["We found that a variety of outreach efforts on identity theft were under way  or were being planned by businesses, trade groups, law enforcement  agencies, federal banking regulators, and consumer groups. We were able  to obtain only limited information on efforts undertaken by businesses and  their trade groups and associations. A few business trade group  representatives told us that they had been active in reaching out to their  constituents on identity theft issues through presentations and newsletters.  These representatives told us that it was likely that the level of awareness  among midsize and large business entities regarding the FACT Act and  section 609(e) was greater than among small businesses, because larger  businesses were more likely to belong to trade groups and associations and  to have more internal legal resources. The representatives also told us that  at the time of our review business entities and their trade groups were  focused on other issues likely to have a more direct impact on their  operations than section 609(e), such as working with Congress on  bankruptcy legislation, which was ultimately passed and became law on  April 20, 2005.", "Most of the federal law enforcement officials that we contacted had general  identity theft outreach efforts under way that included some form of  outreach on the FACT Act, although few specifically included information  that addressed section 609(e). Rather, most of these groups focused on  general identity theft prevention rather than on the section 609(e)  provisions. Officials from one federal law enforcement agency indicated  that their identity theft outreach efforts that include FACT Act provisions  were in the initial stages of implementation. These efforts are designed to  reach consumers, businesses, and law enforcement entities. For example,  as previously discussed, federal law enforcement agencies such as DOJ,  FBI, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, and the Secret Service have held  joint conferences on identity theft, including a discussion of the FACT Act,  and invited local police to attend. As shown in figure 1, one effort that did  specifically address section 609(e) and was directed to law enforcement  agencies was an advertisement developed by the U.S. Postal Inspection  Service that prominently noted the new tools for law enforcement and new  rights of victims under the FACT Act, including section 609(e).", "The International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) has also  specifically addressed section 609(e) in the information that it has  disseminated on identity theft. An IACP official told us that a lack of  awareness among local police departments of the new provision could  make it problematic for some identity theft victims to get local police  departments to take a police report. The IACP official also emphasized the  importance of ensuring that police were aware of the FACT Act and of their  responsibility to take reports to validate an identity theft claim. The official  added that local police were likely to become increasingly involved in  identity theft crimes because these officers are committed to being  responsive to the citizens within their communities. To address the  perceived lack of awareness among local police, the IACP featured articles  on identity theft and the FACT Act, including section 609(e), in its January  through April 2005 editions of Police Chief magazine. The IACP official  also stated that the association was in the process of finalizing a national  report on identity theft that would be released in print, on the Internet, and  on a CD, and would be featured at conferences. The report will discuss  policies and recommended procedures under current laws and describe the  responsibilities, including the FACT Act requirements, of law enforcement.", "While all of the federal banking regulators provided general identity theft  outreach, only the National Credit Union Administration specifically  addressed the section 609(e) provision in its identity theft outreach efforts.  Each of the regulator\u2019s general identity theft outreach included conducting  presentations, posting related information on their Web site, and publishing  identity theft literature or brochures. For example, the Federal Deposit  Insurance Corporation (FDIC) published materials such as Consumer  News, which featured articles on identity theft but did not address the  provisions of section 609(e). The only regulator that we identified as  having specifically addressed section 609(e) was the National Credit Union  Administration which issued a Regulatory Alert in January 2005 informing  credit unions about the FACT Act\u2019s provisions including section 609(e).  Some officials noted that the Federal Financial Institutions Examination  Council (FFIEC) had recently formed an interagency task force, to among  other things, address how federal banking regulators could ensure that  regulated institutions were in compliance with the new requirements.  These officials added that their agencies had not yet established any  outreach efforts specific to section 609(e) because they were waiting for  the results of the recently formed FFIEC task force, in order to avoid  duplicating the task force\u2019s efforts.", "Some consumer groups we contacted maintained FACT Act information on  their Web sites and educated identity theft victims who contacted them in  some instances by providing telephone counseling and printed  publications. Officials from one consumer group acknowledged FTC\u2019s  mandated campaign as a key outreach tool and suggested that the  campaign should also include initiatives directed to businesses. These  officials explained that it was important that business entities understand  their obligations and roles under section 609(e). Specifically, the officials  stated that these initiatives should involve business groups such as the  Better Business Bureau, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National  Retail Federation, state retailer associations, and TRUSTe\u00ae. FTC staff told  us that they often use associations in their outreach as an effective method  to help spread information. The limited anecdotal information that FTC had  on victims who attempted to obtain business transaction records related to  identity theft suggested that not all businesses were aware of their  obligations under section 609(e). According to FTC staff, a few identity  theft victims had contacted FTC and reported that they were unable to  obtain business transaction records related to the theft of their identity.  According to FTC, these instances were caused primarily by businesses\u2019  lack of knowledge about their obligations under the FACT Act. Once FTC  informed these business entities about their obligations, the victims were  able to obtain the necessary transaction records.", "Most agencies and groups that we spoke with had done some general  identity theft outreach and had planned or already had under way a few  efforts that focused on section 609(e), but viewed FTC as having the  primary responsibility for providing outreach on the FACT Act, including  section 609(e). FTC staff told us that they intend to evaluate the  effectiveness of FTC\u2019s mandated identity theft campaign, which will  include the 609(e) provisions, but emphasized that FTC\u2019s first priority is  outreach to consumers, businesses, and law enforcement on the FACT Act,  an effort that would occur over time.

Noting that victims of identity theft often have difficulty  getting local police to take a report to help substantiate an identity theft  crime, consumer advocacy groups also told us that they believed that the  new provision should make filing these reports easier.

Representatives from federal law enforcement agencies and  IACP said that it was too early to determine whether victims were finding it  easier to get local police to take identity theft reports and that local law  enforcement agencies might not yet be fully aware of the requirements of  this provision. But representatives of federal law enforcement agencies and  consumer advocacy groups said that the new provision should help  empower victims of identity theft by giving these victims access to data on  fraudulent business transactions that could help resolve the crimes. The  officials explained that before Congress created section 609(e), victims had  generally been unable to obtain data on fraudulent business transactions  because businesses feared being held liable for providing the information.  To address this concern, Congress established limitations in the FACT Act  provision so that businesses could not be held liable for disclosing such  information to victims. Representatives of businesses we spoke to said  that addressing the liability issue in the law had removed the barrier to  providing information on allegedly fraudulent transactions to victims of  identity theft. One consumer group told us that having records of  fraudulent business transactions, such as copies of checks or signed  applications for credit, would allow victims to prove that someone else was  responsible\u2014for instance, by comparing signatures. Without these records,  victims may have no way of proving that the transactions were fraudulent  and could be forced to pay the bills themselves.", "Officials from law enforcement agencies told us that as an added benefit,  victims would be able to gather more information on their cases that may  prompt law enforcement agencies into opening an investigation. In turn,  law enforcement officials could use that information to assess the nature  and scope of alleged crimes of identity theft. Additionally, law enforcement  officials anticipated that the information would help investigators build  cases more quickly and identify patterns or trends in identity theft  practices. For instance, the information could help identify the frequency  of certain types of fraud and the locations being targeted, allowing  investigators to better determine whether individual crimes were part of a  larger operation. However, federal and state law enforcement officials  pointed out that having more information might not necessarily lead to an  increase in prosecutions. In fact, one of the states we contacted that had a  similar identity theft law told us that the number of police investigations or  prosecutions of identity theft crimes had not increased since the state law  had been in effect. The officials explained that workloads and other  priorities often determined the types of investigations and prosecutions  law enforcement undertake."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Consumer Advocacy Groups Anticipated That the New Provision Would Make Obtaining a Local Police Report Easier for Victims", "paragraphs": ["Consumer advocacy groups we interviewed noted that in the past, victims  of identity theft sometimes had difficulty getting local police to take reports  about the crimes, although police reports help substantiate victims\u2019 claims.  As we reported in 2002, getting local police to file a police report is a  critical first step in being able to investigate the crime and in undoing the  impacts of identity theft. The consumer advocacy groups noted that the  new provision will increase pressure on local police to take reports  because these reports can play a key role in verifying the identity theft  victim\u2019s right to access information. These groups pointed out that in  California, which has a similar identity theft law already in place, local  police who were aware of their obligations under the state law were more  likely to take identity theft reports. One consumer advocacy group told us  they expect a similar outcome with the FACT Act provision. Additionally,  officials from the two states\u2014California and Washington\u2014that have  enacted similar identity theft laws agreed that since their laws had been in  place, police had generally been more willing to take reports from identity  theft victims. Officials from one of the states told us that law enforcement  agencies there had also been more active in discussing identity theft issues.", "Representatives of a consumer advocacy group and law enforcement  agencies acknowledged that the overall number of police reports charging  identity theft crimes was increasing but noted that it was difficult to  attribute this increase to any one cause, including the FACT Act. For  instance, one consumer advocacy group we spoke with attributed the  increasing willingness of local police to take these reports to the fact that  identity theft was a growing problem and that the public was generally  more aware of it. Officials from law enforcement agencies also pointed out  that the difficulty of filing local police reports was only one of the  frustrations victims of identity theft faced. For example, the amount of time  required to clean up credit and the lack of criminal prosecutions for these  crimes are even more frustrating for victims, and both of the issues remain  unresolved."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some State Agencies and Consumer Groups Had Reservations about Portions of the New Provision", "paragraphs": ["Representatives of state agencies and consumer advocacy groups with  whom we spoke identified two potential concerns about the provision.  First, the provision gives businesses 30 days from the date of a victim\u2019s  request to provide information on fraudulent business transactions\u2014a time  period that some feel is too long. For instance, officials from one state  agency and a consumer advocacy group we spoke to stressed the  importance of providing information quickly so that victims could begin  clearing their credit files and resolving their cases. Several of those we  spoke with recommended 2 weeks as a more reasonable length of time for  victims to gain access to records and pointed out that states such as  California and Washington, which have similar identity theft laws, ask  business entities to respond faster. California\u2019s privacy laws require that  businesses respond within 10 business days of receiving the person\u2019s  request (which must include a copy of the police report and identifying  information). Washington\u2019s identity theft law does not specify a time frame  for responding to requests for records, but state officials stated that  business entities are encouraged to respond within a reasonable amount of  time. State officials from both California and Washington noted that victims  in their respective states had generally been able to obtain data on  fraudulent business transactions within their respective time frames.", "In contrast, business entities we spoke with believed that there could be  complicated situations in which it might be difficult to respond within the  30-day time period. Additionally, representatives from two law  enforcement groups said that the 30-day time period appeared to be  reasonable. They explained that businesses might need the time to review  the request and verify a victim\u2019s identity and added that the 30 days could  reflect the reality of running a business with competing priorities. FTC staff  said that although they did not know how long businesses were taking to  respond to victims, it would be unfortunate if businesses were in fact  taking the full 30 days. While these officials agreed that victims needed to  obtain information promptly in order to resolve their cases, they noted that  the 30-day time period had been established to give businesses additional  time to respond to requests if needed. Because the law affects a wide range  of businesses, the officials told us, it must allow for a wide range of  circumstances.", "Consumer advocacy groups were also concerned with the discretion the  provision gives to businesses to request additional documentation\u2014 beyond a police report\u2014as proof of a victim\u2019s claim of identity theft. Under  the provision, businesses may require victims to provide a copy of a  standardized affidavit of identity theft or an acceptable affidavit of fact as  well as a police report. FTC, in conjunction with credit grantors and  consumer advocates, has developed the Identity Theft Affidavit, a standard  form victims can use to report information on, for example, fraudulent  accounts that have been opened. The affidavit of fact is a business\u2019 own  form used by a victim for documenting alleged identity theft. However,  consumer groups we spoke with said that a police report should be  sufficient evidence to verify an identity theft claim and questioned the  amount of information businesses actually needed. Representatives of  CRAs also pointed out that a broad range of what could be characterized as  identity theft reports existed. These representatives explained that any law  enforcement group, whether civil or criminal, could take an identity theft  report, raising concerns about the consistency of the information being  reported and the possibility that the credit repair industry could misuse it.", "Additionally, officials in California and Washington told us that victims of  identity theft in their states had experienced difficulties trying to obtain  data on fraudulent business transactions immediately after their state laws  were enacted. The officials attributed the initial difficulties to the fact that  businesses were probably not aware of the new statutes. Officials in  California told us that they had developed a template for a letter that  victims could send to businesses. The letter provides information both on  the law and on penalties for noncompliance and had been effective in  getting businesses to comply. Officials in Washington told us that they had  provided education to consumers, businesses, and the law enforcement  community early on.

Federal banking agency officials also  stated that FTC solicited comments on two draft versions.

First, these groups  pointed out that FTC did not require CRAs to make the model summary of  rights available in other languages, primarily Spanish, and that access to  bilingual information was especially important to those persons whose  dominant or sole language is Spanish. According to these groups, the  Census 2000 figures indicate that nearly 19.6 million U.S. citizens between  the ages of 18 and 64 spoke Spanish and that one-third of this group spoke  English \u201cnot well\u201d or \u201cnot at all.\u201d FTC staff told us that while the CRAs were  not required to provide a copy of the summary in other languages, the final  summary did contain a Spanish statement telling consumers to contact the  FTC for information in Spanish and giving both the agency\u2019s mailing and  Web site addresses.

Finally, FTC staff told us that FTC  targets certain populations in its ongoing public outreach efforts and  expects to continue to do so in the context of its mandated public  campaign on identity theft prevention.", "The three nationwide CRAs we contacted provided us with copies of their  summaries of rights for identity theft victims that the agencies had begun  distributing to consumers in January 2005. Only one of the agencies had  made a summary of rights available in Spanish; the other two had placed a  Spanish statement similar to FTC\u2019s on their summaries directing consumers  to FTC for information in Spanish. Officials from the CRAs told us that they  distributed the model summary of rights to consumers who notified them  of potential identity theft and not, in general, to every consumer who  contacted them.", "Second, consumer advocacy groups were concerned that the model  summary would not be easy to read and understand. A comment letter to  the FTC from nine consumer advocacy groups said that the model  summary of rights should be tested for readability before it was finalized to  ensure that it could be easily understood by all consumers, including those  with limited education and those who did not speak English as their  primary language. The letter stated that having a readable summary was  vital to ensuring that consumers were aware of their rights with respect to  identity theft, especially those consumers who might not be familiar with  the financial services world. One consumer group we spoke with also  stressed that readability, which includes the organization of the document  and format, was important for any public message. In response to the  comments the agency received, FTC\u2019s final rule stated that the agency had  tried as far as possible to use plain language in the summary and agreed  that the notices needed to be supplemented by outreach efforts, which the  agency said it intended to undertake. FTC staff also told us that while they  did not have the document reviewed by a private readability expert, they  did have the document reviewed internally for presentation and clarity by  FTC\u2019s Office of Consumer and Business Education.", "In our review of FTC\u2019s draft and final summary of identity theft rights, we  found that overall FTC\u2019s final summary was more concise and used shorter  sentences than its draft summary.

However, because section 609(e) has been in effect only a short time  (since June 2004), it is too soon to assess the effectiveness of the provision.  Because efforts to alert consumers, business entities, and local law  enforcement agencies on their rights and responsibilities under section  609(e) were in their early stages, it is also too soon to determine the extent  of the awareness and use of section 609(e) by these groups. The FACT Act  mandates that FTC conduct outreach on identity theft prevention, and most  of the groups we contacted felt that FTC should have primary responsibility  on identity theft issues. FTC is in a unique position because it already has  an existing dialogue with the critical groups involved in section 609(e)  through its ongoing outreach efforts on identity theft issues, its interaction  with consumers who use its identity theft hotline and consumer complaint  database, and its mandated campaign on identity theft prevention. In  contrast, no other agency or group maintains public outreach efforts that  are as far reaching as the FTC\u2019s. FTC intends to assess the effectiveness of  its mandated identity theft campaign which will include coverage of section  609(e). Such an assessment would be useful as a means of determining the  extent that consumers, businesses, and local law enforcement agencies are  aware of their rights and obligations under section 609(e), the extent of any  implementation issues, and whether the new provision is helping  consumers as intended to remedy the effects of identity theft.", "Similarly, experience with victims who have attempted to obtain business  records is limited by the short period of time that has elapsed since the act  went into effect. It is too early to assess the actual impact of section 609(e)  on consumers\u2019 ability to get business records relating to suspected  fraudulent transactions. While consumer groups and state agencies  identified some potential problems with the provision, additional  experience and input from identity theft victims will be needed to  determine whether these concerns prove to be valid and what, if any, other  issues may arise.", "While FTC\u2019s process for developing its mandated model summary of  identity theft victim rights was viewed favorably and CRAs had begun  distributing a similar version of the summary to consumers, some potential  concerns with the summary of rights were noted. These potential concerns  center primarily on the limited availability of a Spanish version of the  summary of rights and, to a lesser extent, on the clarity of the summary of  rights to the general population.

You have the right to ask that nationwide consumer reporting  agencies place \u201cfraud alerts\u201d in your file to let potential creditors  and others know that you may be a victim of identity theft. A fraud alert  can make it more difficult for someone to get credit in your name  because it tells creditors to follow certain procedures to protect you.

An extended alert  stays in your file for seven years. To place either of these alerts, a consumer  reporting agency will require you to provide appropriate proof of your  identity, which may include your Social Security number. If you ask for an  extended alert, you will have to provide an identity theft report. An  identity theft report includes a copy of a report you have filed with a  federal, state, or local law enforcement agency, and additional information  a consumer reporting agency may require you to submit. For more detailed  information about the identity theft report, visit  www.consumer.gov/idtheft. 2. You have the right to free copies of the information in your file  (your \u201cfile disclosure\u201d). An initial fraud alert entitles you to a copy  of all the information in your file at each of the three nationwide  agencies, and an extended alert entitles you to two free file disclosures  in a 12-month period following the placing of the alert. These additional  disclosures may help you detect signs of fraud, for example, whether  fraudulent accounts have been opened in your name or whether  someone has reported a change in your address. Once a year, you also  have the right to a free copy of the information in your file at any  consumer reporting agency, if you believe it has inaccurate information  due to fraud, such as identity theft. You also have the ability to obtain  additional free file disclosures under other provisions of the FCRA. See  www.ftc.gov/credit. 3.

A creditor or other business must give you copies of  applications and other business records relating to transactions and  accounts that resulted from the theft of your identity, if you ask for  them in writing. A business may ask you for proof of your identity, a  police report, and an affidavit before giving you the documents. It also  may specify an address for you to send your request.

If the  agency declines or rescinds the block, it must notify you. Once a debt  resulting from identity theft has been blocked, a person or business  with notice of the block may not sell, transfer, or place the debt for  collection. 6.
