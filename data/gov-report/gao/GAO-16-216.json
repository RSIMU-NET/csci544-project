Although there have been convictions for  multimillion dollar schemes that defrauded federal health care programs,  the extent of the problem is unknown as there are no reliable estimates of  the magnitude of fraud within these programs or across the health care  industry generally. According to the Department of Health and Human  Services\u2019 (HHS) Office of Inspector General (OIG), there are several  types of health care fraud schemes, including those in which providers bill  for services or supplies not provided or not medically necessary, and  those in which providers\u2019 or beneficiaries\u2019 identities are stolen. However,  little is known about which schemes are the most common or most costly.", "To help reduce fraud and abuse in federal health care programs,  including Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance  Program (CHIP), HHS OIG, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid  Services (CMS)\u2014an agency within HHS\u2014and the Department of Justice  (DOJ) were provided $571.7 million in budgetary resources for fiscal year  2014 to identify, investigate, and prosecute health care fraud. During  fiscal year 2014, about $3.3 billion in health care fraud judgments and  settlements were collected (including from cases that occurred before  fiscal year 2014) as a result of the HHS OIG\u2019s and DOJ\u2019s investigations  and prosecutions.", "Many different types of providers and suppliers are the subjects of fraud  cases. In 2012, we examined the types of providers and suppliers  involved in criminal and civil health care fraud cases and found that for  cases resolved in 2010, medical facilities and durable medical equipment  (DME) suppliers were the most common provider or supplier types that  were subjects of criminal fraud investigations and in which subjects were  found or pled guilty. Hospitals and medical facilities were the most  common subjects of civil fraud investigations and the cases that resulted  in judgments or settlements.", "In some fraud cases, the subjects of the case are able to bill federal  health care programs or private health insurance for payment by stealing  a beneficiary\u2019s or provider\u2019s identification information and using it without  the beneficiary\u2019s or provider\u2019s knowledge. Proposals have been put  forward to reduce the ability of individuals to commit this type of fraud.  Proponents of one proposal\u2014to use electronically readable card  technology, such as smart cards that use microprocessor chips to store  and process data\u2014say that using these cards would bring a number of  benefits, including reducing fraud. In a March 2015 report, we examined  the benefits and limitations associated with the use of electronically  readable cards in Medicare. We reported that the use of electronically  readable cards to verify that the beneficiary and provider were present at  the point of care could curtail certain types of fraud (such as when  providers misuse beneficiary identification information to bill fraudulently)  but would have a limited effect on other types of fraud. Because little is  known about the prevalence of even the most common types of fraud, it is  difficult to assess the extent to which smart card technology would affect  fraud.", "You asked us to identify and categorize schemes found in health care  fraud cases. In this report we describe  1.  health care fraud schemes and their prevalence among cases  2.  the extent to which health care fraud schemes could have been  affected by the use of smart card technology.", "To describe health care fraud schemes and their prevalence among  cases resolved in 2010, we reviewed government reports (such as  reports produced by HHS and DOJ regarding the Health Care Fraud and  Abuse Control Program), and DOJ and HHS OIG press releases to  develop a list of definitions for schemes related to health care fraud. To  determine the prevalence of health care fraud schemes, we reviewed  court documents for fraud cases resolved in 2010 that were obtained  during our work for our 2012 report on the types of providers involved in  health care fraud. Although the cases obtained for our 2012 report  included investigations as well as prosecutions, judgments, and  settlements, for this study, we included only cases that had been  adjudicated favorably for the United States. The cases we obtained  involved both federal health care programs and private health insurance.  In total, we reviewed court documents for 739 cases from HHS OIG and  DOJ to determine the prevalence of health care fraud schemes by type.  These documents were associated with the charging stage of the case  (such as an indictment, information, or complaint) unless the charging  document for a case was not available. If the charging document was not  available, we reviewed case details as described in a DOJ or Federal  Bureau of Investigation (FBI) press release. For several HHS OIG cases,  we were unable to locate a charging document or a press release. For  these cases, HHS OIG provided us with other court documents, such as  settlement agreements and plea agreements. For each case, we also  categorized information on the beneficiary\u2019s role, the provider\u2019s role, the  programs affected by the fraud (such as Medicare, Medicaid, or private  health insurance), and any monetary amounts associated with the fraud  schemes (such as the amount paid). For each case we reviewed, two  reviewers independently categorized the case into the relevant health  care fraud schemes and resolved any differences in the categorization.  To assess the reliability of the data, we reviewed relevant documentation  and examined the data for reasonableness and internal consistency. We  found these data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our report.  (See app. I for additional information about our methodology.)", "To describe the extent to which types of health care fraud schemes could  have been affected by the use of smart card technology, we reviewed  literature on the benefits, uses, technical capabilities, and potential effects  of smart cards, including our March 2015 report on electronically readable  cards, and analyzed data on health care fraud schemes from our review  of court cases resolved in 2010. Our analysis of the potential effect of  smart cards on the cases we reviewed is based on the assumption that  the smart cards would have the capability to correctly identify both the  beneficiary and provider at the point of care (e.g., physician office or  hospital). We did not assume any other changes in information  technology that some smart card advocates have suggested could  accompany the adoption of smart cards in some circumstances. For this  analysis, we first identified schemes that could be affected by the smart  cards based on the nature of the scheme and the beneficiary and  provider roles. We then determined the number and percentage of  cases with these particular schemes. For purposes of our analysis, we  defined the term \u201caffected\u201d to mean that the use of smart cards to verify  the beneficiary and provider identities could have potentially reduced the  risk of fraud. We determined whether the smart cards could affect the  entire case (if the scheme was the only one used or was used in  conjunction only with other schemes that could have been affected by  smart cards) or part of the case (if the schemes were used in combination  with other schemes that would not have been affected by smart cards). In  some cases, we were unable to determine if smart cards would have had  an effect because there was insufficient information.", "Our analysis has several limitations. First, it is based on cases we  received from DOJ and HHS OIG that had been resolved in 2010.  Although the cases were resolved in 2010, the fraud schemes and  investigations could have occurred in prior years. The types of fraud  schemes used during those years may be different from the schemes  prevalent now, as schemes can be influenced by various factors, such as  changes to payment policies and program integrity efforts in Medicare  and Medicaid. To mitigate this limitation, we discussed the schemes  identified and our analysis with officials from HHS OIG and DOJ, who  confirmed that while there may be geographic or provider type differences  in fraud cases, the schemes we identified are still relevant today because  they are similar to the common fraud schemes that have been used since  2010. A second limitation of our analysis is that we generally reviewed  charging documents, which represent allegations of fraudulent conduct  and may or may not have been the basis on which the case was  adjudicated or settled. We chose to use charging documents (when  available) as these documents generally tend to provide a more complete  description of all of the alleged fraud schemes compared to schemes that  were adjudicated. Third, the cases we reviewed were prosecuted and  resulted in a favorable outcome. These cases represent a fraction of the  potential fraud cases that could have occurred or that were identified by  DOJ and HHS OIG for possible investigation and prosecution. As a  result, our findings are not generalizable to all fraud cases. Fourth, our  analysis of the potential effects of smart cards assumed a particular set of  smart card characteristics\u2014specifically, that the identity of both providers  and beneficiaries would be verified\u2014and our findings could be different if  we had made different assumptions about the capabilities or  implementation of smart cards. We believe our assumptions are  reasonable given the challenges associated with implementing smart card  technology.", "We conducted this performance audit from December 2014 to January  2016 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

Other  fraud schemes include providing compensation\u2014kickbacks\u2014to  beneficiaries or providers or others for participating in the fraud scheme  and schemes involving prescription drugs (including prescription drugs  that contain controlled substances), such as the submission of false  claims for prescription drugs that have been improperly marketed for non- FDA-approved uses and the illicit diversion of prescription drugs for profit  or abuse. Fraud cases may involve more than one scheme; for  example, an infusion clinic may pay kickbacks to a beneficiary for  receiving care at the clinic, and the care that was provided and billed for  may not have been medically necessary.", "Providers may be complicit in the schemes or unaware of the schemes.  For example, providers who are complicit may willingly use their provider  identification information to bill fraudulently, misrepresent services  provided to receive higher payment, or receive kickbacks to provide their  identification information for others to bill fraudulently. In other cases,  providers may be unaware that their identification information has been  stolen and used in various fraud schemes. Similarly, beneficiaries can be  either complicit in or unaware of the fraud. Beneficiaries who are complicit  may willingly provide their identification information to a provider for the  purposes of committing fraud or receive kickbacks in exchange for  providing their information to or receiving services from a provider. In  contrast, they also may be unaware of fraud schemes in which the  provider bills for services not medically necessary or uses beneficiaries\u2019  identification information without their knowledge. Additionally, both  beneficiaries and some providers may not be involved in the fraud  scheme, in the sense that the fraud schemes involved circumstances  other than a provider giving care to a beneficiary. For example, a  pharmaceutical manufacturing company that marketed prescription drugs  for non-FDA approved uses does not involve a provider giving care  directly to a beneficiary.

Some proposals have suggested that such cards  should be issued to providers as well. Electronically readable cards  include those that store information on magnetic stripes and bar codes  and cards called smart cards that use microprocessor chips to store and  process data. In March 2015, we identified three key uses for  electronically readable cards: (1) authenticating beneficiary and provider  presence at the point of care, (2) electronically exchanging beneficiary  medical information, and (3) electronically conveying beneficiary identity  and insurance information to providers. We also found that smart cards  could provide more rigorous authentication of beneficiaries and providers  at the point of care than cards with magnetic stripes and bar codes,  though all three types of cards can electronically convey identity and  insurance information. Proponents of smart cards have suggested that,  among other benefits, using smart cards may reduce health care fraud in  the Medicare program. For example, some proponents claim that the use  of smart cards to identify the beneficiary and provider at the point of care  could potentially curtail certain types of fraud such as schemes in which  providers misuse another provider\u2019s information to bill fraudulently.", "However, our March 2015 report also found that there are several  limitations associated with the use of smart cards. Specifically, it is  possible that individuals may still be able to commit fraud by adapting and  altering the schemes they use to account for the use of smart card  technology. In addition, the use of smart card technology could introduce  new types of fraud and ways for individuals to illegally access beneficiary  information. For example, malicious software could be written onto a  smart card and used to compromise provider IT systems. Further, various  factors may limit the implementation of smart card technology in the  Medicare program. As we found in our March 2015 report, while the use  of smart cards to verify the beneficiary identity at the point of care could  reduce certain types of fraud, it would have limited effect on Medicare  fraud since CMS policy is to pay claims for Medicare beneficiaries even if  they do not have a Medicare identification card at the time of care. CMS  officials noted that it would not be feasible to require the use of smart  cards because of concerns that this would limit beneficiaries\u2019 access to  care given that there may be legitimate reasons why a card might not be  present at the point of care. For example, beneficiaries who experience a  health care emergency may not have their Medicare cards with them at  the time care is rendered. Additionally, we concluded that the use of  smart cards to verify the beneficiary and provider presence at the point of  care would require addressing costs and implementation challenges  associated with card management and information technology system  enhancements. These enhancements would be needed to update both  CMS\u2019s and providers\u2019 claims processing and card management systems  in order to achieve a high level of provider and beneficiary authentication  as well as meet security requirements."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Fraudulent Billing Schemes Were Most Common Schemes in Cases Reviewed", "paragraphs": ["The majority of the 739 cases resolved in 2010 that we reviewed had  more than one fraud scheme.

The use of  smart cards could have had an effect because the card would have been  able to verify at least one identity.", "Example of health care fraud case that  may have been partially affected by the  use of smart cards  According to a complaint in one case we  reviewed, a physical therapy provider was  billing for services that were not medically  necessary and was submitting duplicate bills  for the same service. This case could have  been partially affected by the use of smart  cards, as the smart card would have verified  that the beneficiary was present for only one  service in which a duplicate bill was submitted  but would not have affected the ability of the  provider to bill for services that were not  medically necessary.", "Smart cards could have partially affected an additional 147 cases (19.9  percent) in which at least one of the six schemes was present. However,  because other fraud schemes were used, the entire case would not have  been affected.

In these instances, the schemes would not have  been affected by the smart cards because although the beneficiary and  provider were present at the point of care, the provider misrepresented  the services rendered after the smart cards would have registered their  identities. These schemes included the following: billing for services that were not provided along with services that billing for services that were not medically necessary, unbundling of services, billing for services that were not prescribed or not referred by a billing for services as if they were provided by a physician to receive a  higher payment rate when they were actually provided by another  provider in which the payment rate would have been lower.", "In these schemes, smart cards would not be able to detect that the  provider misrepresented the actual services provided even if the cards  verified the beneficiary\u2019s and provider\u2019s presence. Similarly, schemes that  involved a provider misrepresenting eligibility to provide services would  not have been affected by smart cards, including schemes in which bills  were submitted for services provided by an excluded provider or by an  unlicensed, uncertified, or ineligible provider. Many of these schemes  involved health care entities that billed for services provided by  employees or contractors that were not licensed or were excluded from  providing care.", "In addition, smart card technology would not have affected schemes in  which the beneficiary was not present or the verification of the beneficiary  and provider was not relevant to the scheme. These fraud schemes  involved improper marketing of prescription drugs, including drugs for  non-FDA-approved uses; misbranding prescription drugs; inflating  prescription drug prices; and physician self-referrals. In addition, smart  cards would not have affected schemes related to improperly obtaining or  distributing prescription drugs (including drugs that contained controlled  substances), regardless of whether the beneficiary\u2019s or provider\u2019s identity  was verified, such as cases in which individuals visited multiple providers  complaining about pain to obtain prescriptions.", "Further, smart cards would not have had an effect on cases in which the  beneficiary and provider were complicit in the scheme, regardless of the  schemes used on the case. For instance, smart cards would not have an  effect on the billing for services never provided if both the beneficiary and  provider were willing participants in the scheme. Similarly, smart cards  would not have an effect on cases in which kickbacks were paid to a  beneficiary or to a provider that allowed his or her smart card to be used  for fraud."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["HHS and DOJ provided technical comments on a draft of this report,  which we have incorporated as appropriate.  In its comments, HHS  reiterated that it would be difficult for CMS to implement smart cards in  the Medicare program because implementation would require significant  changes. For example, CMS stated that it would need to require that  Medicare beneficiaries present smart cards at the point of care, which is  contrary to current CMS policy and which CMS believes could create  access to care issues. Additionally, CMS officials noted that implementing  smart cards in Medicare would be a significant business process change,  requiring substantial resources and time to implement.

Specifically, we reviewed several  government reports, such as reports produced by HHS and DOJ on the  Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Program, and DOJ and HHS OIG  press releases to identify fraud schemes that were commonly included in  the reports and to develop definitions for these schemes. See table 5 for  the health care fraud schemes developed for our case review.", "Using the list of fraud schemes identified, we reviewed court documents  for the health care fraud cases resolved in 2010 to determine the  prevalence of health care fraud schemes. The data we obtained for the  2012 report were for fraud cases, including investigations and  prosecutions, from HHS OIG and DOJ\u2019s U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices and Civil  Division and included a variety of information such as information on the  subjects of the fraud case and outcomes of the case (such as prison or  probation). We obtained data from both HHS OIG and DOJ, as HHS OIG  conducts investigations but DOJ does not prosecute all of the cases that  are investigated. Also, because HHS OIG often works jointly with DOJ on  fraud cases, for our 2012 report, we reduced duplication of fraud cases  from the data we received from HHS OIG and DOJ by comparing  subjects of the fraud cases that were in more than one data set we  received.", "Although the cases we obtained for the 2012 report included  investigations as well as prosecutions, judgments, and settlements, for  this engagement, we included only cases that had been adjudicated  favorably for the United States, meaning criminal cases in which the  subjects were found guilty, pled guilty, or pled no contest to at least one  of the charges, and civil cases that resulted in a judgment for the United  States or a settlement. There were 834 cases that resulted in a favorable  outcome for the United States, though we only reviewed 739 of these  cases. We excluded 95 cases because they were duplicative of another  case in our data set (18 cases), they were not health care fraud cases (21  cases), the data were insufficient to determine the fraud schemes used  on the cases (15 cases), the cases were administrative actions rather  than criminal or civil cases (9 cases), or we could not locate information  on the cases, such as a court document or a press release, to determine  the fraud schemes involved in the cases (32 cases).", "To determine the health care fraud schemes used in the 739 cases  included in our report, we reviewed court documents associated with the  charging stage of the case (such as indictment, information, or complaint)  unless the charging document for a case was not available. We used  court documents that we had previously obtained through our work on the  2012 report. For that report, we obtained court documents from the Public  Access to Court Electronic Records (PACER) database for the DOJ  cases. However, we did not have a charging document for all of the DOJ  cases and did not have a charging document for any of the HHS OIG  cases. As a result, we searched in PACER for charging documents for  any cases for which we were missing a charging document. If the  charging document was not available, we reviewed case details as  described in a DOJ or Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) press  release. For several HHS OIG cases, we were unable to locate a  charging document or a press release and obtained other court  documents, such as settlement agreements and plea agreements, from  HHS OIG.", "When reviewing the court documents, we collected information on the  health care fraud schemes that were used in the cases along with  information about the beneficiary\u2019s role, the provider\u2019s role, whether a  durable medical equipment supplier was involved, the programs that were  affected by the fraud, and any monetary amounts associated with the  fraud schemes (such as the amounts paid). For each case we reviewed,  two reviewers independently categorized all information obtained for the  case, including the relevant health care fraud schemes used on the case,  and resolved any differences in the categorization. To assess the  reliability of the data, we reviewed relevant documentation and examined  the data for reasonableness and internal consistency.
