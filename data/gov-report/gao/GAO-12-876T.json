Moreover, dependence on networked information technology (IT) systems has increased the reach and potential impact of this threat by making it possible for hostile actors to quickly steal massive amounts of information while remaining anonymous and difficult to detect. To address this threat, federal agencies have a key role to play in law enforcement, deterrence, and information sharing. Consistent with this threat, GAO has designated federal information security as a governmentwide high-risk area since 1997 and in 2003 expanded it to include protecting systems and assets vital to the nation (referred to as critical infrastructures). GAO was asked to testify on the cyber aspects of economic espionage. Accordingly, this statement discusses (1) cyber threats facing the nation\u0092s systems, (2) reported cyber incidents and their impacts, (3) security controls and other techniques available for reducing risk, and (4) the responsibilities of key federal entities in support of protecting IP. To do this, GAO relied on previously published work in this area, as well as reviews of reports from other federal agencies, media reports, and other publicly available sources."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The nation faces an evolving array of cyber-based threats arising from a variety of sources. These sources include criminal groups, hackers, terrorists, organization insiders, and foreign nations engaged in crime, political activism, or espionage and information warfare. These threat sources vary in terms of the capabilities of the actors, their willingness to act, and their motives, which can include monetary gain or political advantage, among others. Moreover, potential threat actors have a variety of attack techniques at their disposal, which can adversely affect an organization\u0092s computers or networks and be used to intercept or steal valuable information. The magnitude of the threat is compounded by the ever-increasing sophistication of cyber attack techniques, such as attacks that may combine multiple techniques. Using these techniques, threat actors may target individuals and businesses, resulting in, among other things, loss of sensitive personal or proprietary information.", "These concerns are highlighted by reports of cyber incidents that have had serious effects on consumers and businesses. These include the compromise of individuals\u0092 sensitive personal data such as credit- and debit-card information and the theft of businesses\u0092 IP and other proprietary information. While difficult to quantify monetarily, the loss of such information can result in identity theft; lower-quality counterfeit goods; lost sales or brand value to businesses; and lower overall economic growth and declining international trade.", "To protect against these threats, a variety of security controls and other techniques are available. These include technical controls such as those that manage access to systems, ensure system integrity, and encrypt sensitive data. But they also include risk management and strategic planning that organizations undertake to improve their overall security posture and reduce their exposure to risk. Further, effective public-private partnerships are a key element for, among other things, sharing information about threats.", "Multiple federal agencies undertake a wide range of activities in support of IP rights. Some of these agencies include the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and Homeland Security, among others. For example, components within the Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are dedicated to fighting computer-based threats to IP. In addition, both Congress and the Administration have established interagency mechanisms for better coordinating the protection of IP. Ensuring effective coordination will be critical for better protecting the economic security of America\u0092s businesses."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["In prior reports, GAO has made hundreds of recommendations to better protect federal systems, critical infrastructures, and intellectual property."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to testify at today\u2019s hearing on the threat of  economic espionage facing U.S. businesses.", "The threat of economic espionage is not new. In April 1992, we testified  that the theft of U.S. proprietary information or technology by foreign  companies has long been a part of the competitive business  environment. We also testified that the unauthorized acquisition of U.S.  proprietary or other information by foreign governments to advance their  countries\u2019 economic position was growing.", "Today, this threat continues to grow. According to the Federal Bureau of  Investigation (FBI), the theft of intellectual property (IP)\u2014products of  human intelligence and creativity\u2014is a growing threat which is  heightened by the rise of the use of digital technologies. The increasing  dependency upon information technology (IT) systems and networked  operations pervades nearly every aspect of our society. In particular,  increasing computer interconnectivity\u2014most notably growth in the use of  the Internet\u2014has revolutionized the way that our government, our nation,  and much of the world communicate and conduct business. While  bringing significant benefits, this dependency can also create  vulnerabilities to cyber-based threats. Cyber attacks are one way that  threat actors\u2014whether nations, companies, or criminals\u2014can target the  intellectual property and other sensitive information of federal agencies  and American businesses. According to the Office of the National  Counterintelligence Executive, sensitive U.S. economic information and  technology are targeted by intelligence services, private sector  companies, academic and research institutions, and citizens of dozens of  countries. To help address this threat, federal agencies have a key role  to play in law enforcement, deterrence, and information sharing.  Underscoring the importance of this issue, we have designated federal  information security as a high-risk area since 1997 and in 2003 expanded  this area to include protecting computerized systems supporting our  nation\u2019s critical infrastructure.", "In my testimony today, I will describe (1) cyber threats facing the nation\u2019s  systems, (2) reported cyber incidents and their impacts, (3) security  controls and other techniques available for reducing risk, and (4) the  responsibilities of key federal entities in support of improving the  protection of intellectual property. In preparing this statement in June  2012, we relied on our previous work in these areas. (Please see the  related GAO products in appendix II.) These products contain detailed  overviews of the scope and methodology we used. We also reviewed  relevant reports from the Department of Justice and Office of the National  Counterintelligence Executive, and information on security incidents,  including those involving economic espionage, from the U.S. Computer  Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT), media reports, and other  publicly available sources. The work on which this statement is based  was conducted in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform  audits to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We  believe that the evidence obtained provided a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["As computer technology has advanced, both government and private  entities have become increasingly dependent on computerized  information systems to carry out operations and to process, maintain, and  report essential information.

Table 2  provides descriptions of common types of cyber exploits.", "Cyberspace\u2014where much business activity and the development of new  ideas often take place\u2014amplifies these threats by making it possible for  malicious actors to quickly steal and transfer massive quantities of data  while remaining anonymous and difficult to detect. For example, cyber  attackers do not need to be physically close to their victims, technology  allows attacks to easily cross state and national borders, attacks can be  carried out at high speed and directed at a number of victims  simultaneously, and cyber attackers can more easily remain anonymous.  Moreover, the use of these and other techniques is becoming more  sophisticated, with attackers using multiple or \u201cblended\u201d approaches that  combine two or more techniques. Using such techniques, threat actors  may target individuals, resulting in loss of privacy or identity theft;  businesses, resulting in the compromise of proprietary information or  intellectual property; critical infrastructures, resulting in their disruption or  destruction; or government agencies, resulting in the loss of sensitive  information and damage to economic and national security."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reported Cyber- Incidents Illustrate Serious Risk to the Security of Intellectual Property and Other Sensitive Economic Information", "paragraphs": ["Reports of cyber incidents affecting both public and private institutions are  widespread.

Subsequent to the reported breach, the company\u2019s stock  fell more than 9 percent before trading in its stock was halted. Visa  also removed the company from its list of approved processors.  In March 2012, it was reported that Blue Cross Blue Shield of  Tennessee paid out a settlement of $1.5 million to the U.S.  Department of Health and Human Services arising from potential  violations stemming from the theft of 57 unencrypted computer hard  drives that contained protected health information of over 1 million  individuals.  In April 2011, Sony disclosed that it suffered a massive breach in its  video game online network that led to the theft of personal  information, including the names, addresses, and possibly credit card  data belonging to 77 million user accounts.

Risk assessment is based on a  consideration of threats and vulnerabilities that could be exploited to inflict  damage.", "Even with such a framework, there often are competing demands for  cybersecurity investments. For example, for some companies, mitigating  physical risks may be more important than mitigating cyber risks. Further,  investing in cybersecurity technologies needs to make business sense. It  is also important to bear in mind the limitations of some cybersecurity  technologies and to be aware that their capabilities should not be  overstated. Technologies do not work in isolation. Cybersecurity solutions  make use of people, process, and technology. Cybersecurity technology  must work within an overall security process and be used by trained  personnel.

Each of  the 93 U.S. attorneys offices throughout the country have assistant U.S.  attorneys designated as Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property  coordinators, who are available to work on IP cases. In addition, DOJ has  created Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property units in 25 U.S.  attorney\u2019s offices with histories of large IP case loads.

These include the National Intellectual Property Law Enforcement  Coordination Council (NIPLECC), created in 1999 to coordinate U.S. law  enforcement efforts to protect and enforce IP rights in the United States  and abroad and the Strategy for Targeting Organized Piracy initiative,  created by the President in 2004 to target cross-border trade in tangible  goods and strengthen U.S. government and industry IP enforcement  action. In December 2004, Congress passed legislation to enhance  NIPLECC\u2019s mandate and created the position of the Coordinator for  International Intellectual Property Enforcement, located within the  Department of Commerce, to lead NIPLECC. In November 2006 we  reported that NIPLECC continued to face persistent difficulties, creating  doubts about its ability to carry out its mandate.

The duties of  the coordinator outlined in the act include specific efforts to enhance  interagency coordination, such as the development of a comprehensive  joint strategic plan. The act also required the Attorney General to devote  additional resources to IP enforcement and undertake other IP- enforcement-related efforts. In October 2010, we noted that DOJ and FBI  officials and Office of the IPEC staff reported taking many actions to  implement the requirements of the PRO-IP Act. Moreover, the IPEC  coordinated with other federal entities to deliver the 2010 Joint Strategic  Plan on Intellectual Property Enforcement to Congress and the public. We  reported that the plan addressed the content requirements of the act, but  that enhancements were needed, such as identifying responsible  departments and entities for all action items and estimates of resources  needed to carry out the plan\u2019s priorities.
