The universities acknowledged a need for better coordination of information on investigators' financial relationships, and several universities were developing ways to do so. Policies and procedures at the five universities addressed financial conflicts of interest affecting institutions, including technology transfer activities and financial relationships with small start-up companies that market products developed by the universities. The Department of Health and Human Services has had limited success in promoting the integrity of biomedical research and protecting human subjects.

The Bayh-Dole Act, enacted in 1980, facilitated research collaborations between private industry and research institutions such as universities, and since then, financial relationships between them have grown. In biomedical research, these relationships often pair academic research expertise and facilities with industry resources for technology transfer in order to bring innovations from the laboratory into practical medical application. The increase in financial collaborations has paralleled 2 decades of rapid growth in federal and private biomedical research spending, now reaching into the billions of dollars each year. These financial partnerships and research funding have yielded significant achievements, notably treatments for diseases and conditions such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and strokes.", "Their benefits notwithstanding, some collaborations have raised concerns that research investigators or institutions that have significant financial interests in the research may focus attention on the financial rewards of the research, compromising its integrity and the safety of human subjects. In such situations, the significant financial interest presents a conflict of interest.", "HHS regulations pertaining to financial interests in biomedical research are divided into rules covering federally funded research and rules governing privately funded, federally regulated research. For HHS-funded research, institutions receiving grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) must abide by a Public Health Service (PHS) regulation governing individual investigators\u2019 financial interests. Sponsors of publicly or privately funded research on drugs, medical devices, or biological products, such as vaccines, regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) must abide by FDA\u2019s regulation concerning investigators\u2019 financial interests when filing a marketing application. (See app. I for a description of federal regulations pertaining to the financial interests of research investigators.) While these regulations govern the financial interests of individual investigators, no similar federal regulations apply to the financial interests of an institution.", "HHS\u2019 Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) plays a role in enforcing the HHS financial interest regulations through its oversight of institutional review boards (IRB), which review research involving human research subjects. OHRP, which oversees all research conducted or funded by HHS that involves human subjects, is responsible for enforcing the HHS human subjects protection regulations.", "Because of your concerns about the risks that financial conflicts of interest pose to the integrity of biomedical research and the well-being of human research subjects, you asked us to examine (1) how academic research institutions are implementing HHS\u2019 regulations governing individual investigators\u2019 financial interests, (2) the types of policies and procedures these institutions have to minimize and manage institutional financial conflicts of interest, and (3) the HHS regulations and oversight intended to ensure that financial conflicts of interest do not affect the integrity of research and the safety of human research subjects.", "To address these objectives, we reviewed the HHS regulations on research investigators\u2019 financial interests and the protection of human research subjects; interviewed officials at NIH, FDA, OHRP, and experts at academic associations (including the Association of American Medical Colleges and the Association of American Universities) and other relevant organizations (including the National Bioethics Advisory Commission); and visited five universities to study in-depth their financial conflict-of- interest policies and processes. We selected these universities from among the 20 institutions that receive the largest funding from NIH for biomedical research and that have a high degree of technology transfer activity (that is, the patenting and licensing of new technologies). Although our focus was financial conflicts of interest in biomedical research, at each university, we reviewed universitywide policies and procedures on financial conflicts of interest and related matters and interviewed administrative officials. We also interviewed biomedical research investigators, and we reviewed a sample of financial disclosure files of biomedical research investigators. Because we looked at a relatively small sample of the 483 institutions of higher education receiving research funding from NIH in fiscal year 1999, our findings are not generalizable to other universities or nonacademic research institutions. We performed our work from February through September 2001 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

The academic and professional communities also have developed policies and guidelines on conflicts of interest and have recently devoted resources to study this issue in more depth."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Growth in Biomedical Research Funding and Collaborative Relationships", "paragraphs": ["The budget of NIH, the principal federal agency that funds biomedical research, grew from a little over $3 billion in fiscal year 1980 to more than $20 billion in fiscal year 2001. Most NIH grants and contracts are awarded through universities and medical centers to investigators conducting research at these institutions. Private industry funding grew even more rapidly\u2014funding by drug companies alone rose from $1.5 billion in 1980 to $22.4 billion in 2000. Industry sponsors of biomedical research either conduct the research themselves or provide the funding to university investigators, other research institutions, contract research organizations, or private medical practices. Collaborations between government-funded research investigators and private industry also have increased, in part because of the Bayh-Dole Act. The act gave universities, nonprofit corporations, and small businesses the ability to retain patents and commercialize their federally funded inventions in order to facilitate the commercialization of new technologies. University-generated patents rose from about 250 per year before 1980 to more than 4,800 in 1998."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Investigator and Institutional Financial Conflicts of Interest", "paragraphs": ["As the boundary between academia and industry has become less distinct, concerns have been raised about the potential for financial conflicts of interest in investigators\u2019 as well as institutions\u2019 relationships with private industry. Investigators\u2019 financial relationships with outside interests can include working, contracting, or consulting for a company; holding a management position or board membership or having other fiduciary relationships; or owning stock or other securities. A conflict of interest occurs when these relationships compromise, or appear to compromise, an investigator\u2019s professional judgment and independence in the design, conduct, or publication of his or her research. For example, financial conflicts of interest may affect the recruitment of human research subjects such that inappropriate participants are enrolled. These conflicts also may influence the informed consent process\u2014by which the risks and benefits of a study are communicated to the participants\u2014resulting in participants who are not fully informed about a study\u2019s potential harm to them. Furthermore, an investigator\u2019s financial stake in a product may bias the development and reporting of research results or make the investigator reluctant to share information with other investigators in order to maintain his or her competitive edge. Financial conflicts of interest could bias the publication of research findings. For example, a corporate sponsor of research with a vested financial interest in the study outcome may try to ensure that only findings favorable to the sponsor\u2019s product are published.", "Institutional financial conflicts of interest may arise because of an institution\u2019s desire to participate in technology transfer activities and its need to remain financially sound. While companies may invest in universities by supporting positions such as endowed chairs or facilities such as research laboratories, universities also may invest financial resources in companies that sponsor research at the institution. Such investments would include owning stock in a pharmaceutical company or investing in a small start-up company formed by entrepreneurial faculty who have invented products and want to market them commercially. Start- up companies are generally nonpublicly traded enterprises. An investor\u2019s financial stake in a start-up may result in future financial gain. Sometimes, however, an institution\u2019s economic goals may conflict with its goals of fostering objective, unbiased research. Financial interests may color its review, approval, or monitoring of research conducted under its auspices or its allocation of equipment, facilities, and staff for research. For example, in a case that came to light in the late 1980s, the president of one large university provided venture capital equal to one-fifth of the university\u2019s endowment (funds that support the university) to invest in a biotechnology start-up company that used technologies the university developed, with the university consequently holding more than 70 percent of the company\u2019s equity. The company also had university officials on its board of directors and conducted research through the university. Because of these ties, university decisions about research were inappropriately commingled with financial decisions about the start-up company."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Oversight and Regulations", "paragraphs": ["Within HHS, responsibility for the oversight of federally funded or regulated biomedical research rests primarily with three entities: NIH, FDA, and OHRP. NIH is charged with ensuring that the research it funds complies with applicable HHS regulations, including a PHS regulation on individual investigators\u2019 financial interests. This regulation, promulgated in 1995, requires PHS-funded organizations or institutions (which include all NIH-funded organizations) to maintain and enforce written policies on financial conflicts of interest; inform their investigators of these policies; and require investigators to disclose any \u201csignificant financial interests\u201d in entities whose financial interests may be affected by the research. While the PHS regulation uses the phrase \u201cconflict of interest\u201d without defining it, the regulation defines a \u201csignificant financial interest\u201d as including income of an investigator or investigator\u2019s spouse or dependent child expected to exceed $10,000 over 12 months, or equity interests exceeding $10,000 or 5 percent ownership of a company. It is left to institutional officials to determine which significant financial interests constitute conflicts of interest. Institutions must report a financial conflict of interest to the PHS awarding component and explain whether the conflict has been \u201cmanaged, reduced, or eliminated.\u201d The PHS regulation does not define these terms but provides several examples of strategies to be used. In practice, the management of a financial conflict of interest includes strategies to monitor any effects as well as to reduce or eliminate the financial interest.", "FDA is responsible for ensuring that the financial interests and arrangements of clinical investigators do not interfere with the reliability of data submitted to FDA in support of marketing applications for drugs, biological products, or medical devices. Under FDA\u2019s financial interest regulation, effective in 1999, sponsors submitting marketing applications must certify that investigators did not have certain financial interests and arrangements, or must disclose them. FDA uses this information in conjunction with information submitted on the design and purpose of the study, and information obtained through on-site inspections, to assess data reliability. In contrast to PHS, FDA\u2019s thresholds for financial interests requiring disclosure include payments made by the sponsor of a study to the investigator or his or her institution exceeding $25,000 (beyond the costs incurred in conducting the study) or any equity interest an investigator has in a publicly held company sponsoring the research that exceeds $50,000.", "OHRP oversees all research conducted or funded by HHS that involves human research subjects and enforces the HHS regulations regarding the protection of human subjects. HHS\u2019 human subjects protection regulations do not address directly the disclosure and management of investigators\u2019 financial conflicts of interest. However, the regulations do require a university\u2019s IRB, which reviews research proposals involving human research subjects, to weigh a study\u2019s risks and benefits to participants, and review the study\u2019s participant consent form, as part of its review of the research. Because financial conflicts of interest may affect the risk-benefit analysis, the purpose of the IRB review implies consideration of them. While the actual IRB review of a research proposal may not explicitly consider financial conflicts of interest, IRBs have the right to request and review information about investigators\u2019 financial interests that might pose risks to subjects, and they may require an investigator to disclose significant financial interests to the research subjects in the consent form. The human subjects protection regulations also state that an IRB member may not participate in the initial or continuing review of any project in which he or she has a conflicting interest, except to provide information requested by the IRB.", "Unless biomedical research is federally funded or involves research or products that need federal approval, it is not necessarily subject to the HHS regulations and oversight pertaining to financial interests and human subjects protection.

In 1990, the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) issued a document that in part defined institutional and individual responsibilities for dealing with conflicts of interest in research and provided guidance to institutions in developing policies and procedures to meet their unique situations and local requirements. In 1993, the Association of American Universities (AAU) developed a framework for managing investigators\u2019 financial conflicts of interest. Also in 1993, the Association of Academic Health Centers convened a task force to study institutional financial conflicts of interest and their management. Although this task force produced a report, it did not develop specific guidelines on institutional financial conflicts of interest.", "More activity has occurred recently, partly because of concerns about reports that financial conflicts of interest were associated with harm to research participants. In April 2000, the American Society of Gene Therapy adopted a policy strongly encouraging that its members have no equity, stock options, or comparable arrangements in companies sponsoring a clinical trial. Also in 2000, AAU formed the Task Force on Research Accountability, which issued a report in June on improving the management of human subjects protection systems. In October 2001, the Task Force issued a report on the management of individual and institutional financial conflicts of interest, with specific guidelines and recommendations. In 2001, AAMC convened a task force of clinical investigators; patient representatives; medical school, teaching hospital, and university leaders; and representatives from industry, the legal community, and the media to study the issue of conflicts of interest, update AAMC\u2019s 1990 guidelines, and develop new principles for addressing institutional financial conflicts of interest.", "Editors of the major medical journals also have expressed concern about the competitive economic environment in which some clinical research is conceived, study subjects are recruited, and data are analyzed and reported. In response to these concerns, the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors has revised and strengthened the section on publication ethics in Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals: Writing and Editing for Biomedical Publication, which is a reference widely used by individual journals as a basis for their editorial policies. As part of the document\u2019s revised reporting requirements, authors will need to disclose details of their own and the sponsor\u2019s role in a study.

The extent of IRB involvement in the review of financial conflicts of interest also varied, ranging from reviewing investigators\u2019 financial disclosure documents to obtaining verbal information from investigators and relying on informal exchanges between its members and the conflict- of-interest committee.

Four of the universities had written policies with categories and classifications of financial conflicts of interest. However, the fifth university\u2019s written policy did not have fixed rules about potential financial conflicts of interest but instead listed 13 specific examples of activities that represented actual, possible, or no conflict of interest.", "Policies at the five universities required research investigators to disclose to the institution any significant financial interests. Three universities set the threshold for disclosure at the same level as the PHS requirement. Another set the threshold for publicly sponsored research at the PHS level, while, for privately sponsored research, it set a separate threshold of $250 in income or holdings. The remaining university set the overall threshold for disclosure at the PHS level but had a more stringent disclosure policy for investigators involved in clinical trials. To help protect the interests of human research subjects, this university required an investigator doing clinical research who has any financial interest in the study to disclose it to the institution. Officials at one of the other universities told us they also are considering whether to lower their threshold from the PHS level for disclosure of financial interests in clinical research. At four of the five universities, the overall proportion of clinical researchers who disclosed a significant financial relationship averaged 5 percent. At one university, these data were not readily available.", "The five universities differed in their timelines and processes for disclosure of significant financial interests. Three of the universities required an annual disclosure by research investigators, and two required disclosure when a research proposal was submitted. All required updates whenever there was a change in the investigator\u2019s financial interests. Their disclosure forms also varied, ranging from simply asking whether a significant financial interest exists and what type of interest it is to asking detailed questions about the nature and amount of the financial interest. Several disclosure forms required supporting information to be provided as an attachment or to be submitted later. All of the universities took steps to preserve the confidentiality of personal information, with some taking stronger measures than others. For example, while all five limited review of disclosure forms to university officials or a designated committee, one university redacted the names of investigators in the disclosure forms before giving them to the conflict-of-interest committee for review.", "All five of the universities in our study had conflict-of-interest committees that were responsible for the development and implementation of financial conflict-of-interest policies and procedures. The configuration of these committees and the extent of their involvement in the review of disclosures varied. All five universities had universitywide committees that handled the review of financial conflicts of interest. Three of these universities had additional medical school conflict-of-interest committees. At two of the five universities, either the chairperson of, or staff to, the committee reviewed all disclosure forms and determined whether the financial interest was a conflict, which would then need to be managed, reduced, or eliminated; they referred complex cases to the full committee for discussion and action. At another university, each department chairperson reviewed the department\u2019s investigator disclosures and forwarded disclosures of activities that may be allowable or are presumptively not allowable to the committee for further review. At the other two universities, the committee members reviewed each financial disclosure.", "We found some variation among the five universities in how their conflict- of-interest committees evaluated significant financial relationships. The committees make these determinations in response to the PHS regulation, which requires universities to decide whether a disclosed relationship constitutes a financial conflict of interest that needs to be managed, reduced, or eliminated. For example, one school\u2019s policy stated that an investigator conducting clinical research on a product he or she developed that was licensed to an external organization in which the investigator had equity or other direct relations might be permitted to continue with the research after disclosure, with appropriate safeguards in place. But another university\u2019s policy stated that such a relationship would present serious problems and that it would consider the relationship inappropriate unless it could be managed very closely. In addition, while one university typically allowed investigators who received grant funding to hold equity or receive consulting fees from a company for which they were conducting clinical research, another university strongly discouraged or limited this practice.", "IRB involvement in the review of financial conflicts of interest also varied at the five universities we visited. University officials told us that IRB members, following federal regulations, recused themselves from reviewing research protocols when they had a conflicting interest. At some of the universities, the IRBs were more aware of investigators\u2019 financial interests than at others. The IRB members at one university reviewed faculty financial disclosure forms in detail as part of their review of the research protocol, checked to make sure that all investigators associated with the grant had filed disclosure forms, and, when appropriate, required disclosure to human research subjects. At three other universities, the conflict-of-interest committee was supposed to send the IRB a memo or report that summarized the financial conflict and recommended a management strategy. At two of these three universities, the IRB could overrule the management strategy the conflict-of-interest committee recommended. At the third university, the IRB did not have the authority to overrule a management strategy. The IRB at the remaining university had no formal communication with the conflict-of-interest committee; instead, IRB members obtained verbal information about financial interests from investigators. Officials at this university told us they also relied on the overlapping membership between the conflict-of-interest committee and the IRB to surface any issues regarding investigators\u2019 financial conflicts of interest."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Management Strategies", "paragraphs": ["The universities we visited did one or more of the following to manage financial conflicts of interest: (1) required disclosure, (2) monitored the research, and (3) required divestiture of the financial interest. The application of these strategies differed, however. Some universities had fairly formal guidelines about when each strategy should be used, while others applied the strategies on a case-by-case basis. For example, officials at one university told us that the strategy used was sometimes determined through negotiation and cooperation between the investigator and the conflict-of-interest committee.", "Disclosure of the financial interest can take different forms, depending on the institution. One of the five universities we visited required all investigators who reported financial interests to the institution to disclose them in publications. The four remaining universities did not have an across-the-board policy to require investigators to disclose financial interests in publications, and some of the four decided on a case-by-case basis. At two universities, if human research subjects were involved, investigators had to disclose the interests to their study subjects. One of these two universities required investigators to use specific language in the consent form that described the investigator\u2019s financial relationship with the study sponsor. The other three universities decided on a case-by-case basis whether investigators would be required to disclose financial interests in the consent form.", "Monitoring the research can involve establishing a formal monitoring committee consisting of several faculty members who meet with the investigator periodically to make sure that the significant financial relationship is being handled appropriately and is not harming the integrity of the research. For example, at one university, a subcommittee of the medical school conflict-of-interest committee develops a \u201cmonitoring plan\u201d for each case, outlining the composition, appointment, and responsibilities of the monitoring committee. The plans are contingent upon approval from the universitywide committee, and the subcommittee ensures that the plan is carried out. Conversely, monitoring can be informal and involve, for instance, an investigator designing a personal \u201cself-management\u201d monitoring plan that satisfies the university\u2019s requirement for managing the financial conflict of interest. For example, at one university, an investigator with a significant financial interest in a company designed a self-management monitoring plan that included limiting the time spent with the company, keeping track of the time spent with this company, and not allowing the company to be involved with the research laboratory.", "Divestiture of the financial interest is also an option, but several universities told us that this strategy is infrequently imposed on investigators and not often chosen by them. Of 111 investigators at four of the universities we visited who had significant financial relationships with industry in 2000, only 3 voluntarily divested their interests; none were told to divest by their universities. Some investigators with significant financial interests may decide not to be involved in conducting the study, but if they are the only ones with a key skill or knowledge for a particular study, they may still want to play a role. For instance, an investigator in a privately funded study at one university we visited was willing to relinquish her rights as the head investigator on the project involving a new surgical procedure but insisted that she be present in the operating room during the surgery because of her expertise and understanding of the procedure. Subsequently, the informed consent form was altered to reveal the investigator\u2019s financial interests; other investigator-initiated safeguards, such as disclosure in publications of the investigator\u2019s financial interest, were put into place; and the investigator was permitted to be present during the surgery."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Compliance Enforcement", "paragraphs": ["Each of the five universities\u2019 written conflict-of-interest policies stated that an investigator\u2019s failure to comply with the policy, such as not disclosing a significant financial interest or not following the required management strategy, is cause for disciplinary action, ranging from fines to termination of employment. University officials told us that they rarely determined that sanctions were warranted. None of the five universities had formal processes for verifying that individuals fully disclosed their financial interests. Instead, some universities used informal methods for identifying apparent inconsistencies, such as comparing disclosure forms with those of prior years. They said they relied on investigators to comply voluntarily with conflict-of-interest policies because they believed it was important to have faculty support and maintain collegiality with the investigators. Furthermore, some of the universities emphasized informing faculty about their financial conflict-of-interest policies, a requirement established in the PHS regulation.

The other universities located their technology transfer offices under the vice provost for research or vice chancellor for research.

The policies at the five universities varied in their stringency. Four restricted the amount of equity they would accept to a fixed proportion ranging from 2 percent to 20 percent. The remaining university specified only that its equity position should not be greater than 49 percent. One university\u2019s policy stated that the university generally requires having an equity position in a company when a faculty or staff member develops technology in the course of university employment and assists a business venture in the commercialization of that idea.", "Four of the five universities reported that in fiscal year 1999 they spent more in legal fees for technology transfer activities than they were reimbursed through licensing agreements. Their technology transfer offices provide a service to university faculty members and staff in facilitating the transfer of technology to the private sector. As one university official said, faculty members should be able to pursue developing products from their research even if they generate little or no profit. Consequently, the universities said that they do not target opportunities for generating profit and that most of their patents and licenses do not yield substantial income. The universities do not patent or license all inventions of their faculty and staff, but they do assess whether the technology is worth the investment and assign the rights to the researcher for those they decline to patent or license.", "Various parties are involved in the decision to accept equity holdings in a university-related start-up. The universities we visited encouraged faculty members and staff to disclose inventions to the technology transfer office. The technology transfer staff review the disclosure to determine both its commercial potential and its ownership. Most universities own intellectual property, such as a patent, if significant university resources were used or if it was developed through research conducted at the university. The technology transfer office then attempts to find a private company to license and underwrite the cost of developing and licensing the product. At the early stage of product development, however, the commercial potential of an invention is often uncertain. If no private company is found to assume the financial risk for developing the product, the university may consider taking an invention through the patenting and licensing process itself and accept equity in payment from the company that will hold the license. At four of the universities, the vice provost or vice chancellor makes the decision to accept equity. At the remaining university, the provost makes the decision. The school or department of the university that employs the inventor also is often involved because, according to all five universities\u2019 policies, it receives a portion of the licensing income. It also may provide funds to license and develop the product.", "After the decision to take equity, the university\u2019s investment managers, who are responsible for the university endowments and investments, then manage the equity shares. University officials told us that once the equity is transferred to these managers, they have virtually no other contact or responsibilities for the equity. However, universities transfer the shares to the investment managers at different times. The technology transfer office at one university holds the equity until the company becomes public, then transfers the equity to the university investment office. Another university has guidelines for placing both individual and university equities in escrow. Other universities transfer the equity after the licensing agreement has been signed. In these cases, university officials said that they are not sure what investment managers do with these holdings\u2014in particular, whether these proprietary holdings are managed differently from other equity holdings.", "The universities also restricted their involvement in the management of university-related start-ups because of potential institutional financial conflicts of interest in these ventures. Two universities we visited had written policies that specified the university would not accept representation on a start-up company\u2019s board of directors, nor would it exercise voting rights. Another university, however, reserved the right to elect a member to the start-up\u2019s board of directors. The member, in this case, would be required to resign if the company registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an initial public offering. The remaining two universities had unofficial policies and are now reexamining the appropriate roles and responsibilities of the university, such as using nonpublic information to manage equity of a university- related start-up and the role of the faculty member who established the start-up in the university\u2019s management of the equity."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Current Regulations and Oversight Have Limitations for Promoting Research Integrity and Human Subjects Protection", "paragraphs": ["In our review, we identified limitations with the HHS regulations and oversight of financial conflicts of interest in biomedical research that have implications for promoting the integrity of research and protecting human research subjects.

In our review of the five universities, we found that IRBs learned about investigators\u2019 financial interests in various ways, ranging from reviewing financial disclosures directly or receiving reports from the conflict-of-interest committee to informally following up with investigators.

The PHS regulation requires that investigators receiving NIH funding must disclose to their institutions any \u201csignificant financial interests\u201d related to the research. The institution then must determine whether a financial interest constitutes a conflict and, if so, notify NIH that it exists and that it has been managed, reduced, or eliminated. Through the PHS regulation, therefore, institutions and funding agencies have an opportunity before research begins to protect human research subjects from potential harm from investigator conflicts of interest. But while the FDA regulation requires a clinical investigator to disclose financial interests to the sponsor of a trial before beginning to participate, FDA itself is not notified of financial interests that could present a potential conflict of interest until this information is submitted as part of a marketing application, which occurs after the research has been conducted and research subjects have already participated. Although the IRB is responsible for reviewing and minimizing risks to study subjects, the timing of the disclosure of financial interests in the FDA regulation may limit FDA\u2019s ability to provide oversight of the process.", "The timing of reports to FDA regarding financial interests is geared toward the integrity of research findings. Since the objective of the FDA regulation is ensuring data integrity for the purposes of product review, the regulation focuses on payment arrangements and other financial interests of clinical investigators that could introduce bias into studies.

Some have expressed concern that the PHS threshold was too low. For instance, in 1999, members of the NIH Regulatory Burden workgroup stated that the PHS disclosure threshold was too low and could trigger an excessive number of disclosures where there was no conflict that needed to be managed. FDA\u2019s thresholds\u2014more than $25,000 in payments from the sponsor of a clinical study to an investigator or an investigator holding more than $50,000 in equity in a publicly held company sponsoring the research\u2014are significantly higher than the PHS threshold."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Confusion Exists About PHS Reporting Requirements", "paragraphs": ["The PHS regulation requires an institution to report that it has identified a financial conflict of interest related to PHS-funded research and that it has taken steps to manage, reduce, or eliminate it. Nevertheless, we found that officials from the five universities were confused about the conditions under which they needed to report to NIH and what they needed to report. At the universities we visited, we found very few reports to NIH about financial conflicts of interest. This could be because there were few occurrences of significant financial interests involving NIH grants that were deemed conflicts or because we could not determine from the reports whether the universities had followed the reporting requirements. One university operated under the mistaken assumption that it needed to report only financial conflicts of interest that could not be managed; therefore, it did not report them if they had been managed, minimized, or eliminated. At another university, we found a case of clinical research involving human subjects during our file review in which the university established a management strategy for a financial conflict of interest but did not report it to NIH. The university officials told us they had only reported two cases to NIH since the regulation went into effect in 1995, and neither case involved human research subjects.", "In some instances, confusion about the requirements and concerns about overreporting may lead to underreporting.

Although the PHS regulation defines a significant financial interest, it allows university officials to determine whether such interests pose conflicts for investigators. Only those financial interests meeting the minimum thresholds that are deemed to be conflicts of interest must be reported.

NIH is responsible for ensuring that institutions comply with the PHS regulation on financial conflicts of interest. It may do this by reviewing an institution\u2019s policies and procedures on financial conflicts of interest, monitoring reports of conflicts, conducting site visits, examining institutions\u2019 files, and reviewing actions taken by institutions to manage financial conflicts of interest. Institutions\u2019 reports of conflicts are sent to the funding institutes and centers of NIH and are kept with the grant files. Because these reports contain no details about the conflict and its management, NIH program officials have little information to follow up on. NIH is authorized to request more information about conflicts of interest from institutions, but an official at NIH told us that NIH rarely seeks further information.

In its findings and observations on the site visits, NIH noted some of the concerns we have identified. For example, NIH found that some institutions were confused about the definition of a significant financial interest. In addition, some faculty expressed fear that full disclosure of financial interests might result in limiting their institutional salary or adversely affect NIH funding. NIH officials told us that if they discovered a weakness during the visit, they provided guidance and information to help the institution make appropriate improvements.", "In January 2001, NIH asked 300 institutions with the largest amount of NIH funding to send it copies of their financial conflict-of-interest policies after officials learned that not all research institutions have an investigator financial conflict-of-interest policy in place. A survey published in 2000 of the 250 medical schools and other research institutions with the highest NIH funding had found that 5 medical schools and 10 other research institutions reported they did not have such a policy.

All research subject to HHS regulations, funded privately or publicly, then would be held to the same standards. Steps toward harmonization, in NHRPAC\u2019s view, would include regulatory measures that go beyond the draft interim guidance. In addition, NHRPAC stated that IRBs should not have to collect, analyze, and provide remedies for financial conflicts of interest but should rely on a conflict-of-interest entity (such as a committee or an individual charged with conflict-of-interest review responsibilities) to handle the matters and report formally to the IRB as part of the research application. NHRPAC supported HHS\u2019 efforts to identify and define institutional financial conflicts of interest and methods to manage them and suggested that such interests could be disclosed to the institution\u2019s conflict-of-interest entity. NHRPAC recommended that specific, detailed information be provided in the informed consent process when an actual conflict of interest has been identified during financial disclosure and, in cases in which a potential conflict is conceivable, to make general information about financial interests available, with more detailed information available upon request.

However, as FDA has recognized in its treatment of such information, the likelihood of such disclosures is slim, and only when necessary to effect a public purpose that outweighs a particular privacy interest.
