The studies also used separate analyses to evaluate other effects, such as on wildlife habitat and the health and safety of communities.", "In the eight studies GAO reviewed, the Corps typically recommended the alternative plan with the greatest net benefit, but also relied on other analyses in certain cases, as allowed under Corps guidance. Corps officials said they relied on other analyses to determine the best project design, help make decisions, or respond to local sponsors' preferences. For example, in one study, the Corps recommended a plan that provided a levee 3 feet higher than the plan with the greatest net benefits, in response to the nonfederal sponsor's request.", "The Corps' economic analyses in the eight studies were generally consistent with best practices, but did not fully adhere to practices for transparency. For example, most analyses did not discuss the implications of key limitations in the models and data used.

The  recommended alternative plan\u2019s objectives included reducing the risk  of tidal floods as well as restoring the ecosystem to tidal marsh  habitat. The Corps selected the recommended alternative plan  because the nonfederal sponsor wanted to provide additional  transitional habitat and greater flood risk management for Federal  Emergency Management Agency accreditation over the 50-year study  period. Specifically, the local preference was to build the levee  about 3 feet higher than the plan with the greatest net benefits\u2014 thereby potentially reducing public health and safety risks associated  with flooding more than the alternative plan with the greatest net  benefit."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected Corps Economic Analyses Were Generally Consistent with Best Practices, Although Some Practices Were Not Fully Used", "paragraphs": ["The economic analyses for the eight studies we reviewed generally met  three of the five key methodological elements and partly met two key  elements\u2014analysis of effects and transparency.

In addition, the analyses provided specific  planning objectives, such as to reduce flood risks in the relevant  watershed over the 50-year analysis period and to improve the quality of  life for local neighborhoods. Furthermore, all eight analyses used a 50- year analysis period to analyze benefits and costs\u2014a period that should  be long enough to encompass important economic effects, though  several studies assumed that economic conditions would remain the  same over that time period. For example, the analysis for the Honolulu  District\u2019s flood risk management study assumed that the inventory of  homes and businesses in the flood plain would not change over the 50- year analysis period. According to the analysis, the project area includes  sites that are underutilized or not fully developed, but uncertainty about  how development might proceed made it difficult to project what changes  might occur. The study acknowledged that changes in the business and  residential makeup of the watershed over the 50-year period would occur  but that the exact nature of these changes could not be projected with  any degree of certainty.", "In addition, two of the eight studies involved multipurpose projects and  specified additional economic-related objectives for ecosystem  restoration. For example, the analysis for the San Francisco District\u2019s  feasibility study indicated that it was designed to evaluate and compare  the economic justification and cost effectiveness of various measures to  reduce flood risk and provide ecosystem restoration in South San  Francisco Bay. Similarly, the Chicago District\u2019s study indicated that in  developing an ecosystem restoration plan, undeveloped lands throughout  the watershed were evaluated to determine whether cost-effective aquatic  ecosystem restoration at that site was possible and what measures would  provide the lowest incremental cost per unit of habitat output."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Alternative Identification and Description", "paragraphs": ["Our Assessment Methodology recommends that an analysis used to  examine economic effects should identify and compare alternatives.

These best practices included:", "Quantifying and monetizing important benefits and costs. The  economic analyses in all eight studies quantified and monetized  important benefits and costs associated with each alternative, such as  property damage reductions and construction costs. The Corps\u2019  Planning Guidance indicates that studies should consider analyzing  loss of life in the Other Social Effects category, in either monetary,  quantitative, or qualitative terms. Project alternatives that reduce the  risk of flooding or that relocate people from the flood plain may lower  the risk that individuals living or working in a flood plain will drown or  become injured during flood events. However, the analyses in the  eight studies we reviewed generally did not quantify and monetize the  effect of project alternatives on loss of life. One of the studies we  reviewed quantified these effects, but only for the recommended plan.  Specifically, the Sacramento District\u2019s flood risk management study  found that the recommended plan, which involved the improvement of  an existing levee system, could reduce fatalities during flood events  by about 67 percent. Of the other seven studies that we reviewed, six  analyses included a qualitative discussion of the effects of alternatives  on loss of life, and one analysis did not include an assessment of  these effects. A recent National Academy of Sciences study on  coastal storm flooding indicated that the practice of quantifying and  valuing reductions in loss of life is widespread in the federal  government, allowing these risk reductions to be included in the  economic analysis. In July 2017, after the eight studies that GAO  reviewed were completed, the Corps issued revised guidance  requiring flood risk management studies to include a quantitative  assessment of loss of life for each alternative when it is a significant  factor. Corps officials said they had not attempted to monetize loss  of life because of concerns about the reliability of available valuation  methods but are monitoring other agencies\u2019 efforts to value these  effects and following economic research in the area.", "Using net present value criterion. Analyses for seven studies we  reviewed compared the flood risk management alternatives and  identified the alternative expected to maximize net benefits on a  comparable, present-value basis (that is, on an \u201cannualized\u201d basis).  However, one economic analysis did not clearly indicate whether the  costs associated with the flood risk management alternatives were  annualized and therefore comparable to the annualized benefits.", "Controlling for inflation and use of economically justified  discount rates. Although all the economic analyses in all eight Corps  studies we reviewed controlled for inflation by expressing benefits and  costs in \u201creal\u201d terms, the discount rates that the studies used to  convert future benefits and costs to present values were in nominal  terms. In general, real and nominal values are not combined in the  same analysis. Specifically, discounting real benefits and costs with a  nominal discount rate understates present values when holding all  else the same. Corps officials said that they are aware of this  inconsistency, but they have no latitude to use a real discount rate  because the Water Resources Development Act of 1974 requires the  Corps to use nominal discount rates.", "Corps officials acknowledged areas in which the eight Corps studies we  reviewed partly met the Analysis of Effects key methodological element.  However, as noted, the Corps has taken some steps to address one best practice. Specifically, the Corps\u2019 recently revised guidance, which  requires quantification of loss of life effects when significant, should allow  the Corps to provide decision makers and stakeholders with more precise  information about the relative magnitude of these effects in future  economic analyses. In terms of the best practice regarding economically  justified discount rates, the Corps has not taken steps because it is  required to use the statutorily specified nominal discount rates."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Transparency", "paragraphs": ["Our Assessment Methodology recommends that analyses be transparent  with respect to their analytical choices, assumptions, and data used. The  methodology further recommends (1) evaluating how plausible  adjustments to each choice and assumption may impact the estimates of  the cost-and-benefit effects and results of the comparison of alternatives  and (2) clearly explaining the implications of the key limitations in the data  and models used. Where feasible, to ensure transparency, the analysis is  to adequately quantify how the statistical variability of the key data  elements underlying the estimates of the economic analysis impacts  these estimates and the results of the comparison of alternatives.", "We found that the studies we reviewed did not fully use some best  practices related to transparency. Specifically:", "Being transparent with respect to analytical choices,  assumptions, and data used. The economic analyses in the eight  studies described and justified several, but not all of the analytical  choices, assumptions, and data. For example, to approximate the  amount of damages to structures at different flood depths, the  Wilmington District\u2019s feasibility study relied on standardized \u201cdepth- damage curves\u201d developed by the Corps\u2019 New Orleans District. Corps  guidance indicates that standardized curves can be used in the  absence of regionally developed data. According to the study, data for  structures in the study area were unavailable, and flooding  characteristics were similar in the two areas, with both study areas  covering urbanized and rural areas representing a mix of residential,  commercial, and industrial development with similar types of  construction. However, other data and assumptions used by the  studies in our review were not fully described or justified. For  example, in presenting its results for an initial screening of several  flood risk management alternatives, the Sacramento District\u2019s  economic analysis relied on cost estimates from several different  sources, including prior studies and private consultants. The analysis,  however, did not explain how the estimates were developed or justify  why the estimates were sufficiently reliable for evaluating  alternatives.", "Clearly explaining the implications of key limitations in the data  and models used. With one exception, the economic analyses we  reviewed generally did not discuss the implications of key limitations  in the models used in the studies. Specifically, the economic analysis  for the Sacramento District\u2019s study indicated that the Corps\u2019  Hydrologic Engineering Center-Flood Damage Analysis computer  program can overstate damage reduction benefits because of an  inability to account for the reduced floodplain occupancy and reduced  value of damageable property following a flood event. According to  the analysis, by not taking into account the potential for reduced  floodplain occupancy, the estimated damage reduction benefits may  be overstated, particularly in areas that experience more frequent or  severe flooding. To account for this limitation, the Sacramento  District\u2019s study reduced the overall value of properties in the  floodplain, lowering the average annual benefits for the recommended  alternative by about 29 percent. All the other studies used the same  program to estimate damage reduction benefits but did not indicate  whether this limitation would affect the estimated benefits of the  alternatives evaluated in those studies. In accordance with best  practices, the Corps\u2019 Planning Guidance indicates that studies should  provide adequate supporting documentation to allow reviewers to  understand the models and assumptions used to estimate benefits  and costs. Corps officials stated that a project team\u2019s analysis may  not document every step it took because these are understood among  team members, although they may not be apparent to others.", "Quantifying the statistical variability underlying the results of the  comparison of alternatives. Although the economic analyses for the  eight studies analyzed the effects of uncertainty associated with  several key inputs in the economic analysis, the studies generally did  not report the key estimates (for example, benefits, costs, and net  benefits) on a probabilistic basis. For example, the Chicago District\u2019s  flood risk management study presented damage reduction benefits for  each alternative in terms of its expected values as well as the  probability that the benefit estimate would exceed a particular value.  However, estimates for costs and net benefits were presented as  point estimates, which may imply a greater sense of precision than is  warranted. In accordance with best practices, the Corps\u2019 Planning  Guidance requires economic analyses to report net benefits and  benefit-to-cost ratios both as expected (mean) values and on a  probabilistic basis for each alternative; also, for each alternative, the  analyses are to present the probability that net benefits are positive  and that the benefit-to-cost ratio is at or above one. Corps officials  said the analyses generally did not follow this guidance because it  may not have been useful in helping to select a project alternative.  Nonetheless, Corps guidance states that information about the  probability distributions can help decision making by local sponsors,  stakeholders, and federal officials by helping to increase their  understanding of the uncertainty inherent in each alternative.", "In addition, for only one Corps study, the economic analyses included  a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate, which is used to convert  benefits and costs of the alternatives to present values. Generally,  when benefits or costs are separated in time from each other, the  difference in timing should be accounted for by discounting benefits  and costs. In addition, the specific discount rate may affect the  comparison of alternatives. Corps officials told us that they are  required to use the statutorily designated discount rate, and their  guidance does not require a sensitivity analysis using an alternative  discount rate. The officials added that the Office of Management  and Budget requires the Corps to compute the benefit-to-cost ratios  for recommended plans using a 7 percent discount rate, for budgeting  purposes. The results, though, are not reported in the studies, and the  7 percent rate is not applied in the assessment of the net benefits of  the alternatives, according to these officials.", "Corps officials stated that in general there is a high level of transparency  within the project team and with the nonfederal sponsor, but they  acknowledged that transparency may not always exist for those outside  the team. For example, a project team\u2019s analysis may not document  every step it took or assumption it made because these are understood  among team members, although they may not be apparent to others. As  a result, Corps officials acknowledged that some inconsistency exists in  the transparency of the analyses across feasibility studies. Corps officials  told us that teams rely on the Corps\u2019 internal process for reviewing all  planning products to help ensure the quality of its feasibility studies and  analyses.
