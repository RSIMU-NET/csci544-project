Federally funded transportation projects progress through three planning phases: long range (20 or more years), short range (3 to 5 years), and early project development, (collectively defined as planning in this report) before undergoing environmental review (which includes assessing air and water quality, ecosystems, and other impacts) required under the National Environmental Policy Act. Federal law requires planners to consider protecting and enhancing the environment in the first two phases, but does not specify how and does not require such consideration in the third phase. GAO reported on (1) the extent to which transportation planners consider ecosystem conservation in planning, (2) the effects of such consideration, and (3) the factors that encourage or discourage such consideration. GAO contacted 36 planning agencies (24 states and 12 of approximately 380 metropolitan planning organizations), as well as officials in 22 resource agencies that maintain ecological data and administer environmental laws. The Department of Transportation and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had no comments on a draft of this report. The Department of the Interior generally agreed with the contents of our draft report."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Of the 36 transportation planning agencies that GAO contacted, 31 considered ecosystem conservation in transportation planning, using a variety of methods. For example, Colorado conducts studies that incorporate ecosystem issues to guide future transportation decisions, uses advance planning to avoid or reduce impacts, and actively involves stakeholders. New Mexico uses planning studies to identify locations where wildlife are likely to cross highways and design underpasses to allow safe crossings. In the absence of specific requirements, federal agencies encourage ecosystem consideration in planning. Planners and state resource agency officials most frequently reported reduced ecosystem impacts and improved cost and schedule estimates as positive effects. For example, planners in New York changed a planned fivelane highway to a lower-impact two-lane boulevard after weighing the area's mobility needs and the project's impact on the surrounding habitat. In Massachusetts, resource agency officials said that addressing ecological requirements in planning improved schedule certainty during the federally required environmental review. Furthermore, planners and resource agency officials reported that working together has improved relationships between their agencies, thereby allowing ecosystem concerns to be resolved in a more timely and predictable manner. Officials also listed negative effects, such as higher project costs and more work for resource agencies. Constituent support from agency staff, political appointees, or the public was the most frequently reported factor (27 instances) that encouraged planners to consider ecosystem conservation. For example, New Mexico's \"pro-environment\" culture reportedly encourages planners to consider ecosystem conservation. The cost in time and resources of considering ecosystem conservation was most often cited as a discouraging factor (23 instances). For example, Colorado planners cited the significant amount of time needed to collect and maintain access to ecosystem data."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The nation\u2019s vast network of roads, highways, and bridges is essential to  interstate commerce, economic growth, national defense, and leisure  mobility.

By one estimate, roads  ecologically affect about one-fifth of the U.S. land mass.", "Although federal agencies must assess the environmental impact of  proposed federally funded transportation projects under the National  Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), state and metropolitan planners have  the opportunity to consider these issues earlier during three planning  phases: (1) as they develop long-range (20 or more years) plans; (2) as they  develop short-range (3-5 years) plans known as transportation  improvement programs; and (3) as they conduct early project planning.  The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century requires that planners  develop these long-range plans and short-range programs and that the  plans consider projects and strategies that will, among other things,  protect and enhance the environment.

We also selected a nonprobability sample of 24  states and 12 metropolitan planning organizations, primarily on the basis  of geographic diversity, to reflect a variety of ecosystems. We spoke with  officials in each of our sample states\u2019 departments of transportation and  metropolitan planning organizations to ascertain (1) the extent to which, if  at all, they consider ecosystem conservation during state and metropolitan  area transportation planning before they are required to consider the  proposed project\u2019s environmental impact under NEPA; (2) anticipated and  observed effects of considering ecosystems during transportation  planning; and (3) factors that may encourage or discourage planners from  considering ecosystems during transportation planning. To gain an  understanding of the breadth and depth of each sample states\u2019 and  metropolitan planning organizations\u2019 consideration of ecosystem  conservation in transportation planning, we asked a variety of questions  about how planners implement this approach, whether and how they  involve stakeholders, what types and sources of data they consider, what  positive and negative effects they have observed or expect to observe, and  what factors encourage and discourage them from these efforts. (See app.  I for a complete listing of these questions.) To obtain an additional  perspective on the information that planning agencies reported, we  contacted officials in resource agencies in 22 of our sample states. We  asked these officials how they are involved in transportation planning,  whether they collect ecological data and make these data available to  transportation planners, what they believe are the effects of considering  ecosystem conservation in transportation planning, and what factors  encourage and discourage them from participating in transportation  planning. (See app. II for a complete listing of these questions.) Finally, we  reviewed transportation plans that were available from the state  departments of transportation and metropolitan planning organizations in  our sample.

Similarly, seven planners listed having fewer adverse effects on  ecological resources as an encouraging factor, while five of these planners  also listed this as a positive effect. Planners also listed improved  relationships with the state resource agencies as an encouraging factor as  well as a positive effect of considering ecosystem conservation in  transportation planning."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Planners Identified Time and Resource Requirements and Other Discouraging Factors", "paragraphs": ["Although most of the planners we interviewed reported that considering  ecosystem conservation in transportation planning was beneficial, doing  so presented challenges. Chief among these challenges was the staff time  and money required to consider ecosystem conservation in transportation  planning, reported by 23 planners, including those in Arizona, New  Hampshire, and Montachusett, Massachusetts, who do not consider  ecosystem conservation in transportation planning. (See table 3.) An  Arizona planner said that state reductions in funding and staffing have  discouraged the department from considering ecosystem conservation  during transportation planning, adding that the planning department staff  has been reduced by 75 percent since the mid-1990s. New Hampshire  planners said they do not have sufficient funds to enter into long-range  studies. Therefore, there is pressure to wait until NEPA, which requires,  among other things, an assessment of the impact of proposed  transportation projects on the natural and human environment.", "The staff time and money required was also the major discouraging factor  for those planning agencies that do consider ecosystem conservation in  transportation planning. For example, planners in Colorado and North  Carolina told us that, while beneficial, it takes a significant amount of time  and effort to develop, maintain, and provide access to the data required to  consider ecosystem conservation during transportation planning.  Additionally, some metropolitan area planners told us that small planning  agencies are particularly hard-pressed, because of their small size, to  consider ecosystem conservation. For example, a metropolitan planner in  central Virginia noted that the limited funding his agency receives for long- range transportation planning precludes more focused activities to  address environmental factors, even though the agency would like to do  so. Similarly, metropolitan area planners in Athens, Georgia, told us their  ability to conduct detailed ecological analyses during planning is very  limited because they do not have enough staff.", "Difficulties in obtaining involvement or guidance from stakeholders was  the second most often cited discouraging factor, according to the planners  we interviewed. This was the chief discouraging factor mentioned by a  planner in Montachusett, Massachusetts, a metropolitan planning  organization that does not consider ecosystem conservation before project  developers prepare environmental impact assessments under NEPA. The  planner stated that the planning organization lacks guidance from the state  or federal agencies on the priority of ecosystem conservation. The planner  noted that the planning organization addresses all federal requirements in  transportation planning, as well as those issues the state emphasizes, but  ecosystem consideration has not been one of them. Planners in Utah, a  state that does consider ecosystem conservation in transportation  planning, told us that resource agencies prefer to comment on projects  that are better defined than is typically the case when they appear in  transportation planning documents. On the other hand, a Utah resource  agency official told us that his agency would like to be involved in these  earlier planning phases, but the state department of transportation does  not notify it early enough in planning.", "In addition, some planners told us that they lacked guidance from  stakeholders, namely state resource agencies, on how to consider  ecosystem conservation in transportation planning. They noted that long- term or comprehensive plans for managing the state\u2019s ecological resources  would help them make decisions about what resources to consider during  planning; however, their state resource agencies had not completed such  plans. A few of the state and federal resource agencies we interviewed  noted, though, that some states are developing wildlife conservation plans  as part of a new federal program or other habitat management plans that  they believe will be useful to state departments of transportation.", "Third, pressure from political leaders or project proponents to move  forward in spite of ecological concerns, or because of competing  priorities, also discouraged planners from considering ecosystem  conservation in transportation planning. For example, planners in North  Carolina told us that developers give little credence to environmental  concerns. Economic development in Iowa takes precedence over  ecosystem concerns, according to a planner there. A state resource agency  official in Oregon echoed these sentiments, stating that, in some instances,  regional transportation planners and the state department of  transportation value improving economic development over conserving  ecological resources.", "A few other planners cited additional discouraging factors. Local  expectations that a project will be built, regardless of ecosystem concerns,  is a discouraging factor, according to a transportation planner in North  Carolina. Also, planners in three jurisdictions noted that circumstances  might change between early planning for a project and its implementation.", "This was the chief discouraging factor for Illinois, where planners do not  consider ecosystem conservation before NEPA. Finally, planners in Great  Falls City-County, Montana, a jurisdiction that does not consider  ecosystem conservation in transportation planning, stated that their  existing policy is to rely on NEPA to assess the ecosystem and other  environmental impacts of proposed transportation projects."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Transportation and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had  no comments on a draft of this report.

We defined ecosystems as plants and animals and the  habitats that support them. We defined planning as activities associated  with developing the federally required long-range transportation plan,  short-range transportation improvement program, and the nonfederally  required project planning that some jurisdictions perform just prior to  beginning the environmental review required by the National  Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), as well as any activities, such as  corridor studies, that are performed concurrently with, but independently  of, federally mandated transportation planning activities. Because federal  law already requires that states and local governments meet air and water  quality standards, our inquiry did not include identifying whether state  departments of transportation and metropolitan planning organizations  were considering these issues in transportation planning.", "To ensure ecosystem diversity among the 12 metropolitan planning  organizations in our sample, we divided the nation into quadrants  containing a roughly equal number of states. Then, to ensure that our  sample would reflect the varying extent to which metropolitan planning  organizations consider ecosystem conservation in transportation planning,  we used the results from our 2002 survey of all metropolitan planning  organizations. The survey asked how much consideration, if any, they give  to the impact of transportation projects on environmentally sensitive  lands, such as wetlands, when they develop their transportation plans.  According to their answers, we divided the metropolitan planning  organizations in each quadrant into three subgroups: (1) those that  indicated little or no, or some consideration; (2) those that indicated  moderate consideration; and (3) those that indicated great or very great  consideration. We then randomly selected one metropolitan planning  organization from each of the 12 subgroups, resulting in the following  sample:    Benton-Franklin Council of Governments, Washington;    Butte County Association of Governments, California;    Capital District Transportation Commission, New York;    Central Virginia Metropolitan Planning Organization, Virginia;    Flagstaff Metropolitan Planning Organization, Arizona;    Great Falls City-County Planning, Montana;    Greensboro Transportation Advisory Committee, North Carolina;    Madison Athens-Clarke Oconee Regional Transportation Study, Georgia;    Merrimack Valley Planning Commission, Massachusetts;    Montachusett Regional Planning Commission, Massachusetts;    Waco Metropolitan Planning Organization, Texas; and    Yellowstone County/Billings Metropolitan Planning Organization,  Montana.", "To gain an understanding of the breadth and depth of each sample state\u2019s  and metropolitan planning organization\u2019s consideration of ecosystem  conservation in transportation planning, we developed a variety of  questions about how planners implement this consideration, whether and  how they involve stakeholders, what types and sources of data they  consider, what positive and negative effects they have observed or expect  to observe, and what factors encourage and discourage them from these  efforts. (See app. I for a complete listing of these questions.) Through  telephone interviews, we asked planners to address these questions for  each of three phases of transportation planning: (1) as they develop their  long-range transportation plans, (2) as they develop their short-range  transportation improvement programs, and (3) in the project planning  stage that immediately precedes the environmental review under NEPA.  Planners reported similar effects of considering ecosystem conservation in  transportation, planning and similar encouraging and discouraging factors  across these three phases. Therefore, we did not report answers to these  questions by phase. Appendix II contains the questions that we asked  planners who we interviewed in state departments of transportation and  metropolitan planning organizations. We also reviewed the available long- range transportation plans of each state and metropolitan planning  organization in our samples to determine whether these plans contained  goals related to ecosystem conservation.", "To obtain the perspectives of state resource agency officials, we asked  officials at each department of transportation in our sample to identify the  official at the state resource agency who was most involved with the  department of transportation during planning. We conducted telephone  interviews with resource agency officials in 22 of our 24 sample states,  asking these officials how they participate in considering ecosystem  conservation in transportation planning, whether they collect ecological  data and make these data available to transportation planners, the effects  that they can attribute to considering ecosystem conservation, and the  factors that encourage or discourage their participation. See appendix II  for a complete listing of the questions that we asked resource agency  officials.", "In analyzing our interview responses, we used content analysis and  consensus agreement among four analysts to categorize similar responses,  and grouped state and metropolitan planning organizations accordingly.  To increase the reliability of our coding of responses, we used consensus  agreement among the same four analysts. We did not verify the accuracy  of the information that we obtained in our interviews or determine  whether or how the consideration of ecosystem conservation that  planners described affected transportation projects or ecosystems  because it was not practical to do so. However, the variety of questions  that we asked of transportation planners, combined with the perspectives  of resource agency officials, mitigates the potential that our results portray  more extensive consideration of ecosystem conservation in transportation  planning than may actually exist. Although we requested planners\u2019 and  resource agency officials\u2019 observations about the effects of considering  ecosystem conservation in transportation planning, we did not evaluate  the effectiveness of their efforts, or determine whether one agency\u2019s  efforts were more effective than another\u2019s.
