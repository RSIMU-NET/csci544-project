The three agencies with the highest expenditures for the program over the 5-year period were the Department of Energy (DOE), which oversees the contractor managing ORISE, and the Department of Defense (DOD) and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which both sponsor research participants via interagency agreements with DOE. Expenditures increased 73 percent over that period, and the number of appointments increased 42 percent. Stipends accounted for 82 percent of expenditures over that period, with the remainder going to other participant expenses, overhead and program support, and administrative and security charges. Agencies' expenditures per appointment varied for several reasons, such as differences in methods of setting stipends.", "Components within DOE, DOD, and HHS that sponsor research participants have performed some assessments of the short-term effectiveness of the ORISE program, but provide varying levels of detail to agencies' employees and research participants about inherently governmental functions\u2014those functions that are so intimately related to the public interest as to require performance by federal government employees.", "Program effectiveness. Sponsoring agency components establish their own objectives for research participants and can decide whether and how to assess the extent to which the ORISE program meets those objectives. DOE, DOD, and HHS components have used questionnaires and other methods to assess how well the ORISE program meets the short-term needs of research participants and of the agency staff who oversee their activities. Agencies also face challenges in assessing the program's long-term effectiveness; for example, they do not have methods to track research participants over their careers to determine the extent to which participants' success is a result of the program. DOE has worked with other agencies on developing ways to address such challenges.", "Inherently governmental functions. Federal guidance directs agencies to develop internal procedures to ensure that only federal employees perform inherently governmental functions. DOE, DOD, and HHS sponsoring components' guidance for research participants that GAO reviewed had varying levels of detail on inherently governmental functions. Officials at these agencies said that research participants' projects generally do not involve inherently governmental functions, but GAO found that some research participants' projects involve activities that are closely associated with inherently governmental functions, such as participating in certain policy and strategic planning meetings, which may increase the risk of the participants performing inherently governmental functions.

We  assessed the reliability of the data by interviewing ORAU officials  regarding the systems from which they obtained the data and their data  collection and verification practices, reviewing documentation of audits,  reviewing other reports on the data, and manually testing the internal  consistency of the data; we determined that the data were sufficiently  reliable for the purpose of reporting on program expenditures and  numbers of appointments. To identify how sponsoring agency  components determined stipends and other expenses for research  participants, we reviewed agency components\u2019 guidance; for further  detail, we requested responses to a standard set of questions from  officials at selected DOE, DOD, and HHS components that sponsor  research participants.

We examined relevant statutes,  contracts, and agreements to obtain a general understanding of DOE,  DOD, and HHS responsibilities for assessing the ORISE program and for  ensuring the prohibition on nonfederal employees performing inherently  governmental functions is being followed. These documents included  ORAU\u2019s contract with DOE and the Economy Act of 1932, as amended.  In addition, we examined documents developed by ORAU and used by  DOE, DOD, and HHS to set forth the terms governing research  participant appointments. In particular, we examined examples of  statements of work, research participant appointment letters, and terms of  appointments to determine the extent to which they included information  or guidance on inherently governmental functions. In addition, we  reviewed websites for the ORISE program, as well as other documents,  such as participant handbooks, that ORAU and sponsoring agency  officials provided to us. We interviewed ORAU officials, as well as officials  at a nongeneralizable sample of 27 DOE, DOD, and HHS components  involved with the program (including program coordinators and mentors at  sponsoring agency components) and requested responses to a standard  set of questions from the 27 components to determine how they manage  and assess the effectiveness of their program and how they ensure the  prohibition on inherently governmental activities is being followed. We  selected the 27 sponsoring agency components by using data on the  number of all research participant appointments at DOE, DOD, and HHS  in fiscal year 2014. In particular, we selected components that had both  relatively large and small numbers of research participants and that, in  total, represented over half of all federal agency research participant  appointments in fiscal year 2014. As part of interviews with these  components, we also requested written guidance related to those aspects  we examined, including inherently governmental functions.

Responsibility  for administering the program is dispersed among agencies that sponsor  research participants. In particular, agencies are responsible for ensuring  that research participants do not perform inherently governmental  functions\u2014for example, by developing guidance and other documents for  research participants, coordinators, and mentors. Having this  responsibility allows agencies to tailor guidance on inherently  governmental functions to the features of the ORISE program at their  agencies, such as the types of projects to which research participants are  assigned. However, the level of detail in documents currently used by  DOE, DOD, and HHS varies, with some documents describing specific  types of activities that are inherently governmental functions and others  only providing general statements that research participants are not  federal government employees. More detailed guidance can help ORISE  coordinators, mentors, and research participants ensure that they are  adhering to the prohibition on research participants as nonfederal  government employees performing inherently government functions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretaries of Energy, Defense, and Health and  Human Services develop detailed guidance to ensure that ORISE  program coordinators, mentors, and research participants are fully  informed of the prohibition on nonfederal employees performing  inherently governmental functions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DOE, DOD, and HHS for their review  and comment.

In particular, DOE stated that it plans to provide  detailed guidance to all relevant parties involved in DOE-sponsored  research participation activities administered through ORISE within 180  days, following consultation with relevant DOE offices. DOD stated  detailed guidance will be developed to further ensure those connected  with the ORISE program are fully informed of the prohibition on non- federal employees performing inherently governmental functions.
