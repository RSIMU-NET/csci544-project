GAO's analysis of data provided by State and DOJ indicates that of over 16 million U.S. passports issued in 2008, about 4,500 were issued to registered sex offenders. This estimate is likely to be understated because of data limitations in the passport and NSOR databases. From analysis of the NSOR, GAO also found that about 50 of these registered sex offenders either lived outside of the United States or the offender's whereabouts were not known. GAO also found that at least 30 of these registered sex offenders were federal employees during fiscal year 2008. GAO judgmentally selected 30 sex offenders for investigation. At the time of the criminal offense, many of these offenders held positions of public trust, such as health care provider, school teacher, religious layman, law enforcement official, National Aeronautics and Space Administration engineer, and owner of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Section 8 program single-family houses. GAO's investigation also found that State issued passports to individuals who were residing in prison or delinquent in child support or whose whereabouts were unknown according to the NSOR.

Passport recipients typically travel  internationally to conduct business or enjoy new cultures and scenery. But  some are using their passports to commit nefarious illegal activities  outside the country. Specifically, the Department of Justice (DOJ) has  documented cases of U.S. citizens engaging in sex acts with children in  foreign countries. Several criminal cases highlight the issue: In 2009, a serial sex offender who had failed to register as a sex offender  was convicted of traveling to Germany to have sex with a 14-year-old boy  who was living in an orphanage. He cultivated a friendship with the victim  and while on a bike trip, the victim woke to find the offender fondling him.  The offender was also separately convicted of failing to comply with sex  offender registration requirements.  In 2008, a registered sex offender from Arizona was sentenced to more  than 9 years in prison after he pled guilty to engaging in sexual activity  with teenage girls in Mexico. The Mexican police found the offender in his  Mexican apartment with a 15-year-old Texas girl, who later told authorities  she engaged in sexual conduct with the offender in exchange for money  and crack cocaine. The offender also paid $40 for sex to other underage  girls in a Mexican bar.  In 2005, a registered sex offender from Maryland was sentenced to 15  years in prison followed by supervised release for life after he pled guilty  to sexually molesting young boys in the Philippines and Cambodia. The  offender was previously convicted of three separate child sex crimes in  Maryland and was released on parole in 2000 after serving 13 years of an  18-year sentence.", "Federal statutes authorize the Secretary of State to deny issuance of a  passport in certain circumstances, such as while an individual is  imprisoned or on parole or supervised release for a conviction for  international drug trafficking or sex tourism or is in arrearages for child  support. However, there is currently no comprehensive program to deny  passports to applicants who are registered sex offenders. In response to  your request, we (1) determined the number of passport recipients who  are registered sex offenders and (2) developed and substantiated case  studies of passport recipients who are registered sex offenders.", "To determine the number of passport recipients who are registered sex  offenders, we used State\u2019s passport database of all individuals who were  issued a passport in fiscal year 2008. We compared the database to DOJ\u2019s  National Sex Offender Registry (NSOR) as of December 2008 to determine  the number of fiscal year 2008 passport recipients who were registered sex  offenders. To develop case studies, we judgmentally selected 30 cases  primarily based on geography and considered other factors, such as  severity of crime. We researched and analyzed court records, police  reports, and other investigative sources. Our investigators also interviewed  certain passport recipients from our case studies. While these case studies  cannot be generalized beyond the cases reviewed, they serve to illustrate  the types of sex offenders that were issued passports in fiscal year 2008.", "To determine the reliability of the passport data, we interviewed State  officials responsible for those databases about the quality of the data. In  addition, we performed electronic testing of the passport database and the  NSOR to determine the validity of specific data elements that we used to  perform our work.

The Federal Bureau  of Investigation (FBI) maintains this database, the NSOR. In addition, the  Walsh Act established a comprehensive set of minimum standards for  states to follow for reporting sex offenders, including who must register,  what information must be in the registries, how often registrants must  reappear in person to verify their registration information and be  rephotographed, the number of years that offenders must maintain their  registration, and guidelines for the penalties for failing to register.", "Convicted sex offenders who fail to satisfy registration requirements are  subject to state or federal prosecution. The Walsh Act requires states to  impose criminal penalties (including a maximum potential prison term of  more than 1 year) on sex offenders who fail to comply with registration  requirements.

The  reasons for this large concentration in these five states include that they  have large populations, border or are close to foreign countries, and may  provide a more comprehensive reporting of sex offenders to the NSOR.  The NSOR data also indicated that about 50 registered sex offenders who  were issued passports either lived outside of the United States or their  whereabouts were unknown.

Further, at least 12 individuals were landlords in the Department of  Housing and Urban Development\u2019s (HUD) Section 8 housing program  during fiscal years 2006 and 2007 while they were registered sex  offenders.", "As discussed earlier, although federal law permits certain restrictions on  the issuance of passports to individuals, the Secretary of State is not  authorized to restrict the issuance of passports to individuals who are  listed in the NSOR or to identify such individuals on their passports. State  has indicated that it would like to study any proposed legislation to  provide additional authority to deny passports to sex offenders, including  constitutional, policy, and practical issues that may arise in its application  and use.

In one case study, the sex offender was issued a  passport in his name while in prison, which is allowed under federal law,  while another was issued a passport after becoming delinquent in child  support, an offense for which State must deny passports. Based on  interviews with local police departments, several of our cases showed that  sex offenders left the country and moved to Mexico. According to State  officials, Mexico does not have a sex offense registration system, so these  offenders are likely unknown to authorities and their neighbors.

Although we made  a slight modification to the title to address State\u2019s concern, we believe that  our report and its title are fair and factually accurate. About 4,500  registered sex offenders were issued a passport in fiscal year 2008.

State also said that we should include  other relevant data, such as the number of convictions by DOJ under the  relevant sex tourism statute and whether the passport could have been  denied based on a sex tourism conviction. However, while the federal  statute criminalizing sex tourism was in effect during the time period of  our data (October 1, 2007, through September 30, 2008), the statute that  requires State to deny passports to those convicted under that law did not  go into effect until after this time period elapsed (December 23, 2008).  Furthermore, it is our understanding that State recently began reviewing  the statute that requires passports to be denied to these individuals in  April 2010, after we brought this statute to its attention because State was  not aware of the statute.", "State also wrote that our report suggested that the issuance of passports to  certain Americans facilitated their commission of sex offenses abroad,  adding that there was no evidence connecting the sex offenders to sex  crimes overseas following their convictions. We disagree. In our report, we  did not state that the issuance of passports to sex offenders in fiscal year  2008 facilitated their commission of sex offenses abroad. This was not part  of our objectives for this review.  However, our introduction does cite  examples from DOJ in which prior sex offenders committed sex crimes  overseas. Our investigation did find several cases where the passport  recipients traveled to locations known for sex tourism, and one of our 30  cases is currently under indictment related to sex crimes overseas.", "State also said that there was no logical connection between the issuance  of passports and sex offenders\u2019 travel to Mexico, adding that our evidence  was based on hearsay information and that a passport was not required to  enter the United States from Mexico (via land border) until June 2009. In  our report, we state that convicted sex offenders are required to register  with local or state law enforcement authorities. As part of this  requirement, the pertinent police departments stated that the offenders  informed them of their moving to Mexico.", "Finally, State wrote that our report provides graphic details that were used  to suggest that State knew these details at the time of passport issuance  and should have taken action to prevent the issuance of the passport.  State\u2019s assessment of the details of our case studies as \u201cgraphic\u201d is the  result of the nature of the criminal acts of the passport recipients; the  offenses are directly relevant to our objective to develop case studies of  passport recipients who are sex offenders. In addition, State said that the  details of two of our cases in the Highlights could be construed as  indicating an \u201canti-gay\u201d bias. However, the descriptions of these case  studies are at the same level of detail that we report in other case studies,  describing illegal activities between an adult and a child of either gender.

Starting with the title, \u201cPassports Issued to  Thousands of Registered Sex Offenders,\u201d we are concerned that it conveys more  \u201cshock value\u201d than factual accuracy.  The fact is that the State Department lacks  legal authority to deny a passport to a registered sex offender and the title of the  report should reflect this.  Furthermore, of the over 16 million passport books and  cards issued in 2008, less than 0.0003 percent were issued to registered sex  offenders according to GAO estimates.  Additionally, the title fails to reveal the  very low percentage of passports that were issued to registered sex offenders in  2008 and the use of the word \u201cthousands\u201d without a reference point implies  otherwise.  Moreover, the title fails to convey that GAO found no lawful reasons  for the Department to deny or revoke the passports of the case study sex offenders  based on their status as sex offenders.", "The title also fails to convey that GAO found no evidence that the offenders used  their passports to commit sex offenses abroad.  To be accurate and balanced, the  title should read:  \u201cExisting U.S. Law Allows Passports to Be Issued to Registered  Sex Offenders, Although GAO Found No Evidence That Sex Offenders Used  Their Passports to Travel Abroad to Commit Sex Offenses.\u201d", "The Secretary of State has responsibility for issuing passports to U.S. nationals and  may only deny an application for a passport if there is a legal basis for denial.  The  Department takes this responsibility very seriously.  To that end, trained  adjudicators review each passport application and supporting documentation  extremely carefully to determine if the individual is entitled to a passport.  In most  cases, U.S. citizens are entitled to receive a passport regardless of the fact that they  previously committed or were convicted of a crime.", "The Department does have legal authority to deny passports in certain  circumstances, including limited authority to deny in cases involving sex  offenders.  As noted in the draft report, Congress has already provided the  Department authority to deny passports to individuals convicted of the crime of sex  tourism involving minors and who used their passport or passport card or  otherwise crossed an international border in committing an offense.  The  Department is currently working with the Department of Justice (DOJ) to  implement this legislation.  The Department also has authority to deny passports to  individuals for whom an order of probation or parole as been entered by a court  forbidding departure from the United States.  When such orders are entered for sex  offenders, the Department has authority to deny their passports on that basis.", "To be accurate and fair, the draft report should make clear that GAO found no  evidence that the Department failed to exercise its authority to deny a passport to  any sex offender identified in this study.  It should also include data relevant to this  issue, such as the number of convictions by DOJ in fiscal year 2008 under the  relevant sex tourism statute, and the number of those convicted who already had  valid passports at the time they committed these crimes.  The case studies  themselves could explain whether there is any evidence that the passport could  have been denied based on a sex tourism conviction, whether the criminal courts  failed to enter orders of probation/parole for the applicants forbidding departure  from the United States, or whether such orders had expired prior to passport  issuance.", "The report appears to suggest, without any foundation, that the Department\u2019s  issuance of passports to certain Americans facilitated their commission of sex  offenses abroad.  There are no facts in the report which show that any of the thirty  individuals included in the case studies used his passport to travel to a foreign  country to commit a sex crime.  Rather, it appears that most (if not all) the  individuals included in the case studies committed sex crimes either within their  own state or after traveling to a neighboring state.  There also is no evidence  connecting the sex offender to sex crimes overseas following their convictions.", "Moreover, there is no logical connection between the Department\u2019s issuance of  passports and the case studies involving travel to Mexico.  First, there is little  factual data in the report (beyond mere hearsay) that supports the conclusion that  any of the sex offenders in the case studies actually moved to Mexico.  But even if  they did, the report fails to explain that a passport was (and is) not necessary for  U.S. citizens to enter Mexico, and was not required to enter the United States from  Mexico via the land border until June 1, 2009.", "Ultimately, the Department would want to study any legislative proposal to  prohibit issuance of passports to sex offenders beyond our existing authorities.   As  noted above, we currently have limited authority to deny passports to certain sex  offenders.  To the extent that this report is prepared for those considering such  legislation, the report should provide a more detailed discussion of the FBI\u2019s sex  offender data and the limitations that data provides generally and with respect to  this study.  The Department\u2019s understanding is that such data is derived from  individual state reporting and that there may be concerns, even by the Department  of Justice, with respect to its accuracy.  Each state may choose which offenses to  report on, and report on a range of sex offenses.  The nature of those offenses, e.g.,  the elements and penalties, and the reporting requirements differ from state to  state.  Moreover, as we understand it, the GAO only ran State Department passport  data against the social security numbers included in the database and did not  attempt to determine which offenses or which range of sex offenses the matched  individuals committed.  Data on the nature of the offenses committed by the  matched individuals could be useful in determining whether legislation is needed.", "Including such detail suggests the Department knew or should have known of these details at the  time the passport was issued and should have taken some action to prevent issuance of the  passport.  We are also concerned that the only two case studies highlighted prominently on the  first page of the report that describe the sex of both the offender and the victim are descriptions  of crimes involving two people of the same sex.  The descriptions of the sodomy of a male child  and a search for \u201cboy lovers\u201d abroad could be construed to suggest the report has an anti-gay  bias.
