But once the devices are removed, DWI re-arrest rates return to pre-interlock rates. (Most studies use DWI arrest as a proxy for alcohol-impaired driving.) Further, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) estimated that between 15 and 20 percent of offenders arrested for DWI actually install ignition interlocks. Many factors contribute to low installation rates. For example, some states lack the resources to monitor offenders to ensure they install ignition interlocks; other states require that offenders pay fees and penalties to be eligible to install ignition interlocks and return to driving with interlocks. State ignition interlock programs vary in terms of how they are designed, but little research exists on which specific interlock program characteristics\u2014such as monitoring or length of installation\u2014could improve the effectiveness of interlock programs. NHTSA is currently conducting studies on factors that could help states improve installation rates or otherwise improve the effectiveness of their interlock programs.

While state officials confirmed that NHTSA's overall ignition-interlock-related activities have been useful, some questioned NHTSA's implementation of the ignition interlock grant program. Specifically, NHTSA's implementation was based on the plain meaning of the authorizing language in MAP-21, which did not include any reference to exemptions. As a result, states with \u201cemployer exemptions\u201d\u2014programs that require offenders to drive only vehicles equipped with ignition interlocks for personal use but allow them to drive employer-owned vehicles for work purposes\u2014were disqualified. Some state officials told us these exemptions are seldom used in practice, but are important to maintain because they facilitate the ability of offenders to work. According to NHTSA officials, they recognized that to qualify for the grant, many states would have to modify their ignition-interlock laws to make them applicable to first time offenders and eliminate exemptions; therefore, few states were expected to qualify in the grant's first years because it would be difficult for state legislatures to change their ignition-interlock laws in that time frame. In fiscal year 2013, 2 states qualified for the grant; most of the additional 12 states that applied for the grant were disqualified at least in part due to employer exemptions, but the legislatures in 2 of those states later removed such exemptions from their laws, resulting in 4 states qualifying for the grant in fiscal year 2014. Because the ignition interlock grant is relatively new, the extent to which additional state legislatures may be willing or able to modify their laws to qualify for the grant is unclear. A 2012 NHTSA review of states' impaired-driving laws found that at least 5 states' ignition-interlock laws included employer vehicle exemptions, but additional states had other factors that would prevent them from qualifying for the ignition-interlock grant."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 2012, motor vehicle crashes involving alcohol-impaired drivers killed  10,322 people.

Congress has targeted this  persistent problem through legislation to encourage states to reduce their  illegal per se BAC limit. For example, beginning in 1982, federal  legislation authorized grants to states to establish an illegal per se BAC  limit of 0.10 or greater while driving a motor vehicle. In other words, with  respect to a BAC limit of 0.10, anyone whose blood contains 1/10th of 1  percent of alcohol or higher would be deemed to be DWI. In the late  1990s, Congress made grant funds available to states to encourage them  to further lower the illegal per se driving BAC limit to 0.08. In 2000, the  U.S. Department of Transportation Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2001  included a provision that states must enact 0.08 BAC laws by fiscal year  2004 or begin losing federal highway construction funds.

As noted by the authors, the majority of studies  in this review and those that we separately identified did not randomly  assign participants to the ignition interlock; therefore, a limitation of many  of these studies remains the potential for selection bias, as individuals  who agree to install an interlock may be inherently different from  individuals who do not agree to do so. However, we did identify two  randomized controlled trials, both in Maryland and limited to offenders  with two or more alcohol-related traffic violations, that also found that  ignition interlocks are effective at reducing re-arrests.

Federal officials told  us that it is difficult to accurately estimate installation rates because the  underlying data is often inconsistently maintained within and across  states. For example, NHTSA officials told us that in an ongoing study of  state ignition-interlock programs, they were able to identify only eight  states with sufficient data (e.g., the number of ignition interlocks ordered  and the number of DWI offenders who actually installed the ignition  interlocks) to estimate the program\u2019s installation rate. As such, instead of  using the number of individuals ordered to install an ignition interlock, one  research group we spoke to used more easily-identifiable data such as  total population, total DWI arrests, or total DWI fatalities. The resulting  measure is referred to as an installation \u201cin-use\u201d rate\u2014for instance, the  number of ignition interlocks in-use as a percentage of total population.", "According to state officials, limited follow up and monitoring for  compliance and prerequisites for eligibility can hinder installation.", "Limited follow-up and monitoring for offender compliance\u2014According to  the literature review cited above, monitoring DWI offenders requires  substantial administrative resources. Officials from several states  included in our study said they do not have sufficient resources to follow  up with offenders to ensure ignition interlocks have been installed once  they have been ordered by a court or sanctioned by a state department of  motor vehicles. For example, state officials in Texas told us that courts  (i.e., judges) are often overwhelmed and do not have the resources to  follow up with offenders to ensure that an ignition interlock has been  installed or to monitor the results gathered by the ignition interlock  devices. According to New York officials, the caseloads of some  probation officers who may supervise DWI offenders are also heavy, and  some probation officers may not necessarily prioritize ignition interlock  compliance. Other law enforcement entities, even those that may lead or  operate the state\u2019s ignition-interlock program, may not have the resources  to follow up on offenders to ensure ignition interlocks have been installed  and used as required. For example, Washington\u2019s program is overseen  by the state highway patrol, but according to a senior Washington official,  the program lacks the resources to identify offenders who may be illegally  driving with a suspended license (i.e., those offenders who claim to be  waiting out the period of time that their license was suspended by not  driving at all) or driving without an ignition interlock.", "Moreover, state officials we interviewed stated that limited followup and  monitoring contributed to offenders\u2019 decisions to wait out ignition interlock  requirements. As mentioned above, the likelihood of being stopped for a  traffic violation is estimated to be less than 1 percent of those driving  while impaired by alcohol and research suggests that DWI offenders  continue to drive while their licenses are suspended. Officials from New  York described that a continuing challenge to increasing the number of  installed interlocks were DWI offenders attempts to wait out the period an  ignition interlock is required by temporarily signing over their vehicles to  friends or family. According to these officials, in New York, quarterly  inquiries are made to each of 62 counties\u2019 probation departments to  check vehicle registrations of DWI offenders to address such attempts to  circumvent the state\u2019s requirements for ignition interlocks.

One study of Florida\u2019s ignition- interlock program found that half of DWI offenders who had completed  their revocation period were still ineligible to install an ignition interlock  because they had not paid required fines and tickets. Similarly, an  Illinois official stated that a DWI offender would have to pay at least a  $380 fee in addition to any outstanding fees or penalties and enter  into a payment plan for any judgments resulting from the DWI  conviction in order to be eligible for interlock-restricted driving  privileges. Likewise, Connecticut requires offenders to pay a $100 fee  before an ignition interlock is installed. These fees and penalties are  in addition to any costs paid to the vendor for installation or lease of  the interlocks. Even in some states where there are indigent funds  available to assist offenders with the cost of ignition interlocks, some  of these fees imposed by the state may not be waived or reduced. In  Texas, one official described how mandatory license surcharges have  contributed to a substantial number of offenders driving illegally and  without insurance.", "Treatment programs\u2014In some states, offenders must complete  treatment programs before they are eligible to install an interlock and  have interlock-restricted driving privileges. In Illinois, offenders may be  required by a hearing officer or judge to enter or complete treatment,  in conjunction with installing an interlock, as conditions for being  granted a restricted drivers license.

A 2010 NHTSA evaluation of the New Mexico ignition-interlock  program found that 71 percent of convicted DWI offenders installed an  interlock in Santa Fe County, where judges made house arrest the  alternative to ignition interlock installation. In cases where DWI offenders  pleaded they had no vehicle, the judge required them to wear an  electronic monitoring bracelet. According to a 2013 MADD report based  on workshops with state officials and stakeholders from more than 30  states, imposing harsher sanctions could be a strategy for increasing  installation rates. One state official we interviewed described that  mandating alcohol monitoring as an alternative to installing an interlock  would be effective in increasing the installation rates.", "One study suggested that requiring an ignition interlock for license  reinstatement following a DWI could improve installation rates. As  mentioned above, one of the ways a DWI offender can avoid installing an  interlock is by simply waiting out the ordered suspension period and not  driving during that time. Yet research suggests that many DWI offenders  drive during a suspension period. However, if a state has a separate administrative requirement through the department of motor vehicles, for  example, the offender cannot simply wait out the suspension period and  will have to install an ignition interlock in order to reinstate his full license.  A 2013 study on a Florida state requirement that DWI offenders install an  ignition interlock for at least 6 months in order to fully reinstate their  license observed that nearly 100 percent of offenders eligible to install an  interlock actually did so.

State officials also mentioned that they  used NHTSA\u2019s ignition-interlock reports and guidance, such as the 2013  Model Guidelines report, to identify ways to strengthen their programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some State Officials Questioned NHTSA\u2019s Implementation of the New Grant", "paragraphs": ["State officials questioned how NHTSA implemented one aspect of the  new ignition-interlock grant program; specifically that states did not qualify  for funding if they included exemptions in their alcohol ignition-interlock  programs. As described previously, states qualify for this grant by  requiring that all individuals convicted of a DWI offense be limited to  driving motor vehicles equipped with an ignition interlock. Under NHTSA\u2019s  implementation regulations, states must require that the ignition interlock  be used for a minimum period of 30 days. As implemented by NHTSA,  states whose ignition-interlock programs allowed DWI offenders to drive  vehicles without an ignition interlock for work and medical reasons did not  qualify for the grants because their programs were not considered  mandatory for all such convicted individuals. Officials from New York,  Illinois, Washington, and Arizona indicated that NHTSA disqualified their  state because of the employer vehicle exemptions to their state\u2019s ignition- interlock requirements. Illinois and New York officials stated that although  their state\u2019s statutes allow exemptions, their programs typically grant few  exemptions compared to the number of ignition interlocks installed, and  the officials did not believe that exemptions substantially diminished the  effectiveness of their ignition-interlock program. However, state officials  noted they did not track the specific number of employer vehicle  exemptions that have been granted. For example, in New York, employer  vehicle exemptions are filed at the county level, not at the state level (i.e.,  with a state level department), and the state has little ability to access the  data in order to estimate the number of employer vehicle exemptions that  had been granted or compare this to the number of ignition interlocks  ordered.", "NHTSA officials stated that they based their implementation of the  ignition-interlock grant on the plain meaning of the authorizing language  in MAP-21, which did not include any reference to exemptions or  exclusions. In responding to our draft report, the Department of  Transportation (DOT) provided a document that contained information on  states\u2019 ignition-interlock laws. Specifically, NHTSA\u2019s Digest indicated  that as of May 2012 at least 5 states allowed exemptions for employer  vehicles, and additional states had other factors that would prevent them  from qualifying for the ignition-interlock grant. NHTSA officials noted that  the MAP-21 grant represents a high bar for many states. Based on  experience in reviewing state impaired driving laws, NHTSA officials  recognized that many states would have to change existing laws to apply  to first time offenders and eliminate exemptions. Few states were  expected to qualify in the grant\u2019s first years because it would be difficult  for state legislatures to change their ignition interlock laws in that time  frame. Further, NHTSA officials noted that the agency did not receive  comments from states related to exemptions during the public comment  period for the interim final rule.", "Some state officials noted that it would be challenging to change their  laws to qualify for the ignition-interlock grant. First, officials from several  states told us that there is a lack of political support to put in place  requirements for first time offenders or to eliminate exemptions. State  officials from two states reported that their legislatures would not want to  impede employment of offenders, particularly in a poor economic climate  and given the expanse of areas in states that are rural, which makes  driving a necessity for daily life. Some state officials also pointed out that  the small size and short term nature of the grant funding did not support  making changes to their states\u2019 ignition-interlock programs to qualify for  the MAP-21 ignition-interlock grant program.", "Despite these challenges, two state legislatures changed their laws to  eliminate exemptions to qualify for the ignition-interlock grant in fiscal year  2014. During the first year of the grant\u2014fiscal year 2013\u2014only 2 states  out of 14 that applied qualified for the grant. Most of the states that did not  receive the grant were disqualified due to employer exemptions. State  legislatures in Arizona and Washington were able to eliminate employer  exemptions and other disqualifying factors from their laws in order to  qualify for the grant in fiscal year 2014, bringing the total grant recipients  to four that year. Because the ignition-interlock grant is relatively new, the  extent to which additional state legislatures would be willing or able to  modify their laws to qualify for the grant is unclear."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["Ignition interlocks are one promising tool states can use to combat  alcohol-impaired driving. However, in order to be effective, the devices  must first be installed in vehicles and several factors\u2014including limited  monitoring and eligibility prerequisites\u2014can hinder installation even when  DWI offenders are ordered to use ignition interlocks. Ongoing and  planned research by NHTSA and others may shed light on actions state  officials can take to increase installation rates and otherwise improve the  effectiveness of their ignition-interlock programs. The MAP-21 ignition- interlock grant also has the potential to encourage the increased use of  ignition interlocks by providing funds to states that require the use of an  ignition interlock for all individuals convicted of a DWI offense. In the first  2 years of the grant program, few states applied for the grant and of  those, most were disqualified because of exemptions that allowed DWI  offenders to drive employer-owned vehicles without ignition interlocks.  Following the first grant year, two state legislatures modified their state  ignition-interlock laws to eliminate employer and other exemptions,  thereby qualifying for the MAP-21 grant in 2014. The extent to which  other states may follow suit is unclear. Some state officials noted that  even though these exemptions are not widely used, this option is critical  to allow DWI offenders to retain their jobs, particularly in rural areas or  areas without public transportation. For such states, the incentive and  relatively limited funding offered by the grant is not likely to outweigh the  challenges of changing state ignition-interlock laws to eliminate  exemptions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DOT for review and comment.  Included in the draft report was a recommendation that the Secretary of  Transportation provide Congress with information about the extent to  which states\u2019 ignition interlock laws allow exemptions. This  recommendation was intended to provide Congress with more complete  information as it considers reauthorizing surface transportation programs,  including the ignition-interlock grant program. On June 11, 2014, the  Deputy Director of Audit Relations transmitted DOT\u2019s comments by email.  In responding to our draft report, DOT officials expressed concerns about  this recommendation and provided additional information that addressed  our recommendation. Specifically, DOT provided the Digest of Impaired  Driving and Selected Beverage Control Laws, which is a compilation of  comprehensive information on states\u2019 impaired-driving laws. We  concluded that the Digest includes sufficient information to provide an  overview of the extent to which state laws allow exemptions and  addresses our proposed recommendation. Therefore, in light of the new  information that DOT provided, we withdrew our recommendation.

We  started with a 2010 NHTSA report \u201cKey Features for Ignition Interlock  Programs,\u201d which cited 15 studies and highlighted programs and program  features that are believed to be best able to serve traffic safety interests,  including reducing alcohol-impaired driving. We then identified additional  existing studies from peer-reviewed journals, government reports, and  conference papers based on searches of various databases, such as  ProQuest, MEDLINE, and Transportation Research International  Documentation. Search parameters included studies across the U.S. and  in specific states and those on specific interlock program components,  such as mandatory for first and repeat offenders and length of installation  required. These parameters resulted in 280 abstracts, which we narrowed  to 96, in part by cross-referencing the list with Web of Science, a resource  that identifies highly cited articles. We also conducted interviews with  organizations that conduct research on ignition interlocks, such as the  Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, and asked them to  recommend additional research.", "From these multiple sources, we identified 25 peer-reviewed articles,  government reports, and conference papers between 1990 and 2013 that  were relevant to our research objective on the effectiveness of ignition  interlocks in reducing alcohol-impaired driving. To assess the  methodological quality of the selected studies, we performed an initial in- depth review of the findings, and then a GAO methodologist performed an  independent assessment of the study\u2019s methodological soundness and  confirmed our reported analysis of the finding. One limitation is that the  majority of studies we identified did not randomly assign participants to  the ignition interlock; therefore there remains the potential for selection  bias, as individuals who agree to install an interlock may be inherently  different from individuals who do not agree. Additional limitations related  to the body of literature we reviewed include the lack of a national study  on interlock effectiveness, a lengthy time period over which the studies  were conducted (between 1990 and 2013), and the reliance of DWI arrest  as a proxy for alcohol-impaired driving. Despite these limitations, our  review of the literature did provide support for the effectiveness of ignition  interlocks while installed.", "We supplemented our synthesis by interviewing three of the studies\u2019  authors who had each contributed to multiple studies. We also conducted  interviews with NHTSA officials, as NHTSA has contracted out some  published and ongoing research on the effectiveness of ignition  interlocks. We also discussed program effects with state ignition-interlock  program administrators from the 10 states we included in our review (as  discussed below) and with NHTSA officials who were knowledgeable  about NHTSA-funded published and ongoing research on the  effectiveness of ignition interlocks.", "To identify the types of assistance that NHTSA provides to states to help  them establish and implement their ignition-interlock programs, we  interviewed NHTSA officials about their activities and reviewed reports  describing NHTSA\u2019s ignition interlock-related research, technical  assistance, and conferences. For both objectives, we interviewed  representatives from safety advocacy organizations such as the  Governors Highway Safety Association and Mothers Against Drunk  Driving. We also interviewed traffic safety, criminal justice, department of  motor vehicles or licensing, and law enforcement officials from a  nongeneralizable sample of 10 states. The selected states\u2014Arizona,  Connecticut, Illinois, Montana, New Mexico, New York, Pennsylvania,  South Carolina, Texas, and Washington\u2014were chosen to reflect a mix of  states that applied and did not apply for, as well as, states that qualified  and were disqualified from the MAP-21 ignition-interlock grant program.  To further select among states, we identified states with high DWI fatality  numbers in 2012 (the most recent year for which data are available) and  DWI fatality rates (alcohol-impaired fatalities per 100-million vehicle-miles  traveled) as calculated and categorized by NHTSA as high-, mid-, and  low-range states. We also factored in different types of programs  (judiciary, administrative, and hybrid); states with low DWI fatalities or  rates; and states with rural areas and tribal authorities, in selecting our  state sample.", "Although the information gathered from these 10 states are  nongeneralizable, it provided insights about the extent of NHTSA\u2019s  ignition interlock-related assistance, including its implementation of MAP- 21 ignition-interlock grant program, and the ignition interlock-related  research that states had conducted or participated in. In each state, we  obtained information about the state\u2019s ignition interlock laws and program  as well as any challenges in applying or qualifying for the MAP-21  ignition-interlock grant program. We also asked state officials about  NHTSA\u2019s other ignition-interlock related assistance.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2013 to June 2014 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards,  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
