However, 13 of the 24 agencies GAO reviewed had not fully defined the role of their CISO in accordance with these requirements. For example, these agencies did not always identify a role for the CISO in ensuring that security controls are periodically tested; procedures are in place for detecting, reporting, and responding to security incidents; or contingency plans and procedures for agency information systems are in place. Thus, CISOs' ability to effectively oversee these agencies' information security activities can be limited.", "The 24 CISOs GAO surveyed identified challenges that limited their authority to carry out their responsibilities to oversee information security activities. These challenges can impact agencies' ability to effectively manage information security risk. The table below shows the factors that CISOs reported as being the most challenging to their authority.", "The 24 CISOs also reported that other factors posed challenges to their abilities to carry out their responsibilities effectively, including difficulties related to having sufficient staff; recruiting, hiring, and retaining security personnel; ensuring that security personnel have appropriate expertise and skills; and a lack of sufficient financial resources. Several government-wide activities are under way to address many of these challenges. However, while the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has a statutory responsibility under FISMA 2014 to provide guidance on information security in federal agencies, it has not issued such guidance addressing how agencies should ensure that officials carry out their responsibilities and personnel are held accountable for complying with the agency-wide information security program.

These risk assessments help determine whether controls are in place  to remediate or mitigate risk to the agency. According to NIST  guidance, risks are addressed from an organizational perspective with  the development of, among other things, risk management policies,  procedures, and strategy. The risk decisions made at the  organizational level are to guide the entire risk management program.  At the information system level, risk management activities include  categorizing organizational information systems, allocating security  controls to organizational information systems, and managing the  selection, implementation, assessment, authorization, and ongoing  monitoring of security controls.", "Policies and procedures: Agencies are required to develop,  document, and implement policies and procedures that (1) are based  on risk assessments, (2) cost-effectively reduce information security  risks to an acceptable level, (3) ensure that information security is  addressed throughout the life cycle of each system, and (4) ensure  compliance with applicable requirements.", "Security plans: Information security programs are required to include  plans for providing adequate information security for networks,  facilities, and systems or groups of information systems, as  appropriate. According to NIST, the purpose of a system security plan  is to provide an overview of the security requirements of the system  and describe the controls in place or planned for meeting those  requirements. In addition, NIST recommends that the plan be  reviewed and updated at least annually.", "Security awareness training: FISMA requires agencies to provide  security awareness training to personnel, including contractors and  other users of information systems that support the operations and  assets of the agency. Training is intended to inform agency personnel  of the information security risks associated with their activities and  their responsibilities in complying with agency policies and procedures  designed to reduce these risks.", "Periodic testing: Federal agencies are required to periodically test  and evaluate the effectiveness of their information security policies,  procedures, and practices as part of implementing an agency-wide  security program. This testing is to be performed with a frequency  depending on risk, but no less than annually. Testing should include  management, operational, and technical controls for every system  identified in the agency\u2019s required inventory of major information  systems. This type of oversight is a fundamental element that  demonstrates management\u2019s commitment to the security program,  reminds employees of their roles and responsibilities, and identifies  and mitigates areas of noncompliance and ineffectiveness.

In  addition, NIST guidance states that federal agencies should develop a  plan of action and milestones (POA&M) for information systems to  document the agency\u2019s planned remedial actions to correct  weaknesses or deficiencies noted during the assessment of the  security controls and to reduce or eliminate known vulnerabilities in  the system. Furthermore, the POA&M should identify, among other  things, the resources required to accomplish the tasks and scheduled  completion dates for the milestones. According to OMB, remediation  plans assist agencies in identifying, assessing, prioritizing, and  monitoring the progress of corrective efforts for security weaknesses  found in programs and systems.", "Incident response: FISMA requires that agency security programs  include procedures for detecting, reporting, and responding to security  incidents and that agencies report incidents to the United States  Computer Emergency Readiness Team.

Most agencies  documented the role of the agency CISO in ensuring the implementation  of security program activities in their information security policies;  however, most agencies also had gaps in policies defining their CISO\u2019s  responsibilities, leaving it unclear what role, if any, these officials play in  some aspects of agencies\u2019 information security programs. By not fully  defining this role, agencies may be unable to ensure that their CISOs are  able to effectively oversee the implementation of their information security  programs.", "Although federal law and agency policies vest CISOs with responsibility  for ensuring that agency-wide information security programs are  developed, documented, and implemented, many CISOs reported  challenges to their authority to effectively carry out these responsibilities,  such as difficulties in coordinating with component organizations or other  offices, obtaining reliable and timely information from other entities within  the agency, and an inability to raise concerns to agency leadership. They  also cited concerns in having adequate staff with relevant expertise and  sufficient resources to implement security requirements. These can limit  CISOs\u2019 ability to effectively ensure that the information security program  is implemented and that agency-wide information security risk is  managed appropriately. Several government-wide initiatives that are  under way can address issues related to staffing and financial resources  if fully implemented. However, OMB\u2019s current implementation guidance  does not address how to implement the new FISMA 2014 requirements or  the CISO\u2019s role in carrying them out, nor does it identify how OMB will  evaluate the role of the CISO.

OMB also stated that it believes that its annual  FISMA 2014 guidance provides sufficient and clear details on the  expectations for agencies, to include procedures for overseeing and  managing their information security programs, and that the guidance  incorporates agency feedback and information security best practices to  better reflect challenges and solutions within the current government  operating environment. OMB noted that developing prescriptive guidance  to address or streamline variances in information security management  practices may unintentionally hamper agencies\u2019 ability to conduct their  missions. It added that, in place of issuing such guidance, OMB plans to  continue utilizing several oversight mechanisms to drive performance and  address challenges, including quarterly FISMA performance reviews and  face-to-face CyberStat Reviews.", "We disagree that existing guidance and oversight mechanisms provide  sufficient clarity for agencies on how to implement the new FISMA 2014  provisions. As stated in this report, neither the annual FISMA guidance  nor CyberStat meetings provide guidance for federal agencies on how to  implement the new FISMA 2014 requirements or the CISO\u2019s role in  carrying them out. In addition, OMB\u2019s recently revised Circular A-130 is  clear that the CISO is to have a role in ensuring that all personnel are  held accountable for complying with information security requirements,  but it does not provide guidance on how agencies are to implement this  requirement. As we note in our report, CISOs are not always able to  effectively hold personnel accountable for complying with information  security requirements. Accordingly, additional guidance from OMB  addressing how agencies should ensure that officials carry out their  responsibilities and personnel are held accountable for complying with the  agency-wide information security program could help address many of  the challenges to authority identified by federal CISOs.

The scope of our review  included the 24 major departments and agencies covered by the Chief  Financial Officers Act of 1990.", "To identify the key responsibilities of federal CISOs established by federal  law and guidance, we reviewed relevant laws including relevant  provisions of the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002  (FISMA 2002), the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of  2014 (FISMA 2014) and the Federal Information Technology Acquisition  Reform Act (FITARA).

In the survey, we asked CISOs to identify whether  they felt that they had sufficient levels of responsibility and authority. In  addition, we asked CISOs to identify factors that challenged them in  exercising their authority, and to identify specific challenges related to  these factors. We then reviewed the responses provided by the CISOs  and interviewed each of them in order to validate responses from the  survey and to obtain additional insight into the challenges they identified.  From the survey and interview responses, we analyzed CISOs\u2019  comments to identify challenges common across multiple agencies.", "To minimize errors that might occur from respondents interpreting our  questions differently from our intended purpose, we pretested the  questionnaire in person and by phone with the CISOs at three agencies.  The selection of agencies for pretesting was based on agency availability  to assist us with pretesting, variation in size of agency, and variation in  agency security governance models (i.e., centralized or decentralized).  During these pretests, we asked each CISO to complete the survey as we  listened to the process. We then interviewed the respondents to check  whether the questions were applicable, clear, unambiguous, and easy to  understand. We then revised the survey based on the feedback provided  during the pretests prior to sending the final survey to the agency CISOs.  All 24 Chief Financial Officers Act agency CISOs completed the final  survey, although not all survey respondents answered every question.", "The practical difficulties of conducting any survey may introduce non- sampling errors. For example, differences in how a particular question is  interpreted, the sources of information available to respondents, or the  types of respondents who do not respond to a question can introduce  errors into the survey results. We included steps in both the data  collection and data analysis stages to minimize such non-sampling errors.  We examined the survey results and performed computer analyses to  identify inconsistencies and other indications of error, and addressed  such issues as necessary. We analyzed responses to closed-ended  questions by counting the responses for all agencies. For questions that  asked respondents to provide a narrative answer, we compiled the  answers in one spreadsheet that was analyzed and used as examples in  the report.", "To assess any OMB efforts to provide guidance on the implementation of  new FISMA 2014 requirements for agencies to ensure that senior officials  carry out their responsibilities and to hold personnel accountable, we  analyzed OMB memoranda establishing requirements for federal  information security to determine whether they addressed matters of  information security governance and the role of the CISO.
