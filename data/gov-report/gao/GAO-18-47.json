For  example, U.S. Northern Command\u2019s (NORTHCOM) Defense Support of  Civil Authorities Response concept plan states that NORTHCOM would  be the supported command for a mission to support civil authorities in  responding to a domestic cyber incident. However, we found that other guidance directs and DOD officials confirmed that a different command,  U.S. Cyber Command (CYBERCOM), would be responsible for  supporting civil authorities in the event of a domestic cyber incident.  Therefore, we recommended that DOD issue or update guidance that  clarifies roles and responsibilities to support civil authorities in a domestic  cyber incident.

The Stafford Act aims to provide a means of assistance by  the federal government to state and local governments in responding to a  presidentially declared major disaster or emergency. A governor\u2019s request  for the President to declare a major disaster or emergency is required to  be based on a finding that the situation is of such severity and magnitude  that effective response is beyond the capabilities of the state and the  affected local governments and that federal assistance is necessary.  Additionally, under the Economy Act, a federal agency may request the  support of another federal agency, including DOD, without a presidential  declaration of a major disaster or an emergency. This act permits one  federal agency to request goods and services from another federal  agency provided that, among other things, the service is available and  cannot be obtained more cheaply or conveniently by contract.", "In July 2016, the White House issued the Presidential Policy Directive on  United States Cyber Incident Coordination (hereafter referred to as PPD- 41) to establish principles governing the federal government\u2019s response  to cyber incidents involving government or private sector entities.

This memorandum was signed and issued by DOD subsequent  to the department submitting its Section 1648 report to Congress.

For example,  we found inconsistency on which combatant command would be  designated the supported command and have the primary responsibility  for providing support to civil authorities during a cyber incident.  Consequently, as noted in appendix I, we recommended that DOD issue  or update guidance that clarifies roles and responsibilities for relevant  entities and officials to support civil authorities in a domestic cyber  incident. However, key DOD documents such as DOD Directive 3025.18,  DOD\u2019s Section 1648 report, and the Directive Type Memorandum issued  in June 2017 do not clarify roles and responsibilities of DOD components,  liaisons, and personnel who DOD had previously assigned coordination  roles and responsibilities for supporting civil authorities. As a result,  there is still uncertainty about these roles and responsibilities within the  department. For example, disagreement still exists among officials in the  department regarding whether NORTHCOM and PACOM (as the  geographic combatant commands) or CYBERCOM, which according to  command officials maintains the department\u2019s existing inventory of  cyberspace command and control capabilities, is the supported command  in a cyber incident requiring civil support. DOD officials acknowledged to  us that there are a number of planning and guidance documents that  need to be updated to clarify roles and responsibilities. Until DOD clarifies  the roles and responsibilities of its key entities for cyber incidents, as we  recommended, department leaders and components will continue to  experience uncertainty about the roles and responsibilities of different  components and commands in providing support to civil authorities in the  event of a significant cyber incident.", "In an effort to describe the department\u2019s plans for coordination with heads  of other federal agencies and state and local governments, DOD\u2019s  Section 1648 report provided information on the department\u2019s role in  supporting a whole-of-government approach during a significant cyber  incident. Specifically, DOD included copies of PPD-41, the Department of  Homeland Security\u2019s National Cyber Incident Response Plan, and DOD\u2019s  Department of Defense (DOD) Significant Cyber Incident Coordination  Procedures. These documents recognize that the department coordinates  with other federal agencies (and state and local governments, as  appropriate) through the Cyber Response Group and the Cyber Unified  Coordination Group that were consistent with PPD-41. According to  PPD-41, the Cyber Unified Coordination Group is the primary method for  coordinating between and among federal agencies responding to a  significant cyber incident, as well as for integrating private sector partners  into incident response efforts.", "While DOD\u2019s Section 1648 report recognizes the role and value of these  two groups, these groups have limited coordination opportunities with  state and local governments. For example, the Cyber Response Group is  a national-level policy coordination group composed of federal  department and agencies (i.e., does not include state and local  governments). Also, the Cyber Unified Coordination Group is an ad-hoc  group that is convened in response to a significant cyber incident and will  not include state and local governments unless it is required by the  scope, nature, and facts of a particular significant cyber incident.", "In addition, the report did not identify any plans for coordinating with  heads of other federal agencies and state and local governments, as  required by the statute.

However, this list  was incomplete because DOD did not include all exercises where DOD  components provided support to civil authorities in a cyber incident. For  example, the report did not include NORTHCOM\u2019s 2015 exercises\u2014Vista  Host and Vista Code. These two exercises examined planning  assumptions, potential resource requirements, and roles and  responsibilities associated with cyber-related defense support to civil  authorities operations.

According to these officials, the exercises identified in  the Section 1648 report focused on strategic\u2013level decisions (e.g., Cyber  Guard 16 Legal and Policy table top exercises) or tactical-level actions  (e.g., Cyber Guard 16). CYBERCOM officials told us that they believe that  Cyber Guard is a tier 1 exercise. However, a 2015 DOD Cyber Strategy  implementation document stated that while Cyber Guard is a valuable  \u201cwhole-of-nation\u201d scenario, its focus is much more tactical in nature and  that the department needed another tier 1-level exercise. Similarly,  officials from both DHS and DOD acknowledged that Cyber Guard was a  tactical-level exercise.", "As previously discussed and identified in appendix I, we previously  recommended that DOD conduct a tier 1 exercise to prepare its forces in  the event of a disaster with cyber effects. CYBERCOM officials told us the  command is currently planning an internal staff exercise to address our  recommendation to exercise its forces at the operational-level of  leadership. However, an internal staff exercise (i.e., an exercise that does  not exercise command-and-control relationships with other combatant  commanders) will not be consistent with DOD guidance that states tier 1  exercises are designed to prepare national-level organizations and  combatant commanders and staff at the strategic and operational levels  to integrate a diverse audience in highly complex environments. We  maintain our position that Cyber Guard in its current form is not a tier 1  exercise that would enable the department to achieve its DOD Cyber  Strategy goal of exercising its DSCA capabilities in support of the  Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and other agencies, including  state and local authorities.

To conduct our analysis of DOD\u2019s Section 1648 report, two  of our analysts analyzed the text of the Section 1648 report and assessed  the extent to which the report addressed the six elements required by the  statute. The analysts assessed each element in the report as \u201cfully  addressed,\u201d \u201cpartially addressed,\u201d or \u201cnot addressed.\u201d If the Section 1648  report addressed all aspects of the required element, the analysts  determined that DOD had \u201cfully addressed\u201d the element. If the report  addressed some aspects of a required element, but not all, the analysts  determined that DOD had \u201cpartially addressed\u201d the element. If the report  did not address any aspects of a required element, the analysts  determined that DOD \u201cdid not address\u201d the element.

We also interviewed Department of Homeland Security officials  to obtain clarifying and supporting information on the process by which  the department plans and prepares for a cyber incident requiring civil  support. In the cases in which the analysts determined that the plan did  not address some aspects of a required element, they discussed their  preliminary analyses with officials from the Office of the Assistant  Secretary of Defense for Homeland Defense and Global Security to seek  additional information. Additionally, DOD officials offered clarification  regarding the Defense Support of Civil Authorities process, DOD roles  and responsibilities in civil support, and information on ongoing initiatives.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2017 to November 2017  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
