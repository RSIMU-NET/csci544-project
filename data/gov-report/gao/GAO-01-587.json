Specifically, the Air Force did not meet its mission-capable goals for the E-3 or C-5 aircrafts during fiscal years 1996-2000, nor did it have enough F-100-220 engines to meet peacetime and wartime goals during that period. These shortages may also affect personnel retention. GAO recently reported that the lack of parts and materials to successfully complete daily job requirements was one of six major factors causing job dissatisfaction among military personnel. Item managers at the maintenance facilities often indicated that spare parts shortages were caused by the inventory management system underestimating the need for spare parts and by delays in the Air Force's repair process as a result of the consolidation of repair facilities. Other reasons included difficulties with producing or repairing parts, reliability of spare parts, and contracting issues. The Air Force and the Defense Logistics Agency have planned or begun many initiatives to alleviate shortages of the spare parts for the three systems GAO reviewed."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Having spare parts available when needed to perform required maintenance is critical to the Department of Defense\u2019s accomplishment of its missions. Shortages of spare parts are a key indicator of whether the billions of dollars annually spent on these parts are being used in an effective, efficient, and economical manner. Since 1990, we have designated the Department \u2018s management of its inventory, including spare parts, as high risk because its inventory is vulnerable to fraud, waste, and abuse.", "The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000 requires us to evaluate various aspects of the military services\u2019 logistics support capability, including the provision of spare parts. Also, the Chairman, House Committee on Appropriations, and the Chairman, Subcommittee on Defense, House Committee on Appropriations, requested that we review issues related to the quality and availability of spare parts for aircraft, ships, vehicles, and weapon systems. In response to these requests, we reviewed known spare parts shortages within the services. For this report, our objectives were to determine (1) the impact of spare parts shortages on three selected Air Force systems and (2) the reasons for the shortages. Additionally, we identified the overall initiatives that the Air Force and the Defense Logistics Agency have in place or planned to address the shortages.", "To address our objectives, we reviewed the Air Force\u2019s E-3 early airborne warning and control system aircraft; the C-5 transport aircraft; and the F-100-220 engine, which is used in some F-15 and F-16 fighter aircraft; we also reviewed 75 parts that were in short supply for these systems. We selected these systems because they are key to fulfilling Air Force missions. The Air Force sets goals to have a certain number of each aircraft available and capable of performing its missions at any given time. It measures the impact of parts shortages on aircraft availability by determining the percentage of aircraft that cannot meet mission requirements because parts needed for repairs are unavailable. The Air Force and the Defense Logistics Agency are responsible for managing and providing spare parts for the Air Force\u2019s aircraft."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In January 2001, we reported on Department of Defense management challenges and noted that the Department has had serious weaknesses in its management of logistics functions and, in particular, inventory management. We have identified inventory management as a high-risk area since 1990. In 1999, we reported on the Air Force\u2019s specific problems in managing spare parts and noted an increase in the percentage of some of its aircraft that were not mission capable due to supply problems. (See appendix I for examples from our reports on management weaknesses related to the Air Force.) Also, the Secretary of the Air Force reported that the readiness of the Air Force has declined since 1996 and attributed this overall decline, in part, to spare parts shortages. Table 1 shows the percentage of all aviation systems that were mission capable and the percentage of aircraft that were not mission capable due to supply problems from fiscal year 1996 through the first quarter of fiscal 2001.", "As table 1 shows, the percentage of all Air Force systems reported as not mission capable due to supply problems steadily increased from fiscal year 1996 through fiscal year 2000. The Air Force requested additional funding to address concerns with spare parts shortages. The Air Force states in the Department of Defense Quarterly Readiness Report to the Congress for July through September 2000 that funding Congress provided in earlier years has begun to improve the availability of spares, citing a 58-percent reduction in parts that have been ordered but not received since December 1998. The Secretary also expressed cautious optimism that recent congressional funding would improve the availability of spare parts and aircraft mission-capable rates. In the most recent quarterly readiness report (Oct. through Dec. 2000), the Air Force cautions that although as of early December 2000 overall mission-capable rates had improved from average fiscal year 2000 rates, this improvement had come at the cost of the increased use of the practice of removing parts from one aircraft for use on another, that is, cannibalization.", "Because of concerns that spare parts shortages were causing readiness problems, the Air Force received in fiscal 1999 an additional $904 million in obligation authority from the Department of Defense to buy more spare parts. This amount consisted of $387 million to buy spare parts attributable to the Kosovo operation, $135 million to buy engine-related spare parts for the Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center, and $382 million to overcome the accumulated shortfall of spare parts inventories. Also in 1999, the Department of Defense announced plans to provide $500 million to the Defense Logistics Agency to purchase spare parts for all the services over fiscal years 2001-2004. Of that $500 million, $213.8 million is to be for parts to be used on Air Force aircraft. According to a Department of Defense official, the Air Force was provided the first $50 million in fiscal 2001 to pass on to the Defense Logistics Agency to pay for Air Force parts ordered in fiscal year 2000. The Air Force and the other military services received additional funds in fiscal year 1999 that, unlike the funds cited above, were placed largely in operations and maintenance accounts. In a separate report issued earlier this year, we indicated current financial information did not show the extent to which these funds were used for spare parts. However, the Department plans to annually develop detailed financial management information on spare parts funding uses but does not plan to provide it to Congress. We, therefore, recommended to the Secretary of Defense that the information to be developed annually by the Department and the services on the quantity and funding of spare parts be routinely provided to Congress as an integral part of the Department\u2019s annual budget justification; the Department agreed to do so.", "The aviation systems that we reviewed are vital to the Air Force achieving its missions. The E-3 provides surveillance of the airspace and manages the flight of all aircraft in an assigned battlefield area. The Air Force first received E-3s in 1977, and an Air Force official told us that it is the oldest aircraft in the Air Force in terms of operational hours flown. The C-5 is the Air Force\u2019s largest cargo aircraft, carrying cargo such as Army tanks, and is one of the largest aircraft in the world. About 70 percent of the oversized cargo required in the critical first 30 days of one major war scenario would be the type of cargo the C-5 carries. The Air Force first received operational C-5 aircraft in 1970, and according to Air Force officials, one of the reasons for the lower than expected mission-capable rates in recent years for the C-5 aircraft is its age. The F-100-220 engine powers many of the Air Force\u2019s F-15 and F-16 fighter aircraft and, according to an Air Force official, will become increasingly critical to operations as some older engines are replaced with the F-100-220. For each of these systems, we judgmentally selected for review 25 parts, a total of 75, with the highest number of hours or incidents of unavailability for given time periods.", "Air Force spare parts are classified as either consumables or reparables. Consumable items, which are mostly managed by the Defense Logistics Agency, are those items that are discarded when they fail because they cannot be cost-effectively repaired. The Defense Supply Center Richmond is the lead center for managing aviation consumable spare parts. Reparable items, managed by the Air Force Materiel Command, are items that can be cost-effectively repaired. The Command\u2019s mission is to research, develop, test, acquire, deliver, and logistically support Air Force weapon systems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Spare Parts Shortages Adversely Affect Mission Performance, Economy and Efficiency of Operations, and Retention of Military Personnel", "paragraphs": ["The shortages of spare parts for the three aircraft systems we reviewed have not only affected readiness but also have created inefficiencies in maintenance processes and procedures and may adversely affect the retention of military personnel. Two aircraft we reviewed, the E-3 and C-5, did not meet their mission-capable goals in fiscal years 1996-2000 and were not mission capable due to supply problems from 7.3 percent to 18.1 percent during the same period. The number of usable spare F-100-220 engines that the Air Force had on hand fell short of its goal by as few as 6 and as many as 104 engines during the same period."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Spare Parts Shortages Contributed to Three Systems\u2019 Failure to Meet Mission Performance Goals", "paragraphs": ["The Air Force did not achieve its mission-capable goals during fiscal years 1996-2000 for any of the three Air Force aircraft systems we reviewed, in part, due to spare parts shortages. Table 2 shows the mission-capable goals and actual rates for the E-3 aircraft for fiscal years 1996-2000, and table 3 shows the rates at which the E-3 was not mission capable due to supply problems during the same period.", "The goal for the E-3 was lowered to 73 percent from March through September 2000 based on an Air Force assessment of its ability to achieve its mission-capable goal. The Air Force recognized that it had failed to achieve historical performance levels to the point that falling short of the standard had become the norm. Citing constraints regarding spare parts, maintenance personnel, and repair equipment, the Air Force lowered mission-capable goals for the E-3 and other aircraft with the intent of providing maintenance personnel with more achievable targets. The mission-capable goal for the E-3 aircraft rose to 81 percent in fiscal year 2001, and it is planned to return to 85 percent in fiscal year 2002.", "The goal was 12 percent or less from March through September 2000 and was raised based on an Air Force assessment of the aircraft\u2019s ability to achieve the not mission capable due to supply problems goal for the E-3 and other aircraft. The Air Force recognized that it had failed to achieve historical performance levels to the point that falling short of the standard had become the norm. Citing constraints regarding spare parts, maintenance personnel, and repair equipment, the Air Force raised its goal for not mission capable due to supply problems for the E-3 and other aircraft with the intent of providing maintenance personnel with more achievable targets. The not mission capable due to supply problems goal changed to 8 percent in fiscal year 2001, and it is planned to return to 6 percent in fiscal year 2002.", "The reported rate for total not mission capable due to supply problems in fiscal year 2000, 11.3 percent, equated to about 3 or 4 E-3s of the total of 32 aircraft being not mission capable due to supply problems.", "The C-5 also did not achieve its goals during fiscal years 1996-2000. Table 4 shows the C-5\u2019s mission-capable goals and actual mission-capable rates for those years, and table 5 shows the rates at which the C-5 was not mission capable due to supply problems as well as its goals during the same period.", "The reported rate for total not mission capable due to supply problems in fiscal year 2000, 18.1 percent, equated to almost 23 C-5s of the fleet of 126 aircraft being not mission capable, at least in part, due to supply problems.", "With regard to the F-100-220 engine, the Air Force never met its goal, called the war readiness engine goal, during fiscal years 1996-2000 (see table 6). The goal can change each fiscal year for the number of usable\u2014 ready to be installed in an aircraft\u2014spare engines the Air Force would like to have on hand to meet wartime needs. In some cases, it has had F-15s or F-16s grounded due to the lack of the engine. When the number of usable spare engines is shown as a negative number, there are not enough engines for all the aircraft required for peacetime operations; in other words, aircraft that would otherwise be available to fly are grounded because they lack engines. During fiscal years 1996 through 2000, this occurred in five different quarters.", "To compensate for a lack of spare parts, maintenance personnel sometimes remove usable parts from aircraft for which spare parts are unavailable to replace broken parts on others. Maintenance personnel at Seymour-Johnson Air Force Base said that this practice is necessary to attempt to maintain mission-capable rates when spare parts are not available. As we have previously reported, the result of this practice is that maintenance personnel spend a large amount of time cannibalizing parts and performing double work. According to a Naval Postgraduate School thesis, there is also the potential for breaking the needed part or causing collateral damage while removing the part. Additionally, a part removed from another aircraft will likely not last as long as a part from the supply system and will require maintenance sooner.", "Additionally, our past work shows that spare parts shortages may affect retention. In August 1999, we reported on the results of our December 1998 through March 1999 survey of about 1,000 Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps active duty personnel that were selected based on their work in jobs in which the Department of Defense believed were experiencing retention problems. More than half of the respondents stated that they were dissatisfied and intended to leave the military. The majority of factors were associated with work circumstances such as the lack of parts and materials needed to successfully complete daily job requirements. Both officers and enlisted personnel ranked the availability of needed equipment, parts, and materials among the top 2 of 44 quality-of-life factors that caused their dissatisfaction."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Shortages of Specific Spare Parts Occurred for Multiple Reasons", "paragraphs": ["Spare parts shortages on the three systems we reviewed occurred for various reasons. In addition, an internal Department of Defense study found similar reasons for spare parts shortages."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Contracting Issues", "paragraphs": ["Both the Air Force and the Defense Logistics Agency have encountered a variety of problems in contracting for spare parts needed for repairs. Ten (about 13 percent) of the parts we reviewed were unavailable, at least in part, because of contracting issues. These issues included lengthy price negotiations, a contract requirement to have a minimum number of units before beginning repairs, failure of a contractor to meet the delivery date, and termination of a contract. For example, the Defense Logistics Agency did not have a straight pin for the F-100-220 engine in stock because the sole-source company wanted a price that the Agency was unwilling to pay. This resulted in extended negotiations with the company before an award could be made. By the end of April 2000, the lack of this part had caused F-100-220 engines to be not mission capable in nine cases. In another case, to obtain an acceptable price for a contract for the repair of a temperature indicator for the E-3 aircraft, the Air Force was required to provide a minimum of 10 regulators for repair. By the time 10 units were accumulated and shipped, the demand for the part had exceeded the supply. Through March 2000, E-3 aircraft were not mission capable over 19 operational days due to the lack of this part. Also, a contract for an axle beam fitting for the C-5 aircraft had to be terminated because the contractor requested too many delivery schedule extensions. As of July 2000, the equivalent of one C-5 aircraft was not mission capable for 124 operational days."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Other Reasons", "paragraphs": ["Twelve (16 percent) of the parts we reviewed were unavailable for reasons other than those we have already cited. In one case, the Air Force used an incorrect replacement rate for an engine core, and as a result, the repair of parts was not timely. Through April 2000, F-100-220 engines were not mission capable due to the lack of this part in 33 cases. Also, the limited repair facility capacity for certain spare parts, such as electric generators, created shortages of the parts. By the end of March 2000, E-3 aircraft had been not mission capable for almost 10 operational days due to the lack of this part. In another case, because maintenance facilities prioritize repairs based on current Air Force requirements, a receiver transmitter was not repaired in time to avoid a shortage because higher priority items had to be repaired first. As a result, over 15 operational days of not mission capable time had been accumulated on E-3s by the end of March 2000. In another case, the required part, a vaneaxial fan, was on hand, but E-3 aircraft had accumulated over 15 operational days of not mission capable time by the end of March 2000 because of the time it took to ship the part overseas. In some cases, no spare parts had been purchased when an aircraft was being modified or the technical data for the modification was incomplete. At the end of March 2000, over 10 operational days of not mission capable time had accumulated for E-3 aircraft due to the lack of a control indicator that fell into this category."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Department of Defense Internal Study Found Similar Reasons for Shortages", "paragraphs": ["An internal study conducted by the Department of Defense found similar reasons for Air Force reparable spare parts shortages.

The second was that although there were enough parts in the system, other constraints prevented a repair facility from repairing the parts in a timely manner. The study states that this may have happened for several reasons. The parts may not have been returned from units to the repair facility, a repair facility may have lacked capacity in certain key areas such as manpower or testing equipment, the consumable parts required to fix the reparable item may not have been available, or the item managers may not have requested the repair facility to repair a part because of a lack of funding.The study contained a recommendation that the Air Force provide $609 million for fiscal years 2002 to 2007 to improve the availability of reparable spare parts.
