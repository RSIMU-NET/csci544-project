DOD and the services are taking a variety of actions to cover anticipated shortfalls in their war-related funding. These actions include taking steps to reduce costs, transferring funds among appropriations accounts, and deferring some planned activities to use those funds to support the war. Also, DOD plans to ask the Congress for additional transfer authority, which would give it sufficient authority to move funds from one service to another and get funds to the operation and maintenance accounts that have the greatest shortfalls. The deferral of activities planned for fiscal year 2004 adds to the requirements that will need to be funded in fiscal year 2005 and potentially later years and could result in a \"bow wave\" effect in future fiscal years. GAO's past work has shown that current cost reporting includes large amounts of funds that have been reported as obligated in miscellaneous categories and thus provide little insight on how those funds have been spent. This is likely to result in reduced transparency and accountability to the Congress and the American people. Recent congressional actions have signaled the Congress' intent to require greater accountability regarding the use of GWOT funds. For example, in action on the President's $25 billion request for an Iraqi Freedom Fund Contingent Emergency Reserve in fiscal year 2005, the House Committee on Appropriations included provisions in its bill for cost reporting related to the use of these funds. But additional actions are necessary."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the United States  began military operations to combat terrorism both in the United States  and overseas. Military operations to defend the United States from  terrorist attacks are known as Operation Noble Eagle. Overseas operations  to combat terrorism are known as Operation Enduring Freedom and have  taken place principally in Afghanistan. In March 2003, the United States  began Operation Iraqi Freedom to change the government in Iraq.  Together, these three operations are known as the Global War on  Terrorism (GWOT). To support GWOT operations in fiscal year 2004, the  Congress appropriated $65 billion to the Department of Defense (DOD) in  an emergency supplemental appropriation. The administration had  requested that amount to cover about $51 billion for ongoing military  operations in Iraq, over $10 billion for U.S. forces in Afghanistan, and  about $3.6 billion for homeland defense and support to allies.", "To assist the Congress in its oversight role, we reviewed (1) the adequacy  of current funding for fiscal year 2004 GWOT-related activities and  (2) actions DOD is undertaking to cover any anticipated shortfalls.

Obligations are incurred through actions such  as orders placed, contracts awarded, services received, or similar  transactions made by federal agencies during a given period that will  require payments during the same or a future period. DOD\u2019s financial  systems capture the obligation of funds. To identify DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2004  GWOT-reported obligations, we used DOD\u2019s Consolidated Department of  Defense Terrorist Response Cost Reports, which report the monthly and  cumulative GWOT obligations, and analyzed the data. Although we did not  validate the financial systems or data that the Defense Finance and  Accounting Service uses to produce these consolidated cost reports, we  did discuss the data presented in these reports with DOD and service  representatives and agreed that for the limited scope of this review, the  consolidated reports provided the best available data. We also did not  verify whether reported obligations were actually in support of GWOT.  However, we are beginning a separate review of the obligations  accumulated through the various sources of information used by the  services, including the method by which the Defense Finance and  Accounting Service acquires and consolidates the data into the cost report  and whether the reported obligations support the war.", "We interviewed DOD and service representatives responsible for preparing  budgets and estimating costs to obtain their forecasts of fiscal year 2004  funding needs as contained in their midyear budget reviews that they  presented to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)  and subsequent updates as of June 2004. We also interviewed resource  management representatives from some of the major commands involved  in Operation Iraqi Freedom. We focused our work on the obligation of  funds appropriated for operation and maintenance and military personnel,  for both active and reserve forces, because they represented the large  majority of funds obligated in fiscal year 2004 through April 2004. In  developing observations on how to improve accountability over  contingency funds, we drew upon the body of work we have done over the  past decade on the cost of contingency operations.

Our comparison of the percentage of fiscal year 2004 GWOT  operation and maintenance funds obligated by the military services for the  first seven months of the fiscal year (i.e., October 1, 2003, through April  2004, the latest month for which obligation data are available for all the  services) showed that all of the military services had obligated more than  60 percent of their available appropriations, including any funds  transferred from the Iraqi Freedom Fund. As shown in figure 2,  the percentage of available operation and maintenance funds that were  obligated as of April 30, 2004, ranged from a low of nearly 61 percent for  the Air Force to a high of over 77 percent for the Marine Corps. Therefore,  we believe that if funds continue to be obligated at the current rate or  higher, operation and maintenance reported obligations made in fiscal  year 2004 will be higher than the funds available for obligation in fiscal  year 2004.", "Each of the military services completed a midyear budget review in  May-June 2004 for the Office of the Secretary of Defense, including a  forecast of their requirements for GWOT and, in some cases, has updated  those forecasts. Each service concluded it did not have sufficient  GWOT funding for GWOT operation and maintenance, while two of the  services\u2014the Navy and the Marine Corps\u2014forecasted a shortfall in GWOT  military personnel funds (see next section). A summary of each service\u2019s  review follows.", "The Army forecasts a funding shortfall of about $10.2 billion. The shortfall  includes $5.3 billion for support to deployed Army forces; $3.4 billion for a  variety of activities, including $2 billion for refurbishing equipment used in  Operation Iraqi Freedom and $753 million in contractor logistics support;  $800 million for equipment maintenance; and $650 million for contract  guards and garrison support units in the United States. The two largest  components of the shortfall in support for deployed forces are the  Logistics Civil Augmentation Program (LOGCAP) contract that provides a  wide array of support services such as feeding and housing soldiers and  the costs, such as those for spare parts, associated with the higher  operating tempo of U.S. forces. LOGCAP costs have grown significantly as  contractors replaced soldiers providing complex support functions. Higher  than initially planned troop levels in Iraq as of spring 2004 (130,000 instead  of 99,000) and an increase in troop levels in Afghanistan (from about  14,000 to about 21,000) have increased all aspects of troop support.  Additional factors driving costs are the decision to change the force mix of  units serving in Iraq from one-third armor, two-thirds wheeled vehicles to  one-half armor, one-half wheeled vehicles, which will lead to higher  operational tempo and maintenance costs because armor vehicles are  more expensive to operate and an increased use of airlift to move critical  equipment to Iraq this past spring.", "The Air Force forecasts a shortfall of about $1.5 billion, which includes the  costs for increased operating tempo, such as more flying hours than  anticipated, higher transportation costs to move Air Force units and  equipment, body armor for airmen in combat areas, night vision gear, and  operation of surveillance equipment. In addition, the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) directed the Air Force to fund  $116 million for its own support provided under the LOGCAP contract,  which would otherwise have been paid by the Army.", "The Navy forecasts a shortfall of $931 million, which includes the costs for  higher steaming and flying hours. For example, Navy representatives told  us that they had planned for 11 additional steaming days per quarter but  are actually at 18 additional days per quarter, which totals $231 million of  the shortfall. In addition, there are 4,000 Navy personnel in Iraq and  Kuwait that were not planned to deploy, which increases the operational  costs, and the transportation costs to move additional Navy and Marine  Corps personnel (which were also not expected to deploy) to GWOT  operations.", "The Marine Corps forecasts a shortfall of $446 million. This shortfall  reflects the cost of having 26,500 Marines in Iraq and the additional  deployment of two Marine Expeditionary Units in support of GWOT  operations when initially Marine Corps forces were expected to decrease  their presence in fiscal year 2004. It also includes the cost of refurbishing  equipment that had been in Iraq in fiscal year 2003. Furthermore, the  equipment and maintenance costs associated with adding extra armor on  vehicles are much higher than anticipated because of the extra wear-and- tear the vehicles are experiencing due to the extra weight. The shortfall  does not include an additional $140 million needed for aircraft force  protection that is being funded by the Navy.", "In addition to the military services, the Congress also provided  GWOT operation and maintenance appropriations for the defense  agencies, including the Special Operations Command and the  Defense Logistics Agency. These agencies are also reflected in the midyear  budget review. Our analysis of their collective reported obligations  through April 2004, which represents almost 58 percent of the fiscal year,  indicates that the defense agencies are also obligating their funds rapidly,  with about 66 percent of their appropriated operation and maintenance  funds obligated through April 2004."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Funding for GWOT Military Personnel Is Reasonably Close to Forecasts", "paragraphs": ["The military services have been obligating their funds for military  personnel at a rate that nearly mirrors the percentage of the fiscal year  that has passed.

DOD uses \u201ctransfer authority\u201d to shift  funds between appropriation accounts, for example, between military  personnel and operation and maintenance. Transfer authority is granted  by the Congress to DOD usually pursuant to specific provisions in  authorization or appropriation acts. In the fiscal year 2004 National  Defense Appropriation Act, DOD was given general transfer authority to  shift $2.1 billion between appropriations accounts, as well as other  transfer authorities that are more specific in nature. DOD was also given  transfer authority in the fiscal year 2004 Emergency Supplemental  Appropriation Act to shift $3 billion of the funds appropriated in that act.  In both cases, the Secretary of Defense must determine that this transfer is  necessary in the national interest and that it would fund unforeseen and  higher priority items than those originally funded, and he must notify the  Congress promptly of the transfer. The ability to shift funds within a  specific appropriation account, like operation and maintenance, is  referred to as \u201creprogramming.\u201d In general, DOD does not need statutory  authority to reprogram funds within an account as long as the funds to be  spent would be used for the same general purpose of the appropriation  and the reprogramming does not violate any other specific statutory  requirements or limitations. For example, DOD could reprogram operation  and maintenance funds originally appropriated for training to cover  increased fuel costs because both uses meet the general purpose of the  operation and maintenance account, as long as the shift does not violate  any other specific congressional prohibition or limitation.", "According to a representative in the Office of the Under Secretary of  Defense (Comptroller), DOD has sufficient funds within its overall  appropriation to cover forecasted GWOT shortfalls. Therefore, DOD does  not plan to ask the Congress for additional funding, but instead will cover  the shortfall in its fiscal year 2004 GWOT funding by both transferring and  reprogramming normal annual appropriation and GWOT funds. However,  as explained earlier, there are statutory dollar limits on the amount of  funds DOD can transfer and, according to a DOD representative, as of  June 18, 2004, DOD had exhausted most of its transfer authority.  According to this representative, DOD plans to ask the Congress for an  additional $1.1 billion in transfer authority, which would give the  department sufficient authority to move funds from one service to another  and get funds to the operation and maintenance accounts that have the  greatest shortfalls. Also, according to most service representatives, they  plan to reprogram funds within their appropriations to the extent allowed  by law. Finally, DOD plans to transfer the remaining amount in the Iraqi  Freedom Fund, which has its own transfer authority, to the Army and  Marine Corps operation and maintenance accounts."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Military Services Plan to Cover GWOT Shortfalls", "paragraphs": ["To cover their forecasted GWOT shortfalls, each of the military services  has identified a number of steps it plans to take.

Actions include emphasizing the need to control costs,  reprogramming funds within and transferring funds across accounts,  seeking help from the other military services for bills now being paid by  the Army, and deferring what amounts to a total of about $3.4 billion in  activities until fiscal year 2005 or beyond, including deferring  refurbishment of equipment used in Operation Iraqi Freedom. In a  December 2003 message, the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army asked units to  control costs and look for alternatives to the LOGCAP contract with the  realization that costs were growing rapidly. Army representatives told us  that to control costs they have implemented a number of measures,  including    higher level review of LOGCAP tasks over $10 million as well as over other  contract actions and equipment and supply purchases,    strengthened management controls on new work performed under the  LOGCAP contract, and  the review of supply requisitions to identify and cancel duplicate or  inactive requisitions after 30 days as well as a management review of  requisitions that have a high-dollar value, involve large quantities, or  involve pilferable items.", "The Army will also seek to transfer the previously discussed anticipated  $800 million surplus that is attributable to GWOT in its military personnel  appropriation account and reprogram funds within its military personnel  Army and National Guard appropriations to cover the forecasted  $650 million shortage for contract guards and garrison support units, and  it is waiting for the Congress\u2019 approval of the Office of the Secretary of  Defense\u2019s request to transfer funds from other service and defense agency  accounts, as well as the previously discussed transfer of remaining funds  in the Iraqi Freedom Fund. The Army has already received almost  $1 billion in transfers from the transportation working capital fund that  reflect surpluses in that account and anticipates a reduction in  transportation rates and usage changes that would produce a $265 million  savings. Finally, the Army is seeking to have the other military services pay  some bills it is currently paying. These bills include having the Marine  Corps pay almost $313 million and the Air Force pay almost $116 million in  LOGCAP costs, which is the Army\u2019s estimate of the cost of LOGCAP  services being provided to those services.

To cover its forecasted operation and maintenance shortfall of  $931 million, the Navy, like the Air Force and the Army, plans to reduce or  defer spending in its operation and maintenance account, by reducing  activities involving facility sustainment and restoration modernization  projects by $300 million and non-GWOT flying and steaming hours by  $226 million. According to Navy representatives, if the fleet does not want  to reduce flying and steaming hours, it can defer its depot maintenance.  The Navy received $121 million in transfers from the Office of the  Secretary of Defense. The Navy will cover the remaining $284 million  shortfall in operation and maintenance and the $61 million shortfall in  military personnel through the transfer and reprogramming of funds from  investment accounts.", "The Marine Corps plans to fund both $334 million of its forecasted  $446 million operation and maintenance shortfall and its $107 million  military personnel shortfall with funds transferred from the Iraqi Freedom  Fund and Department of the Navy investment accounts.

In the long term, for example, Air Force  representatives told us that part of the reduction in peacetime flying hours  would affect the Air Education and Training Command\u2019s training of new  pilots, which would slow new pilot production. While some actions, such  as reduced training or travel, cannot be restored, actions that involve  deferring planned activities can be restored in future fiscal years to the  extent funding is available.

As shown in figure 4, the operating support category,  which details obligations for such operation-related activities as facilities  support, fuel, and spare parts and totaled about $32.1 billion, showed  about $15.5 billion in miscellaneous categories.

As a  result, the actual funding requirement is often more or less than what was  initially estimated, and the military services have sometimes used  surpluses to fund activities that were not part of the contingency  operation. We have found that in some years funding was insufficient for  some services while it was sufficient for others and that within a service it  was sufficient for one appropriation account but not for another. For  example, in June 1996 we reported that the Army and the Navy reported  obligations for operation and maintenance that were in excess of their  supplemental funding, while the Air Force and the Marine Corps reported  obligations that were less than their supplemental funding. In that year,  both the Air Force and the Marine Corps used the excess funding for a  variety of otherwise unfunded operational needs.

To ensure accountability for the use of those  funds, the Congress is contemplating requiring periodic reports on the use  of such funds. Our past work has shown that current cost reporting  includes large amounts of funds that have been reported as obligated in  miscellaneous categories and so provides little insight on how those funds  have been spent.
