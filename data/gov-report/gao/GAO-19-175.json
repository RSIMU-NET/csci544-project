In particular, the dollar value of firearms purchases by ICE in USASpending.gov was approximately 8 times greater than the value of the purchases reported by ICE to GAO. Some differences result from other agencies using ICE contracts to make firearms and ammunition purchases, and ICE not properly identifying the funding agency for those purchases in the system that supplies data to USASpending.gov. Because ICE does not accurately report the agency that funded these purchases, the public does not have accurate information on how much ICE\u2014and the agencies that make purchases using ICE contracts\u2014have spent on firearms and ammunition. This decreases accountability and transparency of federal purchases, which is in conflict with the intended purpose of this system.", "Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) have inventory controls for tracking, verifying, and securing federal law enforcement officers' (FLEOs) firearms. GAO observed these agencies' law enforcement components and found them to be generally following their inventory and security policies at selected locations. In instances where agencies were not in compliance with their policies, the agencies made corrections during the course of GAO's review. Each component has a process whereby at least once yearly officials review the firearms inventory to ensure that firearms match with records in the office's inventory system. The figure below illustrates a general process that all components GAO reviewed follow to verify their firearms inventory. Ammunition and tactical equipment inventory controls varied because agencies generally did not consider these items to be as sensitive as firearms. Examples of these controls include security for, and limited access to, equipment that might be vulnerable to risk of loss or unauthorized use, such as silencers or pyrotechnics."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Director of ICE update ICE's contracting process to provide the name of the agency funding the purchase of firearms and ammunition to improve the accuracy of publicly available data.

In 2012, the Bureau of Justice Statistics reported that the federal  government employed approximately 120,000 FLEOs in non-military  agencies with authority to make arrests and carry firearms in the United  States\u2014the vast majority of which were law enforcement agents within  the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Department of Justice  (DOJ). In addition, federal agencies such as the U.S. Department of  Health and Human Services (HHS), the Environmental Protection Agency  (EPA), and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) also have law  enforcement responsibilities that support their core missions. These  responsibilities include investigating potential violations of federal public  health, environmental, and tax laws.", "Within the federal government, FLEOs have a number of different  functions to fulfill their law enforcement missions and roles, including  providing police response, conducting criminal investigations, and  providing building or personnel security. To help FLEOs carry out these  responsibilities, agencies purchase firearms, ammunition, and tactical  equipment. At these federal agencies, FLEOs are authorized to carry  firearms, and are required to train in their use and pass certain firearms  qualification standards. To help ensure officers\u2019 maintain the firearms  proficiency of their firearms-carrying workforce, these agencies purchase  ammunition for training, qualifications, and operations.", "Agencies may also purchase tactical equipment to support and augment  FLEO operations, such as counterdrug, counterterrorism, and border- security activities. The types of tactical equipment used for these  operations can include tactical vehicles to conduct drug raids; night vision  gear and thermal imaging devices to surveil marijuana cultivation on  public lands; helicopters to patrol coastlines; tactical and armored  vehicles to patrol the border for illegal activities; and aerial capabilities to  enhance border surveillance.", "Agencies that purchase firearms, ammunition, and tactical equipment  must report those purchases publicly on a searchable website\u2014 USASpending.gov. Because the law enforcement missions of these  agencies require them to purchase and manage firearms, ammunition,  and tactical equipment, effective purchasing and oversight\u2014including  inventory and safeguarding controls\u2014of these sensitive assets is  important. We have previously reported on federal agency firearms  inventory controls and on DHS ammunition purchasing and inventories. In  those reports, we also noted that it is incumbent upon agencies to ensure  the effective and efficient management of these items as stewards of  taxpayer resources.", "You asked us to review issues related to firearms, ammunition, and  tactical equipment purchases by federal agencies, as well as inventory  controls at HHS, EPA, and IRS specifically. This report examines the  following questions:  1.  What do available data show about spending on firearms,  ammunition, and selected tactical equipment made by federal  agencies with 250 or more federal law enforcement officers from fiscal  years 2010 through 2017?  2.  To what extent have selected agencies accurately reported purchases  of firearms and ammunition in publicly-available data on  USASpending.gov?  3.  What types and quantities of firearms, ammunition, and selected  tactical equipment do HHS, EPA, and IRS have documented to be in  their inventory systems, as of November 2017?  4.  What inventory controls and procedures are in place at HHS, EPA,  and IRS, and to what extent do these agencies follow these  procedures at selected locations?", "This report is the public version of a sensitive report that we issued in  October 2018. HHS, IRS and the Transportation Security Administration  (TSA) deemed some of the information in our October report to be  sensitive, which must be protected from public disclosure. Therefore, this  report omits sensitive information about the number of FLEOs at the TSA,  an illustration of how HHS\u2019s National Institutes of Health Police secures  its firearms, and the number and types of some firearms, ammunition,  and tactical equipment in NIH\u2019s and IRS\u2019s inventory. Although the  information provided in this report is more limited, the report addresses  the same objectives as the sensitive report and uses the same  methodology.", "To address our first question, we selected the 20 agencies from the  departments named in the Chief Financial Officers Act that employed 250  or more FLEOs at any point from fiscal years 2010 through 2017. We  also excluded military and intelligence agencies from our review, such as  all Department of Defense (DOD) branches and the U.S. Coast Guard,  which is part of DHS. Table 1 shows the agencies in our scope for our  first question.", "For the first question, we analyzed the amount 20 federal agencies  reported spending on firearms, ammunition, and tactical equipment and  refer to these internal agency records as spending data. Specifically, we  provided the 20 agencies a data collection instrument and requested that  they report, among other things, the agency\u2019s purchase method; award  date; number of firearms, ammunition, or tactical equipment purchased;  type of firearm, ammunition, or tactical equipment purchased; the amount  spent for these items; and whether the amount spent is an estimate for  the firearms, ammunition, and tactical equipment purchased for FLEOs  from their internal record-keeping systems from fiscal years 2010 through  2017. We analyzed the data agencies reported as \u201camount spent,\u201d and  we use the terms \u201cspending\u201d and \u201cspent\u201d to refer to these data. To identify  tactical equipment for inclusion in our review, we selected 18 categories  of items that appeared on two or more lists of destructive, militaristic, and  specialized equipment. We use the term \u201ctactical equipment\u201d to refer to  these 18 selected categories of tactical equipment.", "To assess the reliability of the spending data, we conducted tests for  missing data and obvious errors, reviewed relevant documentation, and  followed up with agency officials as needed. We interviewed  knowledgeable agency officials about their spending records and data  reporting practices. We found the data sufficiently reliable for the purpose  of reporting the minimum thresholds of total amounts agencies spent and  the number of firearms and rounds of ammunition they bought. However,  we found the data were not reliable for reporting the number of tactical  equipment items purchased or for conducting further comparative  analysis.", "To address our second question, we selected three agencies\u2014the  Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), the U.S. Forest Service, and U.S.  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)\u2014to assess the extent to  which their purchases of firearms and ammunition were accurately  reflected in publicly-available data. We selected these three agencies  based on the total dollar value of obligations reported in  USASpending.gov: one small agency (BIA), one medium agency (Forest  Service), and one large agency (ICE). We requested that these  agencies provide to us internal purchase data for firearms and  ammunition that included, among other things, the amount obligated for  these items, a unique transaction identifier (called the Procurement  Instrument Identifier), and the product or service code for firearms and  ammunition purchases from fiscal years 2010 through 2017. We  compared the amounts these three agencies obligated for firearms and  ammunition purchases, as they reported to us, with the obligation data  that are publicly available on USASpending.gov for those three agencies,  using the Procurement Instrument Identifier to match records across the  two sets of data. We obtained publicly-available data from  USASpending.gov, which included obligations data from the Federal  Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG), using product or  service codes that identify contracts for firearms or ammunition  purchases. We did not include equipment purchases because the  publicly-available data lack product or service codes that would allow us  to reliably identify those records. We reviewed a portion of these data and  interviewed agency officials about differences we found between the  publicly-available and agency-provided data. Results of our analyses of  these three agencies\u2019 data are not generalizable.", "To address our third and fourth questions, we reviewed inventory  information and controls for the case study federal law enforcement  components within HHS, EPA, and IRS. Specifically, we obtained and  analyzed inventory data, annual inventory reports, and other available  documentation provided by these case study agencies and their  components that employ FLEOs regarding their inventory of firearms,  ammunition, and tactical equipment as of November 2017. Accordingly,  we can draw conclusions only about the selected components in these  agencies. To assess the reliability of the inventory data, we reviewed  components\u2019 documentation related to purchases and data management,  especially policies to ensure that items are properly entered and removed  from the system.", "To examine these components\u2019 firearms, ammunition, and tactical  equipment inventory controls, we reviewed their policies describing  storage protocols and inventory control procedures, and we interviewed  components\u2019 officials to better understand these policies and procedures  in practice. We reviewed internal and external audit and inspection  reports related to the controls over firearms, ammunition, and tactical  equipment at these components to identify any reported deficiencies and  actions taken or planned to address those deficiencies. We also  compared these policies with applicable Standards for Internal Control in  the Federal Government and key areas that we have identified as  important for effective inventory management. We also conducted site  visits to 12 components\u2019 offices selected based on a variety of factors,  including the number of agencies with component offices in each city we  visited, data discrepancies at field offices, and reports of loss or theft at  these offices. During these site visits, we observed officials demonstrating  inventory inspection, inventory data entry, and access and other security  controls. In addition, we interviewed officials responsible for maintaining  and inventorying firearms, ammunition, and tactical equipment.

They interpret the FPDS-NG  Government User\u2019s Manual guidance to allow designation of ICE as the  funding agency, since payment for the purchase is made from an ICE  account even when those funds are reimbursed by the agency that  actually receives the purchased product. However, the FPDS-NG  Government User\u2019s Manual specifically requires the identification of the  funding agency and distinguishes between the agency that makes the  payment and the agency that ultimately provides the funds for the  purchase. FPDS-NG guidance also clarifies that when one agency buys  on behalf of another, the agency that is requiring the purchase should be  recorded as the funding agency, not the payment office.", "Because ICE recorded other agencies\u2019 purchases as its own in the  publicly-available data, it significantly inflated the apparent dollar value of  its firearms and ammunition purchases. As a result of ICE not accurately  recording the correct funding agency information in FPDS-NG, the public  does not have accurate information on the value of firearms and  ammunition purchases made by ICE, and the agencies that make purchases using ICE contracting services. As we have previously  reported, data need to be presented in a way that meets the needs of the  end users\u2014both policy makers and the public\u2014if USASpending.gov is to  fulfill its purpose of increasing accountability and transparency in federal  spending.

Forest Service officials  explained that the publicly-reported data includes ammunition purchased  for non-law enforcement purposes\u2014such as protecting Forest Service  employees from wildlife attacks, controlling invasive species, or  euthanizing injured animals\u2014and those purchases were excluded from  the data that they provided to us because the scope of this review  focuses on purchases for FLEOs.", "The type and amount of information recorded in the publicly-available  data also contribute to discrepancies between agency-provided and publicly-available purchase records. As a result, the publicly-available  data may comply with the data reporting requirements enumerated in the  FAR and in the FPDS-NG Government User\u2019s Manual and still differ from  the agency-provided data.

According to the  FPDS-NG Government User\u2019s Manual, the PSC selected for a  purchase should reflect the items that constitute \u201cthe predominance of  the dollars obligated,\u201d and only one PSC may be associated with a  purchase. Therefore, when a purchase is assigned a firearms or  ammunition PSC, but the purchase includes non-firearms or non- ammunition items as well, the total obligated amount of the purchase  will be associated only with the selected PSC in the publicly-available  data. This may result in over- or under-reporting the value of the  obligations for firearms or ammunition purchases. For example, in  fiscal year 2014, BIA purchased 103 shotguns, 220 tactical lights, and  other equipment in a single transaction. The total value of the  obligation was $145,970, of which the shotguns constituted 50.4  percent of the purchase ($73,549). Consistent with FPDS-NG  guidance, the entire purchase was categorized as \u201cGuns, through  30mm\u201d in the publicly-available data, even though almost half of the  purchase was for non-firearms items, thereby over-reporting the  obligated value of the firearms purchased\u2014in this case, effectively  doubling the apparent obligated value of the firearms purchased while  omitting the obligated value of the non-firearms items that were part of  the purchase. Conversely, a purchase categorized as \u201cOptical  Sighting and Ranging Equipment\u201d obligated for $2,971 included a line  item for $500 of ammunition. BIA included the $500 ammunition  purchase in the data provided to us, but that amount was included  under the equipment PSC in the publicly-available data in keeping  with FPDS-NG guidance. This excluded the purchase from the  publicly-available data that we reviewed and under-reported the  obligated value of ammunition purchases by BIA.", "The available PSCs in the publicly-available data do not distinguish  between firearm parts and fully functional firearms. Several purchases  associated with firearms PSCs included descriptive information  indicating that the purchase was for firearms parts. ICE officials also  confirmed that an order described as firearm \u201cparts\u201d could include fully  functional firearms. The officials noted that whether a particular  purchase included fully functional firearms, firearms parts, or both  cannot be determined without the statement of work, and the  statement of work is not part of the publicly-available data. By  including purchases of both fully functional firearms and firearm parts  in the same category, publicly-available data may inflate the obligated  value of functional firearms purchases.", "Firearms and ammunition purchases may not be assigned a related  PSC in the publicly-available data. In cases where agencies assigned  a non-firearms or ammunition PSC to a firearms or ammunition  purchase, those purchases were excluded from the publicly-reported  data that we analyzed. For example, a Forest Service purchase of  rifles and sights which obligated $50,799 was assigned a PSC for  \u201cAssemblies Interchangeable Between Weapons In Two or More  Classes\u201d in the public data, rather than a firearms- or ammunition- specific PSC. Another Forest Service purchase for rifles which  obligated $23,457 was assigned a PSC for \u201cR&D-Defense System:  Weapons (Basic Research).\u201d", "Agencies are not required to report purchases of $3,500 or less to  FPDS-NG. Because purchases of $3,500 or less generally are not  required to be reported to FPDS-NG, these purchases may be  reported inconsistently or not at all in the publicly-available data.  Ammunition is often purchased by the selected agencies in small  quantities and may cost $3,500 or less. For example, Forest Service  officials noted that such small ammunition purchases may be made  using a purchase card, and their internal data included at least 130  such purchases.", "In addition, the publicly-available data do not include a field for agencies  to report quantity information associated with purchases. Therefore, the  number of firearms or rounds of ammunition that an agency purchased  are not available in the publicly-available purchase data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HHS, EPA, and IRS Reported Varying Levels of Inventories of Firearms, Corresponding Ammunition and Limited Tactical Equipment", "paragraphs": ["HHS, EPA, and IRS law enforcement components, our case studies, in  total reported inventories of five types of firearms\u2014all with corresponding  types of ammunition\u2014and nine types of tactical equipment. According  to officials in all components, their inventories of these items can be  attributed to a variety of factors, including the missions and  responsibilities of their FLEOs, the number of FLEOs, and the office\u2019s  schedule for disposing of and acquiring inventory. Table 4 summarizes  the types and quantities of firearms, ammunition, and tactical equipment  reported at case study components as of November 2017. For  additional information on case study components, see appendix II.", "Firearms. The numbers and types of firearms the components in our  review reported having in their inventories varied. As of November 2017,  all components reported inventories of pistols and shotguns, five  components reported rifles, and three reported fully automatic firearms.  Officials noted that they make decisions about what to have in their  inventories based on factors such as their number of FLEOs and mission  needs. All components issued pistols to FLEOs to carry, in accordance  with their statutory authority. Officials stated that these firearms are to be  carried on duty so FLEOs are prepared for potentially dangerous  circumstances, such as serving warrants on armed individuals. Similarly,  qualified FLEOs in all components can temporarily carry rifles or shotguns  in anticipation of, or in response to, high-risk situations, such as active  shooter threats or arrests of suspects who are believed to be dangerous.", "We found that components had more pistols per FLEO than shotguns or  rifles per FLEO, which reflects components\u2019 preferences to issue pistols  to officers as their duty weapons. For example, six components reported  having roughly a 2 to1 or 3 to 1 pistol-to-officer ratio, while EPA OIG  agents had a 5 to1 ratio. Case study components generally reported  having more pistols than FLEOs because every FLEO is assigned at least  one pistol. On the other hand, six components reported having about 1  shotgun or fewer per every two FLEOs. However, EPA Office of  Enforcement and Compliance Assurance (OECA) had a 1.4 to 1 shotgun- to-FLEO ratio. According to EPA OECA officials, their shotgun-to-agent  ratio is higher than other agencies because of two factors: 1) EPA OECA  historically had more agents, which made their shotgun-to-agent ratios  lower than when they acquired the shotguns in use today, and 2) EPA  OECA sends additional unassigned shotguns to natural disaster response  locations to pre-position them for EPA OECA agent use. Components in  the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and IRS reported keeping a  relatively smaller number of shotguns, which they said they only deploy  for high-risk investigations. Among the five components with rifles, rifle-to- FLEO ratios ranged widely\u2014from less than 1 to 10 to 6 to 10 \u2014due to  differences in the number of FLEOs and mission needs. For example,  officials with IRS Police, which had four rifles for nine officers, stated that  they only use the rifles for continuity of operations drills and annual  qualifications.", "Ammunition. As of November 2017, case study components reported  inventories of ammunition ranging from 14,706, in the case of the IRS  Police, to approximately 5 million rounds held by IRS CI. (See table 4  for all components\u2019 inventories of ammunition.) Each law enforcement  agency independently decides how much ammunition to allocate to its  firearm-carrying personnel for training and qualification. Component  officials noted that ammunition inventories constantly fluctuate throughout  the year, based on factors such as the amount used for qualification and  training purposes, and the timing of ammunition shipments. Officials from all components stated that their ammunition inventories can quickly  change by thousands of rounds depending on training and qualification  timing. For example, according to NIH officials, between November 2017  and February 2018, officers used 5,110 rounds of rifle ammunition during  training, and subsequently NIH acquired 14,400 rounds of rifle  ammunition. To help ensure they have sufficient ammunition on hand to  support the training and operational needs of their FLEOs, components  may maintain inventories of ammunition to last for several months. The  length of time between ordering and receiving ammunition orders can be  lengthy, sometimes up to 1 year, according to officials. Therefore,  components order ammunition in large quantities to ensure there is  enough available for training and qualification purposes.", "Tactical Equipment. Six case study components reported inventories of  9 of the 18 types of tactical equipment reviewed. Breaching equipment  and aiming devices were the most frequently reported kinds of tactical  equipment at these six components: four components reported breaching  equipment and four reported aiming devices in inventories. Three  components reported other equipment. EPA OIG reported inventories of  silencers and tactical lighting; however, in February 2018 EPA OIG  officials told us they began to transfer their silencers to another federal  agency because officials decided that they were no longer necessary to  meet their mission. Among the agencies in our review, NIH reported  having pyrotechnics and large-caliber launchers. NIH officials said these  items were necessary for assisting other law enforcement agencies in the  event that extreme circumstances, such as a terrorist attack or riot,  occurred in the area."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Case Study Components\u2019 Inventory Controls Vary and Selected Offices Generally Followed Their Own Procedures", "paragraphs": ["HHS, IRS, and EPA case study components have inventory controls in  place for firearms, ammunition, and tactical equipment.

Through our  observations, we found these components are generally following their  inventory and security procedures at selected locations. According to  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government, agencies  should design control activities to respond to risks related to vulnerable  assets. To ensure these controls operate effectively, management can  take steps such as periodically counting and comparing such assets to  control records, and establishing physical control to secure and safeguard  vulnerable assets. Other examples of these controls include security for  and limited access to assets, such as equipment that might be vulnerable  to risk of loss or unauthorized use. In addition, we have identified areas  that have been consistently recognized as important for effective  inventory management that align with these controls. These areas  include recording and tracking firearms inventory data and maintaining,  controlling, and accounting for firearms inventories, among other things.", "Firearms Tracking. At each of these components, firearms are  considered sensitive items and are tracked in electronic data systems or  using paper records. At HHS OIG, there is a separate firearms tracking  system, and other components track firearms in their overall property  management system. A barcode or serial number is used to track the  firearm through the life-cycle of the weapon\u2014which includes initial  assignment, changes in assignment (to a different agent or to storage),  and weapon disposal. According to each component\u2019s policy, every  firearm has a bar code or serial number associated with it, and each  firearm is assigned to an agent or placed in storage. When an agency  receives a firearm, the serial number or bar code is entered into the  agency\u2019s firearms inventory system and upon assignment to an agent  updated with the agent\u2019s name. Typically, firearms in storage are  assigned to the primary firearms instructor or the firearms coordinator in  the inventory system to ensure accountability. At all case study  components the primary firearms instructors and firearms coordinators  are the persons responsible for managing the firearms inventory of an  office and ensuring firearms are properly tracked\u2014these are considered  ancillary duties for these individuals, in addition to their regular  responsibilities as FLEOs. We observed demonstrations or  documentation of these tracking records at each office we visited and  found them to be generally in accordance with office policies.", "Firearms Verification. Each component has a process whereby at least  once a year officials conduct a firearms inventory to ensure that issued  and stored firearms match with records in the office\u2019s inventory tracking  system. Figure 7 describes a general process that all components we  reviewed follow to verify their firearms inventory. Five components we  examined require this annual firearms inventory process to be conducted  in person and entail the visual inspection of the serial number and  condition of the firearm. However, FDA and EPA OECA FLEOs are  permitted to send an email containing their firearm serial number, a photo  of the firearm, or both to the official conducting the inventory to virtually  verify they are in possession of their firearm. Officials stated that this  saved them the expense of FLEOs in remote locations traveling for  annual inventory checks.", "In addition to regularly verifying inventories of their firearms, five case  study components conduct periodic checks to verify the accuracy of  firearm inventory data. During these checks, headquarters or other  inspection officials review data recorded about inventories, storage  controls, and proper maintenance of weapons. For example, IRS CI and  HHS OIG conduct regular internal reviews of firearms inventories and  records that they use to identify data errors and make recommendations  to improve data quality. We found that recent checks at the case study  components have rarely identified issues related to recorded firearms  data, and the majority of the identified issues were related to minor data  errors, such as incorrectly recorded assignments of guns to FLEOs,  locations of guns, and serial numbers. For example, in May 2017 EPA  OECA\u2019s check of one area office found two firearms listed as being in  storage were actually in service. All components with these administrative  errors corrected them as they became aware of them, according to the  audit reports and agency officials.", "However, during our review of EPA OIG inventory control practices for  firearms, we found that EPA OIG headquarters did not have a  management review process in place for firearms inventory, which  contributed to examples of inaccurate firearms inventory data.  Specifically, we found 6 out of the 12 EPA OIG offices reported  inventories with at least one firearm that did not match the location and  individual to which it was assigned. For example, we found that the  Special Agent in Charge at one EPA OIG\u2019s field office verified that 10  firearms were physically in the office when actually they had been  shipped to headquarters 11 months prior to the inventory date. According  to EPA OIG officials, the errors we found were largely due to EPA OIG  headquarters not updating records when agents transferred firearms from  one office to another. As a result of our review, headquarters is  implementing practices to improve future data quality. Specifically, EPA  OIG officials said they reconciled their inventory data and had field offices  with inaccurate inventories prepare memos to reflect their actual  inventories. EPA OIG also updated firearms procedures to include  headquarters increased oversight of firearms audits and inspections. In  practice, EPA OIG officials stated that this will entail an annual reconciling  of inventory memos sent by field offices with inventory data records  maintained at EPA OIG headquarters. Thus, EPA OIG can more reliably  track the location and agents responsible for firearms, ensuring proper  weapons control procedures and accountability.", "Firearms Storage. All case study components had policies in place that  required secure storage of firearms. All seven components\u2019 policies  specify that this must include a locked container, such as a file cabinet or  desk safe for issued firearms or a firearm vault or safe for unissued  firearms. In all 12 of the components\u2019 offices we visited, we observed  unissued firearms stored in a designated room that was kept locked with  limited access. Specifically, we observed firearms storage rooms secured  by keycard access, alarms, cameras, and other security devices. At all of  the components\u2019 offices we visited, only FLEOs with a need to enter the  rooms had authorization to do so. For example, only FLEOs in  management roles and firearms instructors had access to the firearms  storage room at the IRS CI and HHS OIG offices we visited, according to  officials at each.", "In the secure firearms storage rooms at all of the locations we visited, we  observed firearms that were further protected by cabinets, cages, safes,  vaults, or combinations of these devices. We also observed some  instances of firearms being stored securely in safes outside of the  designated firearms storage room. For example, two EPA OIG and OECA  offices we visited had spare shotguns and related equipment in biometric  safes in offices to be used in response to active shooter threats. Qualified  FLEOs in these two offices can use their fingerprints to open the safes  and respond to such threats.", "Based on our observations, the offices we visited for the six components  were in compliance with their firearms storage policies. However, we  found the IRS Police office in Martinsburg to be out of compliance with  policy that limits access to stored firearms to the armorer and chief of  security and its policy that restricts storage in locked cabinets to five  firearms. Based on our finding, IRS Police officials said they will update  their policy to reflect its current practice of allowing all IRS Police officers  access to stored firearms to respond to active shooter threats and  acquired an additional safe to store firearms in June 2018. For each of  the components we examined in our review, there were no instances of  firearms being lost or stolen from any office, according to component data  and officials."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Case Study Components Vary in Their Controls Over Ammunition and Tactical Equipment", "paragraphs": ["All 12 offices for case study components that we visited were in  compliance with their ammunition and tactical equipment inventory  controls and procedures. All components had policies to treat ammunition  and equipment as items with some level of control, though the specific  controls varied by component.", "Ammunition. At the components\u2019 offices we visited, we observed various  methods for tracking ammunition inventories, such as electronic logs,  physical logs, or visual inspection. In general, case study components\u2019  policies require ammunition tracking through an ammunition log updated  as ammunition is used, a regular inventory, or both. Components track  ammunition to ensure they have enough on hand for training and  qualifications, according to component officials. Some components,  such as EPA OIG, maintain tight controls over their ammunition use by  tracking ammunition use by lot number and the number of bullets used by  each gun in physical logs. EPA OIG officials stated that they used this  level of precision for three reasons: to track how many bullets are fired  through each firearm for maintenance purposes, to quickly identify  ammunition in inventory that may be affected by recalls, and to have a  high degree of accountability. HHS OIG tracks ammunition using an  electronic log, which they said they update whenever ammunition is  removed for training and qualifications. IRS CI currently limits access to  ammunition and entrusts use of force coordinators with independently  managing their ammunition inventory to meet the training needs of their  area of responsibility. One IRS CI use of force coordinator said that she  relies on her experience and judgment to keep track of ammunition use at  her field office without formally recording it. IRS CI is the only component  in our review that does not have a documented policy to track ammunition  or conduct a regular inventory; however, IRS CI officials indicated they  are in the process of establishing a nationwide policy to track ammunition  and conduct a regular ammunition inventory. Officials at two case study  component offices said they provide their FLEOs extra boxes of  ammunition to use for practice at a firing range outside of work hours. In  general, four of the seven case study components did not track the real- time amount of ammunition they had on hand; rather, component officials  said they had a general sense of the amount of ammunition in order to  know if they had enough for training and qualifications, and when they  would need to reorder ammunition.", "All case study components\u2019 policies require secure storage of  ammunition. In all 12 of the components\u2019 offices we visited, we observed  that ammunition was stored in their firearms storage rooms, and all  offices took the additional step of securing the ammunition further in  locked safes. For example, IRS CI requires ammunition storage in a  security cabinet or a security room, preferably separately from firearms.  Both of the IRS CI offices that we observed stored ammunition separately  from firearms and with limited access. In the offices for two components,  NIH and HHS OIG, we observed ammunition secured in a separate room  from the firearms.", "Tactical equipment. Case study components do not control the tactical  equipment in their inventory in the same ways that they control firearms  and ammunition. Case study components that possessed aiming,  breaching, and tactical lighting equipment did not have policies guiding  their storage because they do not generally consider them to be as  dangerous as a firearm or valuable enough to be tracked. However,  components that possessed silencers, large-caliber launchers,  pyrotechnics, or other items did have policies to control these items.  Specifically, IRS CI policy requires the electronic tracking and inventory of  night-vision equipment, optical equipment, and vehicles. NIH policy  directs that large-caliber gas launchers be stored in the armory and  pyrotechnics be stored in their bunker with ammunition. IRS CI, NIH, and  EPA OIG all tracked this equipment during their annual inventory  verification. Case study components did not report any instances of loss  or theft of the tactical equipment in their inventories.", "Storage of tactical equipment varied and corresponded with case study  components\u2019 use of items. For example, we observed silencers and  aiming devices stored on or near firearms at EPA OIG and NIH because  they are accessories that attach to firearms. We observed breaching  equipment to be stored either in the firearms storage room, vehicles, or  elsewhere in the offices we visited. For example, at EPA OIG\u2019s  headquarters office, breaching equipment was stored in the firearms  room because officials stated that they were only likely to use breaching  equipment as part of a planned operation.

However, ICE did not properly identify the  funding agency in FPDS-NG for purchases where other DHS agencies  used ICE contracts to procure firearms and ammunition. This inflated its  publicly-available data to show a significantly higher obligated dollar value  of purchases than it actually purchased. Because ICE does not accurately  report the agency that funded the purchase to FPDS-NG, the public does  not have accurate information on how much ICE and the agencies that  make purchases using ICE procurement services have obligated for  firearms and ammunition.

To what extent have selected agencies accurately reported purchases  of firearms and ammunition in publicly-available data on  USASpending.gov?  3.  What types and quantities of firearms, ammunition, and selected  tactical equipment do the Department of Health and Human Services  (HHS), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Internal  Revenue Service (IRS) have documented to be in their inventory  systems, as of November 2017?  4.  What inventory controls and procedures are in place at HHS, EPA,  and IRS, and to what extent do these agencies follow these  procedures at selected locations?", "This report is the public version of a sensitive report that we issued in  October 2018. HHS, IRS and the Transportation Security Administration  (TSA) deemed some of the information in our October report to be  sensitive, which must be protected from public disclosure.

Although the  information provided in this report is more limited, the report addresses  the same objectives as the sensitive report and uses the same  methodology.", "To address our first question, we obtained available spending data on  firearms, ammunition, and certain tactical equipment from 20 agencies  from the departments named in the Chief Financial Officers Act that  employed 250 or more federal law enforcement officers (FLEOs) at any  point from fiscal years 2010 through 2017. Specifically, we identified  applicable agencies by reviewing Office of Personnel Management  employment data and contacting agency officials to verify the  employment of 250 or more FLEOs during the timeframe we reviewed.  We excluded military branches from our review, such as all Department of  Defense (DOD) branches and the U.S. Coast Guard, which is part of the  Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Table 5 shows the 20  agencies, within eight departments, included in our scope for this  question.", "Because there was no definitive list of what is considered tactical  equipment, we developed a list of equipment to include in our review. To  do so, we reviewed the National Firearms Act List, the Law Enforcement  Equipment Working Group Recommendations, the DOD\u2019s list of  Controlled Property, and the Special Weapons and Tactics Gear used by  the New York, Los Angeles and Houston police departments. We then  selected and categorized the tactical equipment that appeared in two or  more of these lists to include in our review. The 18 categories of tactical  equipment we created were: (1) silencers, (2) explosive devices, (3)  large-caliber weapons (>.50 caliber, excluding shotguns), (4) armored  vehicles, (5) weaponized aircraft, vessels, or vehicles, (6) camouflage  uniforms, (7) manned aircraft, (8) unmanned aerial vehicles, (9) tactical  vehicles, (10) command and control vehicles, (11) pyrotechnics and  specialized munitions, (12) breaching apparatus, (13) riot batons, (14) riot  helmets, (15) riot shields, (16) tactical lighting (excludes basic flashlights),  (17) specialized image enhancement devices (such as thermal imaging  devices and night vision gear), and (18) aiming devices (such as scopes  and tripods). To more closely describe the types of equipment frequently  reported in the large-caliber weapons and breaching apparatus  categories, we refer to them in the report as large-caliber launchers and  breaching equipment, respectively.", "To collect data from the 20 agencies within the scope of our review for  this objective, we developed a data collection instrument that requested  spending data of firearms, ammunition, and selected tactical equipment  from agencies\u2019 internal record-keeping systems from fiscal years 2010  through 2017. For this objective, we requested the types of information  that agencies reported using the data collection instrument: the date of  each purchase; descriptive information on what was bought, including the  caliber or gauge of firearms and ammunition; the quantity of items bought;  the amount spent and whether those amounts were estimates; the type of  record-keeping system used by the agency and any limitations associated  with it or challenges compiling the information we requested; descriptions  of changes or updates to the system that may have affected the data; and  the contracting office(s) that were responsible for buying these items for  the agency. We asked agencies not to include data on any items they  received without spending funds, so agencies may have received more  firearms, ammunition, or equipment in their inventories than what they  reported in their spending data. For example, agencies may have  received these items through interagency transfers, which may have no  cost to receiving agencies.", "For the first objective, we analyzed the data agencies reported in the  \u201camount spent\u201d column, and we use the terms \u201cspending\u201d and \u201cspent\u201d to  refer to these data. In cases where agencies only reported the amount  they obligated for a purchase on the data collection instrument, we  confirmed with agencies that those amounts reflected the amount they  spent on the purchase and that we could use those amounts in our  analysis. We pre-tested the instrument with Veterans Health  Administration and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE),  whose officials provided feedback on the feasibility of providing the  requested data. Based on the feedback we received from the pre-test, we  revised and finalized the instrument and requested that the 20 agencies  provide spending data on firearms, ammunition, and tactical equipment  from fiscal years 2010 through 2017 from their internal record-keeping  systems.", "To assess the reliability of the spending data, we conducted tests for  missing data and obvious errors, reviewed relevant documentation,  interviewed agency officials about their spending records and data  reporting practices, and followed up with agency officials as needed. We  re-categorized agency data that appeared to be miscoded. For example,  we received data on specialized munitions and large-caliber launchers  that agencies categorized as ammunition and firearms, respectively.  Based on the descriptive data that agencies had provided, we re- categorized those items. We also adjusted the data to ensure consistency  in their format, such as consistent entry of dates and use of categories of  tactical equipment. Agencies in our review submitted a range of detail  about their firearms when reporting their data, and we could not  determine to what extent firearms were fully automatic. Some firearms  have selector switches that allow the user to switch between semiautomatic and fully-automatic capabilities, while others are limited to  shooting three-round bursts with each pull of the trigger. As such, we  reported all firearms that are capable of firing multiple rounds with the  single pull of the trigger as fully-automatic firearms. We also combined  ammunition intended for use in machine guns with rifle ammunition  because machine guns shoot rifle-caliber ammunition, and we did not  have confidence that every agency accurately distinguished which rifle- caliber ammunition was intended for use in machine guns and what was  reserved for rifles.", "We found the data sufficiently reliable for the purpose of reporting the  minimum thresholds of total amounts agencies spent and the numbers of  firearms and rounds of ammunition they purchased during fiscal years  2010 through 2017. However, we found the data were not reliable for  reporting the number of tactical equipment items purchased or reporting  further comparative analysis. Agency officials reported various challenges  in compiling the data we requested and we identified some data  limitations, as described in table 6.", "To address our second question, we selected three agencies\u2014the  Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), the U.S. Forest Service, and the U.S.  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)\u2014to assess the extent to  which their purchases of firearms and ammunition were accurately  reflected in publicly-available data. We requested that agencies report  internal purchase data for firearms and ammunition that included, among  other things, the amount obligated for these items, a unique transaction  identifier (called the Procurement Instrument Identifier), and the product  or service code for firearms and ammunition purchases from fiscal years  2010 through 2017. We compared the amounts these three agencies  obligated for firearms and ammunition purchases, as reported to us in  their data collection instruments, with the obligation data that are publicly- available data on USASpending.gov for those three agencies. We  obtained publicly-available data from USASpending.gov, which includes  purchase data from the Federal Procurement Data System-Next  Generation (FPDS-NG), using product or service codes (PSC) that identify contracts for firearms or ammunition purchases. We also  reviewed our related work and Inspector General reports on the quality of  USASpending.gov data. We obtained records for purchases made in  fiscal years 2010 through 2017. We did not include equipment purchases  because the publicly-available data lack product or service codes that  would allow us to reliably identify those records.", "To select the three agencies for inclusion in this analysis, we started with  the 20 agencies with at least 250 FLEOs in our scope. From those, we  selected agencies that provided us with records of their firearms and  ammunition purchases and that USASpending.gov listed as the funding  agency for one or more firearms or ammunition purchase (12 agencies).

Within IRS, two offices employ FLEOs:  Criminal Investigation (CI) and Police Officer Section (Police).  Accordingly, we can draw conclusions only about these components.", "We obtained and analyzed inventory data and other available  documentation provided by these components regarding their current  inventory as of November 2017 of firearms, ammunition, and tactical  equipment. This included firearms in storage as well as those in FLEO  possession. To assess the reliability of the inventory data, we reviewed  components\u2019 documentation related to data management, especially  policies to ensure that items are properly entered and removed from the  system. In addition, we reviewed components\u2019 recent purchases to verify  that purchases were inventoried and reviewed their purchase data for any  limitations that may affect their quality. We reviewed components\u2019  acquisitions through DOD\u2019s excess property program, known as the Law  Enforcement Support Office (LESO) or 1033 program, to ensure these  items were inventoried. We did not conduct physical inventories during  site visits, and therefore did not actually count components\u2019 physical  inventories.", "To examine these components\u2019 firearms, ammunition, and tactical  equipment inventory controls, we reviewed their policies describing  storage protocols and inventory control procedures, and we interviewed  components\u2019 officials to better understand these policies and procedures  in practice. We also compared these policies with applicable Standards  for Internal Control in the Federal Government and key areas that we  have identified as important for effective inventory management. We  reviewed internal and external inspection and Inspector General reports  related to the controls over firearms, ammunition, and tactical equipment  at these components to identify any reported deficiencies and actions  taken or planned to address those deficiencies.", "We also conducted site visits to components\u2019 offices selected based on a  variety of factors, including the number of agencies with component  offices in each city we visited, data discrepancies at field offices, and  reports of loss or theft at these offices. The IRS Police facility we visited in  Martinsburg, West Virginia is the only location for this component. In all,  we visited 12 offices. During site visits, we observed officials  demonstrating inventory inspection, inventory data entry, and access and  other security controls. In addition, we interviewed officials responsible for  maintaining and inventorying firearms, ammunition, and certain tactical  equipment. The observations and information we obtained from the  offices visited cannot be generalized to other locations for these  components, but provide insights about the components\u2019 controls for  firearms, ammunition, and tactical equipment.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2017 to October 2018 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives.
