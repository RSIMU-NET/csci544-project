At that time, most utilities served high-density areas and did not extend lines to farmers and other rural residents. In 1936, REA was given the statutory authority to operate the electricity loan program, and in 1939, REA became part of USDA. In 1949, REA was authorized to lend funds for telephone services in rural areas.", "In recent years, RUS has made or guaranteed an average of about $1.4 billion per year in loans to help borrowers develop, upgrade, or expand their electricity and telecommunications systems.

Hardship rate loans have a 5-percent interest rate. Generally, municipal rate loans are made to qualified borrowers that do not meet the criteria for hardship rate loans. Municipal rate loans have an interest rate that is tied to an index of municipal bond rates; the rate can change quarterly.", "All electricity loans on which RUS has provided repayment guarantees in recent years have been made by the Treasury\u2019s Federal Financing Bank (FFB). These loans have an interest rate equal to the Treasury\u2019s cost of money plus one-eighth of 1 percent.

Eighty-six percent of the borrowers had a generally favorable debt-to-asset ratio of 70 percent or less, including 7 percent whose ratio was no more than 40 percent. The TIER shows the extent to which a borrower can pay its annual interest expenses from its net income.

We did not quantify the portion of this estimated cost that relates to interest rate subsidies and the portion that relates to default costs, fees, and other costs. However, hardship rate loans in both programs are made at interest rates that are less than RUS\u2019 cost of acquiring funds from the Treasury. The interest rates on municipal rate loans are based on the rates in effect for municipal obligations of similar maturities; the rates on these loans are also less than RUS\u2019 cost of borrowing.

All advances on hardship rate loans bear interest at 5 percent. However, each advance on municipal rate loans bears interest at a rate based on an index of municipal bond rates, which can change each calendar quarter. At the beginning of each quarter, RUS publishes a schedule of the interest rates applicable to advances taken during the quarter. A borrower may take up to eight separate advances of funds on an approved municipal rate loan. For each advance, the borrower selects an interest rate term, which is the period of time used to determine the interest rate. The minimum interest rate term is 1 year, and the maximum is the number of years corresponding to the final maturity date of the loan.", "By selecting shorter interest rate terms, borrowers can obtain interest rates on advances for municipal rate loans that are less than 5 percent. As a result, a borrower with a municipal rate loan can borrow at a lower cost than can a borrower with a hardship rate loan. Specifically, interest rates of less than 5 percent were available on advances for municipal rate loans in 14 of the 15 quarters between January 1, 1994, and September 30, 1997. The lowest rate available in the 15th quarter was 5 percent. As table 4 shows, the interest rates in effect for July 1, 1997, through September 30, 1997, included a range of 3.875 percent for a 1-year interest rate term to 4.875 percent for a 9-year interest rate term.", "At the end of the interest rate term selected by the borrower for each advance, the borrower has the option of repaying the remaining portion of the advance or rolling it over for a new interest rate term. If the borrower rolls over the remaining amount, depending on the interest rates in effect at that time, the borrower may again obtain an interest rate of less than 5 percent by selecting another short term. However, the borrower runs the risk that interest rates may have increased from the rate initially selected.", "Many borrowers that took advances on municipal rate loans obtained interest rates of less than 5 percent. Specifically, 115 borrowers took a total of 210 advances with interest rates of less than 5 percent on municipal rate loans approved during fiscal years 1994 through June 30, 1997. The total amount of these advances was $242 million. For example, a borrower with about 29,500 customers had $25.1 million in equity at the end of 1994. In February 1995, RUS approved a $24.7 million loan, and in August 1995, the borrower took a $12.4 million advance.

This change became effective on October 6, 1997.", "RUS officials in both programs told us that they had not set limits for the other loan types\u2014all electricity loans and guaranteed telecommunications loans\u2014or limits on the amount of debt that a borrower can accumulate because the RE Act does not require limits. Electricity program officials added that they believe they need to be able to provide an applicant with the level of funds needed to support the proposed project.", "The general lack of loan limits has allowed RUS to make large-dollar loans to some borrowers. Specifically, while most electricity loans approved during fiscal years 1994 through June 30, 1997, were for less than $10 million, a total of 77 loans, or about 14 percent of the loans, were for $10 million or more. These 77 loans totaled about $1.6 billion, or 51.7 percent of the amount for all loans approved during the period. Similarly, while most telecommunications loans were made for less than $10 million, a total of 36 loans, or about 9.2 percent, were for $10 million or more. These 36 loans totaled about $653 million, or 36.5 percent of the amount for all loans approved during the period. (App. II provides detailed information on loans to borrowers by loan size.)", "In addition to the general absence of limits on individual loans, borrowers do not have any limits on the total amount of debt that they can accumulate through multiple loans. As a result, some borrowers owe a high dollar amount of outstanding principal. For example, 128 borrowers with outstanding direct loans in the electricity program as of June 30, 1997, each owed more than $20 million; one owed about $122 million. In the telecommunications program, 38 borrowers with outstanding direct loans each owed more than $20 million; one owed over $100 million.", "Loan and debt limits exist in some, but not all, of USDA\u2019s rural credit programs.

The act also requires that the guarantee be 100 percent. As of June 30, 1997, RUS had about $19.8 billion in guaranteed loan debt on which it has full risk exposure. Almost $14 billion of this amount was outstanding principal on original loans with RUS guarantees, and about $5.8 billion was on restructured loans. The lenders that made the loans\u2014the FFB and a few commercial lenders\u2014have no risk exposure. Providing a guarantee of less than 100 percent could reduce RUS\u2019 vulnerability to losses from these two credit programs. However, because all guaranteed loans in recent years have been made by the FFB, the risk to the federal government as a whole would not be reduced if the FFB continues to be the sole source of loan funds.", "According to FFB officials, providing a guarantee of less than 100 percent could cause the FFB to stop making electricity and telecommunications loans because it only participates in lending programs when there is full security on its loans. Even if the guarantee remains unchanged, however, a provision in the recently enacted Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-33, Aug. 5, 1997) may affect the FFB\u2019s willingness to continue making loans to electricity and telecommunications borrowers. The act provides that the surcharge on FFB loans, which is one-eighth of 1 percent over the Treasury\u2019s cost of borrowing, is to be deposited in the RUS account held by the Treasury and used to finance the cost of these two loan programs. FFB officials told us that this surcharge has generally offset its administrative cost of participating in RUS\u2019 programs. The act also provides that the FFB can require RUS to reimburse it for the administrative expenses incurred that are attributable to the loans.", "All loans that received RUS\u2019 guarantees during fiscal years 1994 through June 30, 1997, were made by the FFB. While the RE Act gives the borrower the option of selecting the FFB or a commercial lender, RUS officials told us that borrowers have selected the FFB because it offers lower interest rates. According to FFB officials, some borrowers also turn to the FFB because the large amount of money they need is probably more than commercial lenders would provide. While this may be true, our analysis of guaranteed loans made by the FFB and commercial lenders showed that some commercial lenders provided large-dollar loans and that the FFB made a number of small-dollar loans that could have been funded by commercial lenders. For example, as of June 30, 1997, 10 power supply borrowers had outstanding guaranteed loans from commercial lenders that had been made before the start of fiscal year 1994\u2014six of these had received loans for more than $100 million each. In addition, even though the FFB is thought of as a high-dollar lender, RUS\u2019 records showed that 9 of the 36 electricity loans and 20 of the 29 telecommunications loans made by the FFB during fiscal years 1994 through June 30, 1997, were for less than $5 million.", "USDA has less risk exposure when guaranteeing loans in other rural credit programs, such as farm ownership and operations, single-family housing, community facilities, business and industry, and water and waste disposal loans.

Nonetheless, officials in both programs acknowledged that their regulations do not prohibit loans to delinquent borrowers or to those that have caused prior losses.", "On September 26, 1997, RUS published a change to its electricity loan regulations that, rather than denying loans to borrowers that have had debts written off, provides guidance on what such borrowers need to provide as a condition for obtaining another loan. RUS stated that in considering a loan request from a borrower whose debt had been settled, including debt written off, the borrower would be required to demonstrate evidence of financial support for the amount of the requested loan.

Furthermore, the interest rates for municipal rate loans and cost-of-money rate loans, if established in the electricity program, could be set no lower than the rate on a hardship rate loan. Finally, a test could be established to require a borrower to seek commercial credit as a condition for RUS\u2019 assistance.", "To assist in moving financially healthy borrowers with direct loans to the commercial sector, the Congress could have RUS establish a graduation program to require borrowers to attempt to have their outstanding direct loans refinanced by commercial credit sources.", "To limit the level of the agency\u2019s vulnerability to losses, the Congress could set limits on the total amount of money that RUS provides or guarantees on any one loan and on the total amount of outstanding debt that any one borrower can accumulate through a combination of loans.", "To further control RUS\u2019 vulnerability to losses on guaranteed loans, the Congress could set the repayment provision at less than 100 percent.", "To ensure that RUS does not increase its vulnerability to losses by making loans to certain risky borrowers, the Congress could provide guidance specifying that a borrower is ineligible for a direct or a guaranteed loan if the borrower is delinquent or if the borrower has caused RUS to incur a prior loan loss."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to USDA for its review and comment. In summary, USDA expressed concern over several of the options presented in the report, particularly those involving targeting loans, graduating borrowers, and limiting borrowers\u2019 loan and debt levels. In regard to targeting loans, USDA noted, among other things, that a borrower serving a combination of rural and nonrural customers is probably financially stronger than a borrower that does not serve a diverse customer base. We agree. Our point, however, is that some borrowers serve large numbers of customers, including some in nonrural areas, and that the Congress may want to target loans to borrowers who serve rural areas more exclusively. USDA\u2019s discomfort over options involving graduating borrowers and limiting borrowers\u2019 loan and debt levels reflects, in part, concern over possible detrimental impacts that these options may have on borrowers or their service to rural areas. It is difficult to predict the extent to which USDA\u2019s concerns would be realized if these options were to be put into effect. However, we believe that the possible impacts to service in rural areas should be considered in developing specific implementation plans for these or any other options that the Congress may choose to act upon.", "Overall, USDA\u2019s comments provide additional perspectives on issues discussed in the report and highlight the difficulties that face policymakers as they consider options for improving the effectiveness and efficiency while reducing the cost to the government of RUS\u2019 electricity and telecommunications loan programs.

The draft reviewed by USDA contained no GAO recommendations; rather, as requested by the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, it presented several options for congressional consideration and recognized that there would be tradeoffs for any option implemented. 2. Our report referenced the 7 U.S.C. 930 provision in a relatively narrowly focused discussion of how an applicant\u2019s financial health affects its eligibility to obtain RUS\u2019 loans. As a result, we had no reason to discuss the other parts of the provision that dealt with broader policy statements on the availability of RUS\u2019 loan funds. We therefore continue to believe that we cite the provision appropriately and that it indicates congressional intent that borrowers in both programs should be encouraged and assisted to use their own resources or seek credit through commercial sources to satisfy their needs. 3. We believe that changes in the composition of a borrower\u2019s service territory should be considered in determining an applicant\u2019s eligibility to participate in RUS\u2019 loan programs if the Congress is interested in targeting loans primarily to rural areas. We agree with the benefits of diversity cited by USDA\u2014that a combination of rural and nonrural customers reduces risk and contributes to financial health. Our point is that the Congress may want to consider clarifying the level at which RUS\u2019 loans are primarily benefiting nonrural rather than rural customers. 4. We appreciate USDA\u2019s concerns about the changing environment in which RUS\u2019 borrowers operate. We recognize in the report\u2019s discussion on the continuing vulnerability to loan losses that competition may affect borrowers. 5. RUS uses net margins to refer to the bottom-line income of its cooperative borrowers; we recognize RUS\u2019 use of this term in footnote 11 in the report. Rather than use this term, however, we use profits (net income), which is more widely recognized. Profits, or net margins, and losses, or deficits in net margins, are calculated in the same manner. That is, operating revenue less operating expenses plus or minus nonoperating income/expenses, other fixed charges (including interest expense), and other income statement adjustments. We also recognize that a cooperative\u2019s distribution of profits/margins to its members has the effect of reducing the rates that the members pay. 6. Our intention in providing information on customer populations was to show that some borrowers serve large populations\u2014a fact that USDA acknowledges in its response. While most RUS borrowers may be serving sparsely populated areas, as USDA points out, our purpose was to report on customer populations and identify instances in which borrowers appear to be serving areas that are not sparsely populated. Regarding the example of a telecommunications loan borrower, documentation in RUS\u2019 files stated that the loan was intended to benefit the borrower\u2019s entire service area\u2014not just its rural customers. 7. Our draft report did not suggest that customer size be a criterion for program eligibility. In fact, the report acknowledges that customer service statistics are only an indicator of population density, which, in our view, should be considered if the Congress wants to target program benefits to rural areas. 8. The draft reviewed by USDA did not discuss the extent to which borrowers invested their own funds or sought nonfederal financing. Rather, it discussed the levels of equity, profit, and various ratios for borrowers that obtained loans during calendar years 1994 through June 30, 1997. 9. The draft reviewed by the Department defines equity as total assets less total liabilities\u2014it did not state nor attempt to imply that equity is only cash. 10. We recognize that there is some judgment involved in determining benchmarks for financial ratios. This is why we presented data on the number of RUS\u2019 borrowers having debt-to-asset ratios of 70 percent or less as well as those having debt-to-asset ratios of no more than 40 percent. 11. We agree. As the draft reviewed by USDA stated, the current ratio is a measure that shows the extent to which a borrower has sufficient current assets to cover its current liabilities. As such, it is one measure of the financial health of borrowers. 12. The draft reviewed by USDA stated that the discounted prepayment amount is the present value of a borrower\u2019s outstanding debt. 13. The borrower we use as an example in the report is one of many borrowers that appear to be candidates for commercial lenders to refinance their outstanding direct loans. As the report states, about 39 percent of RUS\u2019 electricity and telecommunications borrowers had equity of $10 million or more at the end of 1996. In addition, about 36 percent made a profit of $1 million or more in 1996. 14. We appreciate USDA\u2019s concerns about requiring borrowers to refinance their direct loans with private sector financing during a time in which the environment that the borrowers operate in is changing. However, the fact is that some borrowers appear to have such highly favorable financial characteristics that we believe a graduation program is a logical step in terms of assisting them to move to private sector financing. 15. The draft reviewed by USDA recognized that the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and the Energy Policy Act of 1992 could have either positive or negative impacts on RUS\u2019 borrowers and on the quality of the agency\u2019s portfolio. This issue is covered in the discussion on the continuing vulnerability to loan losses. 16. We agree that the telecommunications loan program has been operated very successfully. The draft reviewed by USDA stated that there were no telecommunications loans written off during the period covered by our review and that no telecommunications loans were delinquent as of June 30, 1997. We have revised the report to reflect USDA\u2019s comment concerning the losses in the electricity loan program. 17. USDA states that it does not agree that loan limits will reduce RUS\u2019 vulnerability to loan losses. We believe that limits would reduce the agency\u2019s vulnerability because individual borrowers would be restricted to a maximum amount on any one loan and on the level of debt that they could accumulate through multiple loans. 18. The extent to which these problems occur would, of course, depend on how much of a limit was placed on loans and debt. These limits could be established with the intent of balancing consideration for minimizing risk as well as optimizing operational efficiency. 19. We do not agree with USDA that the September 1997 rule adequately addresses our concerns. The rule allows borrowers whose accounts are settled, including a write-off of debt, to obtain additional loans, rather than prohibiting such borrowers from being eligible for loans."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["In April 1997, we reported on the financial condition of RUS\u2019 multibillion-dollar portfolio of electricity and telecommunications loans.
