Reported carryover balances for fiscal years 2000 and 2001 were inaccurate and, therefore, the balances were not reliable for decision-making or budget review purposes. The reported carryover balances were not accurate due to (1) faulty assumptions used in calculating work-in-process and (2) records not accurately reflecting work that was actually completed by year-end. As a result, the amount of carryover reported by the Air Force was understated by tens of millions of dollars and customers' funds were idle that could have been used for other purposes during the fiscal year. Even though the carryover was understated, Air Force reports show that the contract portion of the depot maintenance activity group exceeded the 4.5-month carryover standard at the end of fiscal year 2000 and fiscal year 2001 by $44 million and $134 million, respectively.

Carryover consists of both the  unfinished portion of work started but not yet completed, as well as  requested work that has not yet commenced.  To manage carryover, DOD  converts the dollar amount of carryover to months of work.  This is done to  put the magnitude of the carryover in proper perspective.  For example, if  an activity group performs $100 million of work in a year and had  $100 million in carryover at year-end, it would have 12 months of carryover.   However, if another activity group performs $400 million of work in a year  and had $100 million in carryover at year-end, this group would have 3  months of carryover.", "A DOD regulation allows for some carryover at fiscal year-end to allow  working capital funds to operate efficiently and effectively.  In 1996, DOD  established a 3-month carryover standard for all the working capital fund  activities except for the contract portion of the Air Force depot  maintenance activity group.  The Air Force is the only military service that  includes its contract depot maintenance operation in its working capital  fund.  To reflect this difference, DOD established a 4.5-month carryover  standard to account for the additional administrative functions associated with awarding contracts.  In May 2001, we reported that DOD did not have  a basis for its carryover standard and recommended that Defense  determine the appropriate carryover standard for the depot maintenance,  ordnance, and research and development activity groups.  DOD is in the  process of assessing its carryover standards.  Too little carryover could  result in some depot maintenance activity not having work to perform at  the beginning of the fiscal year, resulting in the inefficient use of personnel.   On the other hand, too much carryover could result in an activity group  receiving funds from customers in one fiscal year but not performing the  work until well into the next fiscal year or subsequent years.  By  minimizing the amount of the carryover, DOD can use its resources most  effectively and minimize the \u201cbanking\u201d of funds for work and programs to  be performed in subsequent years."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Plans to Remove the Contract Portion of Depot Maintenance from the Working Capital Fund", "paragraphs": ["In February 2002, the Air Force began to consider financing the contract  portion of the depot maintenance activity group with direct appropriations.

Using its  formula, the Air Force reduced the amount of unfilled orders due to work- in-process by about $1 billion, which is 5.6 months, and $835 million, which  is 4.1 months, in fiscal year 2000 and fiscal year 2001, respectively, to  determine the amount of carryover for these 2 years.", "The amount of work-in-process recorded monthly is affected or is  determined by the nature of the work, the estimated/actual start date of the  work, and the expected time to complete the work.

Air Force officials told  us, and we agree, that a more accurate way to calculate work-in-process  would be to eliminate the assumption that the contractor will start work as  planned and base all work-in-process calculations on when the contractor  actually starts work.  The officials said making such a change to the  calculation would provide a financial incentive for contract depot  maintenance to ensure that data on when the work actually started is  entered into the system in a timely manner.  The incentive to do so stems  from the fact that contract depot maintenance bills customers based on the  work-in-process amount that is recorded in the production and cost  system.  If work-in-process is based on when the contractor actually starts  work, the depot maintenance activity group cannot bill customers until the  date that the work actually started is recorded in the system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Unfilled Order Data in the Production and Cost System Are Unreliable", "paragraphs": ["As previously discussed, because the air logistics centers use the  production and cost system to manage the work performed by contractors,  it is critical that the unfilled order data be entered into the system in an  accurate and timely manner.

For example, in one case, an order for  $3.6 million was not entered in the system for 7 months after the  contract was awarded.  In another case, an order for $802,000 was not  entered into the system for 20 months after the contract was awarded.   In both cases, the lack of production management specialist oversight  due to either heavy workload or inexperience was cited as the reason  for not entering the data in a timely manner.  Without the contract data  in the system, there was no information in the system for managing  repair actions and monitoring the status of the contracts.", "We found that (1) in some cases, the production management specialists  were not following the regulations regarding data accuracy, (2) in other  cases, the production management specialists did not know the correct  treatment for recording data accurately, and (3) standard operating  procedures for use by the production management specialists did not exist  to provide detailed instructions on their responsibilities for data accuracy.

The officials attributed this problem, in part, to the lack of clear  guidance and detailed operating procedures related to how the production  management specialists should go about performing their day-to-day  responsibilities.  The officials further told us that there is a lack of internal  controls or processes to ensure data accuracy, such as the use of metrics  that could act as \u201cred flags\u201d to alert management to possible data problems.   In discussing the data accuracy problem with Air Force headquarter  officials, they told us that a contributing factor was the disruption to  operations when the Air Force hired about 150 new production  management specialists in fiscal year 2000 because of the closing of two air  logistics centers and transferring the oversight of their contracts to the  remaining centers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "New System Effort Terminated", "paragraphs": ["Since 1996, the Air Force has recognized the need to improve the reliability  of the data in the production and cost system and, until February 2002, was  developing a new system, the Contract Maintenance Accounting and  Production System\u2014known as G501\u2014to accomplish this.

Specifically, we estimated that about $530 million of work was not  completed for two key reasons.  First, repairs took longer than planned  primarily because (1) parts needed to perform the repairs were not  available from DOD, (2) more work was needed to repair the assets than  originally planned by the Air Force, and (3) contractors had capacity  constraints related to personnel, facilities, and equipment.  Second, work  on some assets was not started as planned because of the delayed  induction of items into production at contractors\u2019 facilities.

The remaining five inventory  items\u2014which had an unfilled customer order value of about $2 million\u2014 were not received by the contractor until the third quarter of fiscal year  2001 and we, therefore, included $2 million in the delayed induction  category.", "One of the underlying causes of the activity group\u2019s induction problem is  that the Air Force Materiel Command has not established effective internal  control procedures to ensure that production management specialists are  complying with its policy guidance.  For example, Air Force Materiel  Command Instruction 21-113 states that, at a minimum, \u201creview of asset  generation should be done on a quarterly basis and, if assets will not  generate within a reasonable period of time (60 days), the scheduled input  quantities and obligated dollars must be reduced accordingly.\u201d  However,  our analysis showed and the Air Force Materiel Command agreed that  there is no systematic process or effective internal controls to ensure that  the production management specialists are complying with this guidance.   A second cause is that some of the guidance is inconsistent.  For example,  Air Force Materiel Command Instruction 21-113, \u201cContract Maintenance  Program for Depot Maintenance Activity Group (DMAG),\u201d states that work  must be started on at least one asset during the fiscal year that an order is  placed.  However, the Air Force Logistics Command supplement to Air  Force Regulation 170-8 states that the contract depot maintenance activity  group has until December 31 to get a customer\u2019s requirement in a contract  (January 31 for some requirements).  Accordingly, one regulation requires  work to be started on an asset before the fiscal year-end, but another  regulation does not even require that the contract be awarded until the end  of the calendar year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Activity Group Is Not Managing a Major Portion of Its Contract Workload", "paragraphs": ["As shown in table 2, we could not determine the cause of the problem for  about $191 million of unfilled orders that were scheduled to be completed  prior to September 30, 2000, but were not.  We could not make this  determination because production management specialists did not have  documentation on the status of the repairs needed to make this  determination.  The two primary reasons that information was not  available were that production management specialists (1) did not have  required documentation for many of the contracts that were transferred  from the Sacramento and San Antonio Air Logistics Centers to two of the  three remaining centers in October 2000 and (2) did not maintain  information on the status of software projects."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Inadequate Documentation on Transferred Contracts Prevents Effective Management", "paragraphs": ["In October 2000, the Sacramento and San Antonio Air Logistics Centers  discontinued their contract depot maintenance operations and  transferred management responsibility for their contracts to the three  remaining centers (Warner Robins, Oklahoma City, and Ogden).  As part of  this management transfer, the Sacramento and San Antonio centers  shipped contract files and related customer order files to the three centers  that assumed responsibility for the work.  However, in many instances, two  of the centers that assumed responsibility for the work either did not  receive the required files or received incomplete files.  Additionally, for the  files they did receive, they found numerous and significant discrepancies  between the information in the contract files and related customer files.   Discrepancies were also found between these manual records and the data  in the production and cost system.  As a result of these problems, two of  the three remaining centers have had to reconstruct many of the files and  reconcile numerous discrepancies.  Because the Air Force does not know  the status of these contracts, (1) it is potentially vulnerable to paying for  goods and services not received or performed and is subject to fraud,  waste, and abuse, (2) work may have been accomplished but not recorded  in the system, or (3) the Air Force may not be taking prompt and  appropriate action to resolve problems that are delaying the completion of  the work.", "A contract depot maintenance manager at one of the remaining centers  characterized this records reconstruction and reconciliation effort as  \u201coverwhelming.\u201d  Specifically, he noted that his center had assumed  responsibility for 627 contracts (about 20 percent of its total workload),  and pointed out that the contracts went back to 1981 and each contract  could have as many as 800 line items.  The manager also stated that, as of  October 2001 (1 year after the transfer), center staff had not even looked at  many of the contracts and had unreconciled problems with many of the  contracts that they had reviewed.  To further illustrate the magnitude of the  reconciliation problem, he pointed out that their research thus far had  determined that (1) they did not have contracts for $41 million of work that  was recorded in the production and cost system and about $3 million in  contractor payments, (2) the production and cost system contained no  information on 74 contracts with a total contract amount of $12.6 million,  and (3) contractors were providing automated production data for less  than 15 percent of the transferred contracts.", "The lack of documentation for contracts that were transferred from a  closing facility had resulted in the lack of management oversight.  For  example, 10 of the sample items, with a total unfilled order value of  $4.5 million as of September 30, 2000, were requirements for work on hush  houses that were contracted for by one of the closing air logistics centers.   Work on several of these hush houses was supposed to be completed prior  to the end of fiscal year 2000, and work on all of them was supposed to be  completed prior to the end of fiscal year 2001.  However, as of December  2001, the air logistics center that assumed management responsibility for  the contracts was still trying to determine the status of the work since it  had not received the required documentation from the closing center.", "The two centers that have a significant problem in this area have recently  dedicated several personnel to the resolution of problems related to the  transferred contracts.  However, this work is a time-consuming and labor- intensive process, and the Air Force Materiel Command has not established  either a milestone for completing the work or a methodology for  monitoring progress.

Additionally, production management specialists are required to develop  schedules that show when work on the items is scheduled to start and  when repairs are expected to be completed.  If done properly, this  approach ensures that production management specialists have the  information they need to (1) monitor the status of the work, (2) identify  problems, and (3) take prompt corrective action, when appropriate.", "However, for software workloads, the requirement is not to repair a certain  number of items, but rather to accomplish certain tasks.  For example, the  task could be to (1) attend and support any lab, ground, and flight tests  performed on a weapon system, (2) analyze test data, or (3) revise weapon  system software that does not perform as intended, such as an electronic  warfare system that does not perform effectively in high electro-static  environments.  As a result, most software workloads are expressed as a  level of effort, such as in number of hours or months to be worked.", "Because production management specialists do not have reliable data on  the status of software projects, the \u201cactual\u201d production data that they enter  into the production and cost system are estimates that are based on the  frequently erroneous assumption that work will begin and be accomplished  as planned.  This problem, which is similar to the previously discussed  problem with the activity group\u2019s work-in-process data, makes the reported  value of software unfilled orders highly questionable.

These problems resulted in idle funds that could have been used for near- term readiness or other priorities.

This computation is the dollar amount of  unfilled orders at fiscal year-end less the dollar amount of work-in-process  which equates to the amount of funds that carryover to the next fiscal year.   We reviewed the two factors (unfilled orders and work-in-process) that are  used in the computation and obtained documentation that supported the  information.  Since the work-in-process amount is a calculated figure and is  not based on actual work performed by the contractors, we obtained and  analyzed the methodology used by the Air Force Materiel Command and  the air logistics centers to compute the amount of work-in-process.  In  addition, to determine if any of the work had actually been completed, we  selected and reviewed a stratified random sample of unfilled orders.", "To identify the primary causes of contract depot maintenance carryover,  we reviewed a stratified random sample of 369 contract depot maintenance  requirements that, according to the group\u2019s production and cost system,  had been funded by customers, but not yet completed by contractors as of  September 30, 2000.  These 369 depot maintenance requirements were  selected from five major workload categories (aircraft, engines,  exchangeable inventory items, missiles and other major end items, and  software).  They accounted for $744.1 million, about 41.2 percent, of the  $1.806 billion of unfilled orders that the activity group reported at the end  of fiscal year 2000.  Of the $1.806 billion, about $124 million of the  September 30, 2000, unfilled orders were customer requirements that,  according to the production and cost system, had not yet been placed on  contract.  These requirements and an additional $48 million of relatively  small orders were excluded from our analysis.  The remaining $1.634 billion  represents total unfilled orders.  The confidence level used for estimating  the value of completed and uncompleted work was 95 percent and the  expected tolerable amount in error (test materiality) was $163,392,642.
