It ended the 61-year-old Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC) program, under which eligible families were entitled to ongoing monthly cash assistance, and replaced it with the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant for states. The TANF block grant, administered by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), provides a total of up to $16.5 billion to the states each year through 2002. As specified in PRWORA, the goals of TANF include ending the dependence of needy parents on government benefits by promoting job preparation and work. Under TANF, states have increased flexibility to design their programs and are therefore able to build upon initiatives they had begun experimenting with before federal reform. However, among other provisions, the law also requires that, to avoid financial penalties, states impose work requirements for adults, meet steadily rising requirements for the percentage of adults who participate in work activities, and enforce a 5-year lifetime limit on receiving TANF. To ensure they meet these and other requirements, states must also meet new federal program and fiscal reporting requirements.", "The new emphasis on work, job placement, and the temporary nature of aid requires a fundamental shift in how welfare offices do business and has implications beyond the TANF program and its workers. The goal of welfare workers and program managers is to help families become self- supporting. This new work-focused welfare affects other key programs that can help needy families in their transition to employment, most prominently the Food Stamp program, Medicaid, and the employment and training programs that are a part of each state\u2019s workforce development system.Work-focused welfare also has an effect on the multitude of service providers\u2014public, nonprofit, and private\u2014that are involved in helping low-income families move toward economic independence.", "Because of the new ways of doing business, the increased number of agencies and service providers involved, and the expanded federal reporting requirements, welfare reform has placed increased demands on state information systems that have traditionally been critical to the successful operation of states\u2019 welfare programs. Under the AFDC program, information systems were primarily used to determine eligibility and to provide some data for oversight, typically aggregate data on caseloads and expenditures, to state and federal program managers.In the new welfare environment, however, information systems must support an expanded set of functions in three key areas: case management, including eligibility determination; service planning; and program oversight, with a new emphasis on outcomes and results. In addition, the increased devolution of responsibility for program operation and performance to states and localities increases the need for systems that can respond to the multiple needs of users at all levels of government. State and local information systems used in operating and overseeing welfare programs will be important to the effective implementation of the new welfare program."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal Funding and Oversight Have Played Key Roles in Developing States\u2019 Automated Welfare Systems", "paragraphs": ["Three of the federal government\u2019s major programs for needy families\u2014 AFDC/TANF, Medicaid, and the Food Stamp program\u2014have historically relied heavily on state-run automated computer systems to help determine applicants\u2019 eligibility and the amount of assistance each participant should receive. Recognizing the importance of automated systems in efficiently and accurately determining eligibility, over the years the Congress has acted to encourage states to develop automated systems for these programs. Specifically, the Congress authorized HHS\u2019 Administration for Children and Families (ACF), which oversaw the AFDC program, and HHS\u2019 Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), which oversees Medicaid, to reimburse states for a significant proportion of their total costs to develop and operate automated eligibility determination systems.In 1980 the Congress also authorized the Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), which oversees the Food Stamp program, to reimburse states for 75 percent of their costs for planning, designing, developing, and installing automated eligibility systems and 50 percent of the costs to operate these systems.The goals of these automated eligibility systems were to minimize mistakes and the amount of time needed to determine eligibility, and to lower administrative costs.", "To obtain federal funding for a portion of the cost of automated welfare systems development and implementation for AFDC, Medicaid, and food stamps, states have been required to follow the advanced planning document (APD) process. Under this process, states submit APDs to the specific oversight agencies detailing state plans to develop and implement automated systems. The federal agencies then make funding decisions on the basis of these APD submissions. If a system is to be used for more than one program, APDs that meet the separate requirements of each program must be submitted and approved, and development costs are allocated to the various programs. After approving funding to states, the federal agencies monitor development and operation of the state systems to ensure all federal requirements are met. To obtain enhanced funding for AFDC automated systems, states had to meet the requirements for a Family Assistance Management Information System (FAMIS), a general system design developed by HHS to improve state administration of the AFDC program. Because eligibility for Medicaid and food stamps was linked to eligibility for AFDC, most of the AFDC systems also covered Medicaid and food stamps. To the extent that Medicaid and food stamp eligibility systems were integrated with AFDC systems, ACF, HCFA, and FNS used a cost allocation method to determine the portion of the system costs to be borne by each agency. At the time PRWORA was enacted in August 1996, 38 states operated state systems that complied with FAMIS requirements.", "The APD process remains in place for Medicaid and food stamps. However, under TANF, states are no longer required to submit APDs, and ACF is no longer required to play a role in establishing system requirements or in monitoring system development. States may use whatever portion of their capped federal TANF block grant funds they wish for developing and operating systems. However, no legislatively mandated ceilings exist to specifically limit federal funds for states\u2019 development and operation of automated systems costs related to Medicaid and food stamps. According to data reported by states to HHS, states had expended a total of about $456 million, or about 2 percent, of federal TANF funds on systems from fiscal year 1997 through the second quarter of fiscal year 1999.", "HHS also provides states with a proportion of the costs of automated systems for other federal welfare-related programs, including the child support enforcement program, child care subsidy program, child welfare services, and foster care/adoption assistance. We reported in 1994that 52 of the 54 states and territories were operating multiple systems\u2014ranging from 2 to 12 systems each\u2014to provide welfare program support for AFDC, Medicaid, food stamps, child support enforcement, child care, child welfare services, foster care/adoption assistance, and the now-repealed Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training (JOBS) program.We also reported that HHS and USDA had contributed over $6.8 billion from 1984 to 1992, and over $1.8 billion prior to 1984, to help fund development and operation of these automated systems.The 1994 report also asserted that the federal government might pay the largest share of an estimated $10.7 billion in additional automated systems costs from fiscal year 1993 through the end of 1999. These cost figures do not include federal funding for other automated systems used by programs involved in helping welfare recipients move toward economic independence, such as systems related to state workforce development systems.", "Recognizing the importance of information systems in implementing key aspects of welfare reform, the Congress in PRWORA directed HHS to prepare a report that addressed (1) the status of the automated systems operated by states to help program managers administer their TANF programs and (2) what would be required to establish a system capable of tracking participants in public programs over time and checking case records of the states to determine whether individuals were participating illegally in public programs in two or more states at a time. In collecting information intended for use in this report, HHS worked with several organizations representing states, information technology specialists, and welfare administrators to survey states on the likely effects on information systems of legislatively mandated changes to welfare programs. The 1997 report projected on the basis of state estimates that adapting current information systems to meet the demands of welfare reform would require spending about $1 billion."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Welfare Reform Legislation Established Numerous Requirements for Those Receiving TANF and for States", "paragraphs": ["While PRWORA limited the federal government\u2019s role in approving and overseeing states\u2019 development of TANF automated information systems and provided states much greater flexibility than before to design and implement their own programs, it also emphasized states\u2019 accountability for meeting program requirements and for program performance. This accountability focus is in keeping with the increased emphasis governmentwide on program performance fostered by the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993. Under TANF, to avoid financial penalties, states must ensure that a certain minimum percentage of their caseloads are participating in work or work-related activities each year. These percentages are referred to as \u201cminimum mandated participation rates.\u201d To count toward states\u2019 mandated rates, adult recipients in families must participate a certain minimum number of hours in work or a work- related activity as prescribed in the law, such as job readiness workshops; on-the-job training; and, under certain circumstances, education. The required number of hours of participation and the percentage of a state\u2019s caseload that must participate to meet mandated rates generally increase over time, as shown in table 1.", "States must also track the length of time that individuals receive TANF to implement the new time limits. States must enforce the PRWORA prohibition on provision of TANF funds to families with adults who have received TANF for a total of 5 years over their lifetime. Families with no adult receiving assistance (commonly referred to as \u201cchild-only\u201d cases) are not subject to this limit, and up to 20 percent of a state\u2019s average monthly caseload may be exempt on the basis of hardship or having been subjected to domestic violence.Also, states may opt to continue to provide assistance beyond the 5-year limit using state funds.", "In addition to holding states accountable for tracking and enforcing participation requirements and time limits, PRWORA authorized HHS to award federal dollars to states with exceptional performance in achieving the goals of TANF. PRWORA established the broad parameters of a high- performance bonus system and required that HHS work with organizations representing states and welfare administrators to determine the details of the system. For the first year that the bonus was to be awarded\u2014fiscal year 1999\u2014states were to compete in the areas of TANF recipients\u2019 rates of job entry, earnings gains, and job retention as well as increases in these rates over time.", "The new focus on work as well as the new high-performance bonus system resulted in an expanded set of reporting requirements and options for states, as shown in table 2. HHS issued final regulations on data collection and reporting requirements in April 1999 and published information on the first year of the high-performance bonus system in March 1998."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "New and Evolving Welfare Environment Is Transforming States\u2019 Automated Systems Needs", "paragraphs": ["Our work and other studies show that states and localities have made progress in implementing key aspects of TANF. States are refocusing their programs on moving people into employment rather than signing them up for monthly cash assistance. To better support this new work focus, many states are changing how their welfare offices and workers do business; converting their offices into job placement centers; and helping clients address and solve problems that interfere with employment, such as lack of child care or transportation as well as more complex mental and physical health problems.", "As welfare agencies focus on moving needy families toward economic independence, frontline workers are drawing on other federal and state programs, often administered by separate agencies, to provide a wide array of services. These programs range from those designed to meet families\u2019 basic needs for food and shelter to those that provide employment and training services and support services, such as subsidies for child care. While local welfare agencies typically administer eligibility determination for TANF, food stamps, and Medicaid, other programs that provide key services to TANF clients may be administered by separate entities, such as housing authorities or education agencies. Most notably, because TANF has focused welfare agencies on employment, a focus that has long been the province of state and local workforce development systems, welfare agencies need to work more closely than before with workforce development systems, particularly to administer services funded by the new welfare-to-work grants created by the Congress in 1997 and administered by the Department of Labor.", "In addition, some states now rely on state unemployment insurance (UI) systems to obtain data on the employment and earnings of former welfare recipients to help monitor both clients\u2019 progress and the performance of various state programs. Figure 1 shows many of the programs and services that frontline workers may be responsible for arranging and monitoring to help clients move toward economic independence through employment.", "The new environment in which state and local agencies provide services to low-income families has profound implications for the information needs of states and the automated systems designed to meet those needs. Typically, the programs to which welfare workers and managers turn to provide services have automated information systems that were designed to meet the particular needs of each program rather than the cross-program needs of the clients they serve. Yet, successful implementation of welfare reform calls for information from a range of programs in three key areas: case management, service planning, and program oversight. As shown in table 3, these key functions are performed at different levels of program administration.", "While the information needs of the users differ, these needs also share some key characteristics that distinguish them from the information needs of the previous welfare environment. First, information is now needed that allows workers and managers to monitor people\u2019s activities and progress over time toward employment and economic independence. Second, more than ever before, case and program managers must focus on ensuring the delivery of an integrated package of services for families seeking aid. While the importance of service integration\u2014creating methods to unite or link the services provided by different programs and agencies to serve the same population\u2014has been acknowledged as a critical need of human services programs, including welfare, for at least 2 decades,the need for providing integrated services has heightened with the new emphasis on moving welfare recipients into employment and placing a time limit on the receipt of aid. The goal of service integration has been reinforced by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-220), which requires that all states and localities use one-stop career centers to deliver most employment and training services (except TANF-related services). These centers seek to bring together all workforce development programs\u2014each with its own target population\u2014in a single system that serves all individuals, regardless of their eligibility for any specific program. In developing one-stop systems, Labor has encouraged states to involve human services agencies in the planning and delivery of services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To better understand and assess the role of information systems in states\u2019 welfare reforms, we collaborated with the Nelson A.

However, a number of these systems have shortcomings that limit their usefulness in helping to move TANF recipients toward employment and economic independence. One shortcoming is that these automated systems sometimes do not share information about TANF recipients that is needed by the different agencies that serve them. This constrains the ability of case managers to coordinate services and monitor recipients\u2019 progress. A second shortcoming is that the systems\u2019 limited capabilities to query and manipulate data sometimes prevent users from readily obtaining aggregate information on caseload characteristics. This shortcoming limits capabilities for service planning and was reported to be especially pervasive at the local level.

While 5 of the localities indicated that automated systems provide all or most of the information that TANF case managers need to support their clients\u2019 movement to employment and economic independence, the other 10 localities said that automated systems provide about half or less of the information needed.", "A major shortcoming of current automated systems, cited to varying degrees in the six states in which we did in-depth fieldwork, is that some of the systems used by the agencies providing services to TANF recipients do not share data on these recipients. This shortcoming constrains the ability of case managers to arrange needed services; ensure that these services are provided; and respond quickly when problems arise, such as when a recipient does not attend a scheduled work activity. For example, local officials in New Jersey told us that some TANF clients have received sanctions in error because data are not transferred electronically between the automated system used by staff at the labor department, who receive data on recipients\u2019 attendance at work activities, and the system used by staff at the welfare department, who issue sanctions for failure to meet work requirements. Local officials in Ohio and New Jersey said that TANF case managers are unable to determine which of the children receiving TANF are also involved with the child welfare system, a situation that can hinder the ability of case managers to devise appropriate service strategies for such families.Appendix II provides more detailed information from our survey of 15 states on the extent to which the automated systems for different programs share data.", "In the absence of links between automated systems, local officials in our study states generally said that paper forms or telephone contacts are used to refer recipients to, or obtain information on their use of, vocational education, secondary education, substance abuse services, and mental health services. The reliance on paper forms was cited as a major burden for case managers because of the substantial amount of time involved in collecting all the needed forms from service providers and keying data from these forms into automated systems. At many local sites, the problem was reported to be compounded by the need for double or even triple data entry for some items: case managers or other frontline workers must separately input the same data, such as a recipient\u2019s entry into employment, into different automated systems because the data are not automatically transferred and updated from one system to the other. Local officials told us that multiple entry of the same data not only reduces the time available to work directly with TANF clients but also increases the risk of introducing errors into the data contained in automated systems.", "An important dimension of automated support for case management is the extent to which TANF case managers are able to access data from the automated systems for different programs from their desktop computers. As shown in figure 3, case managers in the localities we surveyed generally have desktop access to data in the automated systems for food stamps, TANF work activities, child support enforcement, Medicaid eligibility determination, and transportation subsidies for TANF recipients. However, case managers in most localities do not have desktop access to data from automated systems for welfare-to-work grants, the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA), job listings, child welfare programs, vocational rehabilitation, and subsidized housing. Over half the localities said that case managers have desktop access to data from automated systems for child care subsidies and UI. As a result, case managers do not always have ready access to information that could help them coordinate services for TANF recipients and monitor their use of these services. In such cases, the relevant information either is not available to case managers or it takes longer to obtain it (for example, from hard copy reports from a specific program).", "Our work in the six case study states also uncovered some specific case management tasks that are not always well supported by automated systems, as shown in table 6.", "As a result of separating cash assistance from Medicaid,local officials in five of the six states cited automated system glitches that sometimes occur in enrolling families in Medicaid or ensuring their continued enrollment. For example, local officials said that frontline workers on occasion have to intentionally enter inaccurate data to enable a Medicaid case to be opened correctly. Local officials also told us that automated systems sometimes close Medicaid cases that should not be closed or fail to correctly process cases for transitional Medicaid,which requires frontline workers to do \u201cworkarounds\u201d to correct these problems. PRWORA authorized $500 million to aid states in maintaining Medicaid coverage for individuals affected by welfare reform, some of which may be used to pay the costs of modifying Medicaid eligibility systems.

Other gaps arise because even though the data are contained in automated systems, these data are difficult or impossible to extract in a way that answers the particular question of concern to the program manager. For example, local officials at one site said that the locality does not have adequate access to data it enters into the state welfare system and that writing the computer program needed to extract data generally takes an entire day. Officials at a locality in another state said that data on the characteristics of TANF recipients contained in the state\u2019s automated systems are often not available in a format that can be easily manipulated, so obtaining data depends on the technical expertise of the user.", "As shown in table 7, automated systems in our case study states can provide information on some characteristics of TANF caseloads but not others.

When we asked whether officials could identify their current \u201chard-to- serve\u201d TANF cases by identifying cases that include adults who either are long-term welfare recipients or have multiple barriers to employment, states and localities generally said that their automated systems provide this capability. For example, state officials in Georgia and Washington told us that their automated systems had been programmed to identify recipients who have received cash assistance for 30 months or more. In comparison with long-term welfare recipients, adults who have repeatedly cycled on and off welfare may differ somewhat in their service needs.Local officials generally said that they are unable to identify such cases in their caseloads. Responses from state officials varied: while some said that they cannot identify such cases, others said that they can do so with some difficulty.", "Officials at some localities cited examples of other information gaps they had encountered with respect to characteristics of their TANF caseloads.

However, local officials vary in their automated capabilities to obtain aggregate information on the job retention of these recipients and generally cannot obtain aggregate information on recipients\u2019 wage progression. Local officials in one state cited the need to have more detailed information on the employment progress of TANF clients than is available from state UI records. For example, they noted that while UI records can provide information on the amount of a person\u2019s total earnings for a quarter, these records cannot provide information on the person\u2019s hourly wage and number of hours worked per week.
