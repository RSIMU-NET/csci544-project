During this period, state and local arrests of Native American youth declined by almost 40 percent from 18,295 in 2010 to 11,002 in 2016. The vast majority of Native American youth came into contact with state and local justice systems rather than the federal system.", "However, more Native American youth were involved in the federal system than their percentage in the nationwide population (1.6 percent). For example, of all youth arrested by federal entities during the period, 18 percent were Native American. According to Department of Justice (DOJ) officials, this is due to federal jurisdiction over certain crimes involving Native Americans. Comprehensive data on Native American youth involvement in tribal justice systems were not available for analysis. GAO's analysis showed several differences between Native American and non-Native American youth in the federal justice system. For example, the majority of Native American youths' involvement was for offenses against a person, such as assault and sex offenses. In contrast, the majority of non-Native American youths' involvement was for public order offenses (e.g., immigration violations) or drug or alcohol offenses. On the other hand, in state and local justice systems, the involvement of Native American and non-Native American youth showed many similarities, such as similar offenses for each group.", "DOJ and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) offered at least 122 discretionary grants and cooperative agreements (grant programs) from fiscal years 2015 through 2017 that could be used to address juvenile delinquency among Native American youth. DOJ and HHS made approximately $1.2 billion in first-year awards to grantees during the period, of which the agencies awarded approximately $207.7 million to tribal governments or Native American organizations. Officials from the agencies, tribal governments, and Native American organizations identified factors they believe affect success in applying for grant programs. For example, some tribal governments and Native American organizations found being able to call or meet with federal officials during the application process helpful but found that short application deadlines are a challenge."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss our recently completed report on  American Indian and Alaska Native (Native American) youth involvement  in federal, state and local, and tribal justice systems, and federal grant  programs available to help address issues of delinquency among Native  American youth.", "In particular, I will highlight our findings pertaining to (1) what available  data show on the number and characteristics of Native American youth in  federal, state and local, and tribal justice systems; and (2) selected  federal discretionary grants and cooperative agreements (grant  programs) that could help prevent or address delinquency among Native  American youth, and tribal governments and Native American  organizations\u2019 access to them.", "According to recent reports and agency research, several risk factors  make some Native American youth susceptible to becoming involved with  justice systems at the federal, state and local, and tribal levels.  These risk factors include exposure to violence; substance abuse; poverty;  limited job market skills; and tribal communities\u2019 limited funding for mental  health, education, housing, and other services.", "Native American youth who commit offenses can enter one or more  justice systems at the federal, state and local, and tribal levels. Although  these justice systems have unique characteristics, youth generally  proceed through certain phases, including arrest, prosecution and  adjudication, and in some instances, placement and confinement in a  detention facility.", "When a Native American youth enters the federal criminal justice system,  the Department of Justice (DOJ) and Department of the Interior (DOI),  among others, have responsibility for investigating and prosecuting his or  her act of delinquency or crime. Additionally, federal agencies including  DOJ and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) provide  funding through grant programs that grantees could use to help prevent  or address juvenile delinquency.", "Outside Indian country, a state generally has jurisdiction to proceed  against a youth who has committed a crime or act of juvenile  delinquency. Federal law limits federal jurisdiction over youth if a state  has jurisdiction over the youth and has a system of programs and  services adequate for their needs. State and local justice systems have  specific courts\u2014often at the county or city level\u2014with jurisdiction over  youth alleged to have committed an act of juvenile delinquency or a crime. Inside Indian country, youth (and adults) may fall under federal,  state, or tribal jurisdiction depending on several factors. These factors  include the nature of the crime, the status of the alleged offender and  victim\u2014that is, whether they are Indian or not\u2014and whether jurisdiction  has been conferred on a particular entity by statute. The Major Crimes  Act, for example, grants the federal government criminal jurisdiction over  Indians in Indian country charged with serious, felony-level offenses  enumerated in the statute, such as murder, manslaughter, kidnapping,  burglary, and robbery. State jurisdiction in Indian country is generally  limited to two instances: when both the alleged offender and victim are  non-Indian, or when a federal statute confers, or authorizes, a state to  assume criminal jurisdiction over Indians in Indian country. Otherwise,  only the federal and tribal governments have jurisdiction in Indian country.", "For our September 2018 report, we analyzed federal, state and local, and  tribal arrest, adjudication, and confinement data from 2010 through 2016 (the most recent available) from DOJ and DOI. We also analyzed DOJ  and HHS grant program award documentation from fiscal years 2015  through 2017, and application information for a sample of the grant  programs chosen based on the amount of funding awarded and other  factors. Additionally, we also interviewed officials from DOJ, HHS, and 10  tribal governments or Native American organizations chosen to include  successful and unsuccessful applicants to the grant programs, among  other things. Additional information on our scope and methodology can  be found in our September 5, 2018 report. For specific information about  the different databases from which we gathered our data, see appendix I.  Our work was performed in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Available Data Indicate Native American Youth Involvement in Justice Systems Declined from 2010 through 2016 and Differed in Some Ways from That of Non-Native American Youth", "paragraphs": ["In our September 2018 report, we found that from 2010 through 2016 the  number of Native American youth in federal and state and local justice  systems declined across all phases of the justice process\u2014arrest,  adjudication, and confinement\u2014according to our analysis of available  data. At the federal level, arrests by federal agencies dropped from 60  Native American youth in 2010 to 20 in 2016, and at the state and local  level, arrests of Native American youth declined by almost 40 percent  from 18,295 arrested in 2010 to 11,002 in 2016.", "Our analysis also found that the vast majority of these Native American  youth came into contact with state and local justice systems, not the  federal system. For example, from 2010 through 2016, there were  105,487 total arrests of Native American youth reported by state and local  law enforcement agencies (LEAs). In contrast, there were 246 Native  American youth held in federal custody by the U.S. Marshals Service due  to arrest by federal LEAs during the same period.", "We also found a number of similarities between Native American and  non-Native American youth in state and local justice systems. For  example, the offenses that Native American youth and non-Native  American youth were arrested, adjudicated, and confined for were  generally similar. In contrast, our analysis also showed a number of  differences between Native American and non-Native American youth in  the federal justice system. For example, our analysis showed variation in  the types of offenses committed by each group. From fiscal years 2010  through 2016, the majority of Native American youth in the federal justice  system were arrested, adjudicated, or confined for offenses against a  person, with the top two specific offenses being assault and sex  offenses. In contrast, the majority of involvement of non-Native  American youth in the federal system during the same period was due to  public order or drug and alcohol offenses at all three stages, with the top  two specific offenses being drug and immigration related. Our  September 2018 report contains additional information on the differences  between Native American and non-Native American youth involved with  the federal justice system.", "Further, we found that the percent of Native American youth involved in  most state and local systems was generally similar to their representation  in the youth populations in those states. For example, our analysis found  that the majority (about 75 percent) of Native American youth arrested by  state and local LEAs from calendar years 2010 through 2016 were  located in 10 states: Alaska, Arizona, Minnesota, Montana, New Mexico,  North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Washington, and Wisconsin.  These 10 states had among the highest percent of Native Americans in  their states\u2019 overall youth populations, according to 2016 U.S. Census  estimates we reviewed. In 2016, the largest number of arrests by state  and local LEAs occurred in Arizona and South Dakota.", "In contrast, we found that representation of Native American youth  arrested, referred for adjudication, and confined at the federal level during  the period reviewed was greater (13 to 19 percent) than their  representation in the nationwide youth population (1.6 percent).", "DOJ officials told us that the population of Native Americans in the federal  justice system has historically been higher than their share in the  nationwide population, and they attributed this and other differences  shown by our analysis to federal government jurisdiction over certain  crimes in Indian country, as well as the absence of general federal  government jurisdiction over non-Native American youth. According to  DOJ officials, this jurisdiction requires the federal government to  prosecute offenses that would commonly be prosecuted by states if  committed outside of Indian country. According to DOJ officials, a small  handful of federal criminal statutes apply to all juveniles, such as  immigration and drug statutes, but the federal government has been  granted greater jurisdiction over Native American youth than non-Native  American youth by federal laws that apply to crimes committed in Indian  Country, such as the Major Crimes Act. For example, one DOJ official  noted that the Major Crimes Act gives the federal government exclusive  jurisdiction over crimes such as burglary and sex offenses committed in  Indian country. This differs from the treatment of non-Native American  youth, who are not prosecuted in the federal system for the same types of  offenses, because the federal government does not have jurisdiction over  those youth for such offenses. Non-Native American youth are instead  subject to the general juvenile delinquency jurisdiction of state and local  courts.", "Additionally, DOJ officials stated that tribal justice systems are often  underfunded and do not have the capacity to handle Native American  youths\u2019 cases. Therefore, they stated that when both federal and tribal justice systems have jurisdiction, the federal system might be the only  system in which the youth\u2019s case may be adjudicated. For these reasons,  the percentage of Native American youth offenders in the federal justice  system is higher than non-Native American juveniles in accordance with  population size, according to DOJ officials.", "Representatives from four of the five Native American organizations we  interviewed, whose mission and scope of work focus on Native American  juvenile justice issues and that have a national or geographically specific  perspective, noted that federal jurisdiction is a key contributor to the  higher percentage of Native American youth involved at the federal justice  level. Additionally, representatives from all five organizations noted,  similarly to DOJ officials, that federal jurisdiction over crimes in Indian  country is typically for more serious offenses (specifically under the Major  Crimes Act), such as offenses against a person.", "Comprehensive data from tribal justice systems on the involvement of  Native American youth were not available. However, we identified and  reviewed a few data sources that provided insights about the arrest,  adjudication, and confinement of Native American youth by tribal justice  systems.

DOJ and HHS made  approximately $1.2 billion in first-year awards through the 122 programs  over the period, of which the agencies awarded about $207.7 million to  tribal governments or Native American organizations. A list of the 122  programs, which focus on a range of issues such as violence or trauma,  justice system reform, alcohol and substance abuse, and reentry and  recidivism, can be found in our September 2018 report.", "The 122 DOJ and HHS grant programs we identified included 27  programs that specified tribes or Native Americans as a primary  beneficiary and 95 programs that did not specify these populations but  could include them as beneficiaries. For example, the Department of  Justice\u2019s Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention offered  the Defending Childhood American Indian/Alaska Native Policy Initiative:  Supporting Trauma-Informed Juvenile Justice Systems for Tribes  program for funding in fiscal year 2016. The goal of this program\u2014 increasing the capacity of federally recognized tribes\u2019 juvenile justice and  related systems to improve the life outcomes of youth who are at risk or  who are involved in the justice system and to reduce youth exposure to  violence\u2014explicitly focused on tribal communities. On the other hand, the  Sober Truth on Preventing Underage Drinking Act grant program, which  HHS\u2019s Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration  offered for funding in fiscal year 2016 to prevent and reduce alcohol use  among youth and young adults, is an example of a program that did not  specify tribes or Native Americans as a primary beneficiary but could  include them as beneficiaries.", "We found that tribal governments and Native American organizations  were eligible for almost all of the grant programs we identified.  Specifically, they were eligible to apply for 70 of 73 DOJ programs and 48  of 49 HHS programs. However, although tribal governments and Native  American organizations were eligible to apply for almost all of the  programs, we found in a non-generalizable sample of applications we  reviewed that they applied primarily for the programs that specified tribes  or Native Americans as a primary beneficiary. For example, we reviewed  applications for 18 DOJ grant programs and found that tribal governments  and Native American organizations accounted for over 99 percent of the  applications for the 5 grant programs within the sample that specified  tribes or Native Americans as a primary beneficiary. However, tribal  governments and Native American organizations accounted for about 1  percent of the applications for the 13 programs in the sample that did not  specify tribes or Native Americans as a primary beneficiary.", "We interviewed officials from DOJ\u2019s Office of Justice Programs (OJP) and  seven HHS operating divisions to obtain their perspectives on why tribal  governments and Native American organizations might not apply for grant  programs that do not specify them as a primary beneficiary. They  identified various reasons, including that tribal governments and Native  American organizations might not be aware that they are eligible to apply  for certain grant programs; might believe that their applications to grant  programs that do not specify tribes or Native Americans as a primary  beneficiary will not be competitive with other applications; or might prefer  to apply for those grant programs that specify tribes or Native Americans  as a primary beneficiary.", "We also interviewed representatives from 10 tribal governments and  Native American organizations, who provided perspectives on whether or  not a grant program\u2019s focus on tribes or Native Americans as a primary  beneficiary affected their decision to apply for the program. Officials  from 6 of 10 tribal governments and Native American organizations  indicated that they would consider any grant program that met the needs  of their communities, while the remaining 4 indicated that a grant  program\u2019s focus or lack thereof on tribes or Native Americans could affect  their ability to apply for it.", "Officials from the 10 tribal governments and Native American  organizations also identified various federal practices they found helpful  or challenging when applying for grant programs related to preventing or  addressing delinquency among Native American youth. When asked  what federal practices, if any, were particularly helpful when applying to  receive federal funding, they most frequently responded that they found it  particularly helpful to be able to call or meet with federal officials if they  had questions about or needed help on their applications. Regarding the  biggest challenges, they cited short application deadlines, difficulties  collecting data for grant program applications, and a scarcity of grant  writers and other personnel needed to complete a quality application.", "In addition, DOJ OJP and HHS officials provided perspectives on why  some tribal governments and Native American organizations might be  more successful in applying for federal funding than others. The officials  stated, among other things, that larger and better-resourced tribal  governments and Native American organizations were more successful at  applying for federal funding and that previously successful grant program  applicants were more likely to be successful again.", "More detailed information on the perspectives from tribal governments,  Native American organizations, and agency officials regarding the factors  they believe affect the ability of tribal governments and Native American  organizations to apply successfully for federal grant programs can be  found in our September 2018 report.", "Chairman Hoeven, Vice Chairman Udall, and Members of the Committee,  this completes my prepared statement.

The following is a summary of our analysis of data from  these sources.", "Arrests. Although comprehensive data on the number of tribal law  enforcement agency (LEA) arrests were not available, we obtained and  reviewed admission records from three juvenile detention centers in  Indian country managed by the Department of the Interior\u2019s Bureau of  Indian Affairs (BIA). Based on those records, at least 388 Native  American tribal youth were admitted to these three facilities in 2016, as  shown in table 1. In the Northern Cheyenne facility, for which we obtained  records for 5 years, the number of youth admitted increased yearly  between 2012 and 2016, from 14 to 204.", "According to BIA officials, this growth in the number of youth admitted to  the Northern Cheyenne facility likely reflects an increase in admissions of  Native American youth from surrounding tribes. Specifically, because the  Northern Cheyenne facility is centrally located, the officials said that the  facility admits youth from other tribes, which have grown accustomed to  sending their youth to the facility. BIA officials also noted that the  Northern Cheyenne facility services an area where there is a high rate of  delinquency among youth, and because the facility works well with Native  American youth struggling with delinquency issues, many tribes elect to  send their delinquent youth to the facility. Further, since 2012, the  Northern Cheyenne facility increased its bed space and staff, thus  increasing its capacity to admit more youth, according to BIA officials.", "Even though comprehensive tribal arrest data were not available, we  reported in September 2018 that the Department of Justice\u2019s (DOJ)  Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) was undertaking an effort to increase  collection of arrest data from tribal LEAs. Specifically, this data collection  activity is the Census of Tribal Law Enforcement Agencies. This  collection activity, which BJS plans to conduct in 2019, is to capture  information including tribal LEA workloads and arrests, tribal LEA access  to and participation in regional and national justice database systems,  and tribal LEA reporting of crime data into FBI databases.", "Adjudication. Comprehensive data were not available to describe the  extent to which tribal courts processed Native American youth or found  them guilty. However, BJS concluded a tribal court data collection effort\u2014 the National Survey of Tribal Court Systems\u2014in 2015. Through this  survey, BJS gathered information from more than 300 tribal courts and  other tribal judicial entities on their criminal, civil, domestic violence, and  youth caseloads, and pretrial and probation programs, among other  things. DOJ officials told us that BJS has analyzed the data, and plans to  release results in the future.", "Confinement.
