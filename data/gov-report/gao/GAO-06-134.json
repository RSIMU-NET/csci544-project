In addition to meeting legislatively mandated aggregate personnel levels, each military component must also meet its authorized personnel requirements for each occupational specialty. DOD reports that over half of today's youth cannot meet the military's entry standards for education, aptitude, health, moral character, or other requirements, making recruiting a significant challenge. GAO, under the Comptroller General's authority (1) assessed the extent to which DOD's active, reserve, and National Guard components met their enlisted aggregate recruiting and retention goals; (2) assessed the extent to which the components met their authorized personnel levels for enlisted occupational specialties; and (3) analyzed the steps DOD has taken to address recruiting and retention challenges."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DOD's active, reserve, and National Guard components met most aggregate recruiting and retention goals for enlisted personnel from fiscal years (FY) 2000-2004. However, for FY 2005, 5 of 10 components--the Army, Army Reserve, Army National Guard, Air National Guard, and Navy Reserve--missed their recruiting goals by 8 to 20 percent. Most of the components met their aggregate retention goals for FY 2000-2004, but the Navy experienced shortages in FY 2005 of up to 8 percent. Also, factors such as the shrinking numbers of new recruits in delayed entry programs and the use of stop loss, which delays servicemembers from leaving active duty, indicate that the components may experience future recruiting challenges. All components exceeded authorized personnel levels for some occupational specialties and did not meet others. Specifically, GAO found that 19 percent of DOD's 1,484 occupational specialties were consistently overfilled and 41 percent were consistently underfilled from FY 2000-2005. While the components offered reasons why occupational specialties may be over- or underfilled, GAO believes that consistently over- and underfilled occupational specialties are a systemic problem for DOD that raises two critical questions. First, what is the cost to the taxpayer to retain thousands more personnel than necessary in consistently overfilled occupational specialties? Second, how can DOD components continue to effectively execute their mission with consistently underfilled occupational specialties? In FY 2005, almost 31,000 more servicemembers than authorized served in occupational specialties that have been consistently overfilled. GAO determined that it costs the federal government about $103,000 annually, on average, to compensate each enlisted active duty servicemember in FY 2004. In contrast, DOD was unable to fill over 112,000 positions in consistently underfilled occupational specialties, raising concerns about the validity of the authorized personnel levels. DOD requires the active components to report on critical occupational specialties for recruiting and retention, which amounts to at most 16 percent of their 625 specialties. However, DOD does not require them to report on their noncritical occupational specialties, and does not require the reserve or National Guard components to report on any of their 859 specialties. Consequently, DOD does not have the necessary information to develop an effective plan to address the root causes of the components' recruiting and retention challenges. DOD has taken steps to enhance recruiting and retention, but lacks information on financial incentives provided for certain occupational specialties. GAO found that the components offered financial incentives to servicemembers in consistently overfilled occupational specialties. However, because DOD only requires the components to provide minimal justification for their use of financial incentives, it lacks the information needed to provide assurance to the Secretary of Defense, Congress, and the taxpayer that the increasing amount of funding spent on recruiting and retention is appropriately and effectively targeted to occupational specialties for which the components have the greatest need."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) faces a significant challenge in  recruiting and retaining hundreds of thousands of new servicemembers  each year, not only to meet annual legislatively mandated aggregate  personnel levels, but also to meet authorized personnel requirements  within its hundreds of occupational specialties. To further complicate an  already challenging recruiting environment, DOD reports that over half of  today\u2019s youth between the ages of 16 and 21 are not qualified to serve in the  military because they fail to meet the military\u2019s entry standards for  education, aptitude, health, moral character, or other requirements.  Furthermore, parents, teachers, and other influencers are less inclined to  encourage young people to join the military. In fiscal year 2005 alone, DOD  had goals to recruit almost 170,000 personnel into its active duty forces and  about 131,000 personnel into its reserve and National Guard components.  Additionally, in 2005, DOD had to retain tens of thousands of personnel to  sustain its force of about 2.7 million military servicemembers. Today\u2019s  immediate military recruiting and retention challenge centers on the  continuing deployment of over 180,000 ground forces from the active,  reserve, and National Guard components to the war zone in Iraq. Military  officials have testified that fiscal year 2005 proved to be a difficult  recruiting year and believe the recruiting environment will become even  more challenging in fiscal year 2006.", "The key to managing the force to meet operational demands is for DOD\u2019s  components to balance accessions and losses within the confines of their  legislatively mandated personnel levels. However, simply meeting these  mandated aggregate personnel levels could present a misleading picture of  recruiting and retention challenges. Detailed information concerning  whether the components have met their authorized personnel levels for  occupational specialties, the reasons why certain occupational specialties  may be over- or underfilled, and justifications for the use of incentives  provided to servicemembers are important elements of an effective  recruiting and retention plan.", "Given the extraordinary scope of the current military overseas operational  commitments, many members of Congress have expressed considerable  interest in DOD\u2019s ability to recruit and retain sufficient numbers of  servicemembers with the required skills and experience to accomplish its  multiple missions. In response to this broad congressional interest, we  undertook a review, under the authority of the Comptroller General, of  military recruiting and retention. In March 2005, we submitted a statement  for the record to the Subcommittee on Military Personnel, Committee on  Armed Services, House of Representatives, which outlined our preliminary  observations on DOD\u2019s enlisted personnel recruiting and retention issues.  This report, which updates that statement, addresses enlisted  servicemembers only. Specifically, for this report we: (1) assessed the  extent to which DOD\u2019s active, reserve, and National Guard components  met their enlisted aggregate recruiting and retention goals; (2) assessed the  extent to which the components met their authorized personnel levels for  enlisted occupational specialties; and (3) analyzed the steps DOD has taken  to address recruiting and retention challenges.", "To address these objectives, we examined DOD policies, regulations, and  directives related to recruiting and retention of military servicemembers.  We also reviewed recruiting and retention reports and briefings issued by  GAO, DOD, the military services, the Congressional Research Service, the  Congressional Budget Office, and research organizations such as RAND.  Additionally, we visited and interviewed officials within the Office of the  Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness and DOD\u2019s 10  components, including the active duty, reserve, and National Guard  components\u2019 headquarters and their recruiting commands to obtain  insights into recruiting and retention challenges. We also analyzed  individual component databases containing recruiting and retention data  on active, reserve, and Guard servicemembers. We relied primarily on data  covering fiscal years 2000 through June 30, 2005, the last fiscal quarter for  which data were complete, but in certain cases, we were able to update the  data with more current information. We also determined that the data used  in this report were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.

These military operations have greatly  increased personnel tempo, especially in the Army, Marine Corps, Army  National Guard, and Army Reserve, which have provided the bulk of the  military servicemembers for operations in Iraq. Additionally, when  Hurricanes Katrina and Rita hit the Gulf Coast in August and September  2005, respectively, resulting in possibly the largest natural disaster relief  and recovery operations in U.S. history, DOD was called upon to provide  extensive search and rescue, evacuation, and medical support.", "DOD relies on four active components\u2014the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and  Air Force\u2014and four reserve and two National Guard components\u2014the  Army National Guard, Army Reserve, Navy Reserve, Marine Corps Reserve,  Air National Guard, and Air Force Reserve\u2014to meet its mission. Each  year, Congress authorizes an annual year-end authorized personnel level  for each component. In fiscal year 2005, the authorized personnel levels for  the four active, four reserve, and two National Guard components totaled  approximately 2.3 million military servicemembers. In order to meet  legislatively mandated authorized personnel levels, DOD must balance  accessions and losses.

To  accomplish this task, active, reserve, and National Guard components set  goals for accessions, or new recruits, who will enter basic training each  year, and strive to meet their annual goals through their recruiting  programs; advertising; and, where needed, financial incentives. The term  retention refers to the military services\u2019 ability to retain servicemembers  with the necessary skills and experience. Again, the components rely on  financial incentives, where needed, to meet their retention goals.", "The components further delineate their force structure through  occupational specialties. These occupational specialties, totaling about  1,500 across DOD in the active, reserve, and National Guard components,  represent the jobs that are necessary for the components to meet their  specific missions.

According to a DOD official from  the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the delayed entry program is viewed  as a depository for future soldiers, sailors, and airmen.  When prospects  sign their contracts, they enter into the pool of applicants awaiting the date  that they report to basic training. While in the delayed entry program, the  applicants are the responsibility of the recruiter and, as such, are taught  basic military protocols and procedures, such as saluting and rank  recognition. Applicants generally spend no more than a year in the delayed  entry program and no less than 10 days. Before being released from the  delayed entry program, applicants are medically qualified, take an initial  oath of enlistment, and perform other personal business prior to reporting  to basic training. According to the same DOD official, a healthy delayed  entry program is imperative to a successful recruiting year. If the active  components come in at or near their delayed entry program goals for the  year, they can be relatively sure they will achieve their annual recruiting  goals. If they fall short of their delayed entry program goals, the  components try to make up the shortfalls by sending individuals to basic  training as early as the same month in which they sign enlistment papers.", "Typically, the active components prefer to enter a fiscal year with 35  percent to 65 percent of their coming year\u2019s accession goals, depending on  the component, already filled by recruits in the delayed entry program.  Figure 1 shows the percentage of new recruits in the delayed entry  programs compared to the components\u2019 goals for fiscal years 2003 through  2006. For example, the Army\u2019s goal is to enter each fiscal year with 35  percent of its upcoming annual accession goal already in the delayed entry  program. The Army exceeded this goal when it entered fiscal year 2004  with 46 percent of its annual accession goal already in the program.  However, it entered fiscal year 2005 with only 25 percent of its accession  goal in the program and, as of August 2005, is projected to enter fiscal year  2006 with 4 percent of its accession goal in the program. The Navy, with an  annual goal of 65 percent for its delayed entry program, is projected to  enter fiscal year 2006 with almost 36 percent of its accession goal in the  program. The Marine Corps, with an annual delayed entry program goal of  43 percent, entered fiscal year 2004 well above this goal, with 71 percent of  its accession goal in the program, 54 percent in 2005, and a projected 26  percent in fiscal year 2006. Similarly, the Air Force, with a delayed entry  program goal of 43 percent, projected to enter fiscal year 2006 with almost  22 percent of its accession goal in the program. The fact that all the active  duty components entered fiscal year 2006 with at least 40 percent fewer  recruits in their delayed entry programs than desired suggests that the  active duty components will likely face recruiting difficulties in fiscal year  2006.", "Although some components have employed stop loss over the past several  years, the Army, Army Reserve, and Army National Guard are the only  components currently using it. The stop loss program, according to several  Army officials, is used primarily for units that are deployed and is intended  to maintain unit cohesion. A DOD official told us that in June 2005, the  Army stop loss program affected over 15,000 soldiers, or less than one- tenth of a percent of DOD\u2019s total military force\u20149,044 active component  soldiers, 3,762 reserve soldiers, and 2,480 National Guard soldiers.  The  active Army and Army Reserve stop loss program takes effect 90 days prior  to unit deployment or with official deployment order notification, and  remains in effect through the date of redeployment to permanent duty  stations, plus a maximum of 90 days.  Army headquarters\u2019 officials said that  several Army initiatives, such as restructuring and rebalancing the active  and reserve component mix, will, over time, eliminate the need for stop  loss.  Congress has expressed concern that the use of stop loss to meet  overall personnel requirements may have a negative impact on recruiting  and retention and the public\u2019s perception of the military. Another Army  official told us that the attention this program has received in the media  may have created some of the negative implications on the public\u2019s  perception of military service. Additionally, an Army Reserve official we  spoke with stated that when active duty units are affected by stop loss,  servicemembers who have not completed their military obligations in those  units may be delayed in transitioning from active duty into the reserve or  National Guard components, potentially creating more difficulties for these  components to meet their recruiting and retention goals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Individual Ready Reserve", "paragraphs": ["The Army Reserve has also recalled members of the Individual Ready  Reserve\u2014which, according to an Army Reserve official, is used to fill  personnel shortfalls in active, reserve, and National Guard units\u2014to  address recruiting and retention difficulties.

This obligation  exists regardless of how much time is to be served in the active, reserve, or  National Guard component, or some combination of the active and reserve  or National Guard components under the enlistment contract. If the soldier  is separated from the active duty Army, reserve, or National Guard  component before the 8-year commitment has been completed, the soldier  may elect to remain in active duty Army, affiliate with the reserves, or be  assigned to the Individual Ready Reserve. In the latter case,  servicemembers are subject to recall, if needed. Almost 7,000 soldiers,  including about 600 servicemembers who volunteered to serve and about  6,400 others under contractual obligation, have been deployed from the Individual Ready Reserve since 2002.

For example, the active  Army Reserve Technical Engineer occupational specialty was overfilled by  1 servicemember in fiscal year 2000, and the active Navy Seaman  occupational specialty was overfilled by almost 6,000 servicemembers in  that same year. Similarly, we found shortages in the number of  servicemembers assigned to occupational specialties ranged from just 1  servicemember to over 8,200 servicemembers.

For example, an Air Force Reserve official told us that this  component recruited more Tactical Aircraft Avionics Systems personnel  than authorized because it is a high-demand, technical occupational  specialty that is critical to one of the Air Force Reserve\u2019s missions. As a  result, this occupational specialty has been consistently overfilled by about  160 to 240 individuals each year for the past 6 years. Furthermore, we  found that the Army\u2019s Cavalry Scout occupational specialty was overfilled  by over 200 to almost 1,000 individuals in the past 5 years and an Army  official stated that this occupational specialty was anticipated to increase  its personnel authorization levels. According to Army projections, the  current strength is still 1,700 short of the fiscal year 2007 target. Moreover,  several component officials told us that some of their occupational  specialties have consistently been overfilled because their components  needed to meet legislatively mandated aggregate personnel levels, and to  do so, they assigned personnel to occupational specialties that did not  necessarily need additional personnel.", "Table 6 also presents several reasons provided by component officials to  explain why certain occupational specialties have been consistently  underfilled. For example, component officials told us that extensive  training requirements have led the Army\u2019s Special Forces Medical Sergeant,  the Army National Guard\u2019s Power-Generation Equipment Repairer, and the  Marine Corps\u2019s Counterintelligence Specialist occupational specialties to  be consistently underfilled for the last 5 or 6 years. Furthermore, an official  in the Army National Guard stated that the occupational specialty, Motor  Transport Operator, was consistently underfilled by at least 1,800 to about  4,800 individuals in the past 6 years because the entire nation is short of  truck drivers, which poses a recruiting challenge.", "We believe that consistently over- and underfilled occupational specialties  are a systemic problem for DOD that raises questions about the validity of  occupational specialty authorizations. The fact that DOD has consistently  experienced almost 280 overfilled occupational specialties raises particular  questions about affordability. We determined that it cost the federal  government about $103,000 annually, on average, to compensate each  enlisted active duty servicemember in fiscal year 2004. Accordingly,  compensating the almost 31,000 servicemembers who served in  occupational specialties that exceeded authorized personnel levels for  fiscal year 2005 was costly. Similarly, the consistently underfilled  occupational specialties raise the question about the components\u2019 ability to  continue to achieve their mission.

Table 7 provides the OUSD-defined criteria for  occupational specialties that are critical for recruiting. An occupational  specialty must meet at least one criterion to be considered critical; the fact  that an occupational specialty is underfilled is only one of the criteria.  Accordingly, the active components identify and report to OUSD about 10  percent of their occupational specialties that they deem critical for  recruiting. For example, in OUSD\u2019s third quarter fiscal year 2005 personnel  and readiness report to the Secretary of Defense, the active components  reported accessions information on 67 occupational specialties. In  addition, the active components reported the reason why the occupational  specialties reported were deemed critical, the accession goal for these  occupational specialties, and year-to-date accessions achieved. Beginning  in 2005, OUSD further directed the active components to report critical  occupational specialties for retention as well. Table 7 also provides the  OUSD-defined criteria for occupational specialties that are critical for  retention. In fiscal year 2005, each of the active components reported 10  occupational specialties, for a total of 40 occupational specialties, which  they deemed critical for retention. Again, the active components reported  the reason why the occupational specialties reported were deemed critical;  the retention goal; number of personnel retained to date; and the number of  servicemembers authorized and assigned, or the fill rate, for each  occupational specialty reported. These 40 occupational specialties,  however, represent only 6 percent of the 625 total active duty occupational  specialties. Collectively, the critical occupational specialties (such as Army  Infantrymen and Marine Corps Counter Intelligence Specialists) that the  active components report on represent at most 16 percent of the 625 active  duty occupational specialties. Therefore, OUSD is not receiving  information on at least 84 percent of active duty occupational specialties.  Furthermore, the reserve and National Guard components are not required  to report to OUSD any information on their combined 859 occupational  specialties.

For example, the Army focused efforts on  using its recruiting Web site as a vehicle to provide video testimonials of  soldiers explaining, in their own words, what it means to be a soldier and  why others should enlist. The Army and Army Reserve increased support to  local recruiters through more public affairs efforts and by encouraging  command support of their Special Recruiter Assistance Program.

Over the last fiscal year, DOD made changes to existing  financial incentives and introduced new financial incentives. For example,  DOD expanded the pool of servicemembers who are eligible to receive a  selective reenlistment bonus. Selective reenlistment bonuses are designed  to provide a financial incentive for an adequate number of qualified mid- career enlisted members to reenlist in designated \u201ccritical\u201d occupational  specialties where retention levels are insufficient to sustain current or  projected levels necessary for a component to accomplish its mission. The  statutory authority for this bonus was amended in the Fiscal Year 2004  Authorization Act to allow the Secretary of Defense to waive the critical  skill requirement for members who reenlist or extend an enlistment while  serving in Afghanistan, Iraq, or Kuwait in support of Operations Enduring  Freedom and Iraqi Freedom.", "In addition, in February 2005, DOD announced a new retention bonus for  Special Operations Forces servicemembers (Army Special Forces, Navy  SEALs, Air Force pararescue, plus a few other occupational specialties)  who decide to remain in the military beyond 19 years of service. The largest  bonus, $150,000, may be provided to eligible servicemembers who sign up  for an additional 6 years of service. Eligible servicemembers who sign up  for shorter extensions may qualify for smaller bonuses; servicemembers  who extend for 1 additional year, for example, receive $8,000.", "Individual components also implemented changes over the last fiscal year.  Specifically, to address recruiting, the active Army component  implemented a minimum $5,000 bonus for all qualified recruits\u2014generally  based on graduation from high school and their scores on the Armed  Forces Qualification Test\u2014who enlist for 3 or more years in any military  occupational specialty. Additionally, qualified recruits with bachelor\u2019s  degrees who enlist for 2 or more years in any occupational specialty may  now receive bonuses up to $8,000; previously there were no bonuses for  recruits with those educational qualifications. The Army also increased its  maximum enlistment bonus amount, from $10,000 up to $14,000, for  applicants who enlist for 3 or more years into certain occupational  specialties, such as Cannon Crewmember, Cavalry Scout, and Crypto- Linguist Analyst.", "To address retention, the active Army, Navy, and Air Force components  implemented the Critical Skills Retention Bonus program and the  Assignment Incentive Pay program. The Critical Skills Retention Bonus  program allows the components to target reenlistment bonuses at certain  occupational specialties that have been identified as critical. The bonus is  adjusted to meet current operational needs. For example, in fiscal year  2004, the Army offered the Critical Skills Retention Bonus to soldiers who  were serving in special operations occupational specialties. In fiscal year  2005, the Army granted eligibility to 11 additional occupational specialties.  These occupational specialties included recruiters, unmanned aerial  vehicle operators, psychological operations specialists, and explosive  ordnance disposal specialists. The Assignment Incentive Pay program,  which provides up to $1,500 a month for enlisted servicemembers, was  approved by the Under Secretary of Defense for implementation by the  Navy, Air Force, and Army in early 2005. Assignment Incentive Pay is used  to encourage servicemembers to volunteer for difficult-to-fill occupational  specialties or assignments in less desirable locations. For example, for  personnel in special operations occupational specialties to qualify for this  pay, servicemembers must have more than 25 years of service, be  designated by the Special Operations Command combatant commander as  \u201coperators,\u201d and remain on active duty for an additional minimum of 12  months.", "The Army also implemented a Life Cycle Unit Bonus program designed to  encourage servicemembers to commit to hard-to-fill occupational  specialties in targeted units in fiscal year 2005. Army officials stated that  this may help them address shortages of soldiers assigned to units at  certain locations. When the program began, soldiers received up to $15,000  if they reenlisted and agreed to serve in certain units stationed at Fort  Campbell, Kentucky; Fort Bliss and Fort Hood, Texas; and Fort Lewis,  Washington.", "During fiscal year 2005, the Army Reserve and Army National Guard also  increased some of their incentives to address recruiting and retention  efforts. In fiscal year 2005, the Army allowed the reserve and National  Guard components to increase their prior service enlistment bonus from  $8,000 up to $15,000.

The  fact that several occupational specialties have been consistently overfilled  raises critical questions about affordability and whether the department is  using its recruiting and retention resources most effectively. Similarly,  DOD\u2019s consistently underfilled occupational specialties raise concerns as  to how the department can meet operational demands with what appear to  be chronic shortages in certain occupational specialties. This latter issue is  particularly relevant given the stresses on the force from prolonged  operations in Iraq; the Global War on Terrorism; and most recently,  significant disaster relief efforts in the Gulf Coast region. DOD is not in a  position to develop a comprehensive recruiting and retention plan to  address these and other issues because it lacks complete information from  the 10 components on the occupational specialties that are over- or  underfilled and the reasons why these conditions exist. Moreover, without  this information, the department is not in a position to effectively  communicate its true recruiting and retention challenges to Congress.", "Recently, Congress has provided increasing amounts of funding to assist  DOD\u2019s recruiting and retention efforts. While some components have used  this funding to increase financial incentives to address both aggregate and  occupational-specialty-specific recruiting and retention challenges, these  increases in incentives are costly. Given the fiscally constrained  environment we are facing now and in years to come, DOD can no longer  afford to take a \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d approach to managing its force. In some  cases, DOD\u2019s components have provided financial incentives to  servicemembers in occupational specialties that are overfilled. While there  may be valid reasons for providing these incentives to some  servicemembers in these occupational specialities, DOD does not require  the components to fully justify their decisions on financial incentives,  which restricts the department\u2019s ability to provide assurance to the  Secretary of Defense, Congress, and the taxpayer that the increasing  funding spent on recruiting and retention is appropriately and effectively  targeted to occupational specialties for which components have the  greatest need."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To provide greater understanding of the recruiting and retention issues and  improve the department\u2019s oversight for these issues, we recommend that  the Secretary of Defense direct the Under Secretary of Defense for  Personnel and Readiness, in concert with the Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Reserve Affairs, to take the following two actions:  Require the 10 components to  report annually on all (not just critical) over- and underfilled  occupational specialties,  provide an analysis of why occupational specialties are over- and   report annually on and justify their use of enlistment and  reenlistment bonuses provided to servicemembers in occupational  specialties that exceed their authorized personnel levels.", "Develop a management action plan that will help the components to  identify and address the root causes of their recruiting and retention  challenges."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on a draft of this report, DOD partially concurred with  our two recommendations. DOD\u2019s comments are included in this report as  appendix V.", "DOD partially concurred with our first recommendation to require the ten  components to report annually to the Office of the Under Secretary of  Defense for Personnel and Readiness on all over- and underfilled  occupational specialties; provide an analysis of why specific occupational  specialties are over- and underfilled; and report annually on and justify  their use of enlistment and reenlistment bonuses provided to  servicemembers in occupational specialties that exceed their authorized  personnel levels.  DOD stated that it already has visibility over  occupational specialties deemed most critical for retention, which it  captures through the Balanced Scorecard process.  However, as we note in  this report, the occupational specialties that the components report as  critical for recruitment or retention account for only a small percentage of  the total number of occupational specialties\u2014at most only 16 percent of all  occupational specialties are reported as critical.  Therefore, the department  does not have visibility over at least 84 percent of its occupational  specialties.  DOD asserted that our definition of over- and underfilled  occupational specialties (those that were over- or under their authorized  levels by one or more individuals) is unreasonably strict.  However, as we  note in this report, we established this definition because we found that  DOD lacks common criteria that define thresholds for over- and underfilled  occupational specialties.  In prior work, we determined that it costs the  federal government about $103,000 annually, on average, to compensate  each enlisted active duty servicemember in fiscal year 2004; thus we  believe each individual serving in an occupational specialty that is over the  authorized personnel level represents a significant cost to the government.   For example, we found about 8,400 active duty servicemembers serving in  consistently overfilled occupational specialties in 2005.  If we apply the  2004 average compensation amount to the 8,400 servicemembers, the  additional cost to the taxpayer would be about $870 million.  In addition,  the taxpayer bears the unnecessary costs of supporting over 22,000  servicemembers in consistently overfilled occupational specialties in the  reserve and National Guard components.  DOD also provided in its  response an example of an overfilled occupational specialty, and its  rationale that this occupational specialty was overfilled as a function of  ramping up to meet a future strength requirement.  Our report  acknowledges this and other reasons the components provided for over-  and underfilled occupational specialties.  We believe that this example  underscores the need for our recommendation that the components  provide an analysis of why occupational specialties are over- or underfilled.   Without this type of analysis, OSD is not in a position to assess the extent to  which all specialties are over- or underfilled, determine if the overfilled and  underfilled positions are justified, and identify any needed corrective  action.  Also, DOD agreed with the need to closely manage financial  incentive programs.  However, we believe that DOD needs sufficient  information from the components to determine if the reasons for offering  bonuses to individuals in consistently overfilled occupational specialties  are, indeed, justified.  We continue to be concerned that all financial  incentives may not be justified.  Currently, the components are not required  to provide fully transparent rationales for bonuses they provide to  servicemembers in noncritical occupational specialties, which as we have  stated earlier, make up at least 84 percent of the components total  occupational specialties.  Without greater transparency over the use of  financial incentives, the department cannot truly know if funding spent on  recruiting and retention efforts is appropriately and effectively targeted to  occupational specialties for which the components have the greatest need.", "DOD partially concurred with our second recommendation to develop a  management action plan that will help the components to identify and  address the root causes of their recruiting and retention challenges.  In  response, DOD noted that its Enlisted Personnel Management Plan  (EPMP), formally established by DOD Directive 1304.20 in July 2005,  substantially achieves this recommendation.  We believe DOD is moving in  the right direction in addressing recruiting and retention challenges and, in  this report, we acknowledge that DOD issued directive 1304.20 that  requires the components to meet aggregate and occupational specialty  specific authorized personnel levels.  However, this plan cited in DOD\u2019s  comments did not exist at the time we conducted our audit work and we  believe DOD needs to continue to move forward to establish this plan.", "DOD also stated that it has already laid the framework for this type of plan  through monthly reviews of other reports and quarterly reviews of its  Balanced Scorecard reports.  DOD claimed these omissions in our draft  report result in an incomplete description of management controls.  We  disagree since as stated earlier, the EPMP did not exist at the time we  conducted our audit work and furthermore, we do acknowledge in this  report that the department receives quarterly updates of critical  occupational specialties through the Office of the Under Secretary of  Defense\u2019s personnel and readiness report.

We  calculated the fill rate for each occupational specialty by dividing the  number of servicemembers assigned to the occupational specialty by the  authorization. We then counted the number of years that each occupational  specialty in each component was over- or underfilled. Because most of the  components have not identified acceptable thresholds for over- and  underfilled occupational specialties, we used the strictest interpretation of  these terms. In our analysis, if a component had one person more than its  authorization, we considered the occupational specialty to be overfilled.  Similiarly, if a component had one person less than its authorization, we  considered the occupational specialty to be underfilled. If an occupational  specialty was overfilled for at least 5 of the 6 years, we considered the  occupational specialty \u201cconsistently\u201d overfilled. Similarly, if an  occupational specialty was underfilled for at least 5 of the 6 years, we  considered the occupational specialty \u201cconsistently\u201d underfilled. Some  occupational specialties have changed over the 6-year period of our  analyses. In these cases, we combined the original and new occupational  specialties. For example, in the Army, the occupational specialty for Divers  changed the identifier from 00B to 21D in 2004. We combined these two  occupational specialties by summing the entries for each year and retaining  it in our data set as one entry. In those cases where we could not determine  how to merge occupational specialties, we retained the original data in our  data set.", "To analyze the steps DOD and the components have taken to address their  recruiting and retention difficulties, we interviewed key DOD officials from  each component, including headquarters and recruiting commands, to  obtain an understanding of recruiter, advertising, and incentive programs  as well as overall recruiting and retention difficulties.

We also interviewed Office of  the Secretary of Defense officials to understand overall DOD policies and  future direction for reviewing recruiting and retention goals. We obtained  and reviewed various accession plans, incentive programs, and marketing  initiatives. To determine the extent to which personnel in consistently  overfilled occupational specialties received bonuses, we obtained data  from the active components on the occupational specialties for which  servicemembers were qualified to receive enlistment or reenlistment  bonuses in fiscal years 2000 through 2004 and for fiscal year 2005 as of  June 30. We compared the occupational specialties for which  servicemembers received bonuses to those occupational specialties that  we found to be consistently overfilled, as well as those that were overfilled  in any year.
