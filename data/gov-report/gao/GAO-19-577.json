This study also found that the high medical costs of  obesity are due to extremely high medical costs among a small  percentage of the population who have severe obesity (those with a BMI  of 40 or higher). In addition, a 2017 study found that medical expenditures  rise most rapidly for individuals with a BMI of 40 or higher.", "One option for the treatment of obesity is the use of prescription obesity  drugs. As of June 2019, there were nine prescription drugs approved by  FDA to treat obesity. Four obesity drugs\u2014benzphetamine,  diethylpropion, phendimetrazine, and phentermine\u2014were approved by  FDA in 1961 or earlier for short-term use, which is generally about 12  weeks, and are available as generic drugs. The remaining five obesity  drugs were approved by FDA in 1999 or later for long-term use and are  available as brand-name drugs\u2014 bupropion/naltrexone (Contrave),  liraglutide (Saxenda), lorcaserin (Belviq), orlistat (Xenical), and  phentermine/topiramate (Qsymia). Each of these five brand-name  obesity drugs underwent one or more randomized, controlled clinical trials  for safety and efficacy prior to FDA approval of the drug\u2014a total of 15  clinical trials across the five drugs. Obesity drugs work in different ways;  some may help an individual feel full sooner or less hungry, while others  may reduce fat absorption in the body. Results vary by medication and by  person, but, according to the National Institutes of Health, on average,  people who take obesity drugs as part of a lifestyle program lose between  3 and 9 percent more of their starting body weight than people in a  lifestyle program who do not take obesity drugs. As with other prescription  drugs, obesity drugs may have side effects such as headache, dizziness,  dry mouth, nausea, and diarrhea. And, as with other prescription drugs,  health care providers may prescribe an obesity drug for off-label use\u2014 that is, for a different medical condition, in a different dosage, or for a  different duration than for which the drug is FDA approved.", "Obesity drugs should be used as an adjunct to lifestyle therapy (e.g., diet,  physical activity, and behavioral counseling), according to guidelines from  several medical associations.

In addition, the  guidelines recommend evaluating the patient\u2019s weight loss after about 12  to 16 weeks of treatment with an obesity drug and discontinuing the drug  if the patient has not lost a certain amount (e.g., at least 5 percent) of  their initial body weight.", "Although obesity is classified as a disease, some health care providers,  including those who specialize in the care of patients with obesity,  continue to stigmatize patients with obesity. For example, a 2018 study  reported that health care providers may perceive patients with obesity as  being less compliant and having less self-discipline than other patients.  Additionally, health care providers may not initiate discussions about  weight loss with patients because of lack of time, other important issues  or concerns, a belief that a patient is not motivated or interested in losing  weight, or concern over a patient\u2019s emotional state, according to another  2018 study."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Prevalence of Obesity Was Close to 40 Percent among All U.S. Adults from 2013 through 2016", "paragraphs": ["The prevalence of obesity was about 38 percent among all U.S. adults  (about four of every 10 adults) from 2013 through 2016, according to  nationally representative estimates from CDC.

In addition, one medical association we contacted indicated  physicians consider clinical preventive service recommendations from the  U.S. Preventive Services Task Force on the use of obesity drugs. The  task force recommends that clinicians offer or refer adults with a BMI of  30 or higher to intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions.  Further, a systematic review of evidence of the benefits and harms of  behavioral therapy and use of obesity drugs conducted for the task force  found that obesity drugs, but not behavior-based interventions, were  associated with higher rates of harm. The potential for harm (i.e.,  adverse events) may discourage physicians and other health care  providers from prescribing these drugs. In addition, officials we  interviewed and the studies we reviewed noted that a lack of insurance  coverage, high out-of-pocket costs, and the patient\u2019s means to afford  obesity drugs may also discourage physicians from prescribing obesity  drugs.", "The officials and studies also noted that physicians might have gaps in  knowledge about obesity drugs. For example, officials from one medical  association noted that lack of education is a barrier to physicians in  prescribing obesity drugs for patients who would be candidates for them,  and officials from another medical association said that many clinicians  are not aware that there are FDA-approved drugs for obesity, and  therefore they do not think about prescribing them. One study we  reviewed found that, of the 111 primary care providers responding to a  survey, most reported limited experience with obesity drugs as a barrier  to prescribing them. While guidelines on the use of obesity drugs  suggest prescribing obesity drugs as an adjunct to other diet and lifestyle  changes, or when other approaches have not resulted in clinically  significant weight loss, physicians and other health care providers may  not understand the recommendations outlined in the guidelines.

According to officials from  an advocacy group, specific considerations include (1) the patient\u2019s other  health conditions that may increase the risk from using a particular  obesity drug (contraindications); (2) the ability of an obesity drug to treat  both the patient\u2019s obesity and other health conditions; (3) the patient\u2019s  ability to afford a particular obesity drug, given their insurance coverage  and other financial resources; (4) patient preference regarding the dosage  and form of the drug; and (5) the average efficacy (weight loss) of an  obesity drug. Further, when treating obesity, providers use the least  invasive treatments, such as lifestyle-based therapies first, then escalate  to obesity drugs if noninvasive treatments prove ineffective, according to  officials from the same advocacy group."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Limited Data Are Available on Individuals Who Have Used Obesity Drugs", "paragraphs": ["Some limited data are available on individuals who have used obesity  drugs, including data on the distribution of BMI, the use of obesity drugs  in conjunction with other items or services, whether these individuals  adhered to using the prescribed obesity drug or maintained their weight  loss over time, and the impact that using obesity drugs has on other  medical services directly related to obesity. The following is a summary of  available information on specific aspects of individuals who have used  obesity drugs.", "Distribution of BMI across individuals who have used obesity drugs.  CDC\u2019s nationally representative estimates for 2013 through 2016 found  that the BMI of adults who reported that they used obesity drugs ranged  from 21 to 64, with a median BMI of 34. However, these data are limited  because they do not indicate how long the individual used the drugs  before their BMI was measured.", "Use of obesity drugs in conjunction with other items or services.  Two studies we reviewed examined the use of obesity drugs in  conjunction with other items or services. These studies found that  participants who used an obesity drug in conjunction with other services,  such as behavioral counseling, lost more weight than those who did not  take the drug with the other services. For example, in one 2019 study,  participants who received intensive behavioral therapy combined with an  obesity drug, liraglutide, had nearly double the weight loss (an average of  about 12 percent of their body weight) compared to the participants who  received only intensive behavioral therapy (an average of about 6 percent  of their body weight). In addition, the 15 clinical trials for the brand-name  obesity drugs that we reviewed generally found that a significantly higher  percentage of participants who used the obesity drug combined with other  items or services (such as a low-calorie diet or increased physical activity)  achieved 5 percent or more weight loss compared to participants who  used a placebo with the other items or services. One clinical trial that  used an intensive behavior modification program (28 group sessions)  found higher average weight loss (9 percent loss of initial body weight) for  participants who used the obesity drug (bupropion/naltrexone) than for  the placebo group. This clinical trial also found that the placebo group  with the intensive behavior modification had higher weight loss than  placebo groups in the other clinical trials, none of which used intensive  behavioral therapy.", "Adherence to using the prescribed obesity drug. FDA\u2019s analysis of  Sentinel System data of obesity drugs dispensed in 2008 through 2017  found that in the majority of patients using obesity drugs, cumulative  treatment duration was 90 days or less. FDA analyzed data for 267,836  new users of obesity drugs and found that about 58 percent of patients  who used any of the obesity drugs did so for 90 days or less; about 31  percent used any of the obesity drugs for 30 or fewer days. The average  duration for the first use of any of the nine obesity drugs was 69 days.  (See appendix V for more data from FDA\u2019s analysis.) FDA\u2019s findings are  consistent with the findings of two of the three studies that we reviewed  that measured adherence to using the prescribed obesity drug. These  studies reported that use of obesity drugs dropped significantly after 30  days. For example, one 2018 study that reviewed 1 year of data on  26,522 patients who had new prescription drug claims for one of four  obesity drugs (liraglutide, lorcaserin, bupropion/naltrexone, and  phentermine/topiramate) found that adherence to using any of the four  obesity drugs dropped markedly during the first month following the initial  claim for the drug. In addition, while the 15 clinical trials we reviewed  were not designed to measure adherence to taking obesity drugs, they  provide some information on whether or not study participants adhered to  using these drugs during the trials. Participant dropout rates for these  clinical trials ranged from 14 percent to 66 percent for the obesity drug  treatment and the placebo groups, which could indicate difficulty in  adherence to the study regimen; however, participants using the placebo  generally had higher dropout rates than those using the obesity drug. The  reasons for discontinuation among study participants in the clinical trials  included side effects, such as headaches and nausea; being unavailable  for follow up; and withdrawal of consent.", "Maintaining weight loss over time by individuals who have used  obesity drugs. The recent systematic review conducted for the U.S.  Preventive Services Task Force noted that data on long-term weight loss  with obesity drugs are limited. The review found that individuals using  obesity drugs were more likely to maintain their weight loss over 12 to 36  months compared with placebo, but noted that the evidence was limited  by the small number of trials for each medication, poor follow up with  participants, and limited applicability (given that participants had to meet  narrowly defined inclusion criteria), among other limitations. We also  identified six studies\u2014each of which reviewed one of the FDA-approved  obesity drugs\u2014that examined weight loss maintenance, generally after  about 1 year. For example, a 2018 study for one obesity drug (lorcaserin)  found that while the obesity drug initially improved upon weight loss  achieved with weight loss maintenance counseling, this advantage was  not maintained at 1 year. That is, after 1 year, there was no significant  difference in weight loss maintenance between the participants treated  with the obesity drug along with counseling, compared to those treated  with placebo along with counseling. Another study that examined clinical  trial data for one obesity drug (bupropion/naltrexone) concluded that  participants who lost at least 5 percent of their body weight after 16  weeks were likely to maintain clinically significant weight loss (of at least 5  percent) after 1 year of treatment with the drug.", "The impact of using obesity drugs on medical services directly  related to obesity. We did not identify any studies on the impact that the  use of obesity drugs had on the utilization of medical services directly  related to obesity. In terms of studies on the impact on health outcomes,  the systematic review conducted for the U.S. Preventive Services Task  Force concluded that health outcomes data for individuals receiving  treatment with obesity drugs were limited. The review reported that  clinical trials of obesity drugs for weight loss examined few outcomes  beyond quality of life measures, and that none of the drug-based  maintenance trials reported the effects of the obesity drug interventions  on health outcomes. The review noted that the trials included in the review were of highly selected populations with multiple exclusions  relevant to health outcomes (e.g., history of serious medical conditions).  The review further noted that while it appears that weight loss  interventions, including obesity drugs, can reduce diabetes incidence,  larger studies with longer-term follow up are required to understand the  full benefits of these interventions on health outcomes and whether those  effects are long lasting."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Health Insurance Coverage for Obesity Drugs Is Limited and Varied across Types of Insurance", "paragraphs": ["Health insurance coverage for obesity drugs is limited\u2014that is, not all  public and private health insurance provided coverage for obesity drugs  or may have additional requirements to determine these drugs are  medically necessary.
