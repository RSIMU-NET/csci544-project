States participating in PRAMS use a consistent data  collection methodology that allows for comparisons among states, but it  does not allow for development of national estimates because states  participating in PRAMS were not selected to be representative of the  nation. In addition, PRAMS data cannot be generalized to all pregnant  women because they represent only those women whose pregnancies  resulted in live births; the data do not include women whose pregnancies  ended with fetal deaths or abortions or women who were victims of  homicide. PRAMS is based on self-reported data and, because some  women are unwilling to disclose violence, the findings may underestimate  abuse.", "Studies have also estimated the prevalence of violence within certain  states and communities and among narrowly defined study populations.  These estimates lack comparability and cannot be generalized or projected  to all pregnant women. Many of the studies do not employ random  samples and are disproportionately weighted toward specific demographic  or socioeconomic populations. Most of the 11 such studies we reviewed,  which were published from 1998 through 2001, found prevalence rates of  violence during pregnancy ranging from 5.2 percent to 14.0 percent. In a  CDC-sponsored 1996 review of the literature, the majority of studies  reported prevalence levels of 3.9 percent to 8.3 percent. The variability in  estimates could reflect differences in study populations and  methodologies, such as differences in how violence is defined, the time  period used to measure violence, and the method used to collect the data.", "Research on whether being pregnant places women at increased risk for  violence is inconclusive. CDC reported that additional research is needed  in this area, but that current study findings suggest that for most abused  women, physical violence does not seem to be initiated or to increase  during pregnancy. Although some women experience violence for the first  time during pregnancy, the majority of abused pregnant women  experienced violence before pregnancy. In one study we reviewed, only 2  percent of women who reported not being abused before pregnancy  reported abuse during pregnancy. The same study also found that, for  some women, the period of pregnancy may be less risky, with violence  abating during pregnancy; 41 percent of the women who reported abuse in  the year before pregnancy did not experience abuse during pregnancy.  Studies have found other factors to be associated with violence during  pregnancy, including younger age of the woman, lower socioeconomic  status, abuse of alcohol and other drugs by victims and perpetrators of  violence, and unintended pregnancy.", "To increase the generalizability of research on the prevalence and risk of  violence to women during pregnancy, researchers have reported the need  for more population-based studies that would allow for comparisons of  pregnant and nonpregnant women. These studies would draw their  samples from all pregnant women, not just those receiving health care or  giving birth, as well as nonpregnant women. Such research could indicate  whether pregnant women are at increased risk for violence compared to  their nonpregnant counterparts. Researchers have also suggested using  methodologies that consistently define and measure the prevalence of  violence.

The FBI and CDC are the two federal  agencies that collect and report information on homicides nationwide;  however, neither agency collects data on whether female homicide victims  were pregnant or recently pregnant. According to CDC, 17 states, New  York City, and Puerto Rico collect data related to pregnancy status on  their death certificates, but the data collected are not comparable.  Included in these data are victims who may not have been pregnant at the  time of death but had been \u201crecently\u201d pregnant; in addition, states\u2019 criteria  for recent pregnancy ranged from 42 days to 1 year after birth.

While there are questions on some states\u2019 death certificates  regarding pregnancy status, officials in the four states we contacted  (Illinois, Maryland, New Mexico, and New York) told us that these data are  incomplete and may understate the number of pregnant homicide victims.  For example, if the pregnancy item on the death certificate is left blank,  there is no way to easily determine whether an autopsy, if conducted,  included a test or examination for pregnancy. Moreover, researchers have  reported that physicians completing death certificates after a pregnant  woman\u2019s death failed to report that the woman was pregnant or had a  recent pregnancy in at least 50 percent of the cases.", "To address these limitations, all four states we contacted are making  efforts to compare death certificate data with other datasets and records\u2014 such as medical examiners\u2019 reports\u2014to identify pregnant or recently  pregnant homicide victims. They told us that they are reviewing the data in  order to determine if there is something they can do to prevent violent  deaths of pregnant women or help women who are victimized. For  example, the Maryland medical examiner\u2019s office conducted a study of the  deaths of females aged 10 to 50 to determine if these women were  pregnant when they died. Several sources of data\u2014death certificates,  medical examiners\u2019 reports, and recent live birth and fetal death records\u2014 from a 6-year period were linked. Of the 247 women who were identified  as pregnant or recently pregnant, 27 percent were identified through  examining cause of death information on death certificates. The remaining  73 percent were identified by matching the woman\u2019s death certificate with  recent birth and fetal death records and by reviewing data from medical  examiners\u2019 records, such as autopsy reports or police records. Similarly,  New York officials determined through dataset links (death certificates,  fetal death records, recent birth certificates, and hospital discharge  records) that, in 1997, 9 of 174 female homicide victims aged 10 to 54 were  pregnant or recently pregnant at the time of death, rather than the 1 of 174  that death certificate data alone would have indicated. Officials from New  York and Maryland told us these efforts to link datasets are dependent on  records being computerized. Some state officials also told us they did not  have the resources to conduct these analyses on a continuing basis.", "There are two federal initiatives under development that propose to  collect data on the number of homicides of pregnant women. CDC is  proposing a revision of the U.S. standard certificate of death used for the  National Vital Statistics System to include five categories related to  pregnancy status. (See fig. 1.) Each state has the option of adopting the  U.S. standard certificate for its death certificate or excluding or adding  data elements. If the revision is approved, CDC expects several states to  implement it in 2003, with an increasing number using it each year.", "CDC is also beginning to implement the National Violent Death Reporting  System (NVDRS), which, as currently envisioned, would collect data that  could determine the number of pregnant homicide victims. CDC plans to  collect data from a variety of state and local government databases on  deaths resulting from homicide and suicide. Like the Maryland and New  York efforts, NVDRS would link several databases, such as death and  medical examiners\u2019 records, to identify pregnant homicide victims.  According to CDC, implementation of NVDRS depends on future funding;  full implementation would take at least 5 years. The estimated federal cost  of this system is $10 million in start-up costs and $20 million in annual  operating costs; these estimates primarily consist of expenditures for  providing technical assistance to the states and funding for state personnel  to collect the data."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Multiple Strategies Designed to Prevent Violence, But Effect Is Unknown", "paragraphs": ["Violence prevention strategies for both pregnant and nonpregnant women  include measures to prevent initial incidents of violence, such as educating  women about warning signs of abuse, and intervention activities that  identify and respond to violence after it has occurred.

They also include  training parents, police officers, and other community officials to be  resources for youth seeking assistance about teenage dating violence.  Primary prevention efforts also have been targeted to pregnant women.  For example, the Domestic Violence During Pregnancy Prevention  Program in Saginaw, Michigan, provided 15-minute counseling sessions to  pregnant women who reported that they had not experienced violence.  Women were educated about intimate partner violence and given tools  and information to help prevent abuse in their lives, including information  on behaviors typical of abusive men, warning signs of abuse, and  community resources.", "Interventions to deal with violence that has occurred are designed to  identify victims and to prevent additional violence through such actions as  providing an assessment of danger, developing a safety plan, and providing  information about and referral to community resources. For example,  HRSA has funded a demonstration program to develop or enhance  systems that identify pregnant women experiencing intimate partner  violence and provide appropriate information and links to services. The  HRSA program funds four projects; each project is funded at $150,000 a  year for 3 years.", "Screening for the presence of violence is generally the initial component of  intervention efforts to prevent additional violence against pregnant  women. Many experts view the period of pregnancy as a unique  opportunity for intervention. Pregnant women who receive prenatal care  may have frequent contact with providers, which allows for the  development of relationships that may facilitate disclosure of violence. For  example, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists  (ACOG) recommends that physicians screen all patients for intimate  partner violence and that screening for pregnant women occur at several  times over the course of their pregnancies. Some women do not disclose  abuse the first time they are asked, or abuse may begin later in pregnancy.  Some of the barriers to women\u2019s disclosure of violence are fear of  escalating violence, feelings of shame and embarrassment, concern about  confidentiality, fear of police involvement, and denial of abuse. In  addition, some health care officials told us that the period of pregnancy  may be a difficult time for a woman to leave or take action against the  abuser because of financial concerns and pressures to provide the child  with a father.", "Studies have found that fewer than half of physicians routinely screen  women for violence during pregnancy. For example, a survey of ACOG  fellows reported that 39 percent of respondents routinely screened for  violence at the first prenatal visit. The study found that screening was  more likely to occur when the obstetrician-gynecologist suspected a  patient was being abused. Another study that surveyed primary care  physicians who provide prenatal care found that only 17 percent of  respondents routinely screened at the first prenatal visit and 5 percent at  follow-up visits. Across the 15 states with PRAMS data for 1998, from 25  percent to 40 percent of women reported that a physician or other health  care provider talked to them about intimate partner violence during any of  their prenatal care visits.", "CDC and providers of prevention services have reported that reasons for  physicians\u2019 reluctance to screen women for violence include lack of time  and resources, personal discomfort about discussing the topic, concern  about offending patients, belief that asking invades family privacy, and  frustration with patients who are not ready to leave or who return to their  abusers. Lack of training and education on how to screen for intimate  partner violence and lack of knowledge about what to do if a woman  reports experiencing intimate partner violence have also been cited as  barriers to physician screening. In its report on family violence, the  Institute of Medicine stated that health professionals\u2019 training and  education about family violence are inadequate and recommended that the  Secretary of HHS establish education and research centers to develop  training programs that prepare health professionals to respond to family  violence.", "Criminal justice approaches to preventing violence against women include  apprehending and sanctioning the batterer, preventing further contact  between the abuser and the victim, and connecting the victim to  community services. In addition, batterer intervention programs, which  have existed for over 20 years as a criminal justice intervention, are often  used as a component of pretrial or diversion programs or as part of  sentencing. Batterer programs can include classes or treatment groups,  evaluation, individual counseling, or case management; their goals are  rehabilitation and behavioral change.", "To assist communities, policymakers, and individuals in combating  violence against women, the National Advisory Council on Violence  Against Women and VAWO developed a Web-based resource for  instruction and guidance. These guidelines include recommendations for  strengthening prevention efforts and improving services and advocacy for  victims.

Each state selects a stratified sample of new mothers every month  from eligible birth certificates and then collects data through mailings and  follow-up telephone calls to nonrespondents. A birth certificate is eligible  for the PRAMS sample if the mother was a resident of the state. For 1998,  the most recent year for which CDC has reported comprehensive data for  PRAMS, states used a standardized questionnaire that asked women if  their husbands or partners physically abused them during their most  recent pregnancy. PRAMS defined physical abuse as pushing, hitting,  slapping, kicking, or any other way of physically hurting someone.
