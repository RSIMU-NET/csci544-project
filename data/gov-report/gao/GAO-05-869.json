Grazing occurs primarily on federal land located in the western states managed by 10 federal agencies. Generally, the fee is based on animal unit months (AUM)--the amount of forage that a cow and her calf can eat in 1 month. For most federal land, the fee per AUM is established by a formula. Advocates argue that grazing uses federal land productively and that the grazing fee is fair. Opponents argue that grazing damages public resources and that grazing fees are too low. GAO was asked to determine the (1) extent of, and purposes for, grazing in fiscal year 2004 on lands 10 federal agencies manage; (2) amount federal agencies spent in fiscal year 2004 to manage grazing; (3) total grazing receipts the 10 agencies collected in fiscal year 2004 and amounts disbursed; and (4) fees charged in 2004 by the 10 agencies, western states, and ranchers, and reasons for any differences. In commenting on a draft of this report, the Department of the Interior and the Forest Service neither agreed nor disagreed with the findings. The Forest Service stated that the report accurately described the purpose of the grazing fee. The Army and Air Force and the Department of Energy provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. The departments of Commerce and of Justice responded that they did not have comments."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The 10 federal agencies managed more than 22.6 million AUMs on about 235 million acres of federal lands for grazing and land management in fiscal year 2004. Of this total, the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Forest Service managed more than 98 percent of the lands used for grazing. The agencies manage their grazing programs under different authorities and for different purposes. For BLM lands and western Forest Service lands, grazing is a major program; the eight other agencies generally use grazing as a tool to achieve their primary land management goals. In fiscal year 2004, federal agencies spent a total of at least $144 million. The 10 federal agencies spent at least $135.9 million, with the Forest Service and BLM accounting for the majority. Other federal agencies have grazing-related activities, such as pest control, and spent at least $8.4 million in fiscal year 2004. The 10 federal agencies' grazing fees generated about $21 million in fiscal year 2004--less than one-sixth of the expenditures to manage grazing. Of that amount, the agencies distributed about $5.7 million to states and counties in which grazing occurred, returned about $3.8 million to the Treasury, and deposited at least $11.7 million in separate Treasury accounts to help pay for agency programs, among other things. The amounts each agency distributed varied, depending on the agencies' differing authorities. Fees charged in 2004 by the 10 federal agencies, as well as state land agencies and private ranchers, vary widely. The grazing fee BLM and the Forest Service charge, which was $1.43 per AUM in 2004, is established by formula and is generally much lower than the fees charged by the other federal agencies, states, and private ranchers. The other agencies, states, and ranchers generally established fees to obtain the market value of the forage. The formula used to calculate the BLM and Forest Service grazing fee incorporates ranchers' ability to pay; therefore the current purpose of the fee is not primarily to recover the agencies' expenditures or to capture the fair market value of forage. As a result, BLM's and the Forest Service's grazing receipts fell short of their expenditures on grazing in fiscal year 2004 by almost $115 million. The BLM and Forest Service fee also decreased by 40 percent from 1980 to 2004, while grazing fees charged by private ranchers increased by 78 percent for the same period. If the purpose of the fee were to recover expenditures, BLM and the Forest Service would have had to charge $7.64 and $12.26 per AUM, respectively; alternately, if the purpose were to gain a fair market value, the agencies' fees would vary depending on the market. Differences in resources and legal requirements can cause fees to vary; however, the approaches used by other agencies could close the gap in expenditures and receipts or more closely align BLM and Forest Service fees with market prices. The purpose of the grazing fee is, ultimately, for the Congress to determine."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since the early 1900s, the federal government has required ranchers to pay  a fee for grazing their livestock on millions of acres of federal land located  primarily in western states. On many federal lands, if these ranchers  comply with permit or lease conditions, they may be able to renew their  permits or leases indefinitely, effectively adding forage, and hence value, to  their operations. Over the years, this arrangement has spurred controversy  across a range of issues. Advocates of grazing on federal lands contend that  grazing is a productive use of these lands and supports local economic  development. Advocates also believe that the fee charged is fair, allows  ranchers to stay in business, and provides stability to small rural  communities. Opponents argue that grazing damages public resources,  such as wildlife habitat, threatened and endangered species, and water  quality. Opponents also argue that federal expenditures for grazing are too  high and that fees charged for grazing are far too low, thereby contributing  to increased grazing and deterioration of range conditions.", "Ten federal agencies have programs to allow private ranchers to graze  livestock on portions of the lands they manage: the Department of the  Interior\u2019s (Interior) Bureau of Land Management (BLM), National Park  Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and Bureau of Reclamation  (Reclamation); the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) Forest  Service; the Department of Energy (DOE); and the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) Army, Army Corps of Engineers (Corps), Air Force, and Navy. In  general, agencies manage their grazing programs by establishing permit or  lease conditions, monitoring livestock numbers and resource conditions,  planning and overseeing projects to improve rangeland, and working with  ranchers and local communities. While federal lands in the eastern states  are also used for grazing, grazing occurs primarily on the agencies\u2019 lands  located in 17 western states. Other federal agencies, such as USDA\u2019s  Wildlife Services and the Department of Justice (Justice), do not have  grazing programs but do conduct activities that support these programs.  For example, Justice provides legal services to federal agencies, including  litigation of federal grazing lawsuits.", "Grazing fees are set in several ways. The fee charged for grazing on BLM  and Forest Service lands is set using a formula first called for under the  Public Rangelands Improvement Act (PRIA) of 1978. The formula, which  expired in 1985 but was continued in 1986 by Executive Order 12548,  results in a price per animal unit month (AUM)\u2014that is, the amount of  forage (vegetation such as grass and shrubs) that a cow and her calf eat in a  month (or one bull, one steer, one horse, or five sheep). Fees can be  specifically set by legislation, or agencies are authorized, under certain  circumstances, to charge user fees under the Independent Offices  Appropriation Act (IOAA). Office of Management and Budget (OMB)", "Circular A-25, which further interprets IOAA, states that user fees can be  established to recover the full cost of managing a program or to seek a fair  market value\u2014that is, the price set through competitive bids or market  prices. When fees are set through competitive bidding, they achieve a fair  market value\u2014that is, the price that a willing and knowledgeable buyer  pays and a willing and knowledgeable seller accepts. Competitive bidding  usually includes the use of either sealed bids or public auction, advertising  the permit or lease, and awarding it to the highest bidder. In lieu of  competition, fees can be set to achieve market value based on an estimate  or appraisal of comparable properties.", "Changes in the livestock industry, as well as continued disagreement  between advocates and opponents of grazing have, over the last 2 decades,  resulted in several efforts to reform federal grazing fees for BLM and Forest  Service lands. In 1986 and 1992, the two agencies studied alternative  approaches to value grazing on federal rangelands and the fee charged. In  1994, the Administration considered administrative changes to the fee and  range management regulations. In the late 1990s, the Senate passed  legislation to reform the fee to reflect beef production from federal lands,  but Congress ultimately did not enact this legislation. In 2003, attention  turned to buyouts of federal grazing permits and leases in addition to  grazing fees. Because of changes in the livestock industry\u2014increasing  conflict with other users of federal land, fluctuating prices of beef, and  difficulty finding new owners for ranches\u2014some ranchers have expressed  support for the idea of a buyout. Others remain opposed.", "In this context, you asked us to determine for 2004 the (1) extent of grazing  on, and program purposes for, lands managed by the 10 federal agencies in  the fiscal year; (2) amount spent in the fiscal year by these agencies, and  other federal agencies that have grazing-related activities, to manage  livestock grazing on public lands; (3) total receipts collected during the  fiscal year for grazing privileges by the 10 federal agencies with grazing  programs, and the amounts disbursed to counties, states, or the federal  government; and (4) fees charged by the 10 federal agencies, western  states, and private ranchers, and the reasons for any differences among the fees. In considering agencies\u2019 expenditures and receipts, it is important to  note that we conducted a budgetary evaluation; that is, we examined the  effects of grazing programs on the U.S. Treasury and the federal budget and  did not analyze economic costs and benefits, which would involve a broad  set of trade-offs\u2014some of which cannot be quantified\u2014made by  individuals, the public, and the federal government. (See app. II for a  discussion of such factors.)", "To respond to these questions, we obtained agencies\u2019 data on acres and  AUMs for their grazing programs, as well as expenditures, receipts,  disbursements, and fees. If an agency had a central data information  system, we obtained the data from this system and determined, through  interviews, system tests, and file reviews, as appropriate, the reliability of  the data and whether the agencies have sufficient internal controls over the  fund information in the systems. If an agency did not centrally track the  needed data, we developed a data collection instrument for the agency\u2019s  field unit managers to complete. We relied on data reported by the  agencies. To assess whether the various types of data were sufficiently  reliable for use in this report, as well as to check key internal controls over  grazing receipts, we visited several agencies\u2019 field offices to review their  grazing programs, data systems, and a selection of grazing files to verify the  billing information; and we interviewed officials about key steps in the  processes for issuing grazing permits and leases and billing for and  collecting fees. We reviewed all the files at agencies with smaller grazing  programs (those with up to 25 permits or leases at an office) and selected  10 percent of files at the two agencies that had large grazing programs (250  and 500 allotment files per office). While we gathered and reviewed  expenditure data from the agencies, we did not validate the data or the  accounting systems that produced them. To understand the differences  among fees and approaches to setting fees, we interviewed a range of  experts from Colorado State University, New Mexico State University,  Oregon State University, and the University of Montana, as well as the  Society for Range Management.

In 2004, the livestock  industry had almost 95 million cattle and 989,460 cattle and calf operations,  which include cattle raised for beef as well as milk. Regionally, the  eastern states had almost 590,000 cattle and calf operations, of which  almost 440,500 were beef cow operations; the states in the Great Plains  (Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, North and South Dakota, and Texas) had  292,300 cattle and calf operations with 253,000 beef cow operations; and  the 11 western states had more than 106,000 cattle and calf operations with  about 80,400 beef cow operations.

During western  expansion, settlement typically occurred along streams and rivers, where  the soil is richer, vegetation denser, and water more available. Lands that  remained for the federal government to manage after western expansion  were lands that settlers did not want or could not easily settle; the lands are  often drier, less productive, and located at higher elevations or farther from  water. As the West was settled throughout the late 1800s, conflict among  different users of the rangelands increased, as did degradation of these  lands. As a result, in 1897, the federal government began managing  livestock grazing in the nation\u2019s forest reserves; in 1906, the Forest Service  started charging a fee for grazing on these reserves.", "The Forest Service managed grazing under its general authorities until  1950, when Congress enacted the Granger-Thye Act, authorizing the  Secretary of Agriculture to issue grazing permits on national forest lands  and other lands under the department\u2019s administration. In addition to  national forest lands on which grazing is allowed in the 16 western states,  the Forest Service manages national grasslands in the western states and  forest lands in the eastern states for grazing. The federal government  started purchasing privately owned land in 1911 as necessary for regulating  the flow of navigable streams, creating national forests in the East. The  national grasslands, which are primarily located in Colorado, Kansas, New  Mexico, and North and South Dakota, were purchased by the federal  government under a land utilization program started in the 1930s.  Originally, the program purchased submarginal lands to provide emergency  relief to farmers whose lands were failing. It evolved into a program  designed to transfer land to its most suitable use, culminating in the  Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act of 1937. In 1954, the Secretary of  Agriculture transferred the responsibility for program administration to the  Forest Service and in 1960 designated almost 3.8 million acres of lands in  the program as national grasslands.", "To stop continued degradation caused by overgrazing of the remaining  public lands, among other purposes, the Congress passed the Taylor  Grazing Act in 1934. Under the act, the predecessor to BLM\u2014the Grazing  Service\u2014was created, and control over grazing on public lands was  established. The Taylor Grazing Act authorized the establishment of  grazing districts from public lands that were considered to be chiefly  valuable for grazing and raising forage crops and the leasing of other public  lands that were located outside grazing districts. The act also provided for  the issuance of permits and leases for these lands and set forth  requirements for the distribution of funds received from grazing. Additional  laws affecting grazing on both BLM and western Forest Service lands were  enacted in the 1970s. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976  (FLPMA) limited the length of permits and leases to 10 years and allowed  shorter terms, authorized terms and conditions to be placed on a permit or  lease, and allowed seasonal limits on grazing. In 1978, PRIA required BLM  and the Forest Service to inventory and manage their lands in western  states.", "To provide access to grazing, both BLM and the Forest Service divide their  rangelands into allotments, which can vary in size from a few acres to  hundreds of thousands of acres of land. Because of the land ownership  patterns that occurred when the lands were settled, the allotments can be  adjacent to private lands, or they can be intermingled with private lands.  Under its authorities, BLM permits grazing in allotments within its grazing  districts and leases lands outside grazing districts. The Forest Service,  which does not have grazing districts, uses permits to authorize grazing in  its allotments. To be eligible for a permit or lease on one of BLM\u2019s  allotments, ranchers, among other things, are required to own or control  land or water, called a base property. Under Forest Service guidance,  permits are issued to purchasers of permitted livestock or base property.", "The other federal agencies that manage grazing do not have the same  grazing authorities, processes, or fees as BLM and the Forest Service. Each  agency manages its grazing for different purposes and under different  authorities. For example, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service permits grazing  on a year-to-year basis, depending on a refuge\u2019s land management goals,  while the National Park Service permits grazing for a longer period but can  choose to not renew a permit if certain conditions change, including  damage to park resources, limitations to interpretive experiences, or  impairment of park facilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "User Fees for Grazing on Federal Lands", "paragraphs": ["Federal grazing fees are considered as user fees. Without statutory  authority to charge a fee and retain the proceeds, a federal agency may not  charge a fee to defray the cost of services or resources it provides.  Congress has provided some agencies with specific authority to charge a  user fee and retain and use the proceeds. If an agency does not have  specific authority, the IOAA provides general authority for an agency to  impose a fee if certain conditions are met. However, even if the user fee  applies, an agency may not retain the proceeds from a user fee without  specific authority to that effect, but must credit the collections to the  general fund of the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts. OMB Circular A-25  provides guidance to agencies regarding their imposition of user fees under  the IOAA and other statutes. Under the circular, federal agencies that do  not have specific authority to impose a fee are to charge user fees pursuant  to the IOAA when an individual or a group receives benefits\u2014such as those  that provide business stability or respond to an individual or a group\u2019s  request\u2014that are greater than those that the general public enjoys.  Increasingly since the 1980s, to relieve pressure on taxpayers for increasing  general appropriations for the federal government, user fees have been  levied to help pay for federal services and resources that benefit specific  groups of users. User fees differ from broad-based taxes in that they  attempt to recover some amount of the government expenditures made for  a specific program. For example, Congress enacted laws to increase the  use of recreation fees for access to federal parks, forests, and BLM lands in  the 1990s.", "While agencies are generally to deposit funds they receive in the general  fund of the Treasury under the Miscellaneous Receipts Act, some federal  agencies have specific legislative authority to distribute funds to states and  counties or to deposit funds into special accounts in the Treasury for the  agency\u2019s or program\u2019s use. Generally, funds that are deposited into the  Treasury as miscellaneous receipts are deposited in the general fund where  they are then available to be appropriated as Congress may see fit.

The agency is authorized to allow grazing within  any national park, monument, or reservation as long as such use is not  detrimental to the primary purpose for creating the park, monument, or  reservation. Agency regulations prohibit grazing except as (1) specifically  authorized by statute, (2) required under a reservation of use rights arising  from the acquisition of a tract of land, (3) required in order to maintain a  historic scene, or (4) conducted as an integral part of a recreational  activity. For example, in Virginia and North Carolina, the agency allows  grazing at Blue Ridge National Parkway\u2014about 5,000 AUMs of cattle on  more than 2,000 acres\u2014to maintain a historic scene. In contrast, at the  Appomattox Court House National Historical Park, the agency allowed  grazing on almost 200 acres to maintain a desirable grass level. Grazing is  managed as a special park use, requiring a permit, lease, concession,  contract, or commercial use authorization. Each park superintendent  approves or disapproves requests for special park uses, such as grazing,  and can impose conditions to protect park resources and values and  visitors and the visitors\u2019 experience.

The National Wildlife Refuge System  Administration Act of 1966 authorizes various uses of U.S. Fish and Wildlife  Service lands, including grazing, as long as the agency determines that such  use is compatible with the major purposes for which the refuge was  established. The agency uses grazing as a tool to manage habitat. For  example, in the Anahuac, McFaddin, and Texas Point National Wildlife  Refuges, along the Texas Gulf Coast, the agency allowed livestock grazing  from October to April, the cool season of the year, to encourage different  types of marsh grasses, generate annuals, and increase vegetative diversity,  thereby opening up additional habitat for foraging waterfowl. In fiscal year  2004, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service reported that livestock grazing  occurred on 94 of its refuges and wetland management districts, ranging  from 25 AUMs on 60 acres at Detroit Lakes Wetland Management District in  Minnesota to about 21,500 AUMs on 450,000 acres at the Charles M. Russell  National Wildlife Refuge in Montana.", "Reclamation. Reclamation allows its lands to be used for incidental  purposes, such as recreation and grazing, as long as such uses do not  interfere with the operation of the dams or irrigation works associated with  these projects. In general, Reclamation allows grazing on its project lands  when asked to do so by users, such as ranchers who have had historical  access to the lands or wildlife managers wanting to improve habitat. For  example, the Albuquerque Area Office allows grazing on more than 19,000  acres in the Brantley and Avalon Reservoirs project area, thereby allowing  ranchers access to lands that they historically grazed. In fiscal year 2004,  Reclamation reported that it permitted and leased lands for grazing at 36 of  its facilities in 16 area offices, with the agency managing some of the  permits and leases and other agencies, such as BLM, the U.S. Fish and  Wildlife Service, or local and state agencies managing additional permits  and leases under joint management agreements. For example, in central  Washington state, BLM manages grazing on more than 8,000 acres of  Reclamation land that is adjacent to BLM land in the Columbia Basin  Project. In the same area, the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife  manages grazing on almost 18,000 acres of Reclamation land to improve  vegetation and thereby enhance bird habitat.

Under the Taylor Grazing Act, the Secretary of the Interior is  authorized, by order and with the approval of the relevant department, to  establish grazing districts of certain public domain lands that are not in  national forests, parks, or monuments. In Idaho, Interior, with the  agreement of DOE, issued such an order, and livestock grazing continues  on approximately 50 percent of the Idaho National Laboratory site. BLM  manages the land as part of its grazing program but is to follow the security  and land access requirements set by DOE.", "DOD. Under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2667, the Secretaries of the Army, Air Force, and  Navy are authorized to lease property under their control that is not excess  property, if it will promote national defense or be in the public interest. The  military services use this authority to lease rangelands on military  installations and bases for grazing, among other uses. For example, the Air  Force leases to nearby ranchers land that forms a buffer around the  Melrose Air Force Range at Cannon Air Force Base in New Mexico. The  buffer consists of rangelands surrounding target areas used in training  exercises and protects more developed areas from stray (unarmed) bombs.  According to Air Force staff, leasing the land to ranchers does not hinder  training exercises, but it does provide access to grazing for neighboring  landowners and to maintain rangeland, by keeping grass low, to control  fire. Similarly, Fort Hood in Texas allows grazing on lands used for armored  vehicle training maneuvers. The Army determined that grazing cattle could  be compatible with training exercises, although uncertainty remains about  the intensity of grazing that can be allowed, given the need to let vegetation  recover from training exercises, and hence, reduce soil erosion into nearby  streams and reservoirs. Like the Army, Air Force, and Navy, the Corps  manages grazing on its lands under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2667.

The 8 remaining agencies spent at least $3.4 million on their grazing  programs, but not all of the agencies could estimate their expenditures  because they do not conduct grazing as a major activity and therefore do  not specifically track grazing expenditures. The 10 agencies spent funds on  activities that directly supported grazing, such as managing permits and  leases, monitoring resource conditions on grazing allotments, assuring  permit and lease compliance, and implementing range improvements such  as developing water sources and constructing fences.

As shown in table 3, the  agencies spent these funds on both direct, indirect, and range improvement  activities. BLM has implemented a cost-management system that identifies  direct and indirect expenditures and used it to identify its direct and  indirect expenditures in fiscal year 2004. Unlike BLM, the Forest Service  does not have a cost-management system, but rather reports expenditures  for items in its budget, called budget line items. The agency uses its  Foundation Financial Information System to centrally track and formally  report expenditures. For fiscal year 2004, the Forest Service used  expenditure reports for grazing and related line items, in addition to its  WorkPlan system that shows its intended work plans for the fiscal year, to  identify the amount of expenditures.", "In fiscal year 2004, the agencies generally included the same activities in  reporting their expenditures. Both BLM and the Forest Service included  managing grazing permits and leases, monitoring resource conditions on  grazing allotments, conducting environmental assessments for allotments,  and managing grazing fees as direct expenditures. Both agencies included  expenditures that specifically related to grazing management, rather than  broader range management expenditures, because grazing activities are  distinct from more general rangeland management activities. According to  agency officials, many range management activities need to be conducted  whether or not grazing occurs. For example, monitoring rangeland  conditions through vegetation surveys supports work that the agencies  conduct to manage noxious weeds. While some noxious weeds may occur  on federal lands as a result of livestock grazing, some can be transported by  other means. Although both agencies spent funds on land management  planning to support their specific grazing plans and activities, neither  agency included land management planning expenditures. According to  BLM and Forest Service officials, land management planning and  environmental impact statements are important enough to be a separate  direct expenditure from grazing and would continue to occur if the  agencies no longer permitted or leased grazing activities on their lands.  Furthermore, according to agency officials, land management planning  encompasses all activities\u2014including livestock grazing\u2014conducted by  BLM, at the field office level on public lands, or by the Forest Service, at the  national forest level for all national forest system lands. Even if grazing  activities were not conducted, other range management activities, such as  oil and gas leasing and off-road vehicle use, would still need to be planned  and studied.", "For indirect grazing activities in fiscal year 2004, BLM spent almost $18.7  million, and the Forest Service spent an estimated $13.3 million. Indirect  activities are those that cannot be specifically attributed to grazing because  they also benefit other resource programs. These include activities such as  administrative activities, infrastructure, or technical support. One method  of allocating indirect expenditures is to pool the activities and allocate the  related expenditures across all the programs that use the activities. BLM  allocated its indirect expenditures using its cost-management system. The  system allocated expenditures for such activities as management, state  office expenditures, and BLM office expenditures in fiscal year 2004.  Because the Forest Service does not have a cost-accounting system, it  allocates its budget according to potential indirect expenditures. The  Forest Service has six cost pools, into which it allocates a percent of each  of its budget line items for the fiscal year to be used to cover indirect  expenditures during the year.", "BLM and the Forest Service also spent $14.6 million on range improvement  activities in fiscal year 2004. These funds are revenues from grazing fees  charged in 2003 and deposited as receipts in the agencies\u2019 range  improvement accounts. The agencies use the funds to pay for direct and  indirect activities related to range improvement projects that include  constructing fences, developing water sources such as tanks or  impoundments, and seeding to improve vegetation and forage amounts.

The lowest  per acre fee in fiscal year 2004, $1.50 per acre, was negotiated at the Buffalo  National River in Arkansas. The highest per acre fee, $25, was charged at  several parks, including Minuteman Missile National Historic Site in South  Dakota, which set its fee based on average local rates, and Eisenhower  National Historic Site and Gettysburg National Military Park in  Pennsylvania, which fixed their grazing fees, also based on average local  rates. Similarly, Blue Ridge National Parkway, in Virginia and North  Carolina, which accounted for just over 50 percent of total Park Service  livestock grazing permits in fiscal year 2004, charged a rate of $10 per acre  for each of its 212 permits. The fee was established using values in a 2002  survey that the park\u2019s staff conducted of other National Park Service field  offices that administer agricultural programs, as well as market-rate  information for grazing in the vicinity of the parkway that the park staff  gathered from county extension and other agricultural offices.", "U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The grazing fees charged in fiscal year 2004  were, for the most part, established using market-value prices, including  prices set by USDA\u2019s National Agricultural Statistics Service. Prices ranged  from $0.29 per AUM to $34.44 per AUM; both fees were based on  competitive bids for grazing permits at the Sand Lake Wetland Management  District in South Dakota, where access to small sites and forage conditions  can vary greatly. Under U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service regulations, refuges  are to charge a fee for the grant of privileges or products taken from  refuges that is commensurate with fees charged for similar privately  granted privileges or products, or with local market prices. To establish the  fees charged in fiscal year 2004, most refuges\u2014particularly those in  western states\u2014issued permits at the market rate, including the USDA  rate. For example, the fee charged at the refuge with the largest amount of  grazing, the Charles M. Russell National Wildlife Refuge in Montana,  averaged $14.76 per AUM. A few refuges did not use a market value fee but  instead negotiated the grazing fee with the permittee. For example,  managers at the Hutton Lake National Wildlife Refuge in Wyoming  negotiated a fee of $8.80 per AUM, based on the USDA rate, less services  for fencing and irrigation.", "Reclamation. In fiscal year 2004, the fees charged ranged from $1.27 per  AUM to $56.46 per AUM. Reclamation guidance directs the agency to enter  into permits and leases using competitive means when there is likely to be  demand from more than one party, but permits and leases may be  negotiated when it is in the best interest of the United States or if no  competition is present. In fiscal year 2004, while the majority of  Reclamation\u2019s area offices set grazing fees using competitive approaches,  or other approaches that establish a market price, some of the offices used  fixed fees or negotiated with local ranchers to agree on a fee. For example,  the Wyoming Area Office, which manages several projects in and around  the state of Wyoming, used competitive bidding that opened with a  minimum bid. The area office staff set the minimum bid using the average  private lease rates in the state, as provided by USDA. One area office also  used a discounted lease method, in which the office used an average  private lease rate for the area and discounted it for factors such as multiple  uses of the lands. When area offices charged fixed fees, they generally set  them at historic levels. For example, the Lahontan Basin Area Office, which  manages Reclamation activities in the Lahontan Basin Area in northern  Nevada and eastern California, manages 56 grazing permits and leases that  were inherited from local irrigation districts and charged the same fee in  fiscal year 2004 as the irrigation offices charged in the past.", "DOE. In its agreement with DOE to manage on Idaho National Laboratory  land, BLM charges its current fee for grazing on DOE lands.", "DOD. In fiscal year 2004, the Army, Corps, Air Force, and Navy, offered the  majority of their leases as competitive bids. The bids ranged from an  average of $0.82 to $112.50 per AUM. Under the laws and regulations for  grazing on lands managed by the services, their lands may be leased for up  to 5 years and payment for a lease is generally to be fair market value,  although the payment can be made through services in-kind. The DOD  services may accept less than fair market value under certain  circumstances when it is determined that a public interest will be served.  For example, Army officials recently negotiated a new 5-year lease for  grazing at Fort Hood (in Texas) with a group of cattlemen that included  some previous landowners. The Army determined that, although it had no  legal obligation to continue leasing only to this group, its relationship with  the neighboring ranchers helped to sustain its mission, meet its  environmental stewardship responsibilities, and maintain its good relations  with the community. In April 2005, the Army negotiated a grazing price that  was 40 percent lower than the appraised value, pending a new appraisal  that explicitly considered the unique military circumstances of grazing on  the installation. The new appraisal, completed in August 2005, valued the  lease at a price per animal unit that is 30 percent less than the fair market  value assessed for other, similar grazing parcels to account for such unique  military circumstances.", "See appendix V for details of federal grazing fees charged by these  agencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Private Ranchers and State Land Agencies Generally Set Fees at Market Values to Generate Revenues", "paragraphs": ["Fees charged by private ranchers and state land agencies are higher than  the BLM and Forest Service fees because, generally, ranchers and state  agencies seek to generate grazing revenues by charging a price that  represents market value for that land and/or the services provided. The  average fee private ranchers charged in 2004 in the 11 western states was $13.30 per AUM and $13.80 per head of livestock, which represents  market value, or the price that ranchers are willing to pay and receive for  privately owned grazing lands in western states. This fee is determined  annually through USDA surveys of private ranchers in 17 western states  and is the average price ranchers (producers) reported as being paid in  their area for privately owned nonirrigated grazing land. The National  Agricultural Statistics Service calculates the average for each state, as well  as for the 9 Great Plains states and different combinations of western  states\u201411 western states, 16 western states, and 17 western states. As  shown in table 9, the average private grazing fee for the states ranged from  $8.00 per AUM in Arizona and Oklahoma to $23.00 per AUM in Nebraska.", "In fiscal year 2004, state land agencies in 15 western states charged grazing  fees that ranged from $1.35 per AUM in California to $80 per AUM in  Montana and $0.71 per acre in New Mexico to $56 per acre in South Dakota;  2 states did not charge fees because they do not have grazing on state trust  lands. As table 9 shows, most states charged more than one fee: while 4  states charged a single fee for all of their state lands, 2 states charged two  fees and 9 states charged a range of fees, depending on market rates or  based on counties or areas with variable vegetation. The agencies manage  state trust lands to help pay for schools; the lands were set aside for this  purpose when each state was created. Like the federal government, the  western state agencies lease their lands for grazing, among other uses.  According to Interior officials, unlike the federal government, the western  state agencies have a fiduciary responsibility to obtain revenues from  grazing fees on state trust lands to support schools and education systems.", "Of the 15 state agencies charging fees, 6 agencies used competitive  methods to determine the fair market value of their lands in fiscal year  2004; 6 used appraised prices or formulas to estimate the fair market value  of their lands; and 3 used only formulas that do not start with a market  price. Generally, the formulas adjusted the value of private grazing lands  for different factors, such as the lack of fencing or water on state lands, or  the price of beef. For example, Wyoming based its grazing fee on the  average of private lease rates, as estimated by the Wyoming Agricultural  Statistics Service, for the previous 5 years. The rate was then adjusted to  account for changing resource conditions, market demand, and industry  viability, and reduced by 20 percent to reflect contributions made by the  lessee. (See app. VI for a discussion of the state fees.)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Purpose of the BLM and the Forest Service Fee in Western States Is Not to Recover Expenditures or to Charge Market Value; Different Purposes Would Result in Different Fees", "paragraphs": ["As we noted in our 1991 report on the BLM and Forest Service grazing fee,  fees can vary depending on the purposes for which they are charged. The  BLM and Forest Service fee is set in accordance with the policy of  preventing economic disruption and harm to the western livestock  industry. The primary purpose of the BLM and Forest Service fee is not to  recover the agencies\u2019 administrative expenses. Consequently, in fiscal year  2004, the agencies spent $132.5 million to manage their grazing programs  and collected $17.5 million in receipts, leaving a gap of about $115 million.  If the purpose of the fee were to recover expenditures and if each agency  were to charge a fee that recovered its expenditures, BLM would have had  to charge up to $7.64 per AUM, and the Forest Service would have had to  charge up to $12.26 per AUM in 2004, according to our analysis of the  agencies\u2019 estimated expenditures and the number of AUMs billed (7.6  million AUMs for BLM and 6.1 million AUMs for the Forest Service). While  many argue that fees for grazing on federal lands should recover the  agencies\u2019 expenditures, some grazing advocates argue that agencies\u2019  expenses are high and reflect inefficiencies and that the fee should not  encourage the agencies\u2019 inefficient practices.", "The primary purpose of the BLM and Forest Service fee formula is also not  to achieve fair market value prices. Instead, the fee was designed to reflect  fees charged by private ranchers by including the forage value index, while  also adjusting the value to reflect the net costs of conducting ranching  business. It reflects net costs by including the beef cattle price and  producer prices indexes (a measure of the change in income and  production expenses). While initially, the base price used in the formula  represented what Congress and economists considered fair market value,  the adjustments included in the formula have resulted in a fee that has not  tracked private fees. Consequently, while the fee charged by BLM and the  Forest Service fluctuated up and down, it decreased overall by about 40  percent from $2.36 per AUM in 1980 for BLM and $2.41 per AUM for Forest  Service to $1.43 per AUM for both agencies in 2004. Private ranching fees  increased by 78 percent over the same period, from $7.53 per AUM to  $13.40 per AUM. The federal fee increased to $1.79 per AUM in 2005. (See  fig. 2.)", "If the primary purpose of the formula were to produce a fee equal to market  value, the fee would likely not be the same as that charged on private or  state lands for two key reasons. First, because BLM and Forest Service  permits and leases are not bid competitively, the fees associated with those  permits and leases are not set in the market. In lieu of a market for BLM  and Forest Service grazing, the agencies could estimate the value of their  lands based on comparable properties. However, it is generally recognized  that private lands, which are leased at market prices, are not often  comparable to public lands because the private lands have better forage  and sources of water. The quality of forage and availability of water on  state lands are considered more comparable to that on federal lands  because the federal government granted some of its lands to various states  when they entered the Union. In addition to differences in the quality of  soil, forage, and water resources, private grazing fees differ from fees for  public lands because private landowners often provide services that are not  provided on BLM and Forest Service lands. For example, private  landowners may provide daily livestock care\u2014watering, fencing, feeding,  and veterinary care\u2014as well as maintaining fences, corrals, and water  tanks. In addition, lessees of private land can themselves lease the land to  other users, such as hunters, and generate revenue. Moreover, public  access to private lands is limited, whereas access to federal land is  generally not limited. State agencies also limit access to their lands, a factor  that makes their lands less comparable to BLM and Forest Service lands for  purposes of setting fees.", "Second, market values are difficult to use for BLM and Forest Service  permits and leases because the prices ranchers have paid for their private  ranches often include the capitalized value of any associated federal  grazing permits and leases\u2014called \u201cpermit value\u201d\u2014and advocates state  that ranchers have paid full market value for the grazing permits and  leases, albeit not in the form of a payment to the government. Although  Interior and USDA do not recognize grazing permits and leases issued by  BLM and the Forest Service as a legal property right, the real estate market  realizes the value of holding these permits and leases. As a result, it is  generally recognized that while the federal government does not receive a  market price for its permits and leases, ranchers have paid a market price  for their federal permits or leases\u2014by paying (1) grazing fees; (2) nonfee  grazing costs, including the costs of operating on federal lands, such as  protecting threatened and endangered species (i.e., limiting grazing area or  time); and (3) the capitalized permit value. Should the BLM and Forest  Service charge a grazing fee that reflects market values, the ranchers\u2019  investments could be reduced accordingly, which complicates the use of  the market value of the permits and leases.", "Because of these difficulties in estimating and using market value, some  grazing experts have suggested establishing a competitive bidding process  for federal permits and leases, as has been done for the McGregor Range,  an Air Force bombing range. BLM manages grazing on this range using  competitive bidding to set prices. In 2004, BLM received fees ranging from  $5.00 to $14.50 per AUM for several leases that it offered at auction. (See  app. V for more details.) Experts acknowledge, however, that significant  changes to the current grazing system would be needed to allow  competition, with uncertain results. In particular, range experts and agency  officials point out a potential increase in administrative activities and  expenditures for items such as changing operators, start-up time, and law  enforcement that could occur with greater BLM and Forest Service  involvement in competitive bidding. In addition, some change in the  preference system on BLM and Forest Service lands might need to occur to  allow competitive bidding. However, some states have implemented a form  of competitive bidding while retaining preference. For example, New  Mexico allows ranchers with preference to meet the best offer that results  from competing the lease. Finally, range experts and agency officials point  out that the effect of competitive bidding on grazing receipts collected  could, in fact, reduce receipts because some allotments could be less  competitive than others, given their location and quality of resources.  Others stated that increased competition could reduce the economic  opportunities for some smaller permittees and lessees."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["It is difficult to identify the full cost of grazing on federal lands. Many  federal agencies have their own grazing programs, but other agencies  support grazing in carrying out their responsibilities. Nevertheless, an  analysis of federal expenditures and receipts provided by the agencies  demonstrates that BLM and the Forest Service are spending much more on  grazing than they are generating in receipts. Moreover, the existence of  permit value indicates that while ranchers may have paid full value for  grazing privileges, the agencies have not captured these payments in their  grazing fee. These shortfalls reflect legislative and executive branch  policies to support local economies and ranching communities by keeping  grazing fees low. BLM and the Forest Service are charging a fee that  supports this purpose.", "The current fee for livestock grazing has not been changed significantly  since it was first established a quarter century ago, largely because of  controversy over the purpose of the fee and the role of grazing in  contributing to ranching economies and communities and in degrading  rangeland ecosystems. Although a budgetary analysis such as the one we  conducted does not consider economic, environmental, or societal costs  and benefits, it does demonstrate the need to periodically reexamine  programs to assess their relevance and relative priority for a changing  society, including how much of the program\u2019s financing should be paid for  by those who benefit most directly. Taking a hard look at existing programs  and carefully considering their goals and their financing is a challenging  task. However, faced with a growing and unsustainable fiscal imbalance,  the government cannot accept all of its existing programs, policies, and  activities as \u201cgivens.\u201d Now, as in the 1990s, tightened federal budgets and a  persistent federal deficit create the need to examine federal programs that  spend more funds than they generate in receipts and to determine whether  the purposes of these programs warrant increasing user fees.", "Although other federal agencies\u2019 grazing programs are much smaller than  BLM\u2019s and the Forest Service\u2019s, they demonstrate the application of  competitive and market-based approaches to charging user fees for grazing  programs and recovering some program expenditures. Depending on the  approach taken to set and implement a grazing fee for lands managed by  BLM and the Forest Service, the federal government could close the gap  that exists between those programs\u2019 grazing expenditures and receipts. But  any change in the current fee may necessitate that Congress reconsider the  purpose of the fee and policy trade-offs of different fees. In addition, an  evaluation of the difficulties of implementing the chosen fee would need to  be conducted in order to understand the consequences for the agencies\u2019  programs and expenditures and to deal fairly with such issues as  preference and permit value."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided USDA, Commerce, DOD, DOE, Interior, and Justice with a  draft of this report for review and comment.

The Forest Service uses an information system, called INFRA, to  centrally track and formally report acres, head months, and AUMs. To  determine if the AUM and acreage data produced by BLM\u2019s Rangeland  Administration System and Forest Service\u2019s INFRA system were  sufficiently reliable for use in this report, we interviewed system managers  about the processes used to manage the data in the systems and conducted  a \u201cwalk-through\u201d of the system with these managers. In addition, we tested  the completeness and accuracy of a selection of AUM and acreage data  using fiscal year 2004 system reports at the BLM field and Forest Service  offices. We asked field office officials to provide us their 2004 report that  specifically showed, by permit or lease, the number of AUMs authorized  and billed and the fee charged.

For these  agencies, we collaborated with agency headquarters and field office  officials to design and test a data collection instrument tailored for each  agency, which we sent to field offices. To design and test the data collection  instruments, we visited several agencies\u2019 field offices and followed the  same process we used at BLM and the Forest Service to sample files,  review relevant documents, track AUM data, and interview local officials to  verify the completeness and accuracy of data that they could submit to us.  We performed this work at the Dinosaur National Monument, Klamath  Basin Wildlife Refuge Complex, Reclamation\u2019s Albuquerque Area Office,  Cannon Air Force Base, and Fort Hood Army Installation. To help ensure  the reliability of the data we received from the agencies, we reviewed the  data to determine whether they were complete and accurate. When we  found data that were missing or appeared to be inaccurate, we called  appropriate agency officials to discuss, and if necessary, correct the data.  Based on these reviews and appropriate follow-up interviews, we  determined that the data reported were sufficiently reliable for purposes of  this report.", "To determine the expenditures the 10 federal agencies incurred in fiscal  year 2004 to manage specific livestock grazing on federal lands they  manage, total receipts collected for grazing privileges by these agencies,  and the amounts disbursed to counties, states, or the federal government,  we obtained agency expenditure, receipt, and disbursement data for fiscal  year 2004. BLM maintains an Activity Based Costing System that centrally  tracks and formally reports expenditures on livestock grazing activities, the  receipts that grazing generates, and amounts disbursed. BLM officials used  this system to identify the amount of direct and indirect expenditures the  agency incurred for livestock grazing activities. The Forest Service does  not have a cost-accounting system, but rather reports expenditures for  items in its budget, called budget line items. The agency used expenditure  reports for these line items, in addition to its WorkPlan system (which  shows the forests\u2019 intended work plans at the beginning of a fiscal year) to  estimate the amount of expenditures on grazing activities in fiscal year  2004. The Forest Service direct expenditures include expenditures from the  Forest Service grazing line item, expenditures from its watershed and  vegetation line item, and estimated expenditures from its General  Management and other cost pools. Because the watershed and vegetation  line item can be spent for all programs and not just the grazing program,  the Forest Service allocated a portion of these expenditures\u201411 percent\u2014 using WorkPlan, which is a tool for planning and budgeting program work  at the forest level. The Forest Service uses six cost pools to allocate  indirect activities and expenditures: General Management, Public  Communications, Ongoing Business Services, Common Services, Office of  Worker\u2019s Compensation, and Unemployment Compensation Insurance. The  General Management pool and some of the activities in the Common  Services pool are considered direct or support costs, rather than indirect  costs. These are included as direct expenditures. To estimate expenditures  from its General Management and other cost pools, the agency attributed a  share of the expenditures related to the amount of grazing and related  watershed and vegetation funds that were put into the fund for the fiscal  year. We did not validate the data provided by the agencies\u2019 or test their  financial management and accounting systems. We did contact USDA\u2019s and  Interior\u2019s Office of Inspector General and representatives of KPMG, a  private contractor that annually audits the agencies\u2019 financial statements,  to determine if there was any reason we could not use expenditure data in  this report.

In addition, we  asked headquarters officials to query their financial management and  accounting systems in an effort to extract specific receipt and  disbursement data related to livestock grazing activities. When necessary,  we conducted follow-up interviews with agency headquarters and field  office officials to ensure that the data were reliable enough for use in this  report. We did not validate these financial management and accounting  systems.", "To identify livestock grazing expenditures that other federal agencies may  incur to support livestock grazing, we first developed a list of agencies and  activities that are conducted that are related to grazing on public lands. To  develop this list, we reviewed reports about livestock grazing on public  lands, interviewed BLM and Forest Service officials, and interviewed  experts at the Society for Range Management, as well as the author of a  recent study on the costs of the federal grazing program. We then  contacted the agencies to confirm that the activities they conduct are  related to grazing and are conducted on public lands; if the agencies  conducted activities that support grazing on public lands, we then  requested estimated expenditures for fiscal year 2004. To that end, we  contacted officials at USGS; USDA\u2019s Agricultural Research Service, Animal  and Plant Health Inspection Service, Cooperative State Research,  Education, and Extension Service, Farm Service Agency, National  Agricultural Statistics Service, Natural Resources Conservation Service,  and Risk Management Agency; and the Environmental Protection Agency.  We asked these officials to estimate, if possible, the expenditures they  incur in support of livestock grazing activities. To determine agency  expenditures on consultations for threatened and endangered species, we  requested the data from the two agencies involved, the U.S. Fish and  Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service. To determine  agency expenditures for litigation related to livestock grazing we contacted  the Department of Justice, Interior\u2019s Office of the Solicitor, and USDA\u2019s  Office of General Counsel. Their representatives estimated the cost of their  time devoted to livestock grazing cases in fiscal year 2004 and identified  that no payments were made for attorney fees in the same period. The  National Park Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Reclamation, and  DOD services reported that they were not involved in any litigation related  to livestock grazing in fiscal year 2004.", "To determine the fees charged in 2004 by the 10 federal agencies, western  states, and private ranchers and the reasons for any differences among the  fees, we relied on several different sources. For the fees charged by BLM  and the Forest Service, we contacted BLM and Forest Service officials, who  provided us with 2004 fee and an explanation of the formula used to  calculate the fee. We also discussed the formula and its components with  the staff of the National Agricultural Statistics Service. We also reviewed  historical studies of the formula and fees resulting from the formula.

In these localities, many ranchers who rely on public lands  could be driven out of ranching because, without access to public lands,  their ranches would not be economically viable. In addition, studies have  shown that grazing is beneficial to rural economies because it provides  them with a more diverse economic base in conjunction with other  compatible land uses, such as recreational activities. Advocates also note  that while some economic studies indicate that grazing on federal land is of  minimal economic importance, these studies only consider grazing\u2019s  dependence on public forage on an average annual basis and not on a  seasonal basis. They point out that ranchers rely on forage from federal  lands during certain parts of the year, particularly during the summer and  fall grazing season, and that ranchers\u2019 dependence on federal lands  becomes quite important when only the grazing season is taken into  account.", "In contrast, opponents point to studies showing that, for many of the  western states, federal lands provide only a small percentage of the total  forage needed to support ranchers\u2019 herds and do not contribute  significantly to local economic production and income. For example, one  study that examined the reliance of ranchers on federal land in 11 western  states showed that only $1 of every $2,500 of income (0.04 percent) earned  in those states is directly associated with grazing on federal lands.

Advocates point to  the value of preserving the tradition and culture of rural ranching  communities as an important contribution of grazing. These advocates  believe that because federal land grazing at current rates provides the  support ranchers need to stay in business, grazing prevents a growing trend  toward urbanization and sprawl in rural areas. The development of ranch  lands reduces the availability of open space for scenic pleasure and  recreational opportunities, reduces wildlife habitat, and increases the  infrastructure and tax burden on nearby communities. Further, federal  managers point out that their support of ranchers and rural communities  maintains a buffer around federal lands\u2014for example, military lands\u2014 preventing development along these boundaries.", "Similarly, grazing advocates point out the importance of grazing to the  quality of life for individual ranchers, which is another factor not captured  by a budgetary analysis. Studies have documented the importance of  quality of life (consumptive value) in ranchers\u2019 decisions to purchase or  remain in business despite economic pressures. These studies have  compared the future earning potential of the land from ranching with the  market values for ranches in many rural communities and found that  ranchers have been willing to accept rates of return on their investment  that are below market value, which indicates that the desire to own a ranch  is not motivated entirely by profit, but also by the less tangible benefit on  the quality of life that the rural lifestyle offers.", "While the contribution of ranching to the quality of life and well being of a  segment of society is widely recognized, grazing opponents question the  role of the government in protecting ranchers\u2019 social or economic way of  life at a cost to all taxpayers. In the opponents\u2019 view, preserving the  heritage of \u201cwestern cowboys\u201d by allowing them the use of public lands is a  subsidy to the livestock industry. The opponents question the use of  continuing subsidies, rather than a functioning free market, and question  the choice of subsidizing one lifestyle or chosen profession over another\u2014 for example, teachers.", "Opponents also disagree with the argument that grazing subsidies are  essential to preserving open spaces and stopping development. They point  out that many factors, such as an individual rancher\u2019s wealth and  commitment to ranching as a way of life, will ultimately influence the  decision to continue ranching. Population growth and demand for housing  will widen the disparity in land values between grazing and development  and put some ranchers\u2014especially those facing financial pressures\u2014in a  position to sell. However, opponents note that the replacement of cows  with condominiums is not a foregone result of changes in grazing policy.  Subdividing and developing ranch land is primarily driven by market  conditions\u2014demand\u2014for the land, and market conditions for subdividing  the ranch lands is far from uniform across the West. For example, it would  not be economically feasible to develop lands in some remote areas of the  West. However, acknowledging the reality of development of the ranch  lands in some geographic areas, opponents believe that subsidized grazing  on public lands is neither an efficient nor an effective means of preserving  open spaces.

By grazing the land, ranchers help to maintain rangeland  ecosystems\u2014particularly those east of the Rocky Mountains\u2014that  developed historically and naturally with herbivory by wild animals such as  buffalo, antelope, deer, and elk. According to advocates, grazing also helps  to manage weeds, including invasive plant species, and control fires by  preventing excessive biomass buildup or by reducing the intensity of fires  that do start\u2014expenses that would otherwise shift to federal agencies. For  example, advocates maintain that sheep grazing reduces the need to use  herbicides on the range because the sheep eat noxious plants that other  animals avoid. Advocates also contend that ranchers provide a valuable  service to federal agencies by reporting problems on public lands, such as  fires and illegal activities, and assisting in search-and-rescue operations.", "Furthermore, grazing advocates assert that modern rangeland management  facilitates the maintenance and health of the land because ranchers  understand the science behind ranching and make decisions that preserve  and improve the health of the rangeland, including wildlife habitat. In  general, they point to the increased number of wildlife and game animals in  recent years on the lands with ranch and water developments. For  example, one study has shown that biodiversity for vegetation and animals  is higher on rangelands managed for grazing than on small ranches. They  say that water improvements made by ranchers are the reason behind  enhanced wildlife habitat and numbers and contribute to lower  maintenance costs by the agencies.", "To the contrary, grazing opponents argue that grazing has contributed to,  and increased the amount of, the federal government\u2019s land management  costs. For example, they note, by eliminating grass and low-lying  vegetation in ponderosa pine forests, grazing has contributed to increased  density of conifer trees and shrubs and made these forests more prone to  large, intense fires that are costly to fight. Grazing opponents also note that  grazing contributes to the spread of invasive species, thereby increasing  agencies\u2019 costs for managing their rangelands. For example, opponents  state that livestock transport seeds; weaken and remove native plants, such  as grasses; disturb the soil; and help invasive species to take hold and grow.", "Grazing opponents also note that grazing in general and overgrazing in  particular, have harmed plants and wildlife on federal lands by exposing  soils to erosion, disrupting normal wildlife behavior, and reducing  biodiversity. For example, an environmental group states that grazing has  contributed to the listing of 22 percent of federal threatened and  endangered species. Furthermore, livestock can be detrimental to native  wildlife because they can transmit diseases, compete for food, disrupt  normal behavior patterns, or damage habitat. For example, because some  invasive plants can better tolerate intensive grazing than most native  plants, they can prosper and drive out other native plants. The U.S. Fish  and Wildlife Service has argued that grazing can cause habitat degradation  and disrupt normal behavior patterns of wildlife such as breeding, feeding, or sheltering. For example, livestock management practices, such as  fencing rangelands, can create obstacles for many native wildlife species,  limiting their movement in search of food and shelter. Similarly, livestock  protection has played a large role in eliminating native predators, which are  often killed by private ranchers or federal agencies to protect the livestock.

Before 1906, livestock could graze on federally  managed lands for free, and livestock operators objected to being charged.  Originally, the fee charged by the Forest Service and BLM was $0.05 per  AUM for cattle, but the fee increased by 1968 to $0.56 per AUM for Forest  Service permits and $0.33 per AUM for BLM leases and permits.", "Until 1969, the approach used by the Forest Service and BLM for  establishing grazing fees differed. The original Forest Service fee was  based on the rental value of local, private grazing tracts, while the original  BLM fee was based on the agency\u2019s administrative expenses. Beginning in  the 1920s and continuing through 1968, the Forest Service based its fee on  beef and lamb prices, as determined through studies it conducted. BLM  (and its predecessor) also conducted studies of its fee approach. In 1946,  the year that BLM was created, one of these studies supported the use of  administrative expenses as a basis for the fee. However, in 1951, BLM  began increasing its fees, and in 1958, it shifted its approach to one that was  similar to the Forest Service approach\u2014that is, based on livestock prices.  Throughout the 1960s, BLM charged fees that factored in livestock prices.  For example, the 1958 fee increased from $0.19 per AUM to $0.22 per AUM  in 1959 and 1960, and it decreased to $0.19 per AUM in 1961 and 1962,  reflecting decreasing livestock prices.", "Since 1969, the Forest Service and BLM have used a uniform approach to  establish a grazing fee. After a 1960 study conducted for the Bureau of the  Budget\u2014the predecessor of the OMB\u2014by an interdepartmental grazing  committee, the Bureau set a new fee schedule for the agencies to achieve  fair market value for federal grazing permits and leases. An extensive  survey in 1966 of the western livestock industry, called the Western  Livestock Grazing Survey and Analysis, and a 1968 review of that survey  data determined that a fair market value for federal grazing permits and  leases would be $1.23 per AUM. The $1.23 per AUM value equalizes the  costs of conducting business between private ranch lands and federal  lands. It is based on the premise that the costs of conducting grazing  activities on federal lands should be competitive and comparable to the  costs on private land. Because the new fee, if imposed all at once, would  have increased Forest Service fees by $0.72 per AUM and BLM fees by $0.90  per AUM, a 10-year phase period was scheduled.", "Before the new fee could be implemented, drought and continued debate  caused several delays in the phase-in schedule, and in 1976, the Congress  passed the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA), which  required the Secretaries of Agriculture and of the Interior to conduct a  study to establish a fee that was equitable both to the United States and to  holders of grazing permits and leases. The 1977 study, Study of Fees for  Grazing Livestock on Federal Lands, written by a task force of Forest  Service and BLM officials, evaluated several different formulas for setting  a grazing fee. The goal was to establish a fee that achieved multiple  objectives, including getting fair market value for the forage while also  reflecting the value of grazing to the rancher. The fee was also to contain  regular adjustments to account for changes in fair market value over time.", "On the basis of the 1977 study, Congress enacted PRIA with the task force\u2019s  recommended formula for a 7 year trial basis. The agencies studied the  effectiveness of the formula after 7 years, as required in PRIA, and  academic economists sought to establish better ways to set a fee, but the  use of the formula was extended indefinitely by executive order and has  remain unchanged. Two studies by the agencies, one in 1986 and its update  in 1992, evaluated the components of the PRIA formula and its results. The  reports identified technical issues with the formula, including the fact that  the BCPI does not include prices for calves\u2014which are produced on  western lands\u2014and does include fat cattle (cattle fattened on grain for  slaughter), which are not produced on western lands. The reports also  noted that the PPI does not include a cost of living component;  components of farm origin (feed, feeder livestock, seed, and fertilizer); or  taxes; all of which increases the weight of factors that are affected by  inflation, such as fuel costs. Finally, the reports identified the need to  update the base value ($1.23 per AUM) to reflect current market values  rather than 1960s data.", "Critics of the reports stated that the agencies did not evaluate the  effectiveness of the PRIA formula; disagreed with the agencies\u2019 appraisal of  private lands and fees; and identified incorrect statistical indexing, such as  using inflation factors instead of a livestock-relevant factor. They also  stated that the agencies failed to recognize the different costs of operating  on federal and private land. According to the critics, one of these costs is  the value of permits and leases, which is included in the value of privately  owned ranches. The livestock industry believes that this value should be  included in the calculation of the $1.23 base value (subtracted out as a cost  of doing business).", "In 1993, in response to a perceived need to increase fees to capture the  economic value of forage, another Forest Service and BLM study examined  the potential for an incentive-based grazing fee. The report identified the  \u201cgrazing fee dilemma\u201d as one in which the federal government is not  receiving full market value for its forage, but as one in which ranchers are  paying full market value by paying (1) the fee; (2) nonfee grazing costs  (including costs for operating on federal lands, i.e., complying with federal  requirements like those for endangered species habitat); and (3)  investments in grazing permits and leases. According to this study, the only  way to determine the fair market value of federal grazing permits and  leases was through competitive bidding, which would have its own set of  administrative expenses. In lieu of competitive bidding, according to this  study, all methods of estimating fair market value resulted in fees  somewhere between $3 and $5, and the base value of the formula should be  negotiated at some price in that range. The report also stated that including  BCPI and PPI in the grazing formula did not improve the ability of the PRIA  formula to track market prices, as anticipated in 1977, and that FVI would  adequately update the grazing fee. This study and report were used to  inform efforts to reform grazing regulations in 1994.", "In the late 1980s, agricultural economists examined livestock prices and  ranch revenue\u2014the gross income from ranching\u2014to assess the rate of  return on investments in cattle and sheep ranches. The economists found  that rates of return are relatively low compared with other investments, but  that land value has increased and kept ranchers financially solvent.  Furthermore, the net return in the ranching industry\u2014the value of  production minus costs\u2014is often negative. This information was used to  support federal legislation to change grazing fees in 1997.

In fiscal year 2004, the Utah School and Institutional Trust  Lands Board of Trustees used a formula to charge $1.43 or $2.35 per AUM  for grazing on lands that it manages. The board initially used the federal fee  as the base rate for the state fee, but it now establishes the state fee by  adjusting the previous year\u2019s fee up or down, based on the 7-year trend of  local prices for cattle, sheep, wool, and hay. The fees on state trust lands  are typically about 60 to 90 cents more than the federal grazing fee: $2.25 in  fiscal year 2004 plus a fee of 10 cents for weed and insect control.

In 2004, the Washington State  Department of Natural Resources charged $5.41 per AUM for range  permits and $7.76 per AUM for grazing leases on lands that it manages.  Range permits provide only the right to forage over a large area of land for  a limited period of time each year, whereas grazing leases provide full  leasehold rights, including control of the land. The fee for the range permits  is set by a formula that considers several factors, including average  livestock weight gain and livestock prices. The fee for the grazing leases is  based on a 5-year rolling average of private fees, adjusted downward to  account for higher operating costs on state lands, since the state provides  no fences or other on-site services.
