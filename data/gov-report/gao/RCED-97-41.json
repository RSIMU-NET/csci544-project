S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) officials do not treat them in the same way as nonminority farmers in the conduct of USDA\u2019s programs, particularly in decisions made in the Department\u2019s county offices and district loan offices. Because of this concern, the former Chairman and Ranking Minority Member requested in April 1996 that we review the efforts of the Department\u2019s Farm Service Agency (FSA) to conduct farm programs in an equitable manner. Specifically, they asked us to (1) identify FSA\u2019s efforts to treat minority farmers in the same way as nonminority farmers in delivering program services; (2) examine the representation of minorities in county office staffing and on county committees in the counties with the highest numbers of minority farmers; and (3) examine data on the disposition of minority and nonminority farmers\u2019 applications for participation in the Agricultural Conservation Program (ACP) and the direct loan program at the national level and in five county and five district loan offices.", "The county and district offices we visited were chosen because they had higher disapproval rates for minority farmers than for nonminority farmers for the ACP and the direct loan program or because they were located in counties with high numbers of minority farmers. Because the number of offices we visited was small, we cannot generalize our findings to FSA\u2019s offices nationwide."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Within USDA, FSA has the overall administrative responsibility for implementing agricultural programs. FSA is responsible for, among other things, stabilizing farm income, helping farmers conserve environmental resources, and providing credit to new or disadvantaged farmers. FSA\u2019s management structure is highly decentralized; the primary decision-making authority for approving loans and applications for a number of agricultural programs rests in its county and district loan offices. In county offices, for example, committees, made up of local farmers, are responsible for deciding which farmers receive funding for the ACP. Similarly, FSA officials in district loan offices decide which farmers receive direct loans.", "At the time of our review, the ACP provided funds for conservation projects that, among other things, controlled erosion resulting from planting and harvesting crops and alleviated water quality problems caused by farming, such as the pollution produced by animal waste. The federal government generally paid up to 75 percent of a project\u2019s cost, up to a maximum of $3,500 annually. FSA, in conjunction with other departmental agencies, set national priorities for the program, and FSA allocated funds annually to the states on the basis of these priorities. The states in turn distributed funds to the county committees on the basis of the states\u2019 priorities. Farmers could propose projects at any time during the fiscal year, and the county committees could approve the proposals at any time after the funds became available. Consequently, county committees often obligated their full funding allocation before receiving all proposals for the year.", "The district loan offices administer the direct loan program, which provides farm ownership and operating loans to individuals who cannot obtain credit elsewhere at reasonable rates and terms. Each district loan office is responsible for one or more counties. The district loan office\u2019s agricultural credit manager is responsible for approving and servicing these loans. FSA accepts a farmer\u2019s loan application documents, reviews and verifies these documents, determines the applicant\u2019s eligibility to participate in the loan program, and evaluates the applicant\u2019s ability to repay the loan. In servicing these loans, FSA assists in developing farm financial plans, collects loan payments, and restructures delinquent debt.", "For both the ACP and the direct loan program, as well as other programs, farmers may appeal disapproval decisions to USDA\u2019s National Appeals Division (NAD). For the period of our review, about 7 percent of the direct loan appeals to the Division were from minority farmers. In April 1991, we reported that NAD had reversed loan application decisions at comparable rates for minorities and nonminorities. NAD\u2019s database does not separately identify appeals from ACP applicants; we therefore could not obtain this type of data for the ACP.", "Recently, some minority farmers publicized their concerns that the Department, among other things, takes longer to process the loan applications of minority farmers than of other farmers and has denied debt relief to minority farmers. Subsequently, the Secretary of Agriculture promised to (1) create a civil rights action team to look at the Department\u2019s treatment of minority farmers, as well as other related issues, and (2) hold national and statewide forums on the issue early in 1997. In addition, the Secretary suspended all farm foreclosures and asked the Department\u2019s Office of Inspector General to review the Department\u2019s system for handling discrimination complaints, including the length of time taken to investigate and resolve such complaints."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ongoing Efforts to Enhance Minority Farmers\u2019 Participation in Farm Programs", "paragraphs": ["FSA\u2019s efforts to achieve equitable treatment for minority farmers are overseen by the agency\u2019s Civil Rights and Small Business Development Staff.

In addition to these efforts, FSA recently increased its outreach activities to minority farmers to encourage their involvement in the Department\u2019s programs, including their signing of 7-year production flexibility contracts."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Civil Rights and Small Business Development Staff", "paragraphs": ["FSA\u2019s Civil Rights and Small Business Development Staff is responsible for evaluating the agency\u2019s compliance with civil rights requirements. While we did not evaluate the quality and thoroughness of the Staff\u2019s activities, we noted that a number of efforts are ongoing in this area. The Staff has investigated a number of discrimination complaints filed by farmers. During fiscal years 1995 and 1996, the Staff closed 28 cases in which discrimination was alleged on the basis of race or national origin. In 26 of these cases, the Staff found no discrimination. In the other two cases, the Staff found that FSA employees had discriminated on the basis of race in one case and national origin in the other. USDA has not resolved how it will deal with the employees and compensate the affected farmers. As of January 7, 1997, the Staff had 110 cases of discrimination alleged on the basis of race or national origin under investigation. Ninety-one percent of these cases were filed since January 1, 1995.", "In addition to investigating individual complaints of discrimination, the Staff periodically evaluates state and county offices\u2019 compliance with EEO and civil rights requirements as part of its routine assessments of these offices\u2019 overall operations. During fiscal years 1995 and 1996, the Staff evaluated management activities within 13 states. None of the evaluations concluded that minority farmers were being treated unfairly.", "Beginning in 1993, the Staff began to present revised EEO and civil rights training to all FSA state and county employees. About half of the FSA employees have been trained, according to the Staff, and all are scheduled to complete this training by the end of 1997. The training covers such areas as civil rights (program delivery) and EEO counseling, mediation, and complaints."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Outreach to Minority Farmers", "paragraphs": ["FSA has efforts under way to inform all farmers about USDA\u2019s programs, as well as special efforts to keep minority farmers informed about and enrolled in these programs. To reach all farmers, county offices maintain updated mailing lists and, through periodic newsletters and other announcements, keep all those who own or operate farms in a county informed about new programs and program requirements.", "In addition to its general outreach activities, FSA has specific efforts to increase minority farmers\u2019 participation in agricultural programs. For example, since September 1993, the Small Farmer Outreach Training and Technical Assistance Program has made grants available to at least 28 entities for outreach and assistance to minority farmers. These entities include such institutions as historically black and Native American colleges and universities. Among other things, grant recipients assist applicants in applying for loans and in developing sound farm management practices. Over 2,500 FSA borrowers have been served by these efforts. FSA has also assisted Native American farmers by establishing satellite offices on reservations.", "More recently, in July 1996, FSA created an outreach office to increase minority farmers\u2019 knowledge of, and participation in, the Department\u2019s agricultural programs. According to FSA officials, the office is currently identifying the outreach services that FSA already provides to minority farmers and is assessing the need for additional efforts.", "FSA hired the Federation of Southern Cooperatives to increase the number of minority farmers participating in the 1996 farm bill\u2019s 7-year production flexibility contracts. It has also trained members of the Rural Coalition in the process for electing county committee members. The Rural Coalition consists of several grass-roots groups that provide outreach to minorities in order to increase the number of minorities nominated and elected to county committees."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Employment of Minority Staff in County Offices and Representation of Minority Farmers on County Committees", "paragraphs": ["In the 101 counties with the highest numbers of minority farmers, representing 34 percent of all minority farmers in the nation, FSA employees and county committee members were often members of a minority group.

In the offices serving 77 of these counties, at least one staff member was from a minority group, and in 29 of these offices, the executive director was a member of a minority group. In these 101 counties, minority farmers make up about 17 percent of the farmer population.", "At the time of our visits, 7 of the 10 county and district loan offices included in our review had at least one minority employee. The executive directors of two county offices, Holmes, Mississippi, and Duval, Texas, were members of a minority group, as were the managers of two district loan offices, Elmore, Alabama, and Jim Wells, Texas, and the deputy managers of three district loan offices, Holmes, Jim Wells, and Byron, Georgia.", "The number of minority employees could change as FSA continues its current reorganization. FSA plans to decrease its field structure staff from 14,683 in fiscal year 1993 to 11,729 in fiscal year 1997\u2014a change of about 20 percent.

FSA further required that if these counties did not elect a minority farmer to the county committee, the committee must appoint a minority adviser.", "As we reported in 1995, minority farm owners and operators, nationwide, accounted for about 5 percent of those eligible to vote for committee members, and about 2 percent of the county committee members came from a minority group. In our current review, we found that for the 101 counties with the highest numbers of minority farmers, 36 had at least one minority farmer on the county committee. In the five county offices we visited, two committees had minority members and the other three had minority advisers.", "In February 1996, the President issued a memorandum directing federal agencies to apply revised standards to their affirmative action programs to take into account changes that have occurred since the programs were first instituted. As a result, according to the Department, FSA can no longer require that minorities be placed on the county committee ballots in counties where 5 percent or more of the eligible voters are members of a minority group. However, FSA officials informed us that their policy requires state committees to ensure that county committees fairly represent all agricultural producers in their jurisdiction and that, when needed, minority advisers be used to ensure minority representation."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Reasons Provided for Disapprovals of ACP and Direct Loan Applications", "paragraphs": ["According to FSA\u2019s data, applications for the ACP for fiscal year 1995 and for the direct loan program from October 1994 through March 1996 were disapproved at a higher rate nationwide for minority farmers than for nonminority farmers. To develop an understanding of the reasons for disapprovals, we examined the files for applications submitted under both programs during fiscal years 1995 and 1996 in five county and five district loan offices. We chose these offices because they had higher disapproval rates for minority farmers or because they were located in areas with large concentrations of farmers from minority groups."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Reasons for Disapproval of ACP Applications", "paragraphs": ["Nationally, during fiscal year 1995, the disapproval rates for applications for ACP funds were 33 percent for minority farmers and 27 percent for nonminority farmers. We found some differences in the disapproval rates for different minority groups. Specifically, 25 percent of the ACP applications from Native American and Asian American farmers were disapproved, while 34 percent and 36 percent of the applications from African American and Hispanic American farmers, respectively, were disapproved.", "To develop an understanding of the reasons why disapprovals occurred, we examined the ACP applications for fiscal years 1995 and 1996 at five county offices. Table 1 shows the number of ACP applications during this period from minority and nonminority farmers in each of the five counties, as well as the number and percent of applications that were disapproved.", "When ACP applications were received in the county offices we visited, they were reviewed first for compliance with technical requirements. These requirements included such considerations as whether the site was suitable for the proposed project or practice, whether the practice was still permitted, or whether the erosion rate at the proposed site met the program\u2019s threshold requirements.", "Following this technical evaluation, if sufficient funds were available, the county committees approved all projects that met the technical evaluation criteria. This occurred for all projects in Dooly County and for a large majority of the projects in Glacier County. In Holmes County, the county committee ranked projects for funding using a computed cost-per-ton of soil saved, usually calculated by the Department\u2019s local office of the Natural Resources Conservation Service. The county committee then funded projects in order of these savings until it had obligated all funds.", "In the remaining two counties, Russell and Duval, the county committees, following the technical evaluations, did not use any single criterion to decide which projects to fund. For example, according to the county executive director in Russell County, the committee chose to fund several low-cost projects submitted by both minority and nonminority farmers rather than one or two high-cost projects. It also considered, and gave higher priority to, applicants who had been denied funds for eligible projects in previous years. In contrast, the Duval county committee decided to support a variety of farm practices. Therefore, it chose to allocate about 20 percent of its funds to projects that it had ranked as having a medium priority. These projects were proposed by both minority and nonminority farmers.", "In the aggregate, 98 of 271 applications from minority farmers were disapproved in the five county offices we visited. Thirty-three were disapproved for technical reasons and 62 for lack of funds. FSA could not find the files for the remaining three minority applicants. We found that the applications of nonminority farmers were disapproved for similar reasons. Of the 305 applications for nonminority farmers we reviewed, 106 were disapproved. Fifty-three were disapproved for technical reasons and 52 for lack of funds. FSA could not find the file for the remaining applicant. Approval and disapproval decisions were supported by material in the application files, and the assessment criteria used in each location were applied consistently to applications from minority and nonminority farmers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reasons for Disapproval of Direct Loan Applications", "paragraphs": ["Nationally, the vast majority of all applicants for direct loans have their applications approved. However, the disapproval rate for minority farmers is higher than for nonminority farmers. From October 1994 through March 1996, the disapproval rate was 16 percent for minority farmers and 10 percent for nonminority farmers. We found some differences in the disapproval rates for different minority groups. Specifically, 20 percent of the loan applications from African American farmers, 16 percent from Hispanic American farmers, 11 percent from Native American farmers, and 7 percent from Asian American farmers, were disapproved.", "To assess the differences in disapproval rates, we examined the direct loan applications for fiscal years 1995 and 1996 at five district loan offices.Table 2 shows the number of applications for direct loans during this period for minority and nonminority farmers in each of the five districts, as well as the number and percent of applications disapproved.", "Our review of the direct loan program files in these locations showed that FSA\u2019s decisions to approve and disapprove applications appeared to follow USDA\u2019s established criteria. These criteria were applied to the applications of minority and nonminority farmers in a similar fashion and were supported by materials in the files. The process for deciding on loan applications is more uniform for the direct loan program than for the ACP. The district loan office first reviews a direct loan application to determine whether the applicant meets the eligibility criteria, such as being a farmer in the district, having a good credit rating, and demonstrating managerial ability. Farmers who do not demonstrate this ability may take a course, at their own expense, to meet this standard. If the applicant meets these criteria, the loan officer determines whether the farmer meets the requirements for collateral and has sufficient cash flow to repay the loan. These decisions are based on the Farm and Home Plan\u2014the business operations plan for the farmer\u2014prepared by the loan officer with information provided by the farmer. If the collateral requirements and the cash flow are sufficient, the farmer generally receives the loan.", "In the five district loan offices we visited, 22 of the 115 applications from minority farmers were disapproved. Twenty were disapproved because the applicants had poor credit ratings or inadequate cash flow. One was disapproved because the applicant was overqualified and was referred to a commercial lender. In the last case, the district loan office was unable to locate the loan file because it was apparently misplaced in the departmental reorganization. However, correspondence dealing with this applicant\u2019s appeal to NAD indicates that the application was disapproved because the applicant did not meet the eligibility criterion for recent farming experience. NAD upheld the district loan office\u2019s decision. The Department allows all farmers to appeal adverse program decisions made at the local level through NAD. The division conducts administrative hearings on program decisions made by officers, employees, or committees of FSA and other USDA agencies.", "The applications of nonminority farmers that we reviewed were disapproved for similar reasons. Of the 144 applications from nonminority farmers we reviewed, 15 were disapproved. Nine were disapproved because of poor credit ratings or inadequate cash flow; five were disapproved because the applicants did not meet eligibility criteria; and one was disapproved because of insufficient collateral.", "Additionally, in reviewing the 129 approved applications of nonminority farmers, we did not find any that were approved with evidence of poor credit ratings or insufficient cash flow.", "For the period of our review, we also wanted to obtain information on whether FSA was more likely to foreclose on loans to minority farmers while restructuring or writing down loans to nonminority farmers. We found only one foreclosed loan\u2014for a nonminority farmer\u2014in the five district loan offices we reviewed. We also found 62 cases in which FSA restructured delinquent loans. Twenty-two of these were for minority farmers.", "Finally, the amount of time FSA takes to process applications from minority and nonminority farmers is about the same. Nationwide, from October 1994 through March 1996, FSA took an average of 86 days to process the applications of nonminority farmers and an average of 88 days to process those of minority farmers.

Additionally, whenever a sample from a universe is selected, the estimates made are always subject to error introduced by the sampling procedure. When samples are small, as they would have been in this case, the estimation error tends to be quite large. The only way to decrease the estimation error is to increase the sample size.
