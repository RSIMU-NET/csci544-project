A living will is a written expression of how an individual  wants to be treated in certain medical circumstances.

A living will applies to situations in  which the decision to use life-sustaining treatments may prolong an  individual\u2019s life for a limited period of time and not obtaining such  treatment would result in death.

A health care power of attorney is a  document that identifies a health care agent\u2014also called a health  care proxy\u2014as the decision maker for the patient. Under state law,  the health care power of attorney typically becomes operative when  an individual is medically determined as unable to make decisions.  Most commonly, this situation occurs either because the individual is  unconscious or because the individual\u2019s mental state is such that they  do not have the legal capacity to make decisions. As with living wills,  the process for validly executing a health care power of attorney  depends on the state of residence. The health care power of attorney  may be designated by using a model form in state statute or it may be  drafted specifically for an individual by a lawyer. Similar to the living  will, medical providers will make the initial determination as to whether  an individual has the capacity to make their own medical treatment  decisions.", "Most adults in the United States do not have an advance directive.

In addition  to these two broad challenges, the officials we interviewed identified  challenges related to resources and the portability of advance care  planning documents.", "Individuals and providers may struggle with how and when to initiate  advance care planning conversations. We previously reported that  providers identified informing individuals about advance care planning as  a challenge due to reluctance to talk about end-of-life issues. In  addition, officials from both national and state stakeholder organizations  identified challenges to providers properly counseling their patients about  advance care planning, either to avoid discussing death and dying with  their patients, or because of their own uncertainties regarding the timing  of when to hold such discussions. In addition to challenges related to  having advance care planning conversations, individuals and providers  may not understand that filling out the document is voluntary or how to complete and follow the advance care planning document, according to  officials from national stakeholder organizations and officials in the four  selected states. Officials from national stakeholder organizations and  articles we reviewed noted that challenges with voluntarily completing  advance care planning documents can arise when there are language or  cultural barriers to understanding these documents. When individuals or  providers do not understand the information being requested in advance  care planning documents, it can affect whether an individual\u2019s wishes for  care are accurately represented. A state agency official in one state  identified challenges in ensuring EMS providers understand the  appropriate actions to take when they encounter a document that is  different from a traditional POLST form. For example, the state official  noted that EMS providers might assume that individuals who have a  wallet card on their person do not want CPR when the card actually  indicates that the individual has completed an advance directive or  POLST form to express their care wishes. This could result in treatment  that does not match the individual\u2019s expressed wishes.", "Once advance care planning documents are completed, additional  challenges exist to ensuring that providers have access to these  documents when needed, such as in an emergency situation. Officials  from the national stakeholder organizations, state agencies, and state  stakeholder organizations we interviewed identified challenges related to  accessing advance directives and POLST forms stored in EHRs.  Specifically, stakeholders identified challenges related to EHR  interoperability, such as where a provider in one health system cannot  access advance care planning documents recorded in an EHR at a  different health care system. While interoperability is not limited to  advance care planning documents, the challenges associated with  accessing advance care planning documents in EHRs can affect  providers\u2019 abilities to honor an individual\u2019s wishes in an emergency if they  do not have ready access to the documents. For example, when  emergency providers cannot readily access advance care planning  documents in another health system\u2019s EHR, the providers might not be  aware of and provide treatment inconsistent with the wishes of someone  they are treating in the emergency room. National stakeholder officials  also noted challenges due to a lack of standardization in EHR systems.  For example, one national stakeholder official noted that EHR systems in  health care facilities do not always have standardized processes for  storing advance care planning documents\u2014that is, one health care facility  might enter advance directive information into a physician\u2019s notes section  of the EHR, while another might have a specific tab in the EHR for  advance directives.

The program was implemented in three stages\u2014measures were  established at each stage to promote the use of EHRs in the delivery of  health care and to ensure that providers capture information in their EHRs  consistently. For example, one measure assessed whether providers  have the technical capability in their EHRs to notify the provider of  potential interactions among the patients\u2019 medications and with patients\u2019  allergies.

This  optional measure for eligible hospitals was a yes/no measure of whether  users could record whether a patient has an advance directive. In  October 2015, CMS released the stage 3 final rule that also modified  elements of stage 2 reporting; this modification eased reporting  requirements and aligned them with other quality reporting programs,  according to agency officials. For both modified stage 2 and stage 3  (2015 through 2017), the original advance directive measures were no  longer included.
