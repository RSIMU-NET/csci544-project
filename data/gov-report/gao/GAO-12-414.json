SIPC maintains a file of trustee candidates from across the country, but given the anticipated complexities of the case, officials said the field of potential qualified trustees was limited. SIPC has sole discretion to appoint trustees and, wanting to act quickly, SIPC senior management considered four trustee candidates. After three of the four candidates were eliminated for reasons including having a conflict of interest or ongoing work on a large financial firm failure, SIPC selected Irving H. Picard, who has considerable securities and trustee experience. However, SIPC has not documented a formal outreach procedure for identifying candidates for trustee and trustee\u0092s counsel, or documented its procedures and criteria for selecting persons for particular cases, as internal control standards recommend. Having such documented procedures could allow SIPC to better assess whether it has identified an optimal pool of candidates, and to enhance the transparency of its selection decisions.", "A key goal of broker-dealer liquidations is to provide customers with the securities or cash they had in their accounts. However, because the Trustee determined that amounts shown on Madoff customers\u0092 statements reflected years of fictitious investments and profits, he chose to determine customers\u0092 net equity using the \u0093net investment method\u0094 (NIM), which values customer claims based on amounts invested, less amounts withdrawn. SIPC senior management and officials of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)\u0097which oversees SIPC\u0097initially agreed on the appropriateness of NIM. Over the course of 2009, however, SEC officials continued to consider alternative approaches for reimbursing customers. Although some customers have challenged the Trustee\u0092s use of NIM, two courts have held that the Trustee\u0092s approach is consistent with the law and with past cases, with both courts indicating that using the values shown on customers\u0092 final statements would effectively sanction the Madoff fraud and produce \u0093absurd\u0094 results. In November 2009, SEC commissioners voted to support the use of NIM, but with an adjustment for inflation, in an approach known as the \u0093constant dollar\u0094 method. However, after an SEC official\u0092s conflict of interest was made public in February 2011, the SEC Chairman directed SEC staff to review whether the commission should revote on the constant dollar approach. The matter is currently pending.", "As of October 2011, costs of the Madoff liquidation reached more than $450 million, and the Trustee estimates the total costs will exceed $1 billion by 2014. Legal costs, which include costs for the Trustee and the trustee\u0092s counsel, are the largest category. While the estimated total cost for the Madoff liquidation is double the total for all completed SIPC cases to date, the Trustee, SIPC, and SEC note that the costs reflect the unprecedented size, duration, and complexity of the Madoff fraud. SIPC senior management also said the liquidation costs are justified, as litigation the trustee has pursued has produced $8.7 billion in recoveries for customers to date. Through various reports, court filings, and a website, the Trustee has disclosed information about the status of the liquidation. SIPC senior management, SEC officials, and the U.S. Bankruptcy Court have concluded that the Trustee\u0092s disclosures sufficiently address the requirements for disclosure under the Bankruptcy Code and the Securities Investor Protection Act."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["SEC should advise SIPC to (1) document its procedures for identifying candidates for trustee or trustee\u0092s counsel, and in so doing, to assess whether additional outreach efforts should be incorporated, and (2) document a process and criteria for appointment of a trustee and trustee\u0092s counsel.

After the fraud was disclosed, investigators found no securities  were ever purchased for customers. Within days of Madoff\u2019s arrest, the  Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), a nonprofit,  nongovernmental membership corporation responsible for providing  financial protection to customers of failed securities firms, put the Madoff  firm into liquidation. As part of this process, SIPC designated a trustee,  attorney Irving H. Picard (referred to as the Trustee throughout this  report), to oversee the liquidation of the firm and recover assets for the  benefit of investors.", "The Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 (SIPA) established  procedures for liquidating failed broker-dealers. In a liquidation under  SIPA, the trustee establishes a fund of customer property consisting of  the cash and securities held by the broker-dealer on behalf of customers,  plus any assets recovered by the trustee, for distribution among  customers. Amounts in this customer property fund generally are  distributed to the firm\u2019s customers according to the value of their account  holdings, known as \u201cnet equity.\u201d Determination of net equity is a crucial  step in settling customer claims for reimbursement from the SIPC fund  and distributing any assets recovered from a firm\u2019s liquidation. According  to SIPC, in a typical case, net equity is based on amounts reflected on  statements from the broker-dealer firm to the customer, in what is known  as the \u201cfinal statement method\u201d (FSM). In the Madoff case, however, the  Trustee said he determined that securities positions shown on customer  statements were fictitious. Thus, he decided to value each customer\u2019s net  equity according to the amount of cash deposited less any amounts  withdrawn\u2014a method known as the \u201cnet investment method\u201d (NIM). As a  result, not all customers are eligible to receive funds from the liquidation.  Further, the Trustee has also been pursuing lawsuits, known as  \u201cavoidance\u201d or \u201cclawback\u201d actions, to recover funds from customers who  withdrew more from their accounts than they had invested. SIPC senior  management and officials of the Securities and Exchange Commission  (SEC), which has oversight responsibilities for SIPC, told us they  supported the Trustee\u2019s decision to use NIM.", "Because of the importance of the decision to use NIM in determining  customer claims, you asked us to examine a series of questions about  the actions of SIPC, the Trustee, and SEC as they relate to this decision.

If the SIPC fund becomes, or appears  to be, insufficient to carry out the purposes of SIPA, SIPC can borrow up  to $2.5 billion from the Treasury through SEC, whereby SEC would  borrow the funds from the Treasury and relend them to SIPC.

The broker-dealer has an opportunity to contest the  protective order application.

If SIPC were not to  act immediately, SEC could opt to seek court appointment of an SEC  receiver, pending SIPC action, according to SIPC senior management.  After SIPC makes its selection and the trustee is appointed, the  bankruptcy court holds a disinterestedness hearing, at which interested  parties can object to the selected individual and firm named as counsel.  The district court also orders removal of the liquidation proceeding to the  federal bankruptcy court for that district. To the extent that it is consistent  with SIPA, the proceeding is conducted pursuant to provisions of the  Bankruptcy Code.", "While SIPC designates the trustee, that person, once judicially appointed,  becomes an officer of the court. As such, the trustee exercises independent  judgment and does not serve as an agent of SIPC. Indeed, SIPC- designated trustees and SIPC have occasionally taken opposing legal  positions in liquidation proceedings. Under SIPA, the trustee must  investigate facts and circumstances relating to the liquidation; report to the  court facts indicating fraud, misconduct, mismanagement, or irregularities;  and submit a final report to SIPC and others designated by the court. Also,  the trustee is to periodically report to the court and SIPC on his or her  progress in distributing cash and securities to customers. The bankruptcy  court is to grant the trustee and trustee\u2019s counsel \u201creasonable  compensation\u201d for services rendered and reimbursement for proper costs  and expenses incurred in connection with the liquidation proceeding.", "Promptly after being appointed, the trustee must publish a notice of the  proceeding in one or more major newspapers, in a form and manner  determined by the court. The trustee also must see that a copy of the  notice is mailed to existing and recent customers listed on the broker- dealer\u2019s books and records, and provide notice to creditors in the manner  the Bankruptcy Code prescribes. Customers must file written statements  of claims. The notice typically informs customers how to file claims and  explains deadlines. Two deadlines apply. One is set by the bankruptcy  court supervising the proceeding, and the other by SIPA. The bankruptcy  court deadline for filing customer claims applies to customer claims for  net equity and may not exceed 60 days after the date that notice of the  proceeding is published. Failure to meet the deadline can affect whether  a customer claim is satisfied with securities or cash in lieu of securities.  The SIPA deadline occurs 6 months after the publication date. SIPA  mandates that the trustee cannot allow any customer or general creditor  claim received after the 6-month deadline, except claims filed by the  United States, any state or local government, or certain infants and  incompetent persons (although a request for an extension must be filed  before the 6-month period has lapsed).", "Once filed, claims undergo various review, according to the Trustee. First,  the Trustee\u2019s claims agent reviews claims for completeness; if information  is found to be missing, the claims agent sends a request for additional  information. Next, the Trustee\u2019s forensic accountants review each claim  form, information gathered from the Madoff firm\u2019s records regarding the  account at issue, and information submitted directly by the claimant. The  Trustee uses the results of this review in assessing his determination of  the claim. Finally, claims move to SIPC, where a claims review specialist  provides a recommendation to the Trustee on how each claim should be  determined. Once that recommendation has been made, the Trustee and  trustee\u2019s counsel review it, as well as legal or other issues raised  previously. When the Trustee has decided on resolution of a claim, he  issues a determination letter to the claimant.

If SIPC\u2019s president, general counsel, and vice president  for operations agree that a case should be opened, the SIPC president  requests authority from the SIPC board chair to begin the action.", "Upon receiving this authority, the SIPC president selects a trustee and  trustee\u2019s counsel after consultation within SIPC. According to SIPC senior  management, the SIPC board does not vote on the selections. Instead,  the selection relies on the judgment of SIPC senior management in what  they describe as a relatively narrow field of specialty. SIPC senior  management told us they attempt to match the size of the liquidation  proceeding with the capabilities of the individuals and firms that will  perform the liquidation. Typically in SIPC cases, the firm selected to act  as the trustee\u2019s counsel is the same law firm of which the trustee is a  member, and the statute explicitly permits this. According to SIPC  senior management, having a trustee from the same law firm increases  efficiency and cuts costs, as it provides better communication and allows  the trustee to make better use of legal resources.", "To assist in selection of a trustee or trustee\u2019s counsel, SIPC maintains a  file of candidates from across the country, which contains information  such as professional experience and billing rates, and it subscribes to an  information service that provides background information and ratings on  lawyers and law firms, and identifies areas of specialization. SIPC  informally assembles its roster from multiple sources, including inquiries  from firms interested in SIPC business and SIPC\u2019s experience with firms  it encounters in legal proceedings. Where SIPC is unfamiliar with local  practitioners, it will seek recommendations from SEC staff and local  judges. Among firms new to its roster, SIPC seeks to build their  experience by using them as trustee\u2019s counsel in relatively small cases in  which SIPC itself acts as trustee, or by having them serve as counsel in  matters in which the SIPA trustee or trustee\u2019s counsel discover during an  investigation a previously unknown conflict of interest, according to SIPC  senior management. At the conclusion of a case, SIPC senior  management prepares a legal and accounting evaluation of service  providers used. Included in this evaluation is a recommendation whether  to use the service provider again. If SIPC staff recommends against a  provider, SIPC senior management told us, the provider is less likely to  be selected in the future. We sought to review such evaluations, but SIPC  senior management declined to provide them to us on the grounds they  cover privileged attorney work-product information.", "According to SIPC senior management, the selection of the Madoff trustee  followed these past practices. Specifically, according to senior management,  the SIPC President received a call from SEC on December 11, 2008,  advising him that Madoff had just turned himself in to law enforcement and  had admitted to a massive fraud at his firm. Because of the likely size and  complexity of this case, SIPC senior management told us that selecting an  experienced attorney to act as trustee would be important, which limited the  field of potential trustees. Upon learning of the failure of the Madoff firm,  SIPC senior management used their experience and judgment to initially  identify four potential trustees from their pool of candidates, including Mr.  Picard. The three others were a former New York municipal finance official,  who was a lawyer and accountant but had not done a SIPC case and was  not a member of a law firm; an experienced liquidation attorney who was  already busy with another large financial firm failure; and another candidate  from a large New York law firm with extensive bankruptcy experience, but  that law firm had a disqualifying conflict of interest. Because of the situations  of the other candidates, SIPC contacted Mr. Picard on the morning of  December 11, 2008, and asked him to serve as trustee for the Madoff  liquidation. As described later, the law firm Mr. Picard would soon join, Baker  & Hostetler LLP (Baker Hostetler), was named as the trustee\u2019s counsel.  Similarly, SIPC senior management told us that SIPC followed a similar  process in the recent large failure of MF Global, Inc., in which they contacted  5 candidates, drawn from an initial field of about 10, before the selection was  made.", "Although SIPC senior management said the process in selecting the  Madoff trustee followed past selection practices, such practices are not  documented. According to SIPC senior management, current SIPC  policies do not document the decision process and any criteria applied in  making selections because senior managers rely on their judgment and  familiarity with individuals with appropriate experience. Further, they  noted they must act quickly to get a trustee in place for a failed firm as  soon as possible, because broker-dealer firms often fail with little advance  warning. Moreover, they said that getting a trustee in place quickly to take  over operations of the firm is essential to preserving assets and  maximizing returns to customers.", "However, federal and private sector standards for internal control  recommend that an entity document its system of internal controls, by such  means as management directives, policies, operating instructions, and  written manuals.criteria would allow SIPC\u2019s oversight agency, SEC, to more effectively  assess whether SIPC follows consistent practices in selecting trustees, as  well as increase the transparency of SIPC\u2019s decisionmaking. SEC officials  told us that having SIPC better document its selection process would  improve SEC\u2019s ability to oversee SIPC activities, in such areas as  determining the extent to which SIPC considered the fees charged by  trustees or how it addressed potential conflict-of-interest situations. SEC  officials told us they plan to discuss better documenting the trustee selection  process and criteria with SIPC.", "In the case of trustee selection, documented policies and  SIPC also has not documented its outreach process for identifying  potential candidates to serve as trustees. SIPC senior management told  us they do not make formal efforts to expand the trustee candidate roster,  such as by regularly or systematically identifying or approaching other  parties. They said they view such efforts as unnecessary or impractical  because the number of attorneys who conduct work relevant to broker- dealer bankruptcies is small enough that SIPC is already is aware of most  of them, or the attorneys already are familiar with SIPC. Moreover,  according to SIPC senior management, actively soliciting candidates  could be burdensome for SIPC, by producing too much information about  too many firms that can quickly become outdated. They told us such an  undertaking would duplicate information already available through its  information service subscription, and that because SIPA liquidations can  be infrequent and in more remote areas of the country, it is more efficient  to obtain current information on qualified firms through the information  service and the firms\u2019 websites.", "However, undertaking additional efforts to more systematically identify  other candidates, and to document this process, could help ensure that  the range of choices, which SIPC senior management acknowledges is  currently limited to a small group with the requisite skills, reflects the  widest capabilities available. Access to a potentially wider pool of  candidates could help ensure that SIPC is better equipped to meet its  responsibilities. SEC officials told us that SIPC\u2019s goal is to use individuals  and law firms capable of high-quality work, to avoid potentially damaging  legal decisions that could hinder SIPC in future liquidations. Having a  documented, formal outreach process would allow SEC to better assess  whether SIPC\u2019s outreach efforts are sufficient for ensuring that SIPC is  identifying the optimal pool of candidates. SEC officials told us they likely  would discuss with SIPC senior management whether its roster of  candidates is sufficiently broad, as a wider pool could preserve quality  while offering the opportunity for lowering costs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Trustee Has Considerable Experience", "paragraphs": ["The trustee that SIPC selected for the Madoff liquidation has considerable  industry and broker-dealer liquidation experience.

In particular,  according to SEC officials, in most SIPA liquidations, the books and  records of the broker-dealer match the amounts shown on customers\u2019  final statements. In many cases in which a broker-dealer fails, customer  accounts are transferred to another broker-dealer firm. However, in cases involving fraud, amounts in customer accounts may not correspond  to statement amounts\u2014as in the Madoff case\u2014and SIPA does not have  any particular provisions for fraud cases beyond its general terms.", "The Trustee told us that soon after the case began, and once he realized  the investment advisory unit of the Madoff firm was a Ponzi scheme, he  concluded that NIM\u2014also known as \u201cmoney-in/money-out\u201d\u2014was  appropriate. As noted earlier, this method determines customer net equity  as customer deposits less customer withdrawals; it does not rely upon  holdings reported on customers\u2019 final statements. Under NIM, Madoff  claimants are divided into two categories: \u201cnet winners,\u201d who have  withdrawn more than the amount they invested with the Madoff firm, and  \u201cnet losers,\u201d who have withdrawn less than they invested. Following the  firm\u2019s closure, the Trustee received 16,519 claims and denied most of  them, chiefly because customers did not have accounts with the Madoff  firm. The Trustee said the firm had 4,905 active accounts at the time of  closure. Determination of claim amounts under NIM resulted in 2,356 net  loser accounts and 2,459 net winner accounts.", "According to the Trustee, the chief reason for rejecting FSM in favor of  NIM was that adopting customer statement amounts as the basis for  account values would legitimize Madoff\u2019s fraud and cause account values  to hinge on the fictitious trading and returns that Madoff reported to  investors. The Trustee took the position that customer statements did not  show \u201csecurities positions\u201d that could be used for the net equity  determination, because the statements were fictitious. Instead, the only  Madoff records that reflected reality were those detailing the cash  deposits and withdrawals of customers. Thus, the Trustee asserted that  he was required to determine net equity based on these records, because  they provided the only obligations that could be ascertained and  established from the firm\u2019s books and records.", "The Trustee also said that NIM was the most equitable method for Madoff  customers. According to the Trustee, using FSM would allow some  customers to retain fictitious \u201cprofits\u201d they had withdrawn that actually  were misappropriated investments of other customers.

According to SIPC, such agreement was important in order to avoid a  situation that had arisen in a previous case in which SEC took a position  in court at odds with SIPC. Further, SIPC senior management said they  wanted to reach consensus early in the liquidation out of concern that  SEC would come under pressure to change its position as the extent of  customer losses became clearer.", "By February 2009, SIPC senior management believed that based on their  discussions, they had achieved consensus with SEC on use of NIM.  These discussions included a meeting with the SEC Chairman, who,  according to SIPC, reported that a majority of commissioners supported  NIM. SIPC senior management noted that NIM has unpleasant  consequences in some cases, but that honoring final statements would  mean others would receive less than the amount of their own  contributions. Further, adopting FSM would have put at risk a large  majority of asset recoveries the Trustee has secured, SIPC senior  management told us, because some funds withdrawn by customers that  otherwise could be subject to recovery actions under NIM would instead  be recognized as legitimate under FSM and thus not subject to recovery.", "Although initially agreeing on use of NIM, SEC staff continued to research  other options in a process that would extend until November 2009. SEC  officials told us their preliminary view in the early days of the case was  that NIM appeared to be the only feasible alternative, because it was the  most consistent with the statute and fraud law related to Ponzi schemes.  However, they said there was no official SEC position at the time. SEC\u2019s  continued examination was of great concern to SIPC, according to SIPC  senior management, who told us they saw the continuing analysis as a  reversal of the earlier support for NIM.

These outside parties advanced arguments including that the  Trustee\u2019s view of net equity was at odds with the statute and its legislative  history and purpose. In a letter to SEC, several law firms noted that the  typical Madoff customer received written trade confirmations and monthly  statements, which they said are the basis for determining net equity under  the statute. Further, they said the legislative history shows that Congress  intended customers to have valid net equity claims even when securities  reflected on their confirmations and account statements were never  purchased. The outside parties also argued that the Trustee\u2019s position  would erode investor confidence at a time\u2014during the financial crisis\u2014 when markets and the securities industry could least afford it.

Instead, SIPC senior management told us, the higher expenses are  necessary, because of the investigation required after Madoff\u2019s  statements to customers were found to be fabricated.

As a result, the Trustee petitioned  the bankruptcy court in August 2009 for proceedings to affirm his choice of  NIM. Opposing claimants argued that the Trustee must use FSM because  Madoff statements reflected securities positions that they had every reason  to believe were accurate and upon which they had relied. They  emphasized SIPA\u2019s purpose of reinforcing investor confidence and cited  the act\u2019s legislative history as indicating that securities positions set forth in  broker-dealer statements need not be accurate to be covered under SIPA.", "The opposing claimants further argued that Madoff\u2019s profits, while  fictitious, may have been received and spent years ago, that customers  paid taxes on them, and may have foregone other investment  opportunities in reliance on investment results shown in their statements.  They further maintained that, at least in the case of advances from the  SIPC fund, use of FSM would not limit payments to reimburse net losers  for their losses. This was because they viewed the SIPC fund as a source  for paying customer claims that operated independently of any customer  assets recovered by the Trustee. Thus, they claimed all customers, both  net winners and losers, could receive up to $500,000 from the SIPC fund  without affecting customer assets recovered during the liquidation.", "Both sides contended that precedent dealing with SIPA liquidations  involving Ponzi schemes supported their calculation method.

The court  agreed with the Trustee that net equity can be based on \u201csecurities  positions\u201d only to the extent that such positions are \u201cascertainable from the  books and records of the debtor\u201d or \u201cotherwise established to the  satisfaction of the trustee.\u201d The court further agreed that in a Ponzi scheme  like Madoff\u2019s\u2014in which no securities were ever ordered or acquired\u2014that  \u201csecurities positions\u201d do not exist, and the trustee cannot pay claims based  on the false premise that customer positions are what the account  statements purported them to be. The court added that legitimate customer  expectations based on false account statements \u201cdo not apply where they  would give rise to an absurd result.\u201d It said the Madoff customer  statements \u201cwere bogus and reflected Madoff\u2019s fantasy world of trading  activity, replete with fraud and devoid of any connection to market prices,  volumes, or other realities.\u201damounts evident from the Madoff firm\u2019s books and records are customer   Instead, the court said the only verifiable  cash deposits and withdrawals.

It concluded that payments from the SIPC fund were inextricably  connected to payments from customer assets, rejecting the argument by  FSM proponents to the contrary. Thus, use of FSM for SIPC advance  payments would diminish the amount available for distribution from the  customer asset fund. Because there are limited customer funds, any  funds paid to reimburse fictitious profits would no longer be available to  pay other claims.", "The court also agreed with the Trustee that NIM was more compatible  with efforts to recover assets. The court said that customer withdrawals  made in furtherance of a Ponzi scheme, and specifically, withdrawals  based on fictitious profits, can be subject to recovery actions. NIM  harmonizes the definition of net equity with clawback actions, by similarly  discrediting withdrawals based on fictitious profits, and unwinding, rather  than legitimizing, the fraud. The court noted that FSM, by contrast, would  base compensation to customers on the same withdrawals the trustee  has the power to seek to recover.", "In August 2011, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed use  of NIM as the appropriate method in the Madoff case. The appeals court  found that while SIPA does not prescribe a single method for determining  net equity in all situations, the Trustee\u2019s use of NIM was the best  proposed method given the statutory definition of net equity. The court  noted that use of FSM would have the absurd effect of legitimizing the  arbitrarily assigned paper profits that Madoff\u2019s fraud produced. The court  emphasized that while FSM may be appropriate in typical situations, the  nature of the Madoff Ponzi scheme, including \u201cextraordinary facts\u201d of the  Madoff fraud, point toward use of NIM. The court rejected the claimants\u2019  characterization of SIPA as providing an \u201cinsurance guarantee\u201d against  Madoff\u2019s fraud; rather, it said, SIPA does not clearly protect against all  fraud committed by brokers, or insure investors against all losses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Customer Claims Would Increase Significantly under FSM Compared with NIM", "paragraphs": ["According to information we reviewed, the differences in customer net  equity under the two approaches is significant, because during the  decades of his fraud, Madoff reported considerable investment gains to  his investors.

Table 3 shows a comparison of claims,  broken down by account size, under the as-adopted NIM and the as- proposed FSM.", "As table 3 shows, the number of accounts that potentially would have  allowable claims under FSM nearly doubles from the corresponding  number under NIM. This is because FSM generally accepts customer  statements as accurate representations of holdings, and thus even those  customers that withdrew more than they invested\u2014net winners\u2014would  also be entitled to have their claims approved. Total account value would  more than triple. However, this does not necessarily mean that customers  would recover their statement amounts under FSM. Rather, the amounts  distributed to customers will depend on how much the Trustee can  recover during the liquidation. If the amount recovered is less than the  amount of allowed claims\u2014as is currently expected\u2014then customers  receive payments based on their relative share of total claims.

According to  SEC staff, such adjustments would account for the length of time the  Madoff firm held customer funds. This has become known as the  \u201cconstant dollar approach.\u201d To date, neither the bankruptcy court nor the  appeals court has addressed the merits of the SEC position. SEC officials  told us they see the constant dollar approach as a way to treat customers  more fairly and equally.", "SEC\u2019s consideration of the constant dollar approach arose from the  agency review, as described earlier, of potential methods for calculating  customer claims. SEC officials told us that after they rejected FSM and  adjustments based on Treasury notes, study continued on whether  another method consistent with SIPA would allow customers to recover  more money. However, the focus of their efforts shifted from investments  that Madoff claimed to have made but did not, and toward the time value  of money, pegged to when customers made their investments, so that  customers would be treated equivalently in real dollar terms. The concept  was that this would recognize the long duration of the Madoff fraud.", "Under the constant dollar approach, a customer\u2019s series of deposits and  withdrawals over time would be adjusted for inflation and converted into  dollar amounts that reflect current price levels. The simplest instance would  be a single customer deposit made years ago that would be converted into  current dollars based on price changes over the specified period. For  example, according to the Consumer Price Index, the value of a $10,000  deposit made 20 years ago would be $16,156 in 2012 dollars. Calculations  would become more involved with multiple deposits and withdrawals over  time, but the basic reasoning of converting past transaction amounts into  current dollars would be the same, according to SEC officials.", "SEC officials told us their analysis indicated this approach could be  consistent with case law. Although case law has not specifically  recognized inflation adjustments, they said, it does provide support for the  general notion of seeking to treat investors equally. Translating that  concept to the Madoff case, SEC viewed inflation-adjustment as a way to  treat customers equally over time, during which price inflation would  occur. In a memorandum to commissioners, SEC\u2019s Office of General  Counsel said that failing to do so would ignore the effects of inflation on  innocent investors and treat early victims of the fraud inequitably  compared with later investors.", "SIPC senior management disagrees with SEC\u2019s analysis and conclusion,  saying the statute provides no authority for inflation adjustment and that  no such authority can be inferred or implied. According to SIPC,  determination of net equity is a specified mathematical function, and the  notion of adjusting net equity determinations for inflation is an SEC- created approach that the statute does not support. SIPC senior  management also noted that adjusting customer claims for inflation has  never come up before in any other SIPC case, because the fraud in the  Madoff case is atypical in having such a lengthy duration. While inflation  calculations likely could be done, there would be large costs in doing so,  given the scope of the case and the number of transactions. SIPC senior  management further noted that if inflation-adjustment were permitted, the  size of some claims would increase. Because the pool of funds to satisfy  customer claims is fixed, larger payouts to some could depress payments  to others, according to SIPC senior management. This could lead to  litigation among customers because some net winners could become net  losers.that illustrated how claims could change significantly. It showed a  beginning balance of $130,000 in 1992, followed by a series of 23  withdrawals totaling $145,900 made through 2008. Thus, the customer  had withdrawn $15,900 more than initially invested, and under NIM, is a  net winner whose claim would be denied. But after adjusting the  sequence of transactions for inflation, based on specific timing and  amounts, the customer would become a net loser\u2014having withdrawn  $29,829 less, in inflation-adjusted dollars, than originally contributed.", "We reviewed one sample of an inflation-adjusted Madoff account  The Trustee told us he did not consider a constant dollar approach, as it  is not in the statute or supported by case law. He concurred with SIPC  that claim amounts could increase considerably.

These roles  vary by the party and the stage of the proceeding.", "The Trustee noted that while he previously was at SEC and when serving  as U.S. trustee, he had experience reviewing fee applications. He  described a variety of ways by which he seeks to hold down expenses of  the Madoff liquidation. The general process for approval of costs begins  with the Trustee, who reviews them before submitting them to SIPC for its  review, prior to submission to the bankruptcy court. For billings, the  Trustee conducts a two-level review of Madoff-related time entries.  Following completion of work, a mid-level attorney reviews the billings,  and then a partner conducts another review. This second review is in  tandem with SIPC, the Trustee told us. The purpose of these reviews is to  determine whether too much time has been billed for a particular task. If  so, it is written off, the Trustee said. Information the trustee\u2019s counsel  produced for us, covering from inception through January 2011, showed  about 1 percent of hours worked not being billed, with about another 1.5  percent of hours being written off after review. The Trustee also said that  he does not bill for 5 percent to 10 percent of the time he spends on the  case.", "The Trustee said a similar review of billings takes place for costs  submitted by other law firms and consultants that the Trustee and  trustee\u2019s counsel use in their work. The Trustee said that in some cases,  amounts claimed are reduced. However, the Trustee did not have specific  amounts for any such reductions. The outside entities also discount their  billings at least 10 percent, as the Trustee and trustee\u2019s counsel do, with  some providing 11 or 12 percent discounts.", "In addition to billing reviews, the Trustee also described other approaches  intended to help ensure that costs incurred are necessary and  reasonable.", "Teams. Using teams, in which the same people work on similar  matters, to help achieve greater consistency and efficiency. For  example, the Trustee uses teams for different tasks, such as motions,  discovery, and litigation. For litigation, for example, the trustee\u2019s  counsel has set up about 16 teams, which work on similar topics,  such as employee-related, review of charities, or family-related  matters. The teams follow cases from beginning to end, taking  advantage of experience gained through the process and limiting  additional costs that could occur if staff were assigned work in  unfamiliar areas, according to the Trustee.", "Digitizing information. Computerizing information as much as possible  allows for faster, more efficient retrieval of information. This has  involved significant up-front costs, but the Trustee noted that it  reduces costs over time by avoiding the need to undertake time- consuming, expensive manual searches through thousands of boxes  of paper material.", "Budgeting work in advance. The Trustee said he uses a process in  which consultants must fill out project forms and provide budgets,  which are submitted and must be approved by trustee\u2019s counsel.  SIPC also receives some of these budgets. When bills are received  later, the trustee\u2019s counsel compares the amount claimed with the  budget, and there have been instances in which costs exceeding  budgeted amounts have been refused, according to the trustee.", "When the Trustee has completed in-house review of costs, he presents  them to SIPC for review. The Trustee may hold informal discussions with  SIPC before submitting actual costs for formal consideration. SIPC also  may contact outside vendors directly to inquire about charges. SIPC does  not pay for some charges, and following discussions with SIPC, the  Trustee may decide to write off some costs, according to the Trustee.", "As SIPC senior management said is typical, at the outset of the case,  they sought and obtained a 10 percent reduction in the hourly rates of the  Trustee and trustee\u2019s counsel. According to our review, this 10 percent  reduction has produced savings of $25 million through May 2011. In  addition, the Trustee and trustee\u2019s counsel have provided additional  reductions of $5.4 million over costs they said would customarily be billed.", "Some have suggested that SIPC should have sought a discount greater  than 10 percent. For example, the SEC Office of Inspector General has  reported that an SEC bankruptcy attorney raised questions whether a 10  percent discount for SIPC cases is sufficient. Similarly, the Inspector  General noted to us that the Madoff case began during the recent  financial crisis, when law firms\u2019 business was suffering, and suggested  that as a result, SIPC would have had strong leverage to negotiate lower  compensation for firms.", "SIPC senior management, however, told us that a 10 percent reduction is  appropriate for several reasons. Above that amount, service providers  object, and a 15 percent discount is not economical for sophisticated work  like that required in the Madoff case, according to SIPC senior  management. Also, SIPC senior management noted that liquidation  cases such as the Madoff matter draw highly qualified talent in opposing  counsel, so that as a result, SIPC also must draw upon highly qualified  providers. Furthermore, the 10 percent discount, coupled with  \u201choldbacks\u201d\u2014in which payment of approved amounts is not released until  later\u2014amount to a significant burden on the service provider, according  to SIPC. Finally, SIPC senior management said that the results the  Trustee has produced to date support the costs incurred. For these  reasons, SIPC has not sought a reduction greater than 10 percent in the  Madoff case.", "In addition to the 10 percent discount, SIPC has also created guidelines  for review and approval of costs. The guidelines cover matters including  obtaining a fee discount; submitting costs; reviewing costs submitted; and  documenting questions and discussions relating to the review of costs,  including items flagged for attention or reduced or written off. Under these  guidelines, a SIPC attorney reviews each time entry and expense item  submitted, after which they prepare a memorandum to the SIPC general  counsel, summarizing findings and making recommendations for  approval. The general counsel is to review the memo and  recommendations, before approving, modifying, or rejecting the cost  request. SIPC senior management told us they followed the guidelines  in the Madoff case. Also as part of this portion of the review process,  SIPC\u2019s general counsel makes a line-by-line review of Trustee and  trustee\u2019s counsel invoices, according to SIPC senior management.", "Because costs in the Madoff case are so much greater than in previous  SIPC cases, the Trustee, working with SIPC, has established \u201clitigation  budgets\u201d for the many lawsuits resulting from the case. These budgets detail expected costs of specific litigation, and for each case, divide tasks  into specific categories, including research, drafting, motions, discovery,  trial, appeal, and collection. According to SIPC senior management, this  budgeting process is aimed at managing costs in advance or as they are  being incurred, rather than after-the-fact. In addition, several SIPC  personnel are in daily contact with the Trustee or trustee\u2019s counsel. As a  result, they are aware what activities are planned, and will discuss them  ahead of time. They also discuss possible future actions. SIPC senior  management told us the Trustee has revised certain planned actions or  changed direction as a result of such discussions during the case.", "We sought details on the extent to which SIPC has reduced or disallowed  expenses submitted by the Trustee. SIPC senior management declined to  provide documentation of its cost reviews, citing attorney work-product  privilege. According to SIPC, releasing such information could provide an  unfair advantage to litigation opponents and undermine attempts to  recover assets on behalf of customers. Similarly, SIPC noted that  releasing the litigation budgets could allow an opposing party to see how  much has been allocated for an activity in litigation, which can provide a  tactical advantage to opposing parties. However, the trustee\u2019s counsel  provided us information on amounts written off at SIPC\u2019s request.  According to this information, the trustee\u2019s counsel has written off, at  SIPC\u2019s request, less than 1 percent of hours submitted. For the Trustee,  SIPC-requested reductions to billings have been about 0.02 percent,  according to the information provided by the trustee\u2019s counsel. SIPC  senior management also declined to provide other cost review-related  information we requested, again citing attorney work-product privilege.", "In the Madoff case, the bankruptcy court has a limited ability to oversee  costs. As noted earlier, the Trustee and trustee\u2019s counsel submit legal  costs to SIPC, which reviews them, before filing with the bankruptcy court a  recommendation on what the court should approve. SIPC files the  recommendation after the trustee and trustee\u2019s counsel file their detailed  cost applications with the court. Under SIPA, the court must approve cost  applications if two conditions are met: (1) if there is no reasonable  expectation of SIPC recouping its advances, and (2) if SIPC recommends  to the court that it approve the costs requested by the trustee and trustee\u2019s  counsel. In the Madoff case, both conditions have been met.", "For the first condition, SIPC does not anticipate recouping its  administrative advances because it expects that recoveries by the  Trustee will be insufficient to cover all approved customer claims. SIPC  senior management told us that they have opted to devote all asset  recoveries\u2014of both investor funds and sale of assets of the Madoff firm  itself\u2014to repaying approved customer claims. If a trustee can recover  assets that exceed the amount of allowed customer claims, SIPC has a  priority claim on the excess assets, in order to recoup its advances to  cover liquidation costs. However, based on expected recoveries in the  Madoff case, SIPC senior management does not expect there will be any  excess assets. The current Trustee estimate of allowed claims is $17.3  billion, compared with $9.1 billion in Trustee recoveries and settlements.  Thus, about $8.3 billion in additional recoveries would be needed, and  based on current Trustee assets, lawsuits filed, and the estimated  possibilities for recoveries arising from that litigation, SIPC senior  management does not now expect this level of recoveries to occur.", "For the second condition, SIPC has recommended that the bankruptcy  court approve the legal costs requested in the applications submitted to the  bankruptcy court. SIPC senior management told us that the statute  requires the court to defer to SIPC\u2019s judgment on the appropriateness of  expenses because it is SIPC that faces the economic risk of covering the  costs in situations where SIPC does not expect recoveries to be sufficient  to recoup its advances. For the first seven rounds of approved cost  applications to date, the bankruptcy court has approved all of the legal  compensation and expense requests submitted by SIPC for the Trustee  and trustee\u2019s counsel. Although the court has been obliged to approve the  cost applications because the two conditions have been met, the judge has  said in hearings on the applications that notwithstanding the statutory  requirement, he would nevertheless approve the costs on the basis of the  work performed.", "Although SEC has oversight authority over SIPC, it does not have a direct  role in approving costs incurred in any particular SIPC liquidation.  Instead, fee exams typically take place as part of its general examinations  of SIPC, and SEC officials told us they plan a review of Trustee and  trustee\u2019s counsel costs in coming months. In a March 2011 report, the  SEC Inspector General noted that the Madoff and Lehman Brothers  cases\u2014the two largest liquidations in SIPC history\u2014had focused new  attention on concerns about the amount of trustee fees. The report made  recommendations to improve SEC\u2019s oversight of SIPC liquidation costs.  For example, the report recommended that SEC encourage SIPC to  negotiate more vigorously with court-appointed trustees to obtain fee  reductions greater than 10 percent and to develop a more regular process  for monitoring SIPC\u2019s oversight of costs, rather than relying on  examinations that do not occur regularly. The report also asked SEC to  assess whether SIPA should be modified to allow bankruptcy judges  presiding over SIPA liquidations to assess the reasonableness of  administrative costs in cases in which SIPC pays the costs. The  respective units of SEC indicated they concurred with these  recommendations, and SEC officials told us that formal responses are  being prepared."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "SIPC, SEC, and the Bankruptcy Court Have Been Satisfied That the Trustee Has Made Sufficient Disclosures", "paragraphs": ["Trustees for SIPA liquidations generally have the same duties as trustees  for liquidations under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.

To address customer claims, the Trustee told us that he  provided determination letters to Madoff customers, showing individual  account transactions and how net equity for their accounts was  determined. For customers with questions about their claims  determinations, the trustee\u2019s counsel was available to provide additional  information, which in some cases, involved sharing information contained  in the records maintained by the Madoff firm. The Trustee has also  provided information to former Madoff account holders seeking  information necessary for tax returns or for filing fraud claims under  homeowner\u2019s insurance coverage.

In addition, the bankruptcy court opinion  included an exhibit that outlined the competing arguments in detail.", "The issue of how to determine net equity in the Madoff case turned on  two key SIPA provisions: One is the definition of \u201cnet equity\u201d in section  16(11) of the act, which generally requires the trustee to determine a  customer\u2019s net equity by \u201ccalculating the sum which would have been  owed by the  debtor to such customer if the debtor had  liquidated, by sale or purchase on the filing date . . . all securities  positions of such customer . . . minus . . . any indebtedness of such  customer to the debtor on the filing date . . .\u201d (emphasis added).", "SEC\u2019s position differed from the Trustee\u2019s in one respect. SEC advocated adding an  inflation adjustment to customers\u2019 NIM claims, to compensate them for the time value of  their money. It referred to this as the \u201cconstant dollar approach.\u201d See 424 B.R. at 125, n.  8. Neither the bankruptcy court nor the Court of Appeals have addressed the merits of the  SEC position thus far.", "The other is section 8(b) of the act, which requires the Trustee to  determine net equity claims \u201cinsofar as such obligations are ascertainable  from the books and records of the debtor or are otherwise established to  the satisfaction of the trustee.\u201d", "The Trustee, supported by SIPC and SEC, took the position that because  the statements customers received from the Madoff firm were fictitious,  they did not show \u201csecurities positions\u201d that could be relied upon for  purposes of the net equity determination. Instead, the only Madoff firm  records that reflected reality were those recording the cash deposits and  withdrawals of customers. Thus, the Trustee argued, the plain language  of section 8(b) required the trustee to determine net equity based on  these records, since they provided the only obligations that could be  established from the Madoff firm\u2019s books and records. Accordingly, in his  view, NIM was the only legally permissible option.", "The Trustee also contended that fairness considerations strongly  supported use of NIM. Using FSM would exacerbate Madoff\u2019s fraud and  enable some Madoff customers to retain \u201cprofits\u201d that were in reality the  misappropriated investments of other customers. Moreover, FSM would  divert the limited customer assets available in the bankrupt estate by  paying imaginary \u201cprofits\u201d at the expense of reimbursing real losses. The  Trustee also argued that using FSM could conflict with his obligation to  recover the fictitious profits paid out by the Madoff firm through avoidance  actions. \u201cWhat The Customer Gets. A customer generally expects to receive what he believes  is in his account at the time the stockbroker ceases business. But because securities  may have been lost, improperly hypothecated, misappropriated, never purchased or  even stolen, this is not always possible. Accordingly, when the customer claims for a  particular stock exceed the supply available to the trustee in the debtor\u2019s estate, then  customers generally receive pro rata portions of the securities claims, and as to any  remainder, they will receive cash based on the market value as of the filing date.\u201d", "FSM advocates also argued that the profits Madoff reported, while  fictitious, may have been withdrawn and spent years ago; that customers  paid taxes on them; and they may have foregone other investment  opportunities in reliance on investment results shown in their statements.", "Furthermore, they maintained that, at least in the case of advances from  the SIPC fund, use of FSM would not limit payments to reimburse net  losers for their losses. They viewed the SIPC fund as a payment source  for customer claims that operated separately and independently from any  customer assets in the bankrupt estate. Thus, all claimants, both net  winners and losers, could potentially receive up to $500,000 from the  SIPC fund without any decrease in customer property.", "Finally, both sides contended that judicial precedent dealing with SIPA  liquidations involving Ponzi scheme cases (discussed in the following  section) supported their calculation method."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Bankruptcy Court Affirmed the Trustee\u2019s Selection of NIM", "paragraphs": ["\u201cThe Court recognizes that the application of the Net Equity definition to the complex  and unique facts of Madoff\u2019s massive Ponzi scheme is not plainly ascertainable in law.  Indeed, the parties have advanced compelling arguments in support of both positions.  Ultimately, however, upon a thorough and comprehensive analysis of the plain  meaning and legislative history of the statute, controlling Second Circuit precedent, and  considerations of equity and practicality, the Court endorses the Trustee\u2019s Net  Investment Method.\u201d", "Specifically, the court agreed with the Trustee that sections 16(11) and  8(b) of the act must be read together, so that net equity can be based on  \u201csecurities positions\u201d only to the extent that securities positions are  \u201cascertainable from the books and records of the debtor\u201d or \u201cotherwise  established to the satisfaction of the trustee.\u201d The court further agreed  that in a Ponzi scheme case like the Madoff fraud, where no securities  were ever ordered or acquired, securities positions did not exist, and the  Trustee cannot satisfy claims by relying upon fictitious account  statements that provided fictitious securities positions. Instead, only cash  deposits and withdrawals were verifiable from the books and records of  the Madoff firm. based on false account statements \u201cdo not apply where they would give  rise to an absurd result.\u201d", "Id. at 135. \u201cSIPC payments therefore serve only to replace missing customer property and cannot  be ascertained independently of the determination of the customer\u2019s pro rata share of  customer property. Accordingly, the SIPA statute does not allow bifurcation of the  claims process, with customers recovering SIPC payments based on the   Statement Method, and recovering customer property shares based on the Net  Investment Method.\u201d \u201cWhile the Court recognizes that the outcome of this dispute will inevitably be  unpalatable to one party or another, notions of fairness and the need for practicality  also support the Net Investment Method.\u201d  \u201cAs distribution of customer property to the \u2018equally innocent victims\u2019 of Madoff\u2019s fraud  is a zero-sum game, equity dictates that the Court implement the Net Investment  Method. Customer property consists of a limited amount of funds that are available for  distribution. Any dollar paid to reimburse a fictitious profit is a dollar no longer available  to pay claims for money actually invested. If the  Statement Method were  adopted, Net Winners would receive more favorable treatment by profiting from the  principal investments of Net Losers, yielding an inequitable result.\u201d424 B.R. at 134.", "The bankruptcy court also agreed with the Trustee that NIM was more  compatible with trustee avoidance powers under the Bankruptcy Code. \u201cThe Trustee relies on numerous cases, all holding that transfers made in furtherance  of a Ponzi scheme, and specifically transfers of fictitious profits, are avoidable. The Net  Investment Method harmonizes the definition of Net Equity with these avoidance  provisions by similarly discrediting transfers of purely fictitious amounts and unwinding,  rather than legitimizing, the fraudulent scheme. The  Statement Method, by  contrast, would create tension within the statute by centering distribution to customers  on the very fictitious transfers the Trustee has the power to avoid.\u201d", "Finally, the bankruptcy court concluded that judicial precedent involving  Ponzi scheme cases, including In re New Times Securities Services, Inc.,  supported use of NIM in the Madoff liquidation.  New Times also  concerned a SIPA liquidation arising out of a Ponzi scheme fraud.", "In New Times, some investors (known as \u201creal securities claimants\u201d) had  been offered shares in real mutual funds, which the Ponzi schemer- debtor never purchased. Other investors (known as \u201cfake securities  claimants\u201d) purchased shares in fictitious money market funds with  fictitious names. The debtor generated monthly statements for both sets  of investors that showed fictitious securities positions as well as interest  and dividend earnings. The SIPA trustee in New Times treated the two  sets of investors differently. He determined that for those investors whose  fictitious statements reflected the purchase of real securities, their net  equity for purposes of the act should be based on the positions shown in  their statements\u2014that is, he applied FSM. (This treatment was not before  the court in New Times.) However, the trustee determined that for  investors whose statements reflected earnings from the entirely fictitious  funds, their net equity was limited to their initial investments\u2014that is, he  applied NIM to them.", "371 F.3d 68 (2d Cir. 2004).

The district court sided with the investors, holding  that their net equity should be calculated using FSM, recognizing the  fictitious interest and dividend reinvestment earnings shown on their  statements. The SIPA trustee then appealed the district court\u2019s decision.  SEC joined SIPC in maintaining that NIM should be used to determine the  fictitious fund investors\u2019 net equity.", "On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit endorsed the joint  position of SIPC and SEC that net equity of the fake securities claimants  should be based solely on their initial investments, excluding imaginary  interest and dividends shown on the statements. The appeals court  agreed that basing recoveries on fictitious interest and dividend amounts  would be \u201cirrational and unworkable.\u201d", "In the Madoff litigation, both parties argued that New Times supported  their position. The Madoff net winners argued they should be compared to  the first group of New Times customers, who were supposedly invested in  real mutual funds, because Madoff\u2019s account statements showed  positions in real securities. Because the real securities claimants in New  Times had their net equity calculated by FSM, Madoff net winners argued  they should likewise have their net equity calculated by FSM.", "Instead, the bankruptcy court endorsed the position of the Trustee, SIPC,  and SEC by analogizing Madoff net winners to the fake securities  claimants in New Times with their fictitious holdings, which led to NIM as  the appropriate method by which to calculate their net equity. The court  explained that the key precedent set by New Times regarding net equity  analysis is that customer recovery cannot be based on account  statements that contain numbers with no relation to reality, whether the  securities are identifiable by name (as in Madoff) or not (as in New  Times).court stated, would create \u201cthe absurdity of \u2018duped\u2019 investors reaping   Reliance on fraudulent promises in account statements, the  windfalls as a result of fraudulent promises.\u201d The court also noted that  the initial investments of real securities claimants in New Times were  sufficient to acquire their initial securities, and subsequent statements  listing earnings reflected actual market events. By contrast, initial  investments by Madoff investors were \u201cinsufficient to acquire their  purported securities positions, which were made possible only by virtue of  fictitious profits . . .  account activity was manipulated with the benefit  of deliberately calibrated hindsight.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Court of Appeals Affirmed the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s Decision", "paragraphs": ["\u201cMr. Picard\u2019s selection of the Net Investment Method was more consistent with the  statutory definition of \u2018net equity\u2019 than any other method advocated by the parties or  perceived by this Court.
