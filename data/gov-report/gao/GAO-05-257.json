Although DBS service has traditionally been a rural service, passage of the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act of 1999 enhanced the competitiveness of DBS service in suburban and urban markets. GAO agreed to examine (1) how DBS subscribership changed since 2001; (2) how DBS penetration rates differ across urban, suburban, and rural areas; (3) how DBS penetration rates differ across markets based on the degree and type of competition provided by cable operators; and (4) the factors that appear to influence DBS penetration rates across cable franchise areas. To complete this report, GAO prepared descriptive statistics and an econometric model using data from the Federal Communications Commission's annual Cable Price Survey and the Satellite Broadcasting and Communications Association's subscriber count database."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Since 2001, the number of households subscribing to DBS service has grown rapidly; thus the percentage of households subscribing to DBS service, the DBS penetration rate, has grown to over 17 percent of American households. The DBS penetration rate is highest in rural areas, but growing most rapidly in suburban and urban areas. Between 2001 and 2004, the DBS penetration rate grew 15 percent in rural areas to 29 percent of rural households, 32 percent in suburban areas to 18 percent of suburban households, and 50 percent in urban areas to 13 percent of urban households. The degree and type of competition influences the DBS penetration rate. In areas with no cable service, the DBS penetration rate is about 53 percentage points greater than in areas where cable service is available. Where cable service is available, cable operators increasingly offer advanced services. The DBS penetration rate is approximately 20 percentage points greater in areas where cable operators are not providing advanced services, compared with areas where these services are available. While relatively few areas have more than one wire-based cable operator, in these areas the DBS penetration rate is 8 percentage points lower than in areas with only one cable operator. In addition to the differences in DBS penetration rates across rural, suburban, and urban areas, and differences associated with the degree and type of cable competition, additional geographic and competitive factors also influence the DBS penetration rate. For example, the DBS penetration rate is lower in areas with a high prevalence of multiple-dwelling units, such as apartments. Additionally, the DBS penetration rate is higher in areas where DBS providers offer local broadcast stations (such as ABC and NBC affiliates) directly to their subscribers. The Federal Communications Commission provided technical comments on a draft of this report that we incorporated where appropriate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["For many years, cable television operators faced little competition in the  market for subscription video service. However, in 1994, a new type of  competitor emerged: direct broadcast satellite (DBS). Subscribers to DBS  service use small reception dishes to receive television programming  beamed down from satellites that orbit over the equator. DBS was  originally most popular in rural areas, where cable service was often  limited or did not exist. In recent years, DBS has also become popular in  suburban and urban markets. In particular, the competitiveness of DBS was  bolstered when the Congress enacted the Satellite Home Viewer  Improvement Act of 1999, which allows DBS carriers to provide local  broadcast signals, such as the affiliates of ABC and NBC, directly to  subscribers. Today, the two primary DBS providers\u2014DIRECTV\u00ae and  EchoStar\u2014provide local broadcast signals in 156 of 210 television markets.", "You asked us to provide information on the extent to which DBS is  competitive with cable under varied market circumstances.

For the first and second objectives,  we calculated the DBS penetration rate at the county level for the years  2001 to 2004. This allowed us to examine the trend in the DBS penetration  rate for that period of time. We also classified counties as urban, suburban,  and rural, based on the location of central cities and designations of  metropolitan statistical areas (MSA), and calculated the DBS penetration  rate for each of these geographic categories. For the third objective, we  used data from Knowledge Network\u2019s 2004 The Home Technology Monitor  survey to identify responding households that said cable service was not  available to them, and to then examine the penetration of DBS service  among these responding households, compared with those who said that  cable service was available in their area. We also calculated the DBS  penetration rate for cable franchise areas included in FCC\u2019s 2002 and 2004  Cable Price surveys. Using data from FCC\u2019s surveys, we classified each  cable franchise on the basis of (1) whether \u201cadvanced services\u201d\u2014such as  cable modem and digital cable tiers of programming\u2014were provided by  cable operator and (2) whether there was a second wire-based provider in  the market. We then calculated the DBS penetration rate for these different  categories of cable franchise areas. For the fourth objective, we used an  econometric model we previously developed that examines the  competitive interaction of cable and DBS providers. Using data from 2004,  the model considers the effect of various factors (such as the number of  channels provided by the cable company) on cable rates, the number of  cable subscribers, the number of channels that cable operators provide to  subscribers, and the DBS penetration rate in areas throughout the United  States. See appendix I for additional information on our scope and  methodology and appendix II for the steps we took to ensure the reliability  of the data we used to prepare this report.

At that time, cable operators simply  retransmitted the signals of local broadcast stations. By the late 1970s,  cable operators began to provide new cable networks, such as HBO,  Showtime, and ESPN, and the number of cable subscribers increased  rapidly. Two significant changes occurred in the 1990s and early 2000s.  First, the Congress passed the Cable Television Consumer Protection and  Competition Act of 1992 that, among other things, prohibited local  franchising authorities from awarding exclusive (or monopoly) franchises  to cable operators, thereby opening the door to wire-based competition.  Second, cable operators began offering new services, such as digital cable,  cable modem Internet access, and telephone, in addition to their basic  video service. Today, many cable operators offer these advanced services  in bundles with their basic video service.", "Since its introduction in 1994, direct broadcast satellite (DBS) service has  grown dramatically and is now the primary competitor to cable operators.  Subscribers to DBS service use a small reception dish to receive signals  beamed down from satellites. Because DBS satellites orbit above the  equator, a reception dish must point toward the southern sky, and  households located in the northern part of the United States need to angle  the dish more toward the horizon than households in the southern part of  the United States. Unlike cable, which upgraded to digital service in recent  years, DBS service has been a digital-based service since its inception. DBS  providers generally offer most of the same cable networks as cable  operators. However, for many years DBS providers did not offer local  broadcast stations to their subscribers in most instances because of  copyright obstacles, obstacles that cable operators did not face. After the  Congress passed the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act of 1999,  which altered the copyright rules that applied to DBS providers, cable and  DBS companies were placed on a more equal competitive footing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Subscription to DBS Has Grown Rapidly Since 2001", "paragraphs": ["From 2001 to 2004, the aggregate number of U.S. households that subscribe  to DBS television service grew rapidly.

In general, the farther north one is within the United States,  the more the dish must be angled toward the horizon to see the satellite  over the equator. We found that a 1 percent decrease in the angle at  which the DBS satellite dish must be set at is associated with a 1 percent  decrease in the DBS penetration rate. A possible explanation for this  result is that a satellite dish facing the horizon is less likely to have a  clear line of sight to the southern sky because of interference from  surrounding buildings or trees.", "The DBS penetration rate is generally higher in nonmetropolitan areas.  The DBS penetration rate is about 41 percent greater in cable franchise  areas outside metropolitan areas compared with cable franchise areas  within metropolitan areas.

With greater system capacity, a cable operator  can provide more channels and advanced services, such as digital cable,  cable modem, and telephone services. Thus, greater system capacity  allows the cable operator to provide a compelling alternative to DBS  service that can contribute to lower DBS penetration rates. This result is  consistent with the lower DBS penetration rate in areas where cable  operators provided advanced cable services for 2001 to 2004 that we  discussed above.", "The DBS penetration rate is lower in areas with wire-based cable  competition, compared with areas without wire-based competition.

The addition of a second cable  operator can attract some customers who might otherwise have  purchased DBS service, thereby reducing the DBS penetration rate.", "The DBS penetration rate is higher in areas where DBS customers can  receive local-into-local service. Local-into-local service allows DBS  subscribers to receive the local broadcast stations in their area (e.g., the  ABC, CBS, Fox, and NBC affiliates) from the DBS provider, just as cable  subscribers receive local broadcast stations from their cable operator.  Since individual programming appearing on broadcast stations generally  has higher ratings than individual programming appearing on cable  channels, the ability of DBS providers to offer local broadcast stations  to their customers remains an important competitive factor.

FCC\u2019s survey asked a sample of cable  franchises to provide information, as of January 1, 2004, about a variety  of items pertaining to cable prices, service offerings, subscribership,  franchise area reach, franchise ownership, and system capacity. We  used the survey to define measures of each franchise area\u2019s cable prices,  number of subscribers, and number of channels as described above.

Many of  the variables we used to estimate our model, such as each cable franchise\u2019s  price, come directly from FCC\u2019s Cable Price Survey. However, we also  created variables describing competitive, geographic, and economic  conditions in each franchise area. For these variables, we used information  from other sources. For example, we obtained median household income  and the extent of multiple dwelling units from Census Bureau data, and  derived the DBS penetration rate from information provided by the  Satellite Broadcasting and Communications Association. Generally, these  data are reported at other geographic levels, and we describe briefly the  process by which we merged these different data sources.", "Cable franchise areas take a variety of jurisdictional forms, such as city or  town, or unnamed, unincorporated area. As a consequence, they do not  correspond in many cases to well-recognized geographical units, such as  Census places, for which other data are readily available. Our approach to  identifying the geographic extent of each franchise area and relating  information processed at different geographic levels to each franchise area  is similar to that we have used and described in detail in our previous  reports. In general, we used information in FCC\u2019s survey identifying  franchise community name and type (such as city or town) to match to  Census geographic identification codes for particular places or county  subdivisions that do correspond to Census geography. In particular, we  used 2000 Census information on the number of housing units in these  jurisdictions as the basis for our measure of DBS penetration. For other  franchises, however, the link to Census records was not as direct. For  franchises in unincorporated unnamed areas, for example, and those  whose franchise areas represent a section of the associated community  (which occurs in some large cities), we acquired additional information on  the geographic boundaries of the franchise areas.", "The satellite subscriber information we obtained was organized by zip  code. In order to link these subscriber counts to franchise area  geographies, we determined the zip code or zip codes associated with each  franchise. Because zip codes often do not share boundaries with other  geographies, one zip code can be associated with more than one cable  franchise area. Also, many franchises, particularly larger ones, span many  zip codes. Therefore, we needed to identify the zip code or codes in each  franchise area as well as the degree to which each of those zip codes is  contained in each franchise area to calculate the degree of satellite  penetration for each franchise area. We accomplished this by using  software designed to relate various levels of census geography to one  another. For most franchise areas\u2014that is, those that correspond to  census places, county subdivisions, or entire counties\u2014we were able to  use this software to relate census places, county subdivisions, or other  census geographies directly to the zip codes that corresponded to those  areas and to calculate the share of each zip code\u2019s population according to  the 2000 Census that was contained in that area. We used these population  shares to allocate shares of each zip code\u2019s total DBS subscribers to the  relevant franchise area, and then summed the resulting subscribers across  all zip codes in that franchise area. We defined the penetration by dividing  this subscriber total by an estimate of the housing units in that franchise  area in January 2004.", "As part of the process of identifying the zip codes associated with each  franchise area, we identified a key zip code that we used for linking other  data items. We used Census data organized at the zip code level to assign  demographic data, such as income and the extent of multiple dwelling  units, to each franchise area. We also used this key zip code to attach  information concerning the proper satellite dish elevation.", "We assigned other information to each franchise on the basis of the  franchise\u2019s county, state, or metropolitan area. We assigned wage data from  BLS at the metropolitan or state level and we assigned nonmetropolitan  status, percentage of urban population, and the Nielsen television market  of each franchise at the county level.

The coefficients on the dummy variables are elasticities in  decimal form.", "We found that several factors related to the geographical conditions  influence the DBS penetration rate. Specifically, as shown in table 3, DBS  penetration rates are likely to be significantly higher in nonmetropolitan  areas. This could be associated with the historical development of satellite  service, which had been marketed for many years in smaller and more rural  areas. Additionally, the DBS penetration rate is higher in areas that require  a relatively higher angle or elevation at which the satellite dish is mounted  and is lower in areas where there are more multiple dwelling units. These  two factors can be associated with the need of DBS satellite dishes to \u201csee\u201d  the satellite: A dish aimed more toward the horizon (as opposed to aimed  higher in the sky) is more likely to be blocked by a building or foliage, and  people in multiple dwelling units often have fewer available locations to  mount a satellite dish.", "Additionally, we found that several factors related to competitive  conditions influence the DBS penetration rate. As shown in table 3, our  model results indicate that in cable franchise areas where local broadcast  stations are available from one or both DBS providers, the DBS penetration  rate is approximately 12 percent higher than in areas where local stations are not available via satellite. This finding suggests that in areas where  local stations are available from one or both DBS providers, consumers are  more likely to subscribe to DBS service and, therefore, DBS appears to be  more competitive with cable than in areas where local stations are not  available from a DBS provider.", "We did not find that DBS companies\u2019 provision of local broadcast stations  is associated with lower cable prices. In table 3, the estimate is, in fact,  positive, although not statistically significant, and we therefore cannot  reject the hypothesis that provision of local broadcast stations has no  impact on cable prices. However, we found that cable prices were  approximately 16 percent lower in areas where a second cable company\u2014 known as an overbuilder\u2014provides service. Finally, cable prices are higher  in areas where the cable company provides more channels, indicating that  consumers are generally willing to pay for additional channels and that  providing additional channels raises a cable company\u2019s costs. Additionally,  we found that DBS penetration rates are lower in cable franchise areas  where a second wire-based competitor is present; in these areas, the DBS  penetration rate is 37 percent lower compared with similar areas where a  second wire-based competitor is not present."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Alternative Specifications", "paragraphs": ["We considered alternative specifications under which we expanded the  definition of local broadcast stations to account for (1) whether one or  both DBS companies offer local stations and (2) the length of time that DBS  companies have provided local stations.
