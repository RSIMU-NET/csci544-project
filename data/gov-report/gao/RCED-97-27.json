The PHAs, through which HUD provides these subsidies and grants, house 3 million low-income people, many of whom are elderly or disabled. The Congress holds HUD responsible for ensuring that the authorities provide safe and decent housing, operate their developments efficiently, and protect the federal investment in their properties.", "The National Affordable Housing Act of 1990 required HUD to develop indicators to assess the management performance of PHAs. This law became the framework through which HUD developed one of its primary oversight tools for housing authorities, the Public Housing Management Assessment Program (PHMAP). Primarily, PHMAP establishes objective standards for HUD to evaluate and monitor the management operations of all PHAs to identify those that are troubled. According to HUD, PHMAP also allows the Department to identify ways to reward high-performing PHAs as well as improve the management practices of troubled PHAs. The program also allows PHAs\u2019 governing bodies, management officials, residents, and the local community to better understand and identify specific program areas needing improvement.", "To help improve public housing management, the National Affordable Housing Act of 1990, as amended (the act), required HUD to develop indicators to assess the performance of PHAs in all the major aspects of their management operations. The act required HUD to use certain indicators as well as provided discretion for the Secretary of HUD to develop up to five additional indicators that the Department deemed appropriate. HUD implemented PHMAP by using the 12 indicators listed in table 1.1, the first seven of which are those required by statute.", "Because some indicators are more important than others in measuring management performance, HUD assigns them added weight in determining the overall score. HUD considers the indicators for vacancies, rents uncollected, annual inspection and condition of units and systems, and resident initiatives most indicative of good property management and delivery of services to residents, so each one has a greater weight than other indicators.", "After reviewing existing procedures and extensively consulting with a group of PHAs, public housing industry groups, private management firms, resident groups, and HUD staff in field offices, HUD has significantly revised the PHMAP indicators. HUD\u2019s revisions to PHMAP, published December 30, 1996, eliminated three indicators; consolidated four other indicators into two; and added one new indicator, security. These revisions primarily address the performance indicators on which housing authorities report data, not HUD\u2019s use of PHMAP data."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Indicator Grades Determine the PHMAP Score, Performance Designation, Required Follow-Up, and Incentives", "paragraphs": ["Annually, PHAs receive a grade of \u201cA\u201d through \u201cF\u201d for each of the twelve indicators that apply to their operations. HUD uses a formula that reflects the weights assigned to each indicator, converts indicator grades into points, totals each PHA\u2019s points, and divides that total by the maximum total the PHA could have achieved to arrive at a percentage. That percentage, a number between 0 and 100, is the PHMAP score.", "HUD draws data on the performance of a housing authority from two sources to determine the authority\u2019s PHMAP score. First, the housing authority submits data to HUD for about half of the PHMAP indicators and certifies that this information is accurate and complete. HUD assigns grades to each of these indicators according to a comparison of the authority\u2019s data and HUD\u2019s criteria for grades \u201cA\u201d through \u201cF.\u201d The balance of the information HUD uses comes from its own information system for tracking expenditures from major grants. This system contains the financial and other types of data the field offices need to grade the remaining indicators for which the PHAs do not provide data. The field offices use this data and the PHA-certified data to determine indicator scores, the PHMAP score, and the PHA\u2019s performance designation.", "The PHMAP score is HUD\u2019s starting point for both the performance designation it assigns to a PHA and, depending on that designation, the extent of follow-up required of the PHA to correct deficiencies identified during the PHMAP assessment. Generally, HUD uses three designations to describe the performance of PHAs: troubled performers are those scoring less than 60 percent; standard performers are those scoring between 60 and less than high performers are those scoring 90 percent or more.", "HUD has the discretion to withhold the troubled designation or award the high performer designation if a PHA\u2019s score is within 10 points of the threshold for either designation and HUD determines that its score results from the physical condition and/or neighborhood environment of that authority\u2019s units rather than from the PHA\u2019s poor management practices.", "If a housing authority is designated as troubled, it faces several mandatory follow-up activities and/or corrective actions to improve performance and remove the troubled designation. Specifically, the act requires HUD to perform an independent management assessment of the troubled PHA\u2019s overall operations to identify the causes of the deficiencies that led to its poor PHMAP score. HUD uses private contractors to perform these independent assessments.", "HUD expects the independent assessments to form the basis for the second requirement for troubled PHAs\u2014the memorandum of agreement (MOA). A memorandum of agreement is a binding contract between HUD and a troubled PHA to identify solutions to its management problems and pursue those solutions in a way that is significant, expeditious, and lasting. Among other things, HUD requires that the MOA address the specific responsibilities of HUD and the PHA, the resources each will commit to resolving the authority\u2019s problems, the annual and quarterly performance targets for improving its performance on PHMAP indicators, and the incentives for it to meet its performance targets as well as sanctions for failing to do so. A PHA\u2019s initial MOA generally lasts 18 months so that it can complete a second-year agreement with HUD, if necessary, before the first expires.", "HUD\u2019s regulations for implementing PHMAP require standard- and high-performing PHAs to develop improvement plans for every PHMAP indicator on which the PHA received an \u201cF,\u201d unless the PHA can correct the deficiency within 90 days; HUD may also choose to require these plans for indicators receiving scores of \u201cD\u201d or \u201cE\u201d when failure to raise the grade might pose significant added risk. An improvement plan documents how and when the PHA plans to correct deficiencies. Although similar in content and scope to a memorandum of agreement, improvement plans differ in that (1) PHAs develop and submit them to HUD for approval rather than negotiate them with HUD officials and (2) they are not a binding contractual commitment between the PHA and HUD.", "When HUD first implemented PHMAP, it offered high-performers a variety of incentives, primarily regulatory relief from various reporting requirements. These incentives included less frequent reviews of changes to a PHA\u2019s operating budget and, for those performing well on the modernization indicator, no prior HUD review for architects\u2019 or engineers\u2019 contracts. In addition to regulatory relief, high-performing PHAs receive a HUD certificate of commendation and public recognition for their performance.", "In its fiscal year 1997 budget request, HUD proposed an additional PHMAP-based incentive for high-performing PHAs when it sought to create a $500 million capital bonus fund (as part of the $3.2 billion it sought for its public housing capital fund). To be eligible for a bonus, a PHA would have to be a PHMAP high performer and have undertaken substantive efforts to obtain education and job training for its residents. However, the Congress chose not to fund the bonus proposal for public housing or any of HUD\u2019s other major programs, in part because of concerns about HUD\u2019s ability to accurately and reliably track the performance of bonus recipients."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HUD\u2019s Field Offices Implement PHMAP", "paragraphs": ["With nearly 800 staff devoted to oversight of housing authorities and implementation of the full range of HUD\u2019s public housing programs, its field offices have the bulk of the Department\u2019s responsibility for the day-to-day implementation of PHMAP. Field offices\u2019 PHMAP responsibilities include determining the indicator grades and PHMAP scores, negotiating memorandums of agreement, approving PHAs\u2019 improvement plans, and monitoring their progress in meeting the goals the MOA or improvement plan set forth. To determine a housing authority\u2019s PHMAP score, a field office relies on that PHA to provide about half the data that leads to the overall PHMAP score and certify the data\u2019s accuracy. As a result, the overall PHMAP score and everything it influences\u2014from incentives for high performers to sanctions for troubled PHAs\u2014are very much a joint effort and a shared responsibility.", "A PHA may also request to exclude or modify the data HUD should consider in computing its PHMAP score. An exclusion means that the indicator (or one or more of its components) is entirely excluded from calculations to determine the PHMAP score. For example, PHAs with no ongoing modernization or development programs are automatically excluded from being assessed on those indicators. Modifying the data for an indicator allows HUD to consider unique or unusual circumstances by exempting some of the data HUD usually requires the PHA to consider. The PHA still receives a score for the indicator, but the score would not reflect the data associated with the PHA\u2019s unique or unusual circumstances. For example, a PHA operating under a court order not to collect tenants\u2019 rent at specific developments until it corrects deficiencies the court had identified can seek to exempt those units in its developments from being considered in its indicator score for rents uncollected. A PHA always has the right to appeal a field office\u2019s decision about modifications, exclusions, indicator scores, or the performance designation. However, after those appeals have been exhausted, the field office certifies the PHA\u2019s PHMAP score, assigns a final performance designation, and proceeds with any required improvement plans, MOAs, or other necessary follow-up.", "When a troubled authority\u2019s new PHMAP score is high enough to cause HUD to remove its troubled designation, HUD\u2019s policy is to require the field office to verify the accuracy and completeness of the new data submitted by the housing authority. HUD also requires the field office to conduct a confirmatory review to verify the data the PHA had certified as well as the accuracy of the data HUD had obtained from its own information system. HUD\u2019s guidance for implementing PHMAP stipulates that a confirmatory review must take place on-site at the PHA and cannot be accomplished through remote monitoring.", "HUD\u2019s field offices may choose to conduct some confirmatory reviews of standard- and high-performing PHAs\u2019 PHMAP certifications. HUD expects its field offices to choose these PHAs according to the risk they pose and focus on those with the highest potential for fraud, waste, mismanagement, or poor performance. Some of the factors HUD field offices may consider in analyzing the risk associated with a PHA\u2019s PHMAP certification include size (number of units), borderline troubled designation (5 percent above or below the percentage for the designation), and negative trends in overall or individual indicator scores over several years.", "In May 1995, HUD expanded the scope of the annual independent audit each PHA receives in order to improve the Department\u2019s ability to determine whether PHA-certified data are accurate. The annual audit, conducted pursuant to the requirements of the Single Audit Act, examines the housing authority\u2019s financial statements, internal controls, and compliance with HUD\u2019s rules and regulations. Housing authorities are responsible for selecting their own auditors and submitting the results of the audits to their HUD field office. Field offices are responsible for reviewing the audits to ensure they meet all of HUD\u2019s requirements and, when they have approved the audit, reimbursing housing authorities for them. In fiscal year 1995, these independent audits cost HUD about $8 million for all housing authorities.", "HUD now requires the independent auditors to determine whether a housing authority has adequate documentation for the data it submits to HUD for its PHMAP certification. According to HUD officials, because the Department\u2019s resources are too limited to conduct annual confirmatory reviews of most housing authorities, they expected to use the results of these audits to better focus HUD\u2019s attention, oversight, and technical assistance. In addition to paying for the audits, HUD expects its field offices to use the results as part of a risk assessment to determine which housing authorities should get the most sustained attention and technical assistance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["Stressing the need for HUD to hold housing authorities accountable while making better use of the data that PHMAP produces, the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity, House Committee on Banking and Financial Services, asked GAO to review HUD\u2019s use and implementation of PHMAP. As agreed with the Chairman\u2019s office, we reviewed whether HUD\u2019s field offices are using PHMAP and complying with the program\u2019s statutory and regulatory requirements to monitor and provide technical assistance to housing authorities, whether PHMAP scores have increased and how HUD uses the program to inform HUD\u2019s Secretary and the Congress about the performance of housing authorities, and whether PHMAP scores are consistently accurate and can be considered a generally accepted measure of good property management.", "We developed information from several different sources to address questions concerning the usefulness of PHMAP to HUD and other uses for which PHMAP may not be appropriate. To determine PHMAP\u2019s usefulness to HUD, we interviewed officials and collected information on technical assistance activities at both the Department\u2019s headquarters and field offices. At HUD\u2019s headquarters, we analyzed a variety of documents pertaining to PHMAP and discussed the program\u2019s use as a basis for technical assistance with the Offices of the Deputy Assistant Secretaries under HUD\u2019s Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing.", "At HUD\u2019s field offices, our approach was twofold. First, we surveyed them via fax questionnaire to obtain data on the use of PHMAP, such as the number of confirmatory reviews each field office performs and how useful such program tools as improvement plans have been. This data reflect responses from all of HUD\u2019s public housing field offices. Second, we visited five HUD field offices to review their use of PHMAP in more depth and to supplement the information we had gathered in our survey. We judgmentally selected the five field offices because of their geographic distribution, variations in the number of HUD staff in each office as well as the number of PHAs each oversees, and variations in average PHMAP scores for the PHAs reporting to those offices.", "To provide information on PHAs\u2019 PHMAP scores, we relied on existing data from HUD sources, including HUD\u2019s primary public housing database, the System for Management Information Retrieval-Public Housing (SMIRPH). From this database, we extracted the module containing housing authorities\u2019 PHMAP data, including the PHMAP scores and individual indicator grades. Our analysis covers federal fiscal years 1992 through 1995 because the first fiscal year in which the rules governing PHMAP took effect was 1992 and the most recent year for which all PHMAP scores were complete at the time of our review was 1995.", "We did not systematically verify the accuracy of HUD\u2019s data or conduct a reliability assessment of HUD\u2019s database. In performing our analysis we found erroneous and incomplete information for a few PHAs, ranging from 1 to 3 percent of the total. We confirmed this with HUD officials, who attributed the errors to mistakes in data input or the field office\u2019s having entered incomplete scores. However, because we used these data in context with additional evidence we obtained directly from HUD\u2019s field offices and we did not focus on the scores of specific PHAs or small groups of PHAs, we believe our conclusions about overall trends in scores are valid.", "Throughout the course of our work, because the number of PHAs reporting PHMAP scores is too great for us to visit a representative sample, we consulted with several prominent groups representing the public housing industry to discuss HUD\u2019s uses for PHMAP as well as their perspectives on the program\u2019s ability to measure the performance of public housing authorities. These groups include the Council of Large Public Housing Authorities, the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials, and the Public Housing Authorities Directors Association.", "We provided a draft of this report to HUD for review and comment.

However, beyond identifying troubled authorities and what they need, the amounts and kinds of technical assistance HUD provides varies because its field offices interpret their responsibilities differently\u2014some choose to be actively involved while others adopt a hands-off approach. Furthermore, HUD\u2019s 1995 reorganization of its field offices adversely affected some offices\u2019 ability to provide technical assistance while others adapted to changed expectations and resumed providing as much assistance as they did before the reorganization."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "HUD Uses PHMAP to Identify Troubled Housing Authorities, but Technical Assistance Varies", "paragraphs": ["As part of HUD\u2019s oversight of public housing, the PHMAP score is an important tool for identifying troubled authorities so HUD can focus technical assistance and monitoring on them. The most common types of technical assistance that HUD\u2019s 49 public housing field offices provided all PHAs were telephone consultations, training, and participation in conferences. However, we found differences in how field offices defined their roles in providing PHAs technical assistance as well as some innovations in how others provided that assistance. For example, some field offices have encouraged high-performing PHAs to provide \u201cpeer assistance\u201d to lower performers. Many of the differences in assistance were due to variations in field offices\u2019 interpretations of their roles and the impact of HUD\u2019s 1995 reorganization of its field offices. HUD headquarters officials believe that more training for all field staff and leadership from field office managers would help achieve more quality and consistency among field offices in providing technical assistance."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "HUD Uses PHMAP to Target PHAs for Technical Assistance", "paragraphs": ["Officials in 40 of HUD\u2019s 49 field offices rated PHMAP as being of \u201cutmost\u201d or \u201cmajor\u201d importance in identifying which housing authorities need the most technical assistance. According to field office staff, PHMAP provides standard indicators to objectively measure an authority\u2019s performance. In addition, some staff said that because PHAs have a strong aversion to failing performance scores and try to avoid failure, they are confident that when PHAs report information that results in low scores or failing grades, the data and the resulting scores are accurate. Because an accumulation of low or failing scores results in a PHA\u2019s being designated troubled, HUD staff are confident that those PHAs PHMAP identifies as the worst-performing housing authorities are accurately designated as troubled performers.", "Some field office staff also use declining PHMAP scores to provide an early warning of management problems and to identify which PHAs could need additional technical assistance. In addition, the staff use PHMAP\u2019s 12 individual indicator grades to better focus their limited technical assistance resources and thereby maximize the benefits PHAs receive from HUD\u2019s assistance. For example, one field office developed a package of technical assistance for the \u201cresident initiatives\u201d indicator because many PHAs failed this indicator. The package of assistance included sample policies and procedures for operating resident programs. Another field office developed assistance specifically for small housing authorities because many of them were having trouble renting their units when they became vacant (thus failing PHMAP\u2019s unit turnaround indicator). Among other things, that field office provided its small PHAs an extensive list of suggestions on how and where to better market their units.", "Most technical assistance from HUD\u2019s field offices consisted of telephone consultations, training sessions, and industry conferences. HUD also provided assistance\u2014although limited because of time constraints\u2014at the time of a PHMAP confirmatory review. During telephone consultations, several offices we visited answered questions from housing authority staff and helped the executive directors of new housing authorities better understand public housing regulations and operations. Training sessions covered these and other topics and provided more details than telephone discussions. In addition, to increase the amount of personal contact they have with housing authority staff and to provide technical assistance, field office staff said they regularly participate in conferences hosted by public housing industry associations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Field Offices\u2019 Interpretations of Their Role and Their Recent Reorganization Influence the Level and Types of Technical Assistance", "paragraphs": ["Field offices\u2019 interpretations of their obligation to improve the performance of housing authorities influences the type of technical assistance they provide. For example, officials in one field office did not believe that it was HUD\u2019s role to manage PHAs\u2019 operations. Instead, they believed that the role of their field office should be limited to providing information on compliance with federal rules and regulations and to suggesting solutions to management problems. This field office avoids showing PHAs how to manage their developments because the staff believe that they do not have sufficient expertise and that the housing authorities would view this advice as intrusive.", "In contrast, staff at other field offices that we visited believed they are obligated to tell PHAs what must be done to correct management deficiencies because HUD is responsible for ensuring that PHAs use federal funds efficiently and effectively to provide safe, decent housing. For example, staff from one field office spent several days at a troubled authority to help it set up proper tenant rent records and waiting lists.", "In addition to differences in how they view their role to directly assist PHAs, we found differences in the extent to which field offices use outside resources to help their housing authorities. Some field offices told us that to compensate for a shortage of resources from HUD, they help PHAs in their jurisdiction by encouraging technical assistance from other PHAs rather than providing it themselves. For example, some of the field offices arranged for high-performing PHAs to provide peer assistance to authorities with management problems. One field office persuaded staff from a high-performing PHA to temporarily manage a small authority that unexpectedly lost its executive director. Another field office recruited a high-performing PHA to help another one develop a system for inspecting its housing units.", "In 1995, HUD reorganized the field offices and changed the responsibilities of the staff who oversee and assist PHAs. Before the reorganization, most field office staff were generalists and broadly understood federal housing regulations and PHA operations. After the reorganization, however, the responsibilities of individual field office staff became more specialized to focus on the rules and regulations of specific public housing operations.This specialization confused some staff in field offices and housing authorities as well as impaired the ability of some field offices to provide technical assistance. For example, field office staff we visited said that some specialists do not have the skills needed to do their jobs because many of them did not have the work experience or requisite training for the specialists\u2019 positions; the staff also noted that HUD had not provided sufficient training for the staff to understand the reorganization and their new responsibilities. The staff also said that the reorganization was a source of confusion for PHAs. Before the reorganization, a housing authority could call one employee at HUD\u2019s field office to answer all its questions; afterward, a housing authority generally needed to call several different staff at HUD\u2019s field office to answer questions.", "Adjusting to the reorganization differed across field offices. At one field office, staff resisted the reorganization because they did not want to become specialists and they recognized that technical assistance to the PHAs suffered as a result. For example, the staff now disagree over who is responsible for overseeing certain PHA operations. They also have resisted working together to provide technical assistance and have not been sharing PHMAP information to develop the best plan for correcting management deficiencies. Other field offices we visited adapted to the reorganization. Staff in these field offices worked cooperatively to build on the skills of the experienced staff. For example, one field office continues to assign each housing authority to only one staff member who provides or coordinates all technical assistance to that authority. The responsible staff member, however, belongs to a team of staff from all operational areas who work together to solve each PHA\u2019s problems.", "Officials at HUD headquarters, including the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public and Assisted Housing Operations, acknowledged that some field offices had difficulty adjusting to the reorganization. They stated that although adequate training was crucial to the reorganization\u2019s success, some field offices either did not seek it or did not take the need for it seriously, despite the availability of training funds for field staff. HUD officials continue to emphasize the importance and availability of training and expect field office management to assess the staff\u2019s skills and expertise and request the appropriate training. These officials believe that because of limited staff resources, now and in the future, the reorganization is the best way for field offices to provide effective oversight and technical assistance to PHAs. Furthermore, they believe that managers of the field offices must take a more active leadership role in directing their staff to work together."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "HUD\u2019s Infrequent Use of Some Oversight Tools May Not Adequately Improve the Performance of PHAs or Target Technical Assistance", "paragraphs": ["The act and HUD\u2019s requirements for how field offices use PHMAP provide for several tools to guide improvements in a housing authority\u2019s performance and thereby raise its indicator grades and PHMAP score.

While such tools as MOAs and improvement plans generally apply to PHAs designated as troubled or failing specific indicators, a confirmatory review is mandatory for any PHA coming off HUD\u2019s troubled list and an independent audit is mandatory for all PHAs. Nonetheless, we found that the compliance of field offices with statutory requirements and HUD\u2019s guidance for using these tools has been inadequate and infrequent.", "Furthermore, HUD has not determined whether these statutory or agency requirements are effective, adequately improve housing authority performance, or help the field offices better target limited technical assistance resources.

Yet, most field office staff we visited made fewer personal visits to housing authorities than they felt were necessary because of limited staff resources and travel funds. Field office staff told us, for example, that their workload has increased because their offices have been unable to replace staff who have left the agency. With less time available for on-site visits, direct monitoring of the PHAs\u2019 performance has occurred less frequently.

HUD officials acknowledged that the infrequency of confirmatory reviews by its field offices hampers the program\u2019s credibility and integrity. Because it has done so few confirmatory reviews, HUD cannot say that most scores are accurate, nor can it say that most troubled PHAs that raised their scores above 60 really are no longer troubled. The HUD Inspector General (IG) recently noted that without more confirmatory reviews, the self-reporting nature of PHMAP creates a temptation for PHAs to manipulate data to raise their scores. In fiscal year 1995, 24 of the 49 field offices had housing authorities with PHMAP scores high enough to remove them from HUD\u2019s troubled list, but only 11 of the 24 field offices performed all or some of the required confirmatory reviews. The remaining 13 offices performed none of the required confirmatory reviews. Nonetheless, some of these same 13 field offices performed discretionary confirmatory reviews of other housing authorities that had not been classified as troubled. In one case, a field office had just one housing authority whose new PHMAP score was high enough to remove its troubled designation. Although the field office did not perform a confirmatory review for that authority until the next fiscal year, it did complete nine confirmatory reviews of standard- or high-performing housing authorities. HUD headquarters officials told us that although they encourage the field offices to do as many additional, discretionary confirmatory reviews as possible, they expect field offices to complete the mandatory reviews first. They also told us that limited resources kept them from monitoring the performance of field offices on these reviews.", "In addition to the field offices\u2019 lack of compliance with HUD\u2019s requirement for performing confirmatory reviews, few offices are performing discretionary confirmatory reviews.

HUD agreed that there is a perception that PHMAP is an all-encompassing system to assess the performance of PHAs and stated it is taking steps to address this misperception. Seeking to clarify the program\u2019s purpose, HUD added language to its recently revised interim PHMAP rule (published in the December 30, 1996, Federal Register), that the program\u2019s indicators reflect performance in only specific areas.", "HUD correctly states that this report does not provide a historical perspective of PHMAP by discussing previous HUD systems for assessing and identifying troubled housing authorities. We believe that such information would not contribute substantially to our report\u2019s three objectives to evaluate HUD\u2019s use of the current program, provide trends in PHMAP scores from fiscal years 1992 through 1995, and discuss limitations in the program\u2019s design and implementation that affect its usefulness for purposes other than identifying troubled housing authorities and targeting assistance to them. Therefore, we have not added the historical information HUD suggested to the report.", "Finally, HUD is concerned that we have incorrectly reached conclusions about the reliability of all PHMAP scores based on the results of confirmatory reviews of high-risk authorities. HUD noted that the accuracy of the scores of these PHAs does not necessarily represent the accuracy of all PHMAP scores because the data provided by these PHAs are most susceptible to being inaccurate. Our report did not reach a conclusion about the reliability of all housing authorities\u2019 scores because of the changes that resulted from confirmatory reviews. This report discusses the reliability of PHMAP scores for housing authorities whose scores are low enough that they may be at risk of being designated troubled. We have added language to the report to clarify this point."], "subsections": []}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
