The Bottom-Up Review determined that the Air Force would have 20 fighter wings (13 active and 7 reserve), up to 187 bombers(161 active and 26 reserve), and 500 intercontinental ballistic missiles to implement the strategy. The Bottom-Up Review also concluded the Air Force should maintain the capability to provide (1) airlift to transport people and equipment during conflicts, (2) reconnaissance and command and control aircraft to provide information on the location and disposition of enemy forces, and (3) aerial refuelers to enhance mission effectiveness by refueling aircraft during long-range missions. The review did not specify the number of military personnel required to implement the national military strategy. However, DOD subsequently determined that the active components would consist of about 1.4 million active military personnel, 381,000 of which would be Air Force personnel.

Air Force mission forces consist of the fighter wings, bombers, and intercontinental missiles (as defined in the Bottom-Up Review) and the forces that provide direct combat support; intelligence; space support; and command, control and communications in wartime. Activities that provide support to the mission forces and primarily operate from fixed locations are classified as infrastructure forces. Infrastructure is divided into the following eight categories: acquisition management, force management, installation support, central communications, central logistics, central medical, central personnel, and central training. These categories are described in appendix I. Approximately 140,000, or 36 percent, of the active Air Force personnel are currently categorized as mission forces and 241,000, or 64 percent, are in infrastructure activities.", "The Secretary of Defense wants to reduce and streamline infrastructure to achieve savings to modernize the force. In April 1996, we reported that operations and maintenance and the military personnel appropriations must be reduced if spending for infrastructure activities is to decline, since they account for 80 percent of infrastructure funding. In fiscal year 1996, the Air Force spent about $28 billion of its $73 billion total budget on infrastructure activities. As shown in figure 1.1, about 83 percent of the Air Force\u2019s direct infrastructure costs are funded by two appropriations\u2014military personnel and operations and maintenance.", "One of the Air Force\u2019s major initiatives to generate savings for weapons modernization is to study the potential to contract out infrastructure functions. In deciding whether a function can be transferred to contractors, the Air Force compares the relative cost of using civilian employees and private contractors to perform the same function. DOD data on cost comparisons completed between fiscal year 1978 and 1994 indicates that shifting work to contractors has reduced annual operating cost on average by 31 percent.

The various methods include Air Force staffing standards for positions common throughout the Air Force such as security police; command staffing standards for functions unique to a particular command such as pilot training; a computer-generated model for aircraft maintenance positions; and crew ratios for each type of aircraft in the inventory. The Air Force does not have total control over the allocation of its personnel. For example, legislation and DOD directives establish ceilings on headquarters positions and mandate the number of positions that the Air Force must fill on the joint staff, and in unified commands and defense agencies.

Also, the Goldwater-Nichols Defense Reorganization Act of 1986 gave the Secretary of Defense the authority to determine the number of joint officer positions. An April 1981 memorandum from the Deputy Secretary of Defense states that DOD cannot increase or decrease resources that support the National Foreign Intelligence Program without approval from the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.

The FYDP displays the allocation of resources by programs and activities known as program elements. We used the mapping scheme developed by DOD\u2019s Office of Program Analysis and Evaluation to identify mission and infrastructure program elements. We then compared the changes in active personnel by mission and infrastructure categories between fiscal year 1986 and 1997. We used fiscal year 1986 as a starting point because it represented the peak in the number of active duty personnel, preceding the post-Cold War drawdown.

In addition, some of the decrease resulted when the strategic airlift function was moved to the central logistics infrastructure category.", "The number of military personnel in command, control, and communications positions was reduced by abolishing the Air Force Communications Command. In addition, the increase in technologies such as automation and digital communications allowed the Air Force to assign fewer people to operate and maintain needed capability.", "The decrease in research, development, test, and evaluation primarily resulted from a change in the way these personnel are categorized. Prior to 1988, about 5,600 positions in acquisition and command support were included in the mission forces under the research, development, test, and evaluation activity. However, in 1988 the majority of these positions were moved to the acquisition infrastructure category when the Air Force merged two commands to form the Air Force Materiel Command.", "The remaining two mission categories, intelligence and space, gained personnel. While there were decreases in some intelligence functions such as the retirement of the SR-71, they were offset by increases resulting from the creation of the Defense Airborne Reconnaissance Office in 1994.

Significant decreases occurred in all infrastructure forces except acquisition, central medical, and central logistics as shown in table 2.3.", "The greatest number of personnel decreases occurred in installation support and central training activities. The decline in installation support was caused primarily by the closure of 20 active air bases by the Secretary of Defense\u2019s Base Closure Commission in 1988 and the Base Closure and Realignment Commission in 1991 and 1993. The Air Force also contracted some base operations, which reduced the number of military personnel in installation support.", "The decrease in central training was related primarily to the decreases in mission force structure. For example, the decrease in the number of wings and bombers resulted in about a 6,700 decline in the number of undergraduate pilot and navigator training positions and about an 8,500 decrease in weapons systems training positions. Likewise, the decrease in the number of strategic forces reduced training requirements by about 2,400 positions. The overall decrease in the number of active personnel caused a decline of approximately 11,300 positions in general skill level training and about 4,900 positions in recruit training units. Approximately another 4,000 positions were eliminated from contracting for base operations at training bases.", "The primary reasons for the decreases in the other categories are described as follows: \u2022 Acquisition management\u2014This category experienced a net decrease of 627 military positions. However, in 1988 the Air Force transferred about 5,600 positions from the mission research, development, test, and evaluation category into acquisition. Since 1988, the number of military personnel in the acquisition has declined by about 5,800. \u2022 Force management\u2014The decreases occurred in the weather service, servicewide support, and from consolidation of various headquarters. For example, the Strategic Air Command, the Tactical Air Command, and the Military Airlift Command were combined to form the Air Combat Command and the Air Mobility Command; the Air Force Systems Command and the Air Force Logistics Command were combined to form the Air Force Materiel Command. \u2022 Central communications\u2014Approximately 3,900 of the decrease occurred because the smaller number of fighter wings and bombers required fewer air traffic control personnel. \u2022 Central medical\u2014The number of personnel in central medical has not decreased significantly. OSD and the services are currently assessing post-Cold War medical requirements. OSD is currently updating a 1994 study that will provide new estimates of wartime medical demands. However, the scheduled March 1996 completion has been delayed because OSD and the services advocate using different assumptions and methodologies for factors such as population-at-risk and casualty replacements, which affect overall medical requirements. \u2022 Central personnel\u2014The decrease resulted primarily because the smaller force has reduced the number of permanent change-of-station moves, accessions, and training requirements, which has reduced the number of people in transit.", "Central logistics is the only infrastructure category that had a net increase of personnel. The increase resulted from a change in the way personnel associated with strategic airlift are categorized. Prior to 1992, airlift personnel were counted as direct support mission forces.

Generally, there has been one officer for every 10 enlisted positions in this category. However, our analysis of this category showed that between fiscal year 1986 and 1997, the Air Force eliminated 46,349 enlisted and 3,256 officer positions or 15 enlisted positions for every officer position eliminated.", "Another reason for the smaller percentage decrease is that medical and joint/DOD positions, which have a high number of officers, are classified as infrastructure.

A crew ratio is the number of aircrews authorized per aircraft and is established to enable the Air Force to meet expected wartime sortie rates. For example, the current crew ratio for the F-15C is 1.25, which means that 1.25 pilots are authorized for each F-15C in the active inventory. Air Force officials noted that the actual sortie rates during the Gulf War were higher than could have been flown under the Air Force\u2019s funded crew ratios and that additional pilots from units that had not deployed were therefore used. On the basis of this experience, the Air Force has increased the crew ratio for some aircraft, increased aircraft spares, and plans to use additional pilots from the schools to achieve higher sortie rates. Air Force officials noted that it is not economically feasible to increase the crew ratios beyond current levels because they would have to buy additional aircraft and spares in order to keep all crews properly trained.", "Personnel requirements for strategic and sustainment forces are determined at base level for 36 functional areas such as security police, transportation, and munitions.

In addition, a preliminary air staff review of its infrastructure force has identified a potential to reduce the active force by as much as 75,000 beyond fiscal year 1998 by contracting out some functions now performed by military personnel and converting some military positions to civilian. Our prior work indicates that savings can occur by contracting out functions in lieu of using military personnel, and significant opportunities exist to convert military positions to less costly civilian positions.", "Some opportunities may also exist to reduce mission forces. Our prior work has shown the Air Force could reduce active personnel requirements by increasing the size of its fighter squadrons and transferring some bombers to the reserves.

Air Force officials stated the planned personnel reductions will not lessen the Air Force\u2019s war-fighting capability, since they are primarily in infrastructure-related functions. Our analysis of the planned decrease shows that 1,125, or 12 percent, are in mission forces and 8,415, or 88 percent, are in infrastructure forces as shown in table 4.1.", "The planned decrease in mission forces results primarily from three initiatives. First, the final drawdown of intercontinental ballistic missiles under the first Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty will reduce mission forces by 1,014 personnel. Second, the Air Force plans to retire the EF-111 electronic support aircraft in fiscal year 1998, which would reduce active military personnel by 525. However, the Air Force is concerned the Navy may not assume the electronics warfare mission within the planned time frame, which could delay these planned reductions. Finally, the Air Force plans to retire 8 C-130 aircraft, which will eliminate 360 positions. This reduction is based on a Joint Staff study that showed the Air Force has excess intra-theater airlift capacity.", "The decreases in mission forces are largely offset by increases related to funding six additional B-1B bombers for training and combat operations from the reconstitution reserve, activating an unmanned aerial vehicle squadron, and adding one Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (E-8) and one Rivet Joint (RC-135). Air Force officials noted the additional Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System and Rivet Joint aircraft will help alleviate the high personnel tempo in these units.", "The planned infrastructure decreases are based primarily on the Air Force\u2019s plans to either have civilian employees or contractors perform installation support and communication functions now performed by about 2,500 military personnel. The Air Force determined that these positions do not require military personnel because they do not deploy and are needed to support overseas rotation. Therefore, it plans to study the cost-effectiveness of contracting out the function or using civilian employees.", "The planned decrease in installation support also includes 360 positions providing base operating support at Howard Air Force Base in Panama. The Air Force assumes that all military personnel will withdraw from Panama after the United States turns control of the Panama Canal over to Panama in 1999.

The Air Force has programmed a 4.5-percent reduction (1,748 personnel) through fiscal year 2003. According to Air Force officials, it will take up to 12 years to eliminate the remaining positions to minimize personnel turbulence and impact on peacetime patient care. An Air Force official stated that even though the OSD study on post-Cold War medical requirements has not been completed, officials in the Office of the Air Force Surgeon General believe the study will recommend that the services reduce the number of medical personnel. Thus, these officials believe it is prudent to start reducing the number of medical personnel now. The need for such reductions must be certified by the Secretary of Defense under 10 U.S.C. 129c.", "The decrease in central personnel represents a decline in the number of personnel in transit. An Air Force official stated that the smaller force has reduced the number of permanent change-of-station moves, accessions, and training requirements, which reduces the number of people in transit.", "The changes in force management are caused primarily by decreases in the number of positions in the Air Weather Service, support to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service, and headquarters activities.", "Finally, the decrease in acquisition and the increase in central logistics are due to the transfer of base operations functions at test centers from the acquisition category to central logistics. Congress has directed DOD to prepare a plan to reduce the number of military and civilian personnel involved in acquisition by 25 percent over a period of 5 years beginning in fiscal year 1996.

Three ongoing Air Force studies have identified the potential for eliminating a significant number of active duty personnel. Two studies involve the potential to contract out commercial activity functions now being performed by military and civilian personnel and another involves the potential for converting military positions in inherently governmental functions to civilian positions. The Air Force\u2019s ability to reduce the number of military positions identified in the ongoing studies could be constrained by DOD goals for reducing civilian positions.", "DOD Directive 1100.4 requires the services to staff positions civilian personnel unless the services deem that positions must be filled by military personnel for one or more of the following reasons, including combat readiness, legal requirements, rotation, security, training, and discipline.

The Air Force study is scheduled to be completed by the end of April 1997.", "The functional areas under review consist of all military positions in commercial activities within the Air Force\u2019s major commands in the continental United States and some overseas locations. The Air Force has about 160,400 military positions in commercial activities. The Air Force has deemed that 82,700 of these positions must be filled by military personnel because they would deploy during wartime; about another 25,100 of these positions are in military-unique functions such as headquarters activities, recruiting, basic military training, and those personnel needed to maintain an overseas rotation base. Once these positions were eliminated from consideration, the Air Force was left with about 52,600 military in commercial activities that could be studied for possible conversion, as shown in table 4.2.", "To further assess the potential to contract out or use civilian employees for these positions, the Air Staff has provided each major command with the number of positions within their respective commands that are candidates for conversion. Each command is currently identifying the positions by base and organization to determine how many functions could be studied further to determine the relative cost savings associated with replacing military personnel with either contractors or civilian employees. The major commands are also required to identify barriers to contracting and recommend ways to overcome them. For example, current Air Force procedure exempts such units from being studied as candidates for conversion, if some personnel in the unit are expected to deploy. Air Staff officials noted the major commands may be able to identify ways around this problem in some cases, such as reorganizing units or transferring functions between bases.", "In a November 1996 letter to the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Air Force stated that DOD\u2019s existing civilian workyear policy needs to be modified so the Air Force can achieve savings by replacing military personnel assigned to positions that are not military essential with civilians. The letter noted that the Air Force\u2019s experience has shown that 40 percent of the cost comparison studies performed since 1979 determined that an in-house civilian workforce was more cost-effective than contractors. When a function that was predominantly performed by military personnel remains in-house, the Air Force may have to increase the number of civilian employees, which runs counter to DOD\u2019s efforts to reduce its civilian workforce. For example, the maintenance training function at Altus Air Force Base was performed by 1,444 personnel, of whom 1,401 were military and 43 were civilian employees. The cost comparison showed that an in-house civilian workforce would be more cost-effective than using the private sector. Thus, the Air Force had to increase the number of civilian employees by 692 in order to achieve the projected savings. The Secretary of the Air Force stated that the goals for civilian downsizing pose a disincentive for accomplishing work in the least costly manner and that some consideration should be given to relaxing civilian downsizing goals in such cases.", "The Air Force is also conducting a study to determine if there are opportunities to consolidate its 126 precision measurement electronic laboratories and have the work performed by civilian employees or contractors. There are about 1,200 military personnel in 50 labs in the active force, and the remaining labs are operated by contractors or are in the guard and reserve forces. These personnel are not included in the universe of military positions in commercial activities that could potentially be performed by civilian employees or contractors. According to an Air Force official, the preliminary study results indicate that the Air Force could consolidate from 126 to around 50 labs.

These officials stated that some of the major commands believe that many of the positions should remain military. For example, the Air Force Materiel Command believes all the acquisition positions should remain military because military personnel assigned to these positions bring operational and flightline experience, which is invaluable to developing new systems. However, we believe there is a good basis for studying the potential to replace some military personnel assigned to acquisition functions with civilian employees.

In October 1994, we reported that similar opportunities exist for converting enlisted support positions to civilian employees. Both of our reports noted that a number of impediments exist to military to civilian conversions. For example, guidance provides commanders with wide latitude in justifying the use of military personnel, and local commanders are perceived to prefer military rather than civilian employees in certain positions. Nonetheless, we noted these barriers can be overcome with active participation of senior managers. DOD concurred with our reports and agreed to convene a panel of senior managers within OSD, the joint staff, and the military services to examine the issue of military to civilian conversions.

Air Force officials maintain that more squadrons are needed to provide the Air Force flexibility to respond to numerous potential conflicts across the globe. Although the Air Force considers smaller fighter squadrons beneficial, it had not performed any analysis to justify its decision. We developed several options for consolidating the fighter force that would permit the Air Force to maintain the same number of aircraft but carry out its missions with fewer active duty personnel.

Moreover, in our September 1996 report on DOD\u2019s bomber force, we reported one option for restructuring the bomber force would be to place more B-1Bs in the Air National Guard. This option would reduce the cost to maintain DOD\u2019s bomber force while maintaining DOD\u2019s force of 95 B-1Bs. In 1993, DOD reported to Congress that placing B-1Bs in the Air National Guard would result in no loss of war-fighting capability.", "A major benefit of transferring bombers to the reserve component is that reserve units have traditionally been less expensive to operate than their active duty counterparts. These savings are attributed to two factors. First, DOD expects that an Air National Guard squadron will require fewer flying hours than an active squadron because Air National Guard units are able to recruit more experienced pilots who require less frequent training to maintain their proficiency. Personnel costs are the second major factor that account for the Air National Guard\u2019s lower cost.

The Commission on Roles and Missions recommended that DOD conduct a DOD-wide cost-effectiveness study to determine the appropriate number and mix of deep attack capabilities currently fielded and under development by all the services. The first part of the study, which was to be completed in late 1996, was expected to analyze weapons mix requirements for DOD\u2019s planned force structure in 1998, 2006, and 2014 and determine the impact of force structure changes on the weapon systems mix. As of February 1997, OSD was reviewing the results of this first phase and had not made the results public.
