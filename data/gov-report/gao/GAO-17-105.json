The ways in which VA manages its human resources, including the use of official time, have received increased scrutiny in recent years.

VA's new system (VA Time and Attendance System, or VATAS), which VA began rolling out at some facilities in 2013, has specific codes to record official time, but the older system does not. The inconsistent recording of official time raises questions about VA's ability to monitor its use, but VATAS could help to standardize this process. In rolling out the new system, which VA expects to complete agency-wide in 2018, VA has provided inconsistent training and guidance on how to use the codes in VATAS. While VA has taken steps to provide better training and guidance on recording official time, GAO recently found that timekeepers at two of three selected facilities where VATAS has been rolled out were still not using the codes. Without consistent guidance and training, personnel may not know how to properly record official time in the new system.", "Calculating official time \u2014VA provides its facilities with a range of options for calculating the amount of official time used. VA annually collects and compiles these data agency-wide using the Labor-Management Relations (LMR) Official Time Tracking System\u2014separate and distinct from VA's time and attendance systems. In calculating official time, facilities may use records, estimates, or other methods, which results in inconsistent data. VA officials told GAO that all facilities will eventually be able to rely on VATAS time and attendance records to calculate official time when submitting data in the LMR system. The full implementation of VATAS will provide VA with an alternative to using the LMR system to collect and compile more reliable official time data. Without reliable data, VA cannot monitor the use of official time agency-wide or share reliable data with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), which reports on the government-wide use of official time.", "At all five selected VA facilities, designated space for representational activities comprised less than 1 percent of the overall square footage at each location, according to GAO's analysis. VA does not collect or track data from individual facilities on the amount of space designated for representational activities. Union officials at three of the five facilities GAO visited said that limited space for representational activities made it difficult to provide privacy for employees. A VA official said that certain VA facilities may have space constraints depending on where they are located and the number of veterans served, for example.", "At most selected VA facilities, VA managers and union officials GAO interviewed cited similar benefits of employees using official time, such as improving decision-making and resolving problems.

Official time for other purposes allowed under the  Statute must be negotiated between the agency and the union in an  agreed-upon amount deemed reasonable, necessary, and in the public  interest. Accordingly, collective bargaining agreements often include  provisions concerning the conditions for granting official time. Agencies  and unions can negotiate at the department, component, operating  administration, or facility level, for example, and there can be variation in  how official time is managed within an agency.

VA began implementing  its new time and attendance system, the Veterans Affairs Time and  Attendance System (VATAS), at some facilities in 2013 to replace its  older system, the Enhanced Time and Attendance (ETA) System. VA  expects to complete its rollout of VATAS in July 2018. According to a VA  official, approximately 50 percent of VA facilities and about one-third of  VA employees (120,000) had transitioned to using VATAS as of  September 2016. For the five selected facilities we visited, three had  transitioned to VATAS and two were still using ETA at the time of our  visits. VATAS provides specific codes for timekeepers to record the  various uses of official time for union representational activities, but  according to VA officials, ETA lacks such codes. Under ETA, VA  officials explained that timekeepers can record the amount of official time  used by employees for representational activities in the remarks section  of employees\u2019 time and attendance records, which according to VA  officials, does not always make clear the purpose for which official time is  being used.

The lack of consistent training on how to record  official time in VATAS is due in part to the fact that VATAS is being  implemented in phases and training is being updated throughout the  course of implementation. For example, a VA official told us that  information on how to record official time was incorporated into the  VATAS training curriculum in June 2016. However, VATAS  implementation began in 2013, and employees trained on VATAS prior to  June 2016 may not have been instructed on how to record official time in  the system. For instance, timekeepers and other officials from the three  selected facilities that had implemented VATAS prior to June 2016 said  that recording official time was not covered during their VATAS training  and these facilities were not using the codes in VATAS to record official  time because they were not aware of them. As a result, these facilities  continued to use different approaches to record official time and  documented different information. According to federal internal control  standards, management should internally communicate quality  information that enables personnel to perform key roles, and it should  provide appropriate training to personnel so they may carry out their  responsibilities. Without effectively providing guidance on how to record  official time in VATAS, personnel responsible for recording and  overseeing its use may not know how to perform certain duties, and VA is  missing an opportunity to more accurately track the amount of official time  used by employees across the agency to better monitor its use and  manage its resources effectively.", "VA took several steps in 2016 to provide better guidance to facilities on  how to record official time in VATAS, including: updating VATAS training curriculum for timekeepers and supervisors  to include face-to-face training on official time at facilities where  VATAS is being implemented; making information on how to record official time available on the VA discussing how to record official time during a monthly \u201cVATAS  Connections\u201d call with payroll offices.", "Despite VA\u2019s recent efforts, however, as of October 2016 two of the three  selected facilities using VATAS at the time of our visits were still not using  the different official time codes in VATAS for recording official time.

VA\u2019s Office of LMR uses its LMR Official Time Tracking  System to obtain information from individual facilities on the amount of  official time used by employees. The LMR system is separate and  distinct from VA\u2019s time and attendance systems and provides the Office of  LMR with a centralized way of collecting official time data from individual  facilities.

Federal  internal control standards prescribe that management design control  activities so that events are completely and accurately recorded and that  it communicate reliable information to external entities, such as OPM, to  help the agency achieve its objectives. VA allows facilities to use written  records, estimates, samples, or surveys of official time hours used, or any  combination of these methods to determine the amount of official time  used by employees at their facility. Figure 2 shows the various  information fields included in the LMR system for fiscal year 2015,  including the different calculation methods VA allows facilities to use to  determine the amount of official time used by employees.", "Fiscal year 2015 data collected through the LMR system show that  employees spent approximately 1,057,000 hours on official time for union  representational activities, and according to VA officials, unions  represented almost 290,000 bargaining unit employees across the  agency during this time. In addition, the data show that 346 employees  spent 100 percent of their time on official time. However, as previously  discussed, this data is inconsistent and not reliable. Of the 332 official  time submissions from facilities in fiscal year 2015, 104 entries indicate  that the facility used only records such as time and attendance records, 5  entries indicate the facility used only a survey of supervisors of union  representatives, 123 entries indicate the facility used an estimate only,  and 99 indicate that the facility used a combination of these methods to  determine the amount of official time used. For one entry, it was not clear  which method was used. These different methods of calculating official  time result in inconsistent information on the number of official time hours  used by employees for union representational activities. Figure 3  illustrates the range of information selected facilities submitted to the  Office of LMR on the use of official time. In calculating the amount of  official time used, VA strongly encourages facilities to provide comments  describing how they arrived at their numbers when submitting their data  on official time; however, our review of selected facilities\u2019 fiscal year 2015  official time submissions found that none of the facilities provided such  comments. Without reliable information from facilities on official time, VA  management does not have what it needs to monitor the use of official  time and manage its resources effectively.", "According to VA officials from the Office of LMR, once VATAS is fully  implemented, there will be no need for individual facilities to use different  methods to calculate the amount of official time used because facilities  will be able to rely on information in VATAS when submitting data in the  LMR system. A VA official also told us that after VATAS is fully  implemented, they plan to issue a policy on the change to calculating  official time. Until VATAS is fully implemented, however, the various  calculation methods used by facilities will continue to produce  inconsistent data on the amount of official time used agency-wide.  Furthermore, once fully implemented agency-wide, VATAS could provide  VA with an alternative to collecting data from individual facilities through  its LMR system on the amount of official time used by employees. An  official from VA\u2019s FSC stated that FSC currently has the capability to  generate reports in VATAS on the amount of official time used at  individual facilities. The official added that once all facilities are using  VATAS, FSC could generate one report with official time data, thereby  eliminating the need for individual facilities to submit official time data  through the LMR system. However, an official from VA\u2019s Office of LMR  was not aware of FSC\u2019s ability to produce such reports and said that the  Office of LMR currently plans to continue using the LMR system to obtain  information from facilities on the amount of official time used. According to  federal internal control standards, management should use reliable data  for effective monitoring.

In addition, union officials from three of five groups we  interviewed said that more official time is needed, and union officials from  four groups said they used varying amounts of personal time to conduct  union representational activities."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The use of official time is viewed by VA managers and union officials we  interviewed as beneficial, but it should be monitored effectively to ensure  that public resources are spent appropriately. Reliable data on official  time are important for effectively overseeing its use, understanding the  extent to which it is used across VA, and assisting OPM with the  government-wide tracking of the amount of official time used. Our findings  raise questions about whether VA is doing all it can to ensure it obtains  accurate information on the use of official time in order to effectively  oversee its use and share with external entities. The agency-wide  implementation of VATAS is an important step toward that goal. Prior to  the agency-wide implementation of VATAS, however, VA is not doing all it  can to encourage facilities to standardize the way in which they determine  the amount of official time used. Taking the intermediary step to  standardize methods for determining the amount of official time used at  the facility level will not solve all of the data reliability issues surrounding  VA\u2019s tracking of official time, but it is a step toward collecting more  reliable data. In addition, VA has not provided consistent training to  facilities on how to record official time in VATAS, and some facilities are  still not aware of VA\u2019s updated guidance on how to record official time in  the system, despite recent efforts. Furthermore, given the potential  capabilities of VATAS, there may be better ways for VA to collect  information on official time in the future and it may not be necessary for  VA to continue using the LMR system to track official time. Until all  personnel responsible for recording official time in VATAS are aware of  and familiar with VA\u2019s guidance, and VA is able to determine a way to  obtain more consistent data from facilities, VA will not have an accurate  picture of how much time employees use for union representational  activities and cannot know how best to manage tracking its use."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve VA\u2019s ability to accurately track employees\u2019 use of official time,  we recommend that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs direct the Assistant  Secretary for Human Resources and Administration to:  1.  increase efforts to ensure timekeepers at all facilities receive training  and consistent guidance on recording official time in VATAS;  2.  standardize the methods used by facilities for determining the amount  of official time used prior to the agency-wide implementation of  VATAS by encouraging facilities to rely on time and attendance  records when calculating the amount of official time used at the facility  level; and  3.  in preparation for the full implementation of VATAS, take steps to  transition from using the LMR system to VATAS to collect and compile  information on the amount of official time used agency-wide."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Department of Veterans Affairs  (VA) and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) for review and  comment.

With regard to our first recommendation, VA stated  that the Office of Labor Management Relations (LMR) has revised its  policy to include specific directions to human resource offices to begin  recording official time in the VA Time and Attendance System (VATAS)  once VATAS has been implemented at their respective facilities. With  regard to our second recommendation, VA stated that the Office of  Human Resources and Administration plans to develop a memo directing  facilities to rely on time and attendance records when calculating the  amount of official time used at the facility level. With regard to our third  recommendation, VA stated that the Office of LMR will transition from  using the LMR Official Time Tracking System to collect and compile data  on official time and will coordinate with the Financial Services Center to  use VATAS to create a report on the agency-wide use of official time.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.
