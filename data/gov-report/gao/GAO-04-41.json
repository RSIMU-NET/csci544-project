Reducing tobacco-related deaths and the incidence of disease, along with the associated costs, represents a significant public health challenge for the federal government. Most adults who use tobacco started using it between the ages of 10 and 18. According to a Surgeon General's report, if children and adolescents can be prevented from using tobacco products before they become adults, they are likely to remain tobacco-free for the rest of their lives. GAO was asked to provide information on federal efforts to prevent and reduce youth smoking.

Two federal programs within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) focus only on tobacco use. CDC's National Tobacco Control Program (NTCP) focuses on preventing and reducing tobacco use among the general population and explicitly targets youth. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's program to oversee implementation of a provision of federal law, commonly referred as the Synar Amendment, focuses only on tobacco use among youth. The Synar Amendment requires states to enact and enforce laws prohibiting the sale of tobacco products to minors. In addition to these tobacco-focused programs, HHS, and the Departments of Defense (DOD), Justice (DOJ), and Education sponsor programs that include tobacco use as part of broader efforts to address unhealthy behaviors among youth, such as substance abuse and violence. For example, Education's Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities program is designed to prevent substance abuse and violence. HHS agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health, conduct research on tobacco use and nicotine addiction among youth and its health effects on youth. HHS agencies and other federal departments also support activities to prevent and reduce tobacco use among youth, such as education and outreach efforts. HHS and its component agencies coordinate tobacco-related efforts with other federal, state, and local government agencies and nongovernmental entities. Federal departments and agencies collect a variety of information to monitor how programs that aim to address tobacco use among youth are being implemented by grantees and the effectiveness of grantee efforts in meeting program goals. The information is collected through various means, including grant applications, progress reports, periodic site visits, and program evaluations. For example, to monitor NTCP, CDC requires states to submit biannual reports on the implementation of state NTCP-supported tobacco control programs. The information that federal departments and agencies collect on these programs is also used to provide training and technical assistance to grantees on topics such as conducting program evaluation. In commenting on a draft of this report, HHS stated that the report was very informative but it did not include programs like Medicaid that are a substantial element of HHS tobacco prevention efforts. Including programs that finance health insurance such as Medicaid, however, was beyond the scope of our review. Also, HHS noted that we did not include information about the challenges other federal agencies face in coordinating tobaccorelated issues but DOD, DOJ, and Education did not describe such challenges. DOD and DOJ had no comments on the report and HHS and Education provided technical comments that we incorporated as appropriate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States.

In addition, we interviewed program officials in  multiple federal agencies. As a result, we focused on four federal  departments that support programs and other efforts to prevent and  reduce tobacco use among youth: the Department of Health and Human  Services (HHS) and its component agencies\u2014CDC, Substance Abuse and  Mental Health and Services Administration (SAMHSA), National Institutes  of Health (NIH), and Health Resources and Services Administration  (HRSA); the Department of Defense (DOD); the Department of Justice  (DOJ); and the Department of Education (Education). Where available, we  also obtained fiscal year 2002 funding information on the federal programs  and research that we identified. To identify how federal departments and  agencies monitor their programs, we reviewed agency strategic plans,  annual performance plans and reports, program guidance documents, and  program evaluations. To determine how federal departments and agencies  coordinate their efforts, we reviewed their strategic plans and annual  performance plans and reports and also descriptions of coordination  efforts. In addition, we interviewed agency officials about their program  monitoring and coordination efforts and asked them to describe any  coordination challenges they faced.

HHS is responsible for  informing the public of the dangers of tobacco use and coordinating  federal efforts to address tobacco use issues. Within HHS, CDC\u2019s Office on  Smoking and Health has been delegated the lead for all policy and  programmatic issues related to the prevention and reduction of tobacco  use and has primary responsibility within the federal government for  tobacco use prevention efforts. Also within HHS, the Surgeon General  serves as the nation\u2019s spokesperson on matters of public health and  reports on issues such as the health effects of tobacco use. Other HHS  agencies, such as SAMHSA, NIH, and HRSA, support efforts to prevent and  reduce tobacco use. Education, DOD, and DOJ also support programs and  activities that aim to address tobacco use among youth.", "Several studies have highlighted the importance of addressing tobacco use  among youth. In 1994, the Surgeon General released a report that focused  on the use of tobacco among youth. The report highlighted several factors  that increase the likelihood that youth will begin using tobacco. These  factors include engaging in other unhealthy behaviors, like substance  abuse and violence; peer pressure to smoke; and cigarette advertising and  promotion. In addition, the Surgeon General, CDC, NIH, and the Institute  of Medicine have reported on approaches that can help prevent youth  from starting to use tobacco and help existing users quit. For instance,  they have reported on the demonstrated benefits of interventions such as  implementing counter-marketing campaigns, using school-based  educational programs in combination with providing youth with  alternatives to the illicit use of tobacco, deglamorizing tobacco use, and  restricting minors\u2019 access to tobacco. According to the Surgeon General\u2019s  1994 report, strategies for preventing and reducing tobacco use among  youth should be multifaceted and involve collaborations among those that  can influence the behavior and attitudes of youth, such as family members  and educators.", "HHS led federal, state, and local agencies and nongovernmental  organizations in developing a 10-year national plan, the Healthy People  2010 initiative, that includes goals for addressing tobacco use. The Healthy  People 2010 initiative has identified tobacco use as one of 10 leading  health indicators for the nation.

NTCP provides funds through cooperative agreements to all  states. In fiscal year 2002, NTCP provided about $58 million to states to  address NTCP\u2019s four goals. NTCP\u2019s four goals are to (1) prevent youth  from starting to smoke, (2) help youth and adults quit smoking, (3)  minimize the public\u2019s exposure to secondhand smoke, and (4) identify and  mitigate the factors that make some populations more likely to use  tobacco than others. NTCP cooperative agreements specify the terms  under which federal funds are provided to the states.", "Under NTCP, CDC encourages states to use multiple types of interventions  in their efforts to prevent and reduce tobacco use. CDC has developed  guidance intended to assist states in designing, implementing, and  evaluating their individual tobacco control programs. For instance, CDC  recommends that states establish comprehensive tobacco control  programs that include certain components, such as    community-based programs to reduce tobacco use that include a wide  range of prevention activities, such as engaging youth in developing and  implementing tobacco control interventions, conducting educational  programs for young people, parents, school personnel, and others, and  restricting access to tobacco products;    school programs to implement school health policies that consist of  tobacco-free policies, evidence-based curricula, teacher training, parental  involvement, cessation services, and links between school and other  community efforts and state media and educational campaigns;    marketing campaigns to counter protobacco influences and increase  prohealth messages and influences, including paid television, radio,  billboard, and print media campaigns;    cessation services to help people quit smoking;    enforcement of tobacco control policies by restricting minors\u2019 access to  tobacco and restricting smoking in public places; and    statewide efforts to provide localities with technical assistance on how to  evaluate tobacco programs, promote media advocacy, implement smoke- free policies, and reduce minors\u2019 access to tobacco.", "CDC officials told us that CDC also provides training and technical  assistance to states in designing, implementing, and evaluating their  tobacco control programs. For example, in fiscal year 2000, CDC  conducted three regional workshops for state health departments and  education agencies aimed at helping such agencies develop coordinated  plans to prevent youth from starting to use tobacco. According to CDC,  representatives from 33 states participated in these workshops.", "The second federal program that focuses only on tobacco and aims to  prevent tobacco use among youth is SAMHSA\u2019s program to oversee state  implementation of legislation commonly referred to as the Synar  Amendment. This program is the only one we identified that focuses solely  on tobacco use among youth. The Synar Amendment and its implementing  regulation require states to enact and enforce laws that prohibit the sale of  tobacco products to minors, conduct random inspections of tobacco retail  or distribution outlets and estimate the percentage of retailers that illegally  sell tobacco to minors, and report the results of their efforts to the  Secretary of HHS. States are also required to report enforcement actions  taken against those who violate state laws in order to receive certain  federal grants. By the end of fiscal year 2003, states may have no more  than 20 percent of retail tobacco outlets in violation of state laws that  prohibit the sale of tobacco products to minors. To oversee states\u2019 efforts  to accomplish this, SAMHSA and the states negotiated interim annual  target rates that states should meet. States may use a portion of their  Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment block grant to help fund the  design and implementation of their inspection programs. For fiscal year  2002, the states reported that they planned to expend more than $5.4  million in block grant funds on Synar-related activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Federal Programs Address Tobacco Use Along with Other Unhealthy Behaviors", "paragraphs": ["Other federal programs aim to address tobacco use among youth as part of  a broader focus on unhealthy behaviors. For example, CDC\u2019s Coordinated  School Health program provides grants to states to implement school  health programs to prevent a range of unhealthy behaviors or conditions,  such as drug, alcohol, and tobacco use; physical inactivity; poor nutrition,  and obesity. In fiscal year 2002, CDC awarded grants to 22 states, with  each state receiving approximately $400,000. CDC helps state education  and health departments identify and implement health education curricula  to provide youth with information and the decision-making,  communication, and peer-resistance skills needed to avoid unhealthy  behaviors. In addition, CDC provides guidance to state and local health  education agencies on tobacco prevention programs in schools that covers  policies, programs, and a tobacco-free environment. CDC periodically  surveys the states, school districts, and schools on the health curricula  they offer and on school health policies relating to tobacco prevention and  reduction efforts. According to CDC, the information obtained through  these survey efforts is used to assess trends in school health education  programs.", "Education\u2019s Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities program aims  to prevent violence and drug, alcohol, and tobacco use in the nation\u2019s  schools. Under this program in fiscal year 2002, Education awarded more  than $472 million in grants to state education departments and governors\u2019  offices. Similarly, the Safe Schools/Healthy Students program, which is  funded by Education, HHS, and DOJ, provides local education agencies  with grants that support a variety of services designed to promote healthy  childhood development and prevent substance abuse (which can include  the use of tobacco) and violence. These services target preschoolers,  school-aged children, and adolescents. The Safe Schools/Healthy Students  program\u2019s activities totaled about $172 million for fiscal year 2002.", "DOJ and DOD support drug prevention programs that also aim to prevent  tobacco use among youth. For example, the Drug-Free Communities  Support program, which is administered by ONDCP and DOJ, is designed  to support the efforts of community coalitions that aim to prevent and  reduce young people\u2019s use of drugs, alcohol, and tobacco. These coalitions  consist of youth, parents, health care professionals, educators, law  enforcement officials, and other community partners. In fiscal year 2002,  DOJ awarded about $46 million to community coalitions located in 50  states. Approximately $7 million was given in new awards to 70  community coalitions, and $39 million was given in renewed funding to  462 existing community coalitions. Another program, the Drug Education  for Youth program (DEFY), which is sponsored by DOD and DOJ, targets  youth aged 9 to 12 to improve awareness of the harmful effects of alcohol  and other drugs, including tobacco. According to agency officials, the  program aims to promote positive self-images and lifestyles. In fiscal year  2002, DOD funding totaled over $1 million for 55 local DEFY programs.

Similarly, NIH\u2019s National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) supports  research on effective tobacco use prevention and reduction interventions  for youth. For example, NIDA established and funds a teen tobacco  addiction treatment research center to examine methods of eliminating  dependence on nicotine and assess the effectiveness of these strategies.  The center is assessing the safe use and effectiveness of nicotine patches  and gum for adolescents. According to NIDA, in fiscal year 2002, funding  for its research projects that focused on substance abuse, including  tobacco use among youth, totaled about $124 million.", "In fiscal year 1999, NCI and NIDA jointly established seven  Transdisciplinary Tobacco Use Research Centers (TTURCs) at academic  institutions in an effort to identify effective ways to prevent and reduce  tobacco use. According to HHS officials, additional information on ways  to reduce tobacco use among youth is needed because of the limited  knowledge available about cessation interventions that work best for  young people. The 5-year TTURCs research effort is designed to study new  ways of preventing tobacco use and nicotine addiction. According to HHS  officials, in fiscal year 2002, NCI and NIDA provided over $15 million to  TTURCs, which included funding for research on youth and adolescent  tobacco use and nicotine addiction at four of the seven centers. These four  centers are conducting studies on adolescent smoking. According to NCI,  one study found that students with high academic performance, perceived  academic competence, and involvement in school-related clubs and sports  teams were less likely to smoke.", "CDC also supports research on health promotion and disease prevention  including research on tobacco use among youth, through its network of 28  research centers that are affiliated with schools of public health, medicine,  or osteopathy located throughout the country. According to CDC officials,  these research centers focus on identifying effective prevention strategies  that can be applied at the community level. One center is examining  factors that can influence youth and young adults to start using tobacco  and two other centers are conducting research that examines youth  cessation programs, according to CDC. HRSA is working with certain  federally supported community health centers on a multiyear initiative to  address health disparities among youth.

For example, officials from HHS, Education,  and other federal departments, along with experts from national  organizations and professional associations, developed guidance to help  schools identify and implement strategies for preventing tobacco use  among youth. For example, the guidelines recommend that schools  develop and enforce a school policy on tobacco use, provide tobacco-use  prevention education from kindergarten through 12th grade, provide  instructions about the short- and long-term consequences of tobacco use,  and provide training for teachers. Similarly, in 1997, SAMHSA issued  guidance that describes strategies that communities can use to prevent  and reduce tobacco use among youth.", "In other activities, HHS agencies develop and promote educational  materials to prevent and reduce a range of unhealthy behaviors among  adolescents, including tobacco use. For example, Girl Power!, a national  public education campaign, is designed to prevent 9- to 13-year-old girls  from using tobacco, alcohol, and illegal drugs and includes a Web site that  offers articles, games, and quizzes that teach girls about the dangers of  tobacco use. Similarly, CDC\u2019s Tobacco Information and Prevention Source  Web site offers a variety of educational materials for youth, such as tips on  how to quit using tobacco and information on the health consequences of  using tobacco. CDC also disseminates information for parents, such as a  kit that offers advice on ways to increase parental involvement in their  children\u2019s lives and incorporate tobacco prevention messages into daily  activities. In addition, DOD sponsors Web sites that include information on  preventing and reducing tobacco use among youth and supports various  youth activities that address unhealthy behaviors, including tobacco use.  For example, one project identified was Smart Moves, which aims to  prevent tobacco, alcohol, and drug use by bolstering youths\u2019 self-esteem  and their resistance to unhealthy behaviors.", "HHS agencies also support activities that use various media, such as print,  radio, television, and videotapes, to counteract the impact of tobacco  product marketing. For example, CDC supports a variety of entertainment- related outreach activities that enlist celebrities as spokespersons to  deliver antismoking messages and to increase prohealth messages in  entertainment programming. CDC also supports the Media Campaign  Resource Center, a clearinghouse offering antitobacco media products  developed for television, radio, print, and outdoor advertising.

For example, both the Healthy People 2010  Adolescent Health Work Group, cochaired by CDC and HRSA, and the  related National Initiative to Improve Adolescent Health by 2010 aim to  foster greater involvement by various professions to improve the overall  health of adolescents, in part by reducing their use of tobacco. According  to HRSA officials, members of the national initiative are trying to educate  health care and other professionals on the importance of screening for  tobacco use and other unhealthy behaviors during routine health care  visits, providing counseling on the benefits of quitting tobacco use, and  providing referrals for youth, their parents, and other family members to  tobacco cessation services. As part of the national initiative, CDC, HRSA,  and the American Academy of Pediatrics are collaborating on the  development of a prevention guide to help pediatricians address unhealthy  behaviors among youth, including tobacco use."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HHS Established the Interagency Committee on Smoking and Health to Coordinate Federal Efforts", "paragraphs": ["In 1984, the Congress passed legislation requiring, among other things, that  HHS establish an interagency committee to coordinate the department\u2019s  research, educational programs, and other smoking and health efforts with  similar efforts of other federal departments and nonfederal organizations.  As a result, in 1985, HHS established the Interagency Committee on  Smoking and Health. According to CDC officials, the committee brings  together representatives of federal agencies and nonfederal organizations  involved in tobacco use issues and serves as a forum for committee  members and the public to share information and discuss a variety of  tobacco-related issues and efforts.

Through interagency agreements, Education handles  grants management activities, HHS provides technical advice and financial  assistance, and DOJ oversees program evaluation efforts. Similarly, for the  Drug-Free Communities Support program, ONDCP directs the program  and through an interagency agreement transfers funds to DOJ to cover  grant awards, grants management, and evaluation activities. Both ONDCP  and DOJ provide technical assistance to program grantees.", "HHS agencies also coordinate on efforts to jointly support research on  tobacco use prevention and cessation. For example, in addition to the NCI-  and NIDA-supported TTURCs initiative, NCI led the creation of an NIH- wide Tobacco and Nicotine Research Interest Group in January 2003.  According to NCI officials, the group was established to leverage expertise  and resources across NIH for tobacco research. In addition to NCI,  representatives from other NIH institutes, such as NICHD, NIDA, NHLBI,  and the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR)  have participated in the group. Representatives from CDC are also  participating in the group\u2019s meetings.", "Furthermore, HHS agencies, Education, ONDCP, and nonfederal  organizations collaborate on education and outreach activities aimed at  discouraging youth from starting to use tobacco and encouraging existing  users to quit. For example, CDC and Education collaborated on the  development and dissemination of a guide for parents on how to address  their children\u2019s health needs, including preventing and reducing tobacco  use.

They pointed out that, although multiple HHS  agencies have programs and other efforts to address the prevention and  reduction of tobacco use, the missions and funding priorities of the  agencies differ. For example, CDC officials told us that they had initiated  discussions in fiscal year 2003 with HRSA to collaborate on offering  tobacco prevention and cessation services to underserved populations  that obtain health care through HRSA\u2019s network of community health  centers. However, this effort has been delayed largely due to HRSA\u2019s  competing funding priorities and limited resources. In another instance,  NCI officials noted that NIDA and NIDCR decided to fund a proposal to  translate research findings on alcohol, tobacco, and other drug prevention  and treatment research to clinical dental practice settings.
