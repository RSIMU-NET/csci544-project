The Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act of 2003 (Check 21) was intended to make check collection more efficient and less costly by facilitating wider use of electronic check processing. It authorized a new legal instrument--the substitute check--a paper copy of an image of the front and back of the original check. Check 21 facilitated electronic check processing by allowing banks to use electronic imaging technology for collection and create substitute checks from those images for delivery to banks that do not accept checks electronically. Check 21 mandated that GAO evaluate the implementation and administration of the act. The report objectives are to (1) determine the gains in economic efficiency from check truncation and evaluate the benefits and costs to the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve) and financial institutions; (2) assess consumer acceptance of the check truncation process resulting from Check 21; and (3) evaluate the benefits and costs to bank consumers from check truncation. GAO analyzed costs for the check operations of the Federal Reserve and a group of banks, interviewed consumers about their acceptance of and costs and benefits of electronic check processing, and analyzed survey data on bank fees. The Federal Reserve agreed with the overall findings of the report."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Check truncation has not yet resulted in overall gains in economic efficiency for the Federal Reserve or for a sample of banks while Federal Reserve and bank officials expect efficiencies in the future. GAO's analysis of the Federal Reserve's cost accounting data suggests that its costs for check clearing may have increased since Check 21, which may reflect that the Federal Reserve must still process paper checks while it invests in equipment and software for electronic processing and incurs costs associated with closing a number of check offices. However, GAO found that the Federal Reserve's work hours and transportation costs associated with check services declined from the fourth quarter of 2001 through the fourth quarter of 2007. Several of the 10 largest U.S. banks reported to GAO that maintenance of both paper and image-based check processing systems prevented them from achieving overall lower costs, although they had reduced transportation and labor costs since Check 21 was enacted. Check imaging and the use of substitute checks appear to have had a neutral or minimal effect on bank fraud losses. Most bank consumers seem to have accepted changes to their checking accounts from check truncation. In interviews with bank consumers, the majority of them accepted not receiving their canceled checks and being able to access information about their checking account activity online. Several reported that they did not need the \"extra paper\" from canceled checks and that image statements and online reviewing was more secure than receiving canceled checks. Eleven percent of the 108 consumers still preferred to receive canceled checks. Most consumers reported that they were not significantly concerned about their ability to demonstrate proof of payment using a substitute check or check image rather than a canceled check and few reported that they suffered errors from the check truncation process. Also, GAO found that the federal banking regulators reported few consumer complaints relating to Check 21. To the extent that banks have employed check truncation, bank consumers have realized benefits and costs relating to faster processing and access to account information. GAO found that some banks have extended the hours for accepting deposits for credit on the same business day, which can result in faster availability of deposited funds for consumers. Based on consumer interviews, consumers have benefited from receiving simpler imaged account statements and immediate access to information about check payments. Check 21's expedited recredit (prompt investigation of claims that substitute checks were improperly charged to accounts and recrediting of the amount in question) also is considered a consumer benefit. However, based on our consumer and bank interviews, it appears that a small number of consumers have filed expedited recredit claims. Based on analysis of survey data on bank fees, GAO found some consumers may incur fees related to receiving canceled checks and images. Since 2004, fees for canceled checks appear to have increased, while fees for images appear to have remained relatively flat."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In the last 10 years technological innovations and consumer and business  preferences for electronic payments have transformed the U.S. retail  payments system from a largely paper-based system to one that mostly  uses electronic transactions. In 2007, the Federal Reserve System (Federal  Reserve) reported that electronic payments, including credit and debit  cards, exceeded two-thirds of all noncash payments while the number of  checks written declined from more than 37 billion checks in 2003 to 33  billion checks in 2006. Although check volume has declined, paper checks  still represent a significant number of payments that need to be processed,  cleared, and settled. The paper-based collection system for checks has  been a labor-intensive process because at each step in the collection  process, the paper check has had to be physically handled and transported  before being settled.", "The Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (Check 21), enacted in 2003,  was intended to make the check payment system more efficient and less  costly by facilitating wider use of electronic check processing without  demanding that any bank change its current check collection practices. At  the time that Check 21 was enacted, most banks could not leverage their  investments in imaging technology to collect checks electronically  because the legal framework for the check collection system constrained  the efforts of many banks to use it. Prior to Check 21, a bank was required  to present an original paper check to the bank where the check was  payable\u2014the paying bank\u2014for payment unless the paying bank had  agreed to accept presentment in some other form. This required the bank  presenting the check\u2014the collecting bank\u2014to enter into agreements with  all or nearly all of the banks to which it presented checks. Because of this  impediment, banks were deterred from making the necessary investments  to collect checks electronically.", "Check 21 addressed this situation by authorizing a new paper negotiable  instrument, called a substitute check, that when properly prepared is the  legal equivalent of the original check. Any bank that transfers, presents, or  returns a substitute check warrants that the substitute check contains an  accurate image of the front and the back of the original check at the time  the original check was truncated and a specific legend stating that the  substitute check is a legal copy of the original check and can be used in  the same way one would use the original check. Check 21 does not require  the banks to adopt electronic check processing, but enables banks that  want to truncate or remove the original paper checks from the check- collection system to do so. Check 21 facilitated electronic processing by  allowing banks to use electronic imaging technology for collection and  create substitute checks from those images for delivery to banks that do  not accept checks electronically. Substitute checks are considered an  intermediate step toward a matured electronic check processing system,  in which the goal should be the electronic exchange of payment  information and check images between banks.", "Check 21 mandated that we evaluate the implementation and  administration of Check 21. To respond to the Check 21 mandate, the  objectives of this report are to (1) determine the gains in economic  efficiency from check truncation and evaluate the benefits and costs to  banks and the Federal Reserve from check truncation; (2) assess  consumer acceptance of the check truncation process resulting from  Check 21; and (3) evaluate the benefits and costs to consumers from  check truncation under Check 21.", "To determine the gains in economic efficiency from check truncation and  evaluate the benefits and costs to financial institutions from check  truncation, we separately analyzed costs for the check operations of the  Federal Reserve and a group of banks. Using data from the Federal  Reserve\u2019s cost accounting system, we applied an econometric cost model  to estimate the effects of different variables, such as the volume of checks  processed, wages, and other costs incurred by the Federal Reserve, on  total check processing costs from 1994 through 2007. While the Federal  Reserve has consistent cost accounting data, the banking industry does  not. Accounting for costs associated with check processing varies across  the banking industry, preventing a similar analysis for private-sector costs.  Instead, we sent a data collection instrument to and interviewed officials  from the 10 largest banks by deposit size as of March 2008 in the United  States and a group of smaller banks. The 10 banks account for a significant  volume of checks presented (in 2007, about one-third of all checks paid).  We asked about costs related to paper check processing, the investment  that banks incurred to exchange check images, the cost savings that banks  achieved (including labor and transportation) with image technology, and  the impact of check imaging and substitute checks on losses from  fraudulent checks. We sent the data collection instrument to the 10 banks  and received a response from 9. For the bank that did not respond, we  interviewed an official representing the bank at an early stage of our  engagement. We conducted follow-up interviews with a number of the  institutions requesting clarification of their responses. In addition, we sent  the data collection instrument to 12 smaller banks, which had assets  ranging from less than $500 million to $5 billion. Our selection criteria  included whether the banks were located in metropolitan or  nonmetropolitan areas and were on the Electronic Check Clearing House  Organization\u2019s (ECCHO) list of participating members. From this group of  12 banks, we received five completed forms. We conducted follow-up  interviews with three of the smaller banks. To assess bank consumer  acceptance of the check truncation process resulting from Check 21, we  conducted in-person interviews with 108 consumers. The consumers  represented an approximate distribution of the U.S. adult population  across broad categories (age, education, and income). Consumers had to  meet certain other conditions: having primary responsibility in the  household for balancing the financial account that allows paper check  writing and having received canceled original checks in paper form with  the checking account statement at some point since 2000. However, the  consumers recruited for the interviews did not form a random, statistically  representative sample of the U.S. population; therefore, we could not  generalize the results of the interviews to the relevant total population.  The interview questions covered topics, such as how consumers reviewed  their checking account activity, their acceptance of the check truncation  process, and any problems or errors they might have had with their  checking accounts since Check 21. This report does not contain all the  results from the consumer interviews. We reproduced the text from our  structured interview instrument and tabulated the results from the  questions in Questions for Consumers about Check 21 Act (GAO-09-09SP).", "To evaluate the benefits and costs to bank consumers from check  truncation, we interviewed Federal Reserve Board staff, representatives  from Consumers Union, the Consumer Federation of America, and the  U.S. Public Interest Research Group, and bank officials to identify possible  benefits and costs.

When a paper check is imaged depends on the  structure of a bank\u2019s back office operations. Some banks have the  capability to image a paper check at their branches, while others transport  the paper to centralized locations where the paper is imaged. Once the  images are taken, an image cash letter (ICL) is assembled and sent to the  paying bank directly or to an intermediary (such as the Federal Reserve, a  correspondent bank, or an image exchange processor) for ultimate  presentment to the paying bank (see fig. 3). Since Check 21 was enacted,  imaging technology has been further refined so that it is possible for a  bank to image a paper check at its branches or automated teller machines  (ATM)\u2014commonly referred to as branch or ATM capture.

Moreover, as we reported in 1998, perceptions about consumer  preferences for receiving canceled checks also deterred electronic check  processing. Because, under Check 21, checks drawn on any particular  bank can be truncated by any bank across the country, banks cannot  return the original canceled paper checks to their customers once they are  imaged.

The Federal Reserve has estimated that the  number of checks used in the United States peaked during the mid-1990s  at around 50 billion checks per year. In its 2007 study the Federal Reserve  highlighted the decline in check usage as a retail payment instrument. It  reported that both the number of checks written and checks paid declined  from 2003 through 2006. In 2006, 33.1 billion checks were written  compared with 37.6 billion checks in 2003 and paid checks decreased from  37.3 billion checks to 30.6 billion checks in the same period. The number  of checks written differs from checks paid because paper checks that have  been converted into automated clearing house (ACH) payments were  included in the figure for checks written. Additionally, the Federal  Reserve concluded that the share of retail payments made electronically  was growing, while the share of check payments of total noncash  payments was declining. Electronic payments, including debit and credit  cards, ACH payments (including check conversions), and electronic  benefit transfers (EBT) amounted to two-thirds of the total number of  noncash payments, which in 2006 totaled 93.3 billion.

To distinguish the effects of check truncation  from other factors influencing the Federal Reserve\u2019s total costs for check  clearing services, we modified econometric cost functions that Federal  Reserve economists have used to assess the effects of check volumes on  total costs. In particular, we sought to distinguish the effect of the  increased use of check truncation following passage of Check 21 on total  costs from the concurrent effects of  the decrease in the number of checks written in the United States,   changes in the volume of checks processed by the Federal Reserve,  the Federal Reserve\u2019s consolidation of its check services, and    costs of labor, software, and other expenses associated with the check  processing services.", "With this consolidation of check offices, the Federal Reserve has incurred  an estimated $115 million in costs from 2003 through 2007, including  severance and other payments, which would increase total check services  costs.

Most recently, the 2008 annual  budget review reported that the expense overrun was due mainly to  greater systemwide costs in preparation for additional restructuring of  check services (costs included $34.0 million for accrual of severance,  equipment impairments, and other expenses). The 2007 annual budget  review noted total expenses for check services were to increase to $11.0  million reflecting higher costs for Check 21-related supplies and  equipment, as well as additional resources necessary to facilitate further  consolidation into five regional check-adjustments sites. \u201cTotal check service expenses were budgeted to increase by $5.7 million, or 0.9 percent  from the 2005 estimate. The increase reflects one-time costs to prepare further  consolidations of check operations, as well as other initiatives underway to improve the  efficiency of check operations, including investments in Check 21 technology to  accommodate increased volumes.\u201d", "The Planning and Control System (PACS) is the Federal Reserve\u2019s cost  accounting system for recording expenses, which includes the costs of its  check operations.

We chose 1994 as the beginning point for the  analysis based on conversations with Federal Reserve officials about the  data and in order to provide adequate coverage for the period before and  after enactment of Check 21. These cost functions estimate the effects that  different explanatory variables may have on total Federal Reserve costs  for check services. Explanatory variables include the total volume of  checks processed, the introduction of electronic processing or the volume  of checks processed electronically, the number of return items, the  number of Federal Reserve check processing offices, whether Check 21  was in effect, and wage and price indexes. The cost functions permit  isolation of the effect of Check 21 from the effects of other variables on  the Federal Reserve\u2019s total costs for check services.", "The results do not demonstrate any gains in economic efficiency as  measured by lower costs in the Federal Reserve\u2019s check operations for the  period since the passage of Check 21 through 2007. In particular, the  variable that would measure a change in total costs following the effective  date of Check 21 did not have a statistically significant effect on total  costs. See appendix II for a more detailed discussion of the estimated  cost functions. In part, the results reflect costs associated with the  concurrent closing of the Federal Reserve\u2019s check processing sites. While  these closings should reduce costs in the long run, restructuring expenses  incurred as part of the closings (such as severance pay for workers)  represent up-front costs.", "The need to maintain dual infrastructures for paper and electronic check  services also may explain the results. While Check 21 removed a barrier to  electronic processing by creating the substitute check, Check 21 did not  require that paper be removed from the process. So, the Federal Reserve  continues to process paper checks and must maintain the infrastructure to  process paper checks as it invests in new equipment to electronically  process checks. Further, the creation of the substitute check also required  investment in new equipment to print those instruments. For instance, a  Federal Reserve Retail Payment Office official noted that the high-speed  printing machines for substitute checks cost approximately $200,000 each  and the Atlanta processing site had purchased about 12 of these  machines.", "Although the move to electronic check services apparently has not led yet  to overall cost savings, the Federal Reserve has seen decreases in  transportation costs and work hours.

As previously noted, Check 21 did not require banks  to take any action other than the acceptance of the substitute check. The  10 largest banks in the United States, based on deposit size, generally have  large national branch networks and process large volumes of checks;  consequently, they have a financial incentive to reduce the amount of  paper they have to sort and transport. In 2007, these banks individually  had at least 350 million paper checks deposited by their customers and  some of them had considerably higher deposits, up to approximately 5 to 7  billion checks.", "But, the 10 banks have achieved various levels of electronic processing.  Two of the 10 banks have not converted their check processing systems to  imaging, but plan to do so by early 2009 and 7 banks have migrated to  check imaging to some extent, but with imaging volumes at various levels.  As of 2007, on the basis of our data collection instrument, the check  volume of the seven banks that sent electronic check images ranged from  almost 4 to 60 percent of their overall check deposits, although imaged  volumes have been growing for some of the seven banks. However, the  seven imaging banks are maintaining dual processing systems to collect on  checks deposited at their institutions. If a bank cannot receive an image, a  bank or an intermediary must either print a substitute check of the image  or present the original paper check.", "Officials from four banks provided us with information on how the  continued use of paper presentment has affected their transition to check  imaging and their level of cost savings. Federal Reserve officials noted that  the willingness of private banks to invest in the equipment needed to  process check electronically demonstrated the bank\u2019s expectation of  lower costs. One bank official told us that the bank still has to print  substitute checks for presentment to the small institutions that cannot  receive images, which adds to the bank\u2019s costs. Another bank noted that  for banks that would prefer to receive only paper, it will deposit the image  with either the Federal Reserve or another intermediary that then will  print the substitute check to present for payment. An official representing  this bank stated that the bank has to incur the additional cost of printing a  substitute check or, if it goes through an intermediary, to pay the  intermediary\u2019s prices. The same bank official added that maintaining paper  operations has delayed the ultimate potential savings from electronic  check processing because the bank had to keep in place its transportation  network to continue delivering paper checks. A third bank official  reported to us that fees paid to clear checks would be reduced as more  and more banks converted to imaging. Finally, a bank official from the  fourth bank advised us that mid-size and regional banks were behind in  their conversion to imaging because they are too large to outsource their  check business, but not large enough to have a financial incentive to invest  in check imaging technology. Thus, they continued to use local  clearinghouses where they could exchange their checks at very low costs.  This official noted that these banks need a reasonable business case for  investing in check imaging.", "The declining volumes of paper checks also may be inhibiting the  migration of some banks to check imaging. As previously noted, from 2003  through 2006, the number of checks paid had declined from about 37  billion to over 30 billion checks. According to one bank trade association,  some banks are still undecided about converting to imaging because they  recognize that check volume is declining and wonder why they should  invest in check processing technology. During our interviews, some of the  seven imaging banks raised the issue of declining check volumes as an  additional complication preventing some banks from converting to check  imaging. Officials from the Federal Reserve acknowledged while the  volume of checks is declining, paper checks would continue to be used  long enough to warrant banks\u2019 investments in the technology for a more  efficient check processing method. In both the paper-based and the image- based check processing systems, the bank of first deposit bears most of  the cost of check collection; thus, it has the most financial incentive to  convert to an image-based system. In addition, under EFAA, the bank of  first deposit is required to release funds to the depositor within specified  time periods; thus, it has an additional incentive for speeding up  processing. The paying bank has the least market incentive to migrate to  imaging because it does not incur the costs for collection, such as  transportation and clearing fees.", "Officials representing some of the four banks with the highest volumes of  check image deposits and receipts raised concerns with us that some  banks are refusing to migrate to the new imaging technology and some  action may be needed to encourage them to do so.

According to Federal Reserve officials,  when fewer banks require the services of a particular transportation  network, per-check transportation costs will increase for those banks still  using the services because the network is transporting a smaller number  of checks. The costs for the last bank on a specific route will be very  expensive. According to one Federal Reserve official, in the future  overnight mail may be the only practical option for these banks. In  congressional testimony, the Director of the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s  Division of Reserve Bank Operations and Payment Systems stated, \u201cAs  banks improve their technological capabilities, they can reduce their  reliance on air and ground transportation, especially shared transportation  arrangements.

The report objectives are to: (1) determine the gains in economic  efficiency from check truncation and evaluate the costs and benefits to  banks and the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve) from check  truncation, (2) assess consumer acceptance of the check truncation  process resulting from Check 21, and (3) evaluate the costs and benefits to  consumers from check truncation.", "To estimate the gains in economic efficiency from check truncation and  evaluate the costs and benefits to banks from check truncation, we  separately analyzed costs for the check operations of the Federal Reserve  and for a selected group of banks. We used data from the Federal Reserve  cost accounting system, known as the Planning and Control System or  PACS, for the period beginning 10 years prior to the effective date of  Check 21 (1994) through 2007. We modeled the Federal Reserve\u2019s total  check processing costs as different functions of variables, such as the  volume of checks processed, the volume of returned checks, the number  of Federal Reserve check processing offices, and the general indexes on  wage and price. The specified cost functions allowed us to use standard  econometric methods for estimating the effects of the variables on the  Federal Reserve\u2019s total check processing costs for 1994 through 2007.  Because data on prices of input factors associated with Federal Reserve\u2019s  check processing operations are not available, we also used in our  estimation data from the Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Economic  Analysis (BEA) and the Department of Labor\u2019s Bureau of Labor Statistics  (BLS) as alternative measurements for the prices of these input factors.  For example, we used average hourly earning for all private sectors from  BLS as an alternative measurement for the Federal Reserve\u2019s labor cost,  BEA\u2019s price deflator for equipment and software by nonresidential  producers as an alternative measurement for communications equipment  and transit cost, and BEA\u2019s Gross Domestic Product price deflator as an  alternative measurement for costs of all other input factors. We assessed  the quality of all the above data and found them to be sufficiently reliable  for our purposes. We also discussed Federal Reserve check processing  costs and our econometric cost model with staff at the Federal Reserve.  See appendix II for a detailed discussion of our econometric cost  functions.", "While the Federal Reserve has consistent cost accounting data, cost  accounting varies throughout the banking industry, preventing a similar  analysis for private-sector costs. To evaluate the costs and benefits to  banks from check truncation, we focused our data collection and analysis  on the 10 largest banks in the United States, based on deposit size as of  March 25, 2008. The check volume at the 10 largest U.S. banks represents a  significant segment of the check paid volume. In 2007, these banks  presented almost 13 billion checks for collection out of approximately 30  billion checks, which were paid in 2006. Thus, we determined that these  banks should have a financial incentive to reduce the amount of paper that  has to be sorted and transported. We created a data collection instrument  to obtain qualitative cost information about the following issues: (1) the  extent to which the banks deposited and received checks as images; (2)  the primary costs related to paper check processing; (3) the extent of the  investment that banks made to exchange check images; (4) the level of  cost savings banks achieved, if any, including changes in labor and  transportation costs through the use of image technology; and (5) the  impact of check imaging and the use of substitute checks on the  prevalence of bank losses from fraudulent checks. Officials from the  Electronic Check Clearing House Organization, commonly known as  ECCHO, also reviewed the data collection instrument. We sent it to the 10  banks and received a response from 9. At an early stage of our  engagement, we also interviewed an official representing the bank that did  not provide a response. We conducted follow-up interviews with a number  of the banks requesting clarification of their responses.", "We also sent the data collection instrument to 12 smaller institutions,  which included credit unions, to understand the small bank experience  with check imaging. These banks\u2019 assets ranged from less than $500  million to $5 billion and were selected from ECCHO\u2019s list of participating  members. In addition, our selection criteria included whether these  smaller institutions were located in metropolitan or nonmetropolitan  areas. We received completed forms from five of these institutions, but  two had not migrated any of their volume to check imaging. We conducted  subsequent interviews with the three institutions that had. We made  several attempts to contact the nonrespondents through e-mail messages  and follow-up telephone calls. In addition, we interviewed officials from a  corporate credit union and a banker\u2019s bank.", "To assess consumer acceptance of the check truncation process resulting  from Check 21, we conducted in-depth structured interviews with a total  of 108 adult consumers in three locations (Atlanta, Boston, and Chicago)  in May 2008. We contracted with NuStats, Inc., a private research and  consulting firm, to recruit a sample of consumers who generally  represented a range of demographics within the U.S. population in terms  of age, education level, and income. However, the consumers recruited for  the interviews did not form a random, statistically representative sample  of the U.S. population; therefore, we could not generalize the results of the  interviews to the relevant total population. Additionally, the self-reported  data we obtained from consumers are based on their opinions and  memories, which may be subject to error and may not predict their future  behavior. Consumers had to speak English and meet certain other  conditions: having primary responsibility in the household for balancing  the financial account that allows paper check writing; having received  canceled original checks in paper form with the checking account  statement at some point since 2000; and not having participated in more  than one focus group or similar in-person study in the 12 months before  the interview. We achieved our sample recruitment goals for all  demographics, with the exception of the age category \u201c65 plus\u201d and the  education category \u201csome high school or less.\u201d In addition, our sample  comprised 64 women and 43 men. We considered that the impact of not  achieving these goals on our work was minimal. See table 1 for further  demographic information on the consumers we interviewed.", "During these interviews, we obtained information about the experience of  consumers with, and their opinions about, changes to their checking  accounts resulting from the check truncation process. Our interviews  included a number of standardized questions, and more tailored follow-up  questions as necessary to more fully understand their answers. All  consumers were asked about their current experience with their checking  accounts and preferred method of making retail payments. The interview  focused on consumer experience with canceled checks, substitute checks  and check images, and the possible changes to their checking accounts  since Check 21. More specifically, the structured interview of the 108  consumers included questions on the following issues: (1) bank fees  charged to them to receive canceled checks, substitute checks or image  statements; (2) instances and subsequent resolution of errors involving  their checking accounts; (3) their preferred method of receiving  information from their bank about check payments activity (such as  receiving their canceled checks, reviewing information online, or  reviewing an image statement); (4) instances in which they had to  demonstrate proof of payment using a canceled check or a check image  and their resolutions; (5) their level of concern about using a check image  as a proof of payment; and (6) whether their bank had extended its cut-off  time for accepting deposits and the consumer\u2019s opinion about the merits  of such an action. In addition, we asked nine questions about the  consumers\u2019 experience submitting complaints to banks and federal  banking regulators. This report does not contain all the results from the  consumers\u2019 interviews. We reproduced the text from our structured  interview instrument and tabulated the results from the questions in  Questions for Consumers about Check 21 Act (GAO-09-09SP).", "To evaluate the benefits and costs to consumers from check truncation,  we interviewed staff from the federal banking regulators\u2014the Board of  Governors of the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation, the National Credit Union Administration, the Office of the  Comptroller of the Currency, and the Office of Thrift Supervision\u2014and  collected consumer complaints about the implementation of Check 21 that  were submitted to these agencies from October 28, 2004, through March  31, 2008. Our analysis of the consumer complaint data helped us identify  the issues that we pursued in our structured interviews of 108 consumers.  While the regulators\u2019 consumer complaint data may be indicative of the  relative levels of different types of complaints, we did not rely solely on  these data because these voluntary reporting systems rely on  complainants to self-select themselves; therefore, the data may not be  representative of the experiences of the general public. We also  interviewed representatives from consumer advocacy groups, including  Consumers Union, the Consumer Federation of America, and the U.S.  Public Interest Research Group. Furthermore, we interviewed officials  from the American Bankers Association and third-party processors.", "The data collection instrument discussed above also included questions  about the potential benefits and costs of Check 21 for consumers. For  example, we asked the banks for information about (1) their policies on  returning canceled checks before and after Check 21; (2) the fees they  charged to consumers for the return of canceled checks and image  statements; (3) their assistance to customers in showing proof of payment  using a canceled check, a substitute check, or a check copy; (4) the  instances of expedited claims they received on substitute checks and their  resolution; and (5) the complaints they have received about matters  relating to Check 21 and whether they had changed their cut-off times for  deposits at automated teller machines or branches in the last 2 years.", "In addition, we analyzed the conclusions and the methodology applied in  the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s Report to the Congress on the Check Clearing  for the 21st Century Act of 2003, published in April 2007, to determine  whether we could use the results in our report. The study constituted the  Federal Reserve Board\u2019s assessment of the banking industry\u2019s  implementation of Check 21 to date, as well as the continued  appropriateness of the funds availability requirements of Regulation CC.  We interviewed staff from the Federal Reserve Board about the  methodology and conclusions in the report and we examined the design,  implementation, and analysis of the survey instrument used for the study.  We considered the overall strengths and weaknesses of the Federal  Reserve\u2019s data collection program, as well as specific questionnaire items  relating to Regulation CC. On the basis of our review, we concluded that  we could use the results in this report.", "To determine whether consumers may incur fees for receiving canceled  checks and check images since the implementation of Check 21, we  reviewed and analyzed data purchased from Informa Research Services  (Informa) that included summary-level fee data from 2001 through 2006.  The data included information on check enclosure and imaging fees.  Informa collected its data by gathering the proprietary fee statements of  banks, as well as making anonymous in-branch, telephone, and Web site  inquiries for a variety of bank fees. It also received the information directly  from its contacts at the banks. The data are not statistically representative  of the entire population of depository institutions in the country because  the company collects fee data for particular institutions in specific  geographical markets so that these institutions can compare their fees  against their competitors. That is, surveyed institutions are self-selected  into the sample or are selected at the request of subscribers. To the extent  that institutions selected in this manner differ from those which are not,  results of the survey would not accurately reflect the industry as a whole.  Informa collects data on more than 1,500 institutions, including a mix of  banks, thrifts, credit unions, and Internet-only banks. The institutions from  which it collects data tend to be large ones that have a large percentage of  the deposits in a particular market. Additionally, the company has access  to individuals and information from the 100 largest commercial banks.", "The summary-level data Informa provided us for each data element  included the average amount, the standard deviation, the minimum and  maximum values, and the number of institutions for which data were  available to calculate the averages. They also provided these summary- level data by institution type (banks and thrifts combined, and credit  unions) and size (as shown in table 2). In addition, Informa provided us  with data for nine specific geographic areas: California, Eastern United  States, Florida, Michigan, Midwestern United States, New York, Southern  United States, Texas, and Western United States.", "We interviewed representatives from Informa to gain an understanding of  their methodology for collecting the data and the processes they had in  place to ensure the integrity of the data. Reasonableness checks were  conducted in 2007 on the data and identified any missing, erroneous, or  outlying data and Informa Research Services representatives corrected  any mistakes that were found. Also, in 2007, we compared the average fee  amounts that Informa had calculated for selected fees for 2000, 2001, and  2002 with the Federal Reserve\u2019s \u201cAnnual Report to the Congress on Retail  Fees and Services of Depository Institutions.\u201d The averages were found to  be comparable to those derived by the Federal Reserve. While these tests  did not specifically include check enclosure and check image fees, they  did confirm our assessment of the Informa data system. Because the  assessment conducted for our January 2008 report encompassed the  checking fee data we used, we determined that the Informa Research  Services data were sufficiently reliable for our current report.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2007 to October  2008 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

Prior to Check 21, a bank was required to present an original paper check  to the paying bank for payment unless the paying bank agreed to accept  presentment in some other form. This required the collecting bank to enter  into agreements with all or nearly all of the banks to which it presented  checks. Because of these impediments, banks were deterred from making  the necessary electronic check processing investments. Check 21  addressed these impediments by authorizing a new paper negotiable  instrument (a substitute check), which is the legal equivalent of the  original check. Other than accepting the substitute check, the act does not  require banks to adopt electronic check processing, but it enables banks  that want to truncate or remove the original paper checks from the check- collection system to do so more easily. Check 21 facilitates electronic  check processing by allowing banks to use imaging technology for  collection and create substitute checks from those images for delivery to  banks that do not accept checks electronically.", "To assess the implications for economic efficiency in the Federal Reserve  System\u2019s (Federal Reserve) check processing since Check 21 took effect in  October 2004, we conducted a standard econometric analysis of the  Federal Reserve\u2019s quarterly accounting cost and volume data for the  period from 1994 through 2007.

Though insignificant, the coefficient of total presentment  is positive and less than 1, and the coefficient of the interacted variable of  total presentment and Check 21 dummy is negative (-0.25). If significant,  the sum of two coefficients would imply that the cost structure for the  check operation in the post-Check 21 period would be different from the  pre-Check 21 period. However, the relatively short time series data for the  post-Check 21 period increase the standard errors for all the coefficients  of the interacted variables. Also, although insignificant, the coefficient of  the Check 21 dummy is positive, implying that the total cost, on average, is  lower in periods before Check 21 than after.", "In addition to the estimation results shown in table 4, we estimated  alternative functional forms used in other similar studies for the  relationships in equation (2). Because these functional forms generally  require constructing a substantial number of interacted variables, the  subsequent multicollinearity and the limited data available make the  results subject to high estimation errors and thus difficult from which to  draw clear inferences.
