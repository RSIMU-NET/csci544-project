State's over 260 centrally billed accounts are used by State and other foreign affairs agencies to purchase transportation services, such as airline and train tickets. GAO found that between April 2003 and September 2004 State's centrally billed accounts were used to purchase over 32,000 premium-class tickets costing almost $140 million. Premium-class travel--primarily business-class airline tickets--represented about 19 percent of the tickets issued but about 49 percent of the $286 million spent on airline tickets with State's centrally billed account travel cards. GAO determined that this trend continued for fiscal year 2005. GAO found that 67 percent of this premium-class travel was not properly authorized, justified, or both. Because premium-class tickets typically cost substantially more than coach tickets, improper premium-class travel represents a waste of tax dollars. Most of these blanket premium-class travel authorizations were signed by subordinates who told us they couldn't challenge the use of premium-class travel by senior executives. Ineffective oversight and control breakdowns also contributed to problems with monitoring unused tickets, reconciling monthly statements, and maximizing performance rebates. Although federal agencies are authorized to recover payments made to airlines for tickets that they ordered but did not use, State failed to do so and paid for about $6 million for airline tickets that were not used or processed for refund. State was unaware of this problem before our review because it neither monitored travelers' adherence to travel regulations nor systematically identified and processed all unused tickets. State also failed to reconcile or dispute over $420,000 of unauthorized charges before paying its monthly bank invoice and instead deducted the amounts from its bill. Because these amounts were not properly disputed under the contract terms, State underpaid its monthly bills and was thus frequently delinquent. Handling questionable charges in this ad hoc manner sharply reduced State's eligible rebates. Overall, State earned only $700,000 out of a possible $2.8 million in rebates that could have been earned if it had properly disputed unauthorized charges and paid the bill in accordance with the contract."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["This report responds to your request that we audit controls over the travel  paid for with the Department of State\u2019s (State) over 260 centrally billed  travel accounts, which includes travel related to a number of foreign affairs  agencies (e.g., State and other federal agencies located at United States\u2019  diplomatic missions abroad). State\u2019s centrally billed travel process is used  predominantly by State employees; however, other government travelers  who also use State\u2019s centrally billed accounts reimburse State for their  travel expenses.

In general, other agencies  overseas authorize their own travel and State processes the payments  based on their authorizations. In carrying out this mission, State manages  the second largest centrally billed travel card program in the federal  government, after DOD. About 70 percent of State\u2019s and other foreign  affairs agencies\u2019 travel is international or at least one flight segment in a  trip had an origin or destination outside the continental United States.  Comparatively, State and other foreign affairs agencies spent more on  premium-class travel than did DOD, both in terms of total dollars spent and  as a percentage of total airline travel.  In light of the relative size of State\u2019s  program, and the concerns about fraud, waste, and abuse in government  travel card programs, you requested that we audit premium-class travel and  other centrally billed travel account activities.

State\u2019s general policy is for  its foreign and civil service employees to travel using coach-class  accommodations provided by common carriers. However, regulations  governing foreign service and civil service travel authorize the use of  premium-class travel under specific circumstances. Both foreign service  and civil service travel regulations require the agency head or his or her  designee to authorize first-class travel in advance. These regulations also  require the authorizing official at a post abroad or the executive director of  the funding bureau or office domestically to authorize premium-class travel  other than first class. Further, in September 2004, the Assistant Secretary of  State for Administration sent a memorandum to all State executive  directors emphasizing \u201cthat it is wrong to authorize premium-class travel  on a blanket basis\u201d and \u201cthat a separate justification for premium-class  travel is required for each trip.\u201d  Federal and State travel regulations  authorize premium-class accommodation when at least one of the  following conditions exists:  no space is available in coach-class accommodations,   regularly scheduled flights provide only premium-class   an employee with a disability or special need requires premium-class   security issues or exceptional circumstances,  travel lasts in excess of 14 hours without a rest stop,   foreign-carrier coach-class air accommodations are inadequate,   overall cost savings, such as when a premium-class ticket is less  expensive than a coach-class ticket or in consideration of other  economic factors,  transportation costs are paid in full through agency acceptance of  payment from a nonfederal source, or  required because of agency mission (e.g., courier).", "The regulations also allow for the traveler to upgrade to premium-class  accommodations, at the traveler\u2019s expense or by using frequent traveler  benefits, but the upgrade cannot be charged to the centrally billed account.", "State has the second largest centrally billed travel card program in the  federal government.

On the basis of our statistical sample,  we estimate that 67 percent of premium-class travel during April 2003  through September 2004 for State and other foreign affairs personnel was  improper--either not properly authorized or properly justified because of  breakdowns in key internal controls. Examples of breakdowns in key  controls include travelers flying premium-class travel when the travel  orders did not authorize premium-class travel; subordinates authorizing  their supervisors to take premium-class flights; and travel orders  authorizing premium-class travel using criteria of a total flight time of more  than 14 hours, even though the actual flight time, including layovers, was  less than 14 hours. Also, State\u2019s diplomatic couriers used premium-class  travel even when it was not justified.

Using these regulations, we found that transactions failed  the authorization test in the following two categories: (1) the  documentation did not specifically authorize premium-class travel or a  blanket travel authorization was used to authorize premium-class travel  and (2) the travel order authorizing premium-class travel was not signed.", "Premium-class travel was not specifically authorized.

We estimated that an additional 17 percent of the  transactions were authorized by a blanket authorization, including all  diplomatic courier travel. A blanket authorization is not an appropriate  vehicle for authorizing premium-class travel because federal and State  travel regulations require that all premium-class travel be authorized on a  trip-by-trip basis. In September 2004, State issued a memorandum to all  executive directors reminding them about the use of blanket orders,  emphasizing that it is wrong to authorize business-class travel on a blanket  basis and also reminding the executive directors that a trip-specific  justification must be provided for each business-class authorization.", "Travel order was not signed.

Thirty-nine percent of premium-class transactions were not  authorized and, therefore, could not have been justified. State asserts that  even if business-class authorization for some trips was not properly  documented, the premium travel was nevertheless justified so long as the  trips were in excess of 14 hours. However, without properly documented  authorization, we cannot assess the propriety of such travel  notwithstanding the 14-hour travel rule and therefore must conclude that it  was unjustified premium-class travel. In addition, 28 percent of premium- class transactions were authorized but were not supported by valid  justification.

In comparison, the unrestricted government  fare from Washington, D.C., to Honolulu was $790.

Furthermore, the travel was authorized by  a blanket premium-travel authorization signed by a subordinate of the  traveler and a separate trip authorization was not included to  specifically authorize this trip, as required. The travel authorization did  not provide specific justification for business-class travel and the travel  was not more than 14 hours. Therefore, the transaction failed  authorization and justification.", "Travelers #2 and #3 traveled from Johannesburg to Asmara through  Frankfurt, at a cost of about $8,353 each, a total of $16,706.

In addition to the federal and State regulations, we  also applied the criteria set forth in our internal control standards and  sensitive payments guidelines in evaluating the proper authorization of  premium-class travel. For example, State travel regulations and policies do  not restrict subordinates from authorizing their supervisors\u2019 premium-class  travel, a practice which our internal control standards consider to be  flawed. Therefore, a premium-class transaction that was approved by a  subordinate would fail the control test based on our internal control  standards.

Most of these flights were to destinations within the United  States, South America, and Western Europe. Further, over $860,000 in  premium-class trips taken by executives were obtained using blanket  authorizations. For each premium-class trip, State regulation requires  specific authorization to fly premium class.

Although  State officials were aware that offering employees rest stops on longer  flights was often less expensive than premium-class travel, they offered the  more expensive premium-class travel to employees for all flights lasting  over 14 hours, which increased costs. For example, one individual in our  statistical sample flew premium-class roundtrip from Washington, D.C., to  Tel Aviv at a cost of over $6,000. Although the trip lasted over 14 hours, as  an alternative to paying the premium-class rates, State could have flown  this employee coach and paid the cost of an overnight rest stop in London,  for a total cost of about $2,300 (about $1,600 for the GSA contract airfare  and $700 in lodging and per diem expenses). Overall, this option could have  saved taxpayers over $3,700. State officials explained that they made these  decisions about premium-class travel to improve morale and retain highly  qualified foreign-service personnel. State officials also believed that, among  other factors, their decisions about premium-class travel for trips in excess  of 14 hours have led to increased morale, as reflected in \u201cThe Best Places to  Work\u201d survey. However, State could not provide any empirical evidence  that showed a direct correlation that offering premium-class travel  increased its scores on the survey or increased retention of foreign-service  personnel, and could not provide evidence that travel was a metric in the  \u201cBest Places to Work\u201d survey.

These measures  include the expanded use of cargo carriers (e.g., FedEx), which do not  require the couriers to purchase passenger tickets and charge lower freight  costs than the commercial airlines. Our analysis of a FedEx study  performed for the Courier Service showed that substantial air cargo  savings and benefits could be achieved through direct cargo flights with  multiple stops along a designated route. Although the Courier Service  initiated the use of cargo carriers in late 2004, expanding this approach to  the extent practical could achieve substantial savings. However, to achieve  the additional savings, the Courier Service would need to overcome foreign  mission resistance to meeting cargo aircraft outside of business hours.  According to Courier Service officials, foreign mission personnel have been  unwilling to meet air cargo shipments that arrive outside normal business  hours and at cargo airports outside city limits.

This notification of an unused ticket initiates a process to  submit requests to the airlines for refunds.", "Figure 4 illustrates where control breakdowns can occur if travelers do not  adhere to State requirements.

In exchange, the TMC received a fee  for each refund received for an unused ticket. However, State did not  implement procedures to determine whether unused tickets were being  identified and credits were being received. Instead, State officials took the  TMC\u2019s monthly report indicating only the total dollar amount of refunds  submitted to the airlines as evidence of contractual compliance.

During  fiscal years 2003 and 2004, State did not dispute any of the previously  mentioned over 320 unauthorized charges applied to its domestic centrally  billed accounts, and instead simply deducted the amounts due from its  credit card bill. If State had disputed these charges, Citibank would have  given State a 60-day grace period to investigate whether the charges were  appropriate and the disputed amounts would not have to be paid until the  investigation was completed. An average person cannot simply determine  which charges on their credit card bill they are going to pay but must notify  the bank of any unauthorized charges. Since State did not dispute the  charges, it was still liable for the amounts associated with these charges  and simply deducting them from the credit card bill did not relieve State of  its responsibility for these charges.

However, State also commented that our report overstates the problem,  fails to identify improper travel conducted for other than official  government travel, identifies only a few instances of unjustified travel, and  implies incorrectly that State carelessly implemented business-class  regulations without regard to the increased cost. We disagree.", "We do not agree with State\u2019s position that we overstate the nature and  extent of its control breakdowns and ineffective oversight. State and other  foreign affairs travelers charged almost $140 million on premium-class  travel from April 2003 through September 2004. On the basis of our  statistical sample, 67 percent of premium-class travel was not properly  authorized, justified, or both. This failure rate and the associated dollars  spent on premium class travel shows that taxpayers lost tens of millions of  dollars on improper travel. For example, State issued premium-class  tickets to a family of four traveling from Washington to Moscow for a  permanent change of duty station. Although this trip was well under the  required 14 hours to justify premium-class travel, State purchased the  premium class accommodations for almost four times the cost of coach  seats. In addition to the waste exemplified here and elsewhere in our  report, taxpayers lost millions more because State failed to recover  payments made to airlines for tickets issued but never used and failed to  reconcile and dispute other charges properly. For example, State paid for a  premium-class ticket for roundtrip travel between New Mexico and  Ethiopia that was neither used nor refunded. These specific examples and  our overall analysis clearly show how ineffective oversight\u2014not just  procedural problems\u2014resulted in substantial waste of taxpayers\u2019 dollars.", "As our report clearly explains, we did not specifically question whether  travel charged to State\u2019s centrally billed travel accounts were necessary.  Therefore, we purposely did not identify improper travel conducted for  other than official government travel and thus our report makes no  conclusions on this matter.", "State\u2019s position that our findings of improper travel are simply the result of  \u201cprocedural problems\u201d and that \u201conly a few instances\u201d of travel were  conducted outside of the regulations are inconsistent with the facts. In this  regard, over half of the transactions we tested\u2014not just a few instances\u2014 were not simply the result of procedural problems (e.g., not properly  authorized), they were unjustified because the travel was conducted  outside of the regulations. Over half of the travelers improperly flew  premium-class on trips lasting shorter than 14 hours or flew business class  and also took a rest stop, which is to be used in lieu of using premium-class  accommodations to economize travel. For example, one State traveler flew  premium-class between points in Europe on a trip lasting well short of   14 hours and also took an unjustified rest stop, which further added lodging  and subsistence expenses to the total cost of travel. Another traveler flying  short of 14 hours on a premium-class ticket enjoyed 3 nights of rest upon  her return. These and other examples of unjustified travel underscore  problems beyond what State says are simply \u201cdeficient procedural  protocols\u201d and demonstrate how State\u2019s ineffective oversight of premium- class travel resulted in substantial losses to taxpayers.", "Finally, State takes exception with our characterization that it treated  premium-class travel as an employee benefit. This position, however, is in  stark contrast to the representations State made throughout our review.  For example, although State prohibits blanket authorizations for premium- class travel, many of State\u2019s top executives consistently flew on blanket  travel orders improperly authorizing premium class from Washington to  numerous domestic and other destinations that were well below the 14  hours required to justify such travel. For example, one senior State  executive completed 45 premium-class trips costing $213,000, many of  which were under 14 hours, using a blanket travel order. These executive  travelers set a tone at the top that premium-class travel was in fact a benefit  to the traveler and not something that should be minimized or used  sparingly. In addition, during our review, State said that it indeed offered  premium-class travel as a benefit to its employees and that such travel  contributed to their improved employee feedback provided to \u201cThe Best  Places to Work\u201d survey. However, State could not provide evidence that  travel was a metric in that survey. Moreover, regardless of the increased  cost associated with such moves, State began in 2002 and continues today  to offer premium-class travel for permanent change of station moves as a  benefit to its employees and their families. We believe these examples,  especially the top State executives who gave themselves the benefit of  flying premium class when federal law and regulations did not allow such  travel, demonstrate that the tone at the top of the department indicates that  premium-class travel is in fact a benefit, without specific regard to cost.
