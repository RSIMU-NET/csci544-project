ICE officers exercise discretion to achieve its operational goals of removing any aliens subject to removal while prioritizing those who pose a threat to national security or public safety and safeguarding aliens' rights in the removal process. The General Accountability Office (GAO) was asked to examine how ICE ensures that discretion is used in the most fair, reasoned, and efficient manner possible. GAO reviewed (1) when and how ICE officers and attorneys exercise discretion and what internal controls ICE has designed to (2) guide decision making and (3) oversee and monitor officers' decisions. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed ICE manuals, memorandums, and removal data, interviewed ICE officials, and visited 21 of 75 ICE field offices."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["ICE officers exercise discretion throughout the alien apprehension and removal process, but primarily during the initial phases of the process when deciding to initiate removals, apprehend aliens, issue removal documents, and detain aliens. Officers GAO interviewed at ICE field offices said that ICE policies and procedures limit their discretion when encountering the targets of their investigations--typically criminal or fugitive aliens, but that they can exercise more discretion for other aliens they encounter. Officers also said that they consider humanitarian circumstances, such as sole caregiver responsibilities or medical reasons, when making these decisions. Attorneys, who generally enter later in the process, and officers told GAO that once removal proceedings have begun, discretion is limited to specific circumstances, such as if the alien is awaiting approval of lawful permanent resident status. Consistent with internal control standards, ICE has begun to update and enhance training curricula to better support officer decision making. However, ICE has not taken steps to ensure that written guidance designed to promote the appropriate exercise of discretion during alien apprehension and removal is comprehensive and up to date and has not established time frames for updating guidance. For example, field operational manuals have not been updated to provide information about the appropriate exercise of discretion in light of a recent expansion of ICE worksite enforcement and fugitive operations, in which officers are more likely to encounter aliens with humanitarian issues or who are not targets of investigations. Also, ICE does not have a mechanism to ensure the timely dissemination of legal developments to help ensure that officers make decisions in line with the most recent interpretations of immigration law. As a result, ICE officers are at risk of taking actions that do not support operational objectives and making removal decisions that do not reflect the most recent legal developments. Consistent with internal control standards, ICE relies on supervisory reviews to ensure that officers exercise appropriate discretion and has instituted an inspection program designed to ensure that field offices comply with established policies and procedures. However, ICE lacks other controls to help monitor performance across the 75 field offices responsible for making apprehension and removal decisions. A comprehensive mechanism for reviewing officers' decision making could provide ICE with meaningful information to analyze trends to identify areas that may need corrective action and to identify best practices. ICE officials acknowledged they do not collect the data necessary for such a mechanism and said doing so may be costly. Without assessing costs and alternatives, ICE is not in a position to select an approach that will help identify best practices and areas needing corrective action."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Responsibility for the enforcement of immigration laws within the interior  of the United States rests with U.S. Immigration and Customs  Enforcement (ICE), which plans and conducts investigations of persons  and organizations subject to criminal and administrative provisions of the  Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). ICE officers investigate violations  of immigration law and are responsible for identifying aliens\u2014that is,  persons who are not citizens or nationals of the United States\u2014who are  removable from the United States. Aliens may be subject to removal for a  wide variety of reasons, including entering the United States illegally,  staying longer than their authorized period of admission, being convicted  of certain crimes, or engaging in terrorist activities. Aliens who enter the  United States illegally are subject to removal, as are aliens who violate  immigration law after entering the country legally. According to its  strategic plan, ICE focuses the greater part of its immigration enforcement  efforts on aliens who pose a threat to national security and public safety,  as well as on aliens who have ignored orders to leave the United States.  According to ICE records, in fiscal year 2006, ICE removed about 182,000  aliens from the United States as part of its enforcement efforts.", "In recent years, through targeted investigative operations, ICE  components have increased their efforts to enforce immigration laws and  apprehend and remove aliens subject to removal. The ICE Office of  Investigations (OI), which has responsibility for investigating immigration  and other crimes related to national security, has increased its emphasis  on worksite enforcement operations. These operations are conducted to  apprehend and remove aliens who are unlawfully employed and impose  sanctions on employers who knowingly employ these aliens. According to  ICE data, the number of worksite enforcement arrests increased from 510  in fiscal year 2002 to 4,383, in fiscal year 2006. Likewise, ICE\u2019s Office of  Detention and Removal Operations (DRO), which has responsibility for  ensuring that all removable aliens depart from the country, has increased  its emphasis on fugitive operations, which are enforcement operations  designed to locate, apprehend, and remove aliens from the country who  have not complied with orders of removal issued by an immigration  judge\u2014known as fugitive aliens. Over the last 2 fiscal years, the number  of fugitive arrests conducted by DRO increased from 7,958 in fiscal year  2005 to 15,467 in fiscal year 2006. In carrying out these operations and  processing aliens for removal, OI and DRO officers are to work with  attorneys from ICE\u2019s Office of the Principal Legal Advisor (OPLA), which  is responsible for providing legal advice, training, and services to support  the ICE mission and for defending the interests of the United States in the  administrative and federal courts. In fiscal year 2006, OPLA handled  approximately 324,000 proceedings in immigration courts.", "During the process of enforcing immigration law, there are a number of  decisions that ICE officers and attorneys must make, taking into account  all facts and circumstances of each case, about the apprehension and  disposition of aliens who are subject to removal. Specifically, ICE officers  exercise discretion when they decide whom to stop, question, and arrest;  how to initiate removal; whether to grant voluntary departure (whereby  aliens agree to waive their rights to a hearing and are escorted out of the  United States to their home countries by ICE officers); and whether to  detain an alien in custody. For example, ICE officers might consider  alternative ways to initiate removal proceedings\u2014other than immediate  apprehension and detention\u2014when they encounter aliens who are sole  caretakers for minor children or who are ill and are undergoing medical  treatment. In other circumstances, officers might decide not to question  and arrest some aliens they suspect are subject to removal in the interest  of pursuing other law enforcement efforts that provide a greater value to  the nation\u2014such as those involving known criminals or threats to national  security. Also, once an ICE officer has made a decision to pursue removal,  ICE attorneys exercise discretion when they decide whether and how to  settle or dismiss a removal proceeding or to appeal a decision rendered by  an immigration judge.", "All of these decisions are made within the context of the number of aliens  subject to removal from the United States (estimated to be about 12  million in 2006); ICE resources available to investigate, apprehend, and  remove aliens subject to removal; and the circumstances surrounding each  case. One of ICE\u2019s operational objectives is to apprehend and remove  aliens who are subject to removal\u2014with a priority on those aliens who  pose a threat to national security and public safety\u2014while safeguarding  aliens\u2019 rights in the removal process. Nonetheless, given the large number  of aliens in the country who are subject to removal, it is virtually  impossible for ICE officers to investigate and arrest every potentially  removable alien encountered through the course of an enforcement effort.  ICE headquarters officials told us that data are not collected about  potentially removable aliens whom its officers may encounter and against  whom officers do not take actions that may result in removal proceedings.  For this reason, the data provided in this report focus primarily on aliens  for whom removal proceedings have been initiated.", "Because of the important role that discretion plays in the alien  apprehension and removal process, you asked us to examine how ICE  ensures that discretion is used in the most fair, reasoned, and efficient  manner possible. Along these lines, we examined whether ICE has  designed internal controls to guide and monitor officers\u2019 exercise of  discretion when making alien apprehension and removal decisions,  consistent with internal control standards for the federal government.  Specifically, this review addresses the following three questions:  1.  When and how do ICE officers and attorneys exercise discretion  during the alien apprehension and removal process?  2.  What internal controls has ICE designed to guide officer decision  making to enhance its assurance that the exercise of discretion  supports its operational objectives?  3.  What internal controls has ICE designed to oversee and monitor  officer decision making during the alien apprehension and removal  process to enhance ICE\u2019s assurance that the exercise of discretion  supports its operational objectives?", "To address these questions, we reviewed relevant laws and regulations as  well as applicable policies, memorandums, field operational manuals, and  training materials developed by OI, DRO, and OPLA headquarters offices.  We also examined available data on alien apprehensions for worksite  enforcement and fugitive operations to understand decision outcomes  resulting from alien apprehension enforcement operations. We performed  procedures to test the data\u2019s reliability and we concluded that the data  were reliable for the purpose of our review. We also met with officials at  OI, DRO, and OPLA in Washington, D.C.; and interviewed ICE officers,  supervisors, and managers in 14 ICE field offices\u2014seven OI and seven  DRO field offices\u2014located in seven cities throughout the United States:  Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia, Phoenix, and San  Diego. In addition, we interviewed ICE attorneys, supervisors, and  managers in seven Chief Counsel Offices (which serve as OPLA\u2019s field  offices) at these same locations. We asked both officers and attorneys  about when and how they have exercised and are expected to exercise  discretion in the course of their duties related to alien removal. We  selected these locations considering field office size, ICE data on alien  apprehensions, and geographic dispersion. As we did not select probability  samples of field offices to visit and ICE officers and attorneys to interview,  the results of these interviews may not represent the views of ICE officers  and attorneys nationwide.", "We also reviewed field operational manuals, headquarters policy  memorandums, locally developed field guidance, and training materials.  We asked headquarters officials and officers and attorneys in the field  about the guidance and information that would help to inform alien  apprehension and removal decisions available to officers, attorneys, and  their supervisors and managers. At headquarters and the various field  locations, we also examined available documentation on internal controls  in place to guide supervisory and managerial oversight and monitoring of  alien apprehension and removal decisions, and inquired about procedures  and practices for assessing the exercise of discretion and outcomes  associated with alien apprehension and removal decisions. We compared  the internal controls in place with the standards for internal control to  determine whether ICE\u2019s internal controls are designed to provide  assurance that its officers and attorneys are best equipped to consistently  exercise discretion in support of its operational objectives.

DHS\u2019s Office of  Immigration Statistics estimated that the population of aliens subject to  removal has increased by half a million from January 2005 to January 2006.

ICE investigations resulted in 102,034 apprehensions, or  about 8 percent of the approximately 1.3 million DHS apprehensions in  2005. Four main categories constituted the basis for aliens removed by  DHS in 2005: (1) aliens entering without inspection, by, for example,  illegally crossing the border where there is no formal U.S. port of entry; (2)  aliens attempting to enter the United States without proper documents or  through fraud, at U.S. ports of entry; (3) aliens with criminal convictions  or believed to have engaged in certain criminal activities, such as terrorist  activities or drug trafficking; and (4) aliens who are in violation of their  terms of entry (e.g., expired visa)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "ICE Officers Exercise Discretion, Particularly for Aliens with Humanitarian Issues or Who Are Not Investigation Targets", "paragraphs": ["Our review of ICE policies and procedures, along with interviews at ICE  field offices, showed that officers exercise discretion throughout various  phases of the alien apprehension and removal process, but the initial  phases of the process\u2014initiating removals, apprehending aliens, issuing  removal documents and detaining aliens\u2014involve the most discretion.

Officers noted that several  factors\u2014such as the availability of detention space, travel time to an  alien\u2019s location, and competing enforcement priorities\u2014affect their  decisions to initiate removal action against an alien. Officers at one of the  seven OI field offices we visited also told us that because of limited  resources they have to make trade-offs between dedicating resources to  aliens who pose a threat to public safety and those who do not\u2014that is,  noncriminal aliens\u2014which in some instances result in decisions to not  initiate removal action against noncriminal aliens."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Apprehension Phase", "paragraphs": ["Our review of DHS and ICE guidance showed that officers\u2019 ability to  exercise discretion is limited for aliens who are investigation targets, such  as criminal aliens and fugitive aliens who have ignored a final removal  order.

By contrast, officers at all seven DRO and seven OI field offices  we visited told us that they have discretion to process and apprehend  aliens who are not investigation targets or aliens who present  humanitarian circumstances. In such circumstances, officers told us that  they can exercise discretion by deciding to (1) apprehend an alien and  transport the alien to an ICE facility for processing, (2) issue the alien an  NTA by mail, or (3) schedule an appointment for the alien to be processed  at an ICE facility at a later date.", "For example, in looking for a criminal alien who is the target of an  investigation, a fugitive operations team may encounter a friend or relative  of the targeted alien\u2014who is also removable\u2014but not the primary target  of an ICE investigation.

In  such instances, ICE headquarters officials told us that officers are to  confirm child welfare claims made by an alien and determine whether  other child care arrangements can be made. Headquarters officials also  told us that aliens do not always divulge that they are the sole caretakers  of children but explained that if ICE agents became aware of an alien\u2019s  child welfare responsibility, agents must take steps to ensure that the child  or children are not left unattended.", "In addition, officers at two OI offices and one DRO office told us that in  some instances, such as when aliens are sole caretakers for minor children  or are ill, they will schedule appointments for aliens who are not  investigation targets to process them at a later date. Officers at five of the  seven OI field offices and two of the seven DRO offices we visited also told  us that they will mail an NTA\u2014as an alternative to apprehension\u2014to  aliens who present humanitarian issues such as medical conditions or  child welfare issues.

Officers told us that they may consider factors like  humanitarian concerns and ICE priorities when exercising discretion to  grant voluntary departure.", "On the basis of our review of ICE data, we noted significant variation in  the use of voluntary departure across field offices. Our review of OI  apprehension data also showed that three OI field offices near the U.S.  southwestern border initiated a relatively higher number of voluntary  departures (equal or greater than the number of NTAs issued). ICE  headquarters officials noted that officers at field offices near the U.S.  southwestern border employ voluntary departure generally because of  their proximity to the U.S.-Mexico border, which enables them to easily  transport Mexican nationals to Mexico. Figure 1 illustrates the number of  NTAs and voluntary departure issued by OI field offices.", "Our review of procedures also showed that if detention is not mandated by  the INA, officers have discretion to determine if an alien will be detained  or released pending the alien\u2019s immigration court hearing. When making  this determination, ICE guidance instructs officers to consider a number  of factors, such as humanitarian issues, flight risk, availability of detention  space, and whether the alien is a threat to the community. Officers at two  DRO field offices we visited told us that they exercise discretion to release  aliens from custody if appropriate facilities are not available or if  detention space is needed for aliens who pose a greater threat to public  safety. At one OI field office, officers provided an example of an operation  where they released two women and two children on their own  recognizance because of the lack of appropriate detention space to house  women and children.

Our review of ICE policy and interviews with attorneys at 5 of  7 Chief Counsel Offices showed that most aliens have few alternatives to  appearing before immigration court after entering the removal proceeding  phase. Circumstances in which ICE might not pursue proceedings include  a legally insufficient NTA; an alien\u2019s eligibility for an immigration benefit,  such as lawful permanent residency; and an alien\u2019s serving as a witness in  a criminal investigation or prosecution. In these specific cases, ICE  attorneys can exercise discretion not to pursue proceedings by asking the  immigration court to terminate removal proceedings if the NTA has been  filed with the court. ICE OPLA guidance also permits ICE attorneys to take  steps to resolve a case in immigration court for purposes of judicial  economy, efficiency of process, or to promote justice. Examples in the  guidance include cases involving sympathetic humanitarian circumstances  like an alien with a U.S. citizen child with a serious medical condition or  disability, or an alien or close family member who is undergoing treatment  for a potentially life-threatening disease.", "ICE policy states that DRO may exercise discretion and grant some form  of relief to the alien, such as a stay of removal and deferred action at the  final phase of the process. A stay of removal is specifically authorized by  statute and constitutes a decision that removal of an alien should not  immediately proceed. Deferred action gives a case a lower removal  priority, but is not an entitlement for the alien to remain in the United  States. While some aliens could be granted a stay or deferred action by  DRO field office managers, DRO officers told us that DRO seeks to  execute removal orders in the vast majority of cases. DRO officers in field  offices told us that they could recall only a handful of cases when DRO  officers did not execute a removal order after it was issued by an  immigration judge.

Examples in the guidance include cases  involving sympathetic humanitarian circumstances like an alien with a  U.S. citizen child with a serious medical condition or disability, or an alien  or close family member who is undergoing treatment for a potentially life- threatening disease. However, this memo is directed at Chief Counsel  attorneys, who do not have the authority to initiate removal proceedings.  Instead, only supervisory DRO and OI officers can initiate removals, and  as a result the memo is not clearly applicable to them.", "In addition, DHS, OI, DRO, and OPLA have also issued their own separate  memorandums that guide officers\u2019 actions at different points of the  apprehension and removal process. Each memorandum is generally  directed to officers and attorneys under the respective ICE unit that issues  it, resulting in a number of memos distributed via a number of different  mechanisms within each ICE unit. These memorandums do not offer  comprehensive guidance on exercising discretion for aliens with  humanitarian circumstances or aliens who are not the primary targets of  ICE investigations. For example, OI issued a memo in May 2006, which  instructs officers to schedule appointments as a last resort for juvenile  aliens, elderly aliens, or aliens with health conditions to be processed at a  later date, rather than apprehend these aliens at the time of the encounter  or mail them an NTA. This guidance addresses important humanitarian  issues, but it is only directed to ICE officers who are responding to calls  from local law enforcement agencies. Furthermore, it does not define or  fully delineate circumstances that might constitute \u201clast resort.\u201d Another  memo issued by DHS in October 2004 provides officers and supervisors  with flexibility on detaining aliens (who are not subject to mandatory  detention) depending on the circumstances of the case, such as available  bed space. However, this memo does not offer specific guidance on  determining detention for aliens with humanitarian circumstances or  aliens who are not primary targets of ICE investigations.", "In addition to ICE field operational manuals and various memorandums,  an OI headquarters official told us that ICE has recently instituted a  worksite enforcement operational guidebook to assist in the proper  planning, execution, and reporting of worksite enforcement operations.  Our review of this guidebook showed that it discusses, among other  things, operational planning and coordination, including instructions on  reporting requirements at the arrest site and working with other ICE units,  like DRO.  However, although ICE plans to regularly update its worksite  enforcement operational guidebook based on lessons learned from past  worksite operations, the current guidebook that ICE provided us in August  2007 does not include any guidance about how officers should factor  humanitarian issues into their decision making during the apprehension  and removal process. Finally, in our review of the worksite enforcement  operational guidebook, we did not find guidance to inform officers\u2019  exercise of discretion on whom to stop, question, and arrest when  initiating the removal process\u2014guidance that was also lacking in the  various operational manuals and memorandums.", "In our review of documents from 26 OI field offices, we also noted that  only 3 of these field offices have developed local guidance to guide  officers\u2019 discretion in the initial phases of the apprehension and removal  process. However, the local guidance we reviewed is not comprehensive  because the 3 offices do not have guidance that covers the use of  discretion throughout the phases of the alien apprehension and removal  process when officers can exercise discretion. For example, 1 of the 3  offices has guidance on scheduling appointments for future processing for  aliens with humanitarian concerns. Another office has guidance that  covers factors to consider when exercising discretion for cases involving  humanitarian issues as well as guidance on deciding whether to detain  aliens who are not investigation targets."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Current ICE Operations Present a Need for Guidance on Humanitarian Issues and Aliens Who Are Not ICE Targets", "paragraphs": ["ICE has recently expanded its worksite enforcement and fugitive  operations, increasing the probability that officers in the field will have to  exercise discretion in their encounters with aliens who present  humanitarian issues or aliens who were not the targets of their  investigations\u2014particularly noncriminal aliens. With these expanded  operations, the need for up to date and comprehensive guidance to reduce  the risk of improper decision making becomes increasingly important.  According to ICE data, in fiscal year 2006, ICE made, through its worksite  enforcement operations, 716 criminal arrests, which include aliens subject  to removal who are charged with criminal violations, and 3,667  administrative arrests, which refer to alien workers who are unlawfully  present in the United States but have not been charged with criminal  violations. These data show a sharp increase from fiscal year 2005, as  noted in figure 2. Through July 2007 of fiscal year 2007, ICE made 742  criminal arrests and 3,651 administrative arrests in its worksite operations;  these arrests surpassed the combined arrests for worksite enforcement  operations from fiscal year 2002 to fiscal year 2005. According to a senior  ICE headquarters official, from fiscal year 2003 through the third quarter  of fiscal year 2007, ICE has also experienced over a six-fold increase in the  number of new officers dedicated to worksite enforcement operations,  many of whom are temporarily assigned to worksite operations.", "ICE reported that it has also expanded fugitive operations and plans to  increase the number of fugitive operation teams from 18 in 2006 to 75 by  the end of fiscal year 2007. Annual performance goals for each of these  teams call for 1,000 apprehensions per team. As of April 27, 2007, ICE  officers had arrested 17,321 aliens through its fugitive operation teams in  fiscal year 2007, a 118 percent increase in arrests since fiscal year 2005.", "ICE\u2019s expanding worksite enforcement and fugitive operations both  present officers with circumstances that could require the use of  discretion, specifically cases that involve aliens with humanitarian issues  or aliens who are not ICE targets. Expanded fugitive operations may  increase the number of encounters that officers have with removable  aliens who are not the primary targets or priorities of ICE investigations.  For cases involving these aliens, additional guidance could provide ICE  with better assurance that its officers are equipped to exercise discretion  and prioritize enforcement activities appropriately.", "In large-scale worksite enforcement operations, officers have encountered  numerous aliens who have presented humanitarian issues. For this type of  case, comprehensive guidance on how to weigh relevant aspects of aliens\u2019  circumstances or humanitarian factors would provide ICE with enhanced  assurance that officers are best equipped to appropriately determine  whether aliens should be apprehended, how they should be charged, and  whether they should be detained.", "A recent large-scale worksite enforcement operation in Massachusetts  highlights the importance of having comprehensive and up to date  guidance to help inform officers\u2019 decision making when they encounter  aliens with humanitarian issues. In this operation, ICE officers  encountered aliens who had humanitarian issues, including aliens who  were primary caretakers of children and had to assess the totality of the  circumstances in numerous cases, in real time, to decide how to handle  each case in coordination with other entities, such as social service  agencies, state government, and local law enforcement. ICE issued a fact  sheet about this operation on its external Web site that discussed  difficulties in coordinating and communicating with these entities on  issues of operational plans, detention space, access to detainees, and  information about arrestees. The fact sheet noted that ICE arrested 362  removable aliens and transported over 200 of these aliens to detention  facilities in Texas due to a lack of bed space in Massachusetts. In addition,  60 aliens were initially released during administrative processing at the  time of the operation for child welfare or family health reasons, and  additional aliens were released later for these reasons. According to ICE  officials, another concern ICE officers face as they attempt to exercise  discretion is that these officers encounter aliens who sometimes do not  divulge their status as sole caregivers for children. Complex environments  like the one described here demonstrate the need for up to date and  comprehensive guidance that supports ICE\u2019s operational objectives and  use government resources in the most effective and efficient manner."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "No Mechanism Is in Place to Help Ensure Officers Consistently Have Necessary Information Regarding Legal Developments", "paragraphs": ["Internal control standards state that effective communications should  occur in a broad sense with information flowing down, across, and up the  organization.

However, ICE has  not instituted a mechanism to ensure that legal developments are  consistently disseminated to ICE officers across all field offices.

ICE officials told us that, as part of worksite enforcement  operations, its officers make decisions in the field on a case-by-case basis  in a time-constrained environment. In recent worksite operations, officers  have apprehended thousands of aliens in operations conducted in various  cities across the nation. Our review of ICE\u2019s worksite enforcement training  curriculum and OI\u2019s field operational manual showed that ICE policy  outlines a key internal control\u2014after-action reports\u2014which are to  capture, among other things, information on significant or unusual  incidents or circumstances that may have occurred during an operation; a  listing of the number of aliens arrested, reasons for the release of detained  or arrested aliens, and any allegations of civil rights violations or other  complaints.

Moreover, since ICE has  experienced a more than six-fold increase (between fiscal year 2003 and  the third quarter of fiscal year 2007) in the number of new officers  participating in worksite enforcement operations, more officers are  making decisions and exercising discretion in these complex  environments.

For example, having comprehensive information on factors considered by  officers and actions taken by them (e.g., scheduling an appointment for  later processing, or mailing an NTA) to address aliens with humanitarian  issues could lead to revised policies and procedures.

Without a mechanism to catalog and collect information\u2014 agencywide\u2014on the exercise of discretion, ICE managers cannot analyze  trends to provide additional assurance that officer decision making  complies with established ICE policies and operational objectives, nor is  ICE positioned to refine operational approaches based on a review of best  practices across field offices.", "ICE relies on two databases to document officers\u2019 decisions regarding  alien apprehensions: (1) the Enforcement Case Tracking System  (ENFORCE), which is primarily used to collect alien biographical  information and removal option employed, such as voluntary departure or  an NTA, and (2) the Deportable Alien Control System (DACS), which is  used to track the location of detained aliens, as well as the status of aliens\u2019  immigration court hearings. However, headquarters officials told us that  the details of discretionary decisions (e.g., factors considered in deciding  whether to apprehend an alien or detain an alien, based on humanitarian  reasons) are not recorded in ENFORCE and DACS.

DHS and ICE concurred with the OIG\u2019s recommendation and  said that it would prepare a project plan for developing and deploying the  system in an expedited manner. Although DHS and ICE said that the new  system is to allow users to capture, search, and review information in  specific areas, including information on detention and removal case  details, the response was not specific about whether it would contain  information on the rationale for making these decisions.

Internal controls, like training, guidance, and monitoring  that are designed to help ICE ensure that its officers are well equipped to  consistently make decisions that support its operational objectives, are  crucial for ICE to help provide assurance that its officers exercise  discretion in a manner that protects the agency\u2019s integrity, advances its  mission, and provides the greatest value to the nation. Although ICE has  taken steps in the area of training to develop and retain officer skills, ICE\u2019s  guidance does not comprehensively address key aspects of the alien  apprehension and removal process, such as dealing with humanitarian  issues and aliens who are not investigation targets.

We also requested locally developed written guidance and policies and  procedures regarding alien apprehension and removal procedures from all  DRO, OI and Chief Counsel field offices. We received and reviewed locally  developed guidance from 13 of OI\u2019s 26 field offices and 12 of Chief  Counsel\u2019s 26 field offices. The purpose of this review was to identify the  range of policies and guidance developed by field units that we did not  capture as part of our nonprobability sample of ICE field offices. We did  not receive locally developed guidance from DRO\u2019s 23 field offices, as  DRO headquarters officials told us that DRO field offices do not rely on  locally developed guidance and instead rely on national policies and  memorandums. As part of our work at the ICE field offices we visited, we  also discussed and identified guidance and training provided to officers  and attorneys with regard to the guidance and information available to  them when exercising discretion during the apprehension and removal  process, including guidance about nontargeted aliens, humanitarian  issues, and updates on legal developments. We then compared the national  and local guidance, memorandums, and training materials in place with  internal control standards to determine whether these controls were  consistent with the standards. In addition, we met with headquarters  officials responsible for the development of policy and training of field  unit operations for OI and DRO and we interviewed OPLA officials  responsible for developing policy and training for Chief Counsel Offices to  discern their role in developing and providing guidance and information to  ICE officers, attorneys, supervisors, and managers involved in the alien  apprehension and removal process.", "To address what internal controls ICE has designed to oversee and  monitor officer decision making during the alien apprehension and  removal process, we reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and field  operational manuals. We also interviewed OI, DRO and OPLA  headquarters officials, field officers, and field attorneys to identify the  types of oversight that are in place. We examined what controls were in  place to provide assurance that removal decisions are consistent with  established policies, procedures, and guidelines across field offices, and  examined whether these controls were designed to be consistent with the  internal control standards. We did not test ICE controls in place as part of  our review. We also interviewed headquarters officials responsible for  overseeing ICE\u2019s enforcement operations to examine controls in place to  monitor enforcement activities. We met with ICE headquarters officials  responsible for overseeing ICE databases containing information pertinent  to alien apprehension and removal outcomes, and we inquired about  information collected in these databases regarding officer decision  making, including cases involving humanitarian issues and cases involving  aliens who are not targets of ICE investigations. We also interviewed ICE  officers, supervisors, and management personnel at the ICE field offices  we visited to identify the types of supervisory reviews and approvals  required for decisions made by ICE officers and attorneys and the  documentation to be reviewed and approved by supervisors in regard to  these decisions. We reviewed data on alien apprehensions for worksite  enforcement operations, for fiscal year 2002 through fiscal year 2007, to  identify trends in ICE\u2019s expanded enforcement efforts. We also reviewed  data on alien apprehensions resulting from fugitive operations. To  determine the reliability of the data, we interviewed headquarters officials  responsible for overseeing and verifying the data, reviewed existing  documentation regarding the data, and interviewed headquarters officials  responsible for tracking statistics pertaining to the data.", "We conducted our work between August 2006 and September 2007 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the above, John F.
