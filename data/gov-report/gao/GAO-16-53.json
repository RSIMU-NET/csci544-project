According to GAO's analysis of state reported data, of the approximately 69.8 million individuals recorded as enrolled in Medicaid, about 60.1 million were traditionally eligible enrollees, comprising about 86 percent of the total; about 7.5 million (11 percent of all Medicaid enrollees) were PPACA-expansion enrollees, and 2.3 million (3 percent of all Medicaid enrollees) were state-expansion enrollees. With regard to expenditures, states had reported $481.77 billion in Medicaid expenditures for services in calendar year 2014.

This creates a gap in efforts to ensure that only eligible individuals are enrolled into Medicaid and that state expenditures are correctly matched by the federal government. In addition, CMS reviews of states' expenditures do not use information obtained from the reviews of state eligibility determination errors to better target its review of Medicaid expenditures for the different eligibility groups. An accurate determination of these different eligibility groups is critical to ensuring that only eligible individuals are enrolled, that they are enrolled in the correct eligibility group, and that states' expenditures are appropriately matched with federal funds for Medicaid enrollees, consistent with federal internal control standards.

Historically, Medicaid eligibility has been limited to  certain categories of low-income individuals\u2014such as children, parents,  pregnant women, persons with disabilities, and individuals age 65 and  older. However, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act  (PPACA), enacted on March 23, 2010, states may opt to expand their  Medicaid programs by covering nearly all adults with incomes at or below  133 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL) beginning January 1,  2014. Twenty-six states and the District of Columbia opted to expand  their Medicaid programs for 2014. States that choose to expand their  programs receive an increased federal match for expenditures incurred  as a result of providing services to individuals whom the state had not  previously covered. Some of these states may also receive an increased  federal matching rate for another eligibility group, provided the state  covered this eligibility group as of December 1, 2009, for example,  through a state-funded expansion. In order to receive a federal match for  expenditures, states are required to provide to the Centers for Medicare &  Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency within the Department of Health  and Human Services (HHS) that oversees Medicaid, data on Medicaid  enrollment and expenditures for review. In addition to expanding eligibility  standards, PPACA also required the establishment of a coordinated  eligibility and enrollment process for Medicaid and the health insurance  exchanges to streamline the eligibility determination process. These  changes, which shift the process toward a more automated approach,  necessitated the adoption of new policies and information technology  systems by the states that allow for the exchange of data to ensure that  applicants are enrolled in the program for which they are eligible,  regardless of the program for which they applied. During fiscal year 2013,  Medicaid covered about 72 million individuals at a cost of approximately  $431.1 billion, with the federal share of $247.7 billion comprising 57  percent of costs, and the state share of $183.4 billion comprising 43  percent.

States will also receive an FMAP above the state\u2019s regular match  for their Medicaid expenditures for the state-expansion enrollees, ranging  from 75-92 percent in 2014.

In its written  comments, HHS highlighted the actions the department has taken to  ensure the accuracy of Medicaid eligibility determinations made through  the exchanges, citing the multi-layer verification processes in place to  assess applicant eligibility, and also noted that it conducts reviews of  expenditure data submitted by the states. HHS agreed with our first  recommendation and agreed with the concept of our second  recommendation.", "HHS concurred with our first recommendation to conduct reviews on  federal Medicaid eligibility determinations to ascertain the accuracy of  these determinations and institute corrective action plans where  necessary. HHS noted that federal eligibility determinations in two states  are currently being reviewed by the eligibility support contractor, and  stated that federal determinations will be included as part of the future  PERM eligibility review. However, the eligibility component of the PERM  will not be resumed until 2018, and in the interim, without a systematic  assessment of federal eligibility determinations, we remain concerned  that CMS lacks a mechanism to identify and correct federal eligibility  determination errors and associated payments. Given the program  benefits and federal dollars involved, we urge CMS to look for an  opportunity to identify erroneous federal eligibility determinations and  implement corrective actions as soon as possible.", "With regard to our second recommendation, HHS agreed that ensuring  accurate eligibility determinations and correct expenditure reporting is an  important safeguard for the Medicaid program but did not state whether it  specifically concurred with the recommendation. HHS further noted that  eligibility and expenditure reviews are two distinct, but complementary  oversight processes, with different timeframes. In consideration of HHS\u2019s  comments, we adjusted our recommendation to take into account the  differences in the timeframes for these two types of reviews. We continue  to believe that using the information obtained from state and federal  eligibility reviews to inform the agency\u2019s review of expenditures for  different eligibility groups will help ensure that expenditures are reported  correctly and matched appropriately. Eligibility reviews are conducted on  a different timeframe than the expenditure reviews, and because states  are required to identify errors and develop corrective action plans to  address these errors, it is anticipated that, over time, the eligibility reviews  will support HHS\u2019s efforts to appropriately match state expenditures.", "HHS\u2019s comments are reproduced in appendix I.

These data included information from new  enrollment forms developed by CMS that are used by states to report the  number of enrollees by eligibility type, as well as expenditure data, to  CMS by means of the Quarterly Medicaid Statement of Expenditures for  the Medical Assistance Program\u2014also known as the form CMS-64\u2014 within the Medicaid Budget and Expenditure System (MBES). We  reviewed data for each quarter in calendar year 2014 and relevant  guidance and documentation where available.

States may report expenditures up to a  period of two years (possibly more) after the date of the original service  payment.

For example, at the time of our review of the data, of the 28 states that had  expanded Medicaid, 21 had reported enrollment data for PPACA-expansion eligible  enrollees for December 2014 and 14 had reported enrollment data for the state-expansion  individuals for December 2014. Some states had reported data for both groups.", "We obtained enrollment and expenditure data for calendar year 2014\u2014 the first full year that states had the option of expanding Medicaid under  PPACA. This includes the first through fourth quarters of the 2014  calendar year (ending March, June, September, and December 2014,  respectively). Because data are reported for each month, we use the last  month of the quarter to report for that quarter. For example, we used the  numbers reported for March 2014 as the numbers reported by states for  the first quarter of 2014. We extracted these data from the MBES on June  2, 2015. We reviewed the data for reasonableness and consistency,  including screening for missing data, outliers, and obvious errors.
