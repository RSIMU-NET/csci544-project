GAO reviewed budget data for Midway from fiscal years 2009 through 2015; reviewed laws, policies, and regulations on historic preservation; examined public visitation plans, emergency landing data, and the use of the airfield; and interviewed FWS, FAA, and Advisory Council on Historic Preservation officials and other stakeholders."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["According to officials in the Department of the Interior's U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), operations funding for Midway Atoll (Midway) has decreased in recent years and project-specific funding has varied. Specifically, budget officials said that FWS, after increasing the funding allocated to Midway's operations to more than $4 million by fiscal year 2011, decreased Midway's allocation by more than $1 million by fiscal years 2012 and 2013. These officials said that the lower allocation led to suspension of public visitation on Midway in November 2012, which, in turn, decreased operations funding available from fees collected for services such as lodging. Midway has also received funding for specific projects, such as lead-based paint abatement. In addition, under an interagency agreement, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has reimbursed FWS up to $3 million per year for the direct costs of operating Midway's Henderson Airfield and provided additional funds for capital improvement projects, such as resurfacing runways.", "FWS has maintained most historic properties on Midway but has demolished others without providing for public notice and involvement, which is not consistent with the regulations implementing section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. A 2000 order by the Secretary of the Interior directs FWS to administer Midway in accordance with the law. Federal agencies must provide the public with notice of and opportunity to comment on agency actions that may affect historic properties. Since 2012, FWS has demolished seven historic properties on Midway as part of the agency's removal of lead-based paint and taken another action adversely affecting historic properties without providing adequate public notification, including directly notifying parties that have previously expressed interest in historic preservation issues on Midway, and an opportunity for public comment. An FWS official said that the extent of such notification may vary based on the size of the actions. However, officials with the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation said that groups known to have a high level of interest should be notified directly. Without providing public notification, including ensuring that such parties are notified about future actions that may adversely affect historic properties, FWS will not have reasonable assurance that it is adequately seeking public comment and input under the section 106 process.", "Since the suspension of public visitation to Midway in 2012, FWS faces multiple challenges relating to personnel, infrastructure, supplies, and transportation access to reestablish the program. For example, the building used to house visitors is almost beyond the point of repair and renovation, according to a 2009 assessment of its condition. FWS officials estimated that $1.2 million in annual funding would be needed to reestablish a public visitation program and that additional funding would also be needed for start-up costs.", "Midway's Henderson Airfield serves as an emergency landing airport for aircraft in the mid-Pacific Ocean region and facilitates access to Midway and its surroundings. Under FAA regulations, air carriers must designate in their flight plans a certified airport for use in the event of an emergency during extended operations. Since 2003, there have been seven military and civilian emergency landings on Midway."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that FWS ensure that the public, including previously interested key parties, are notified about FWS actions on Midway that may have an adverse effect on historic properties.

Midway has undergone a number of transformations since it  was claimed by the United States in 1867, including to a relay station for  the trans-Pacific communication cable in the early 1900s and to host for a  U.S. Navy base that was the site of the Battle of Midway, a turning point  in World War II. As a result of its prior uses, Midway has more than  50 historic properties, some of which are contaminated with lead paint,  and an airport known as Henderson Airfield that is used as an emergency  landing airport for trans-Pacific flights and military aircraft. In addition,  Midway is part of the Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea Marine National Monument  and is the only location within the monument that has an airport and  facilities for people who visit the monument. Though remotely located in  the mid-Pacific\u2014about 1,300 miles from Honolulu\u2014Midway previously  had a public visitation program, which was discontinued in November  2012 for budgetary reasons.", "The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), within the Department of the  Interior, has managed the wildlife refuge on Midway since 1996, when the  Navy closed its base, and FWS co-manages the airport with the Federal  Aviation Administration (FAA) within the Department of Transportation.  The executive order transferring management of Midway to FWS directs  FWS, among other things, to maintain the atoll\u2019s historical significance  and provide opportunities for scientific research, environmental education,  and certain recreational activities consistent with the executive order on  management and general public use of refuges. In September 2000, the  Secretary of the Interior designated the Midway Atoll National Wildlife  Refuge as the Battle of Midway National Memorial and directed FWS to  administer, protect, and develop it in accordance with the National  Historic Preservation Act, among other laws. Under section 106 of the  act and its implementing regulations, federal agencies undertaking  actions that might affect historic properties are to consult with state  historic preservation officers and other interested parties (i.e.,  stakeholders) to assess the effects of the undertakings on historic  properties and seek ways to avoid, minimize, or mitigate any adverse  effects on historic properties. In addition, under the regulations  implementing section 106, federal agencies are to provide the public with  notice about such undertakings and their potential effects on historic  properties and seek public comment and input on resolving adverse  effects. Various stakeholders have raised concerns about the  maintenance of historic structures on Midway, as well as protection of  wildlife from lead paint and other hazards, and discontinuation of the  public visitation program.", "You asked us to review FWS\u2019s management of Midway. This report  (1) describes funding for operations and projects on Midway for fiscal  years 2009 to 2015; (2) examines how FWS has maintained historic  properties on Midway and the extent to which it has consulted key  stakeholders and sought public comment; (3) identifies challenges, if any,  FWS faces in reestablishing a public visitation program; and (4) describes  the use of Henderson Airfield as an emergency landing airport and  access point for the Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea Marine National Monument.", "To describe funding, we reviewed budget data for Midway over the last  7 years, for fiscal years 2009 through 2015. FWS officials told us that  because of the agency\u2019s document retention policy it does not have pre- 2009 data. We assessed the reliability of these data and found them to be  of undetermined reliability for purposes of our report. For example, we  reviewed the annual external audit report of the Department of the  Interior\u2019s financial database for fiscal year 2015, which covers FWS data;  this report noted that internal control deficiencies related to financial  reporting resulted in a lack of assurance that the department\u2019s financial  data were correct. As a result, we relied on information from interviews  with agency budget officials to generally describe funding.", "To examine how FWS has maintained its historic properties, the extent to  which the agency has consulted key stakeholders, and any challenges it  faces in reestablishing a public visitation program, we undertook several  data collection methods. We visited Midway in April 2015 to observe and  document in photographs and video the condition of existing properties,  which we identified from current FWS asset lists, historic preservation  plans, and other documents. We reviewed FWS management and visitor  services plans for Midway as a national wildlife refuge and as a part of the  marine national monument. We reviewed laws, regulations, and policies  regarding wildlife refuges, historic properties, and hazardous substances,  including the National Historic Preservation Act and the Comprehensive  Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980  (CERCLA). We interviewed FWS officials on Midway as well as the  agency\u2019s Pacific Islands Refuges and Monuments Office in Honolulu and  its Region 1 office in Portland, Oregon, about the management and  oversight of Midway. We interviewed officials from the other co-trustees of  the marine national monument\u2014specifically, the National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), within the Department of  Commerce, and the state of Hawaii, through its Department of Land and  Natural Resources\u2014regarding the management of Midway and the  permitting process for activities in the marine national monument. We  interviewed officials from the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation  concerning historic preservation requirements affecting federal agencies.  We also interviewed representatives of the four key stakeholder groups  who have participated in public visitation programs to Midway in the past,  before or after the designation of the Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea Marine  National Monument in 2006.", "To describe the use of Henderson Airfield, we reviewed FWS and FAA  reports, policies, and regulations on the operation of Henderson Airfield  and airports designated by FAA for emergency landings. We also  interviewed FWS and FAA officials regarding the agencies\u2019 roles and  responsibilities in providing an emergency landing site on Midway.  In addition, we interviewed a nonprobability sample of airline industry  representatives\u2014of a leading aircraft manufacturer, the largest airline  pilots association, and the largest organization representing commercial  airlines\u2014regarding the use of Midway as an emergency landing site.  Because this was a nonprobability sample, it does not allow us to  generalize these views to either a segment of or to the entire airline  industry. However, these interviews provide examples of the views of  some industry representatives.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2015 to June 2016  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives.

The atoll is roughly 5 miles in diameter  and includes three islands\u2014Sand Island (1,117 acres), Eastern Island  (336 acres), and Spit Island (7 acres). Nearly 3 million birds nest much  of each year on Midway, including albatross (Laysan, black-footed, and  short-tailed), Bonin petrels, and Laysan ducks.", "The Laysan albatross is a large bird, with a  wing span of up to 6 feet. Beautiful in flight, but  ungainly in their movement on land, the  albatross were called \u201cgooney birds\u201d by those  stationed on Midway Atoll (Midway) during  World War II. In 1997, when the Navy  ceremonially transferred Midway to the U.S.  Fish and Wildlife Service, the Secretary of the  Navy cited the changing mission as \u201ctrading  guns for goonies.\u201d Laysan albatross are  monogamous. If one mate should die, the  other will likely create a new pair bond.  Seventy-one percent of the world\u2019s population  nests on Midway. Laysan albatross feed  primarily at night on anything that floats on the  surface of the water, such as squid and fish,  and also on marine debris, with an estimated  5 tons of plastic being accidently fed to chicks  each year. Their typical life span is 12 to  40 years. The world\u2019s oldest known banded  bird in the wild is a Laysan albatross named  Wisdom (left in above photo with her mate,  Akeakamai), who is at least 65 years old and  has likely raised at least 37 chicks, according  to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.", "The seasons on Midway are marked by the annual arrival of the first  albatross in late October, and their courting, mating, nesting, and fledging  activities until their departure in July. Green turtles, spinner dolphins, and  endangered Hawaiian monk seals also frequent Midway\u2019s lagoon. See  figure 1 for a map of the Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea Marine National  Monument showing the location of Midway, which lies about 1,300 miles  from Honolulu.", "The first westerner to discover the atoll arrived in July 1859. Then in  1867, the Navy formally claimed the islands for the United States to  establish a coaling station, supply depot, and emergency refuge for ships  traveling between the West Coast of the United States and eastern Asia.  In 1903, an executive order placed Midway under the jurisdiction and  control of the Navy. Construction of a naval air station began in 1940,  and the station was commissioned on August 1, 1941. The naval air  station included barracks; officers\u2019 housing; a theater; a seaplane hangar;  a three-runway airfield on Eastern Island; and a defensive system,  including gun emplacements, ammunition storage, and pillboxes.", "On December 7, 1941\u2014the day Pearl Harbor was attacked\u2014Midway was  attacked by Japanese ships, causing casualties and extensive damage to  buildings, including the seaplane hangar. During the Battle of Midway,  fought June 4 through 6, 1942, the Japanese launched an attack against  Midway in the hope of engaging and destroying the U.S. aircraft carriers  and occupying Midway. U.S. fleet aircraft ambushed the Japanese fleet  north of the islands, thereby inflicting heavy losses (four aircraft carriers),  an action credited with turning the tide of the war in the Pacific.", "Following World War II, the Navy retained jurisdiction over Midway and  maintained it as a naval air station, which was supported by a town of up  to 5,000 civilians and military service families. In the 1970s and 1980s,  the Navy began downsizing operations on Midway. In 1988, the Navy  invited FWS to manage the atoll\u2019s extensive wildlife resources, and  Midway became an overlay national wildlife refuge since the Navy  retained primary jurisdiction. In 1993, the Defense Base Closure and  Realignment Commission recommended that the mission of the naval air  station on Midway be eliminated. The Navy began operations to close  the air station, thereby beginning a transition in primary mission from  national defense to wildlife conservation.", "Figure 2 shows key events and legislation in Midway\u2019s history, including  the timing of Midway\u2019s historic and other designations. (See app. II for a  fuller chronology of Midway events.)", "As part of the base closure process, the Navy conducted environmental  studies that indicated widespread contamination based on introduction of  a variety of man-made materials to the environment and the native  wildlife, such as the presence of lead-based paint in soil, which can be  toxic to birds on Midway (e.g., up to 3 percent of Laysan albatross  hatchlings die from lead poisoning each year). In addition, the Navy  conducted cultural resources surveys in 1993 and 1994 that identified  buildings, structures, objects, and sites on both Sand and Eastern  Islands. Based on these surveys, 78 properties were determined to be  historic properties eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic  Places, including 9 properties previously designated as the Midway  National Historic Landmark.", "Under section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, federal  agencies are to consider the effects of their undertakings on historic  properties that are listed in or eligible for listing in the National Register  of Historic Places prior to the approval of the undertaking. For such  undertakings, the regulations implementing section 106 require federal  agencies to consult with the relevant state historic preservation officer,  individuals, or organizations that request and/or are invited to be  consulting parties and others. Since Midway is an unincorporated  territory and has no state historic preservation officer, the Advisory  Council on Historic Preservation instructed FWS officials to consult with  the state historic preservation office for Hawaii, which is the nearest  state.", "The section 106 consultation is a process of seeking, discussing, and  considering the views of other participants and, where feasible, seeking  agreement with them on resolving adverse effects on historic properties  and other matters in the section 106 process before a federal agency  approves an undertaking. If the consultation results in an agreement on  how to resolve the adverse effects, the federal agency usually enters into  a memorandum of agreement (MOA) with the relevant state historic  preservation officer, which the regulations require the agency to provide  to the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation after it is signed and  before approving the undertaking.", "In addition to consultation, the regulations implementing section 106  require agencies to provide an opportunity for the public to express  views on resolving the undertaking\u2019s adverse effects. According to the  regulations, the views of the public are essential to informed federal  decision making in the section 106 process. Moreover, the regulations  require agencies to seek and consider the views of the public in a manner  that reflects, among other things, the nature and complexity of the  undertaking and its effects on historic properties and the likely interest of  the public in the effects on historic properties. The regulations also  require agencies, in consultation with state historic preservation officers,  to plan for involving the public in the section 106 process.", "In lieu of conducting multiple section 106 processes, federal agencies  may negotiate programmatic agreements to govern the resolution of  adverse effects from multiple undertakings. The regulations  implementing section 106 require agencies, when developing  programmatic agreements, to consult with, as appropriate, the relevant  state historic preservation officer and others and provide for appropriate  public participation. In 1996, the Navy and FWS along with the Advisory  Council on Historic Preservation signed a programmatic agreement  directing how Midway\u2019s 78 historic properties were to be treated during  the closure of the Naval Air Facility and transfer of these properties. The  agreement defined the following six levels of treatment for the  properties:", "Reuse: The agreement identified 23 properties to be used and  maintained in support of refuge operations, including the officers\u2019  housing, theater, barracks, shops, and industrial facilities.", "Secure: The agreement identified 13 properties to be secured by the  Navy to minimize hazards to wildlife and people, including the power  plant/command center that was shelled on December 7, 1941, and  the cable station complex.", "Leave as is: The agreement identified 20 properties that would be left  in \u201cas is\u201d condition and would not be used under refuge management,  other than for interpretive purposes, including the runways on Eastern  Island and various bunkers, pillboxes, and gun batteries.", "Fill: The agreement indicated that four properties would be filled with  sand, including pillboxes on Sand and Eastern Islands and two  ammunition storage huts.", "Demolish: The agreement called for demolishing 15 historic  properties that were of secondary historical importance, were in  very poor condition, or were redundant to other resources being  maintained; the properties included a motor pool building, a laundry,  the naval operating base armory, and airport storage buildings.", "Relocate: The agreement listed three properties to be moved to  enhance their protection and interpretation: a torpedo and inert bomb,  submarine net, and metal pillbox.", "The Navy transferred to FWS the 63 historic properties that remained  after the 15 demolitions as well as a number of buildings and other  infrastructure (i.e., equipment and related buildings that provide  electricity, water, and other support services) that had been used to  support the base. On June 30, 1997, the last Navy personnel departed.  (See app. IV for pictures of all the historic properties in existence in 2015  and selected other properties on Midway.)", "When Midway was transferred from the Navy in 1996, Executive Order  13022 directed FWS to provide opportunities for scientific research,  environmental education, and certain recreational activities in a manner  consistent with the executive order on management and general public  use of refuges. In 1996, FWS entered into a cooperative agreement with  the Midway Phoenix Corporation for support of a public use program,  which required the corporation to operate Henderson Airfield; maintain  the harbor; operate, maintain, and/or provide utilities (i.e., electrical  system, sewage, television, and telephone); implement a grounds  maintenance plan; and provide basic and emergency medical care. In  addition, the agreement authorized the Midway Phoenix Corporation to  provide food service, lodging, and maritime rescue services. After the  Midway Phoenix Corporation discontinued operations on Midway in 2002,  FWS did not operate an ongoing public visitation program but allowed  occasional visitation, primarily through tour providers and cruise ships.  Subsequently, in accordance with its regulations and guidance  implementing the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act of  1997, FWS determined that a number of recreational uses were both  appropriate and compatible with the refuge\u2019s wildlife conservation  purposes, such as wildlife observation and photography, environmental  education, interpretation, snorkeling, and diving. FWS reestablished a  public visitation program in 2007 and then suspended public use in  November 2012. (See app. III for additional information on public  visitation to Midway.)", "In February 2010, FWS and the other co-trustees of the  Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea Marine National Monument received a notice of  intent to sue from a nongovernmental organization for violations of  several laws on Midway because, among other things, the lead-based  paint used to paint some buildings in the 1950s and 1960s was causing  lead poisoning in some birds. FWS agreed in a 2012 settlement with the  nongovernmental organization to complete, over the course of 7 years,  a \u201cnon-time critical removal action\u201d under CERCLA, which governs the  cleanup of releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances, to  address the lead-based paint on buildings. The regulations  implementing CERCLA require removal actions to comply with applicable  requirements under federal and state laws, among other things. FWS  determined that the National Historic Preservation Act was an applicable  requirement for removal actions involving historic properties on Midway  and decided that it would work with the Hawaii State Historic Preservation  Officer to address the removal action\u2019s adverse effects on historic  properties. When completing removal actions that are not time critical, the  regulations require federal agencies to publish a document containing the  analysis of removal alternatives, provide for at least a 30-day public  comment period on the document, and issue a decision document  selecting a removal alternative that responds to the public comments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FWS Officials Reported That Midway\u2019s Operations Funding Has Decreased in Recent Years and Project- Specific Funding Has Varied", "paragraphs": ["The Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge\u2019s funding consists of both  operational and project-specific funding.

The 1996 programmatic agreement signed by the Navy, FWS,  and Advisory Council on Historic Preservation covered actions the Navy  would take before departing Midway, such as securing certain properties  from intrusion by wildlife or demolishing properties that were badly  deteriorated, and specified that FWS would reuse and maintain 23 of the  63 historic properties that would remain on Midway after the Navy\u2019s  departure. As required by the programmatic agreement, FWS  developed its first historic preservation plan in 1999, followed by an  updated plan in 2010. The 1999 plan included the following five  management categories for the properties, all of which were consistent  with the earlier agreement with the Navy: reuse (23 properties), secure  (13 properties), leave as is (20 properties), fill with sand (4 properties),  and relocate (3 properties). A sixth category, the demolition of  15 properties, was carried out by the Navy prior to transferring the  management of Midway to FWS. The 2010 updated historic preservation  plan revised the management categories to account for issues that arose  since 1999 and to conform with the Secretary of the Interior\u2019s Standards  for the Treatment of Historic Properties.", "Since 1996, FWS has reused 19 of the 23 properties planned for reuse,  in some cases rehabilitating them. For example, as of June 2015, FWS  rehabilitated and was using as housing for residents structures that once  provided housing for Navy officers (see table 1). In addition, FWS put into  use 3 properties, including a paint shop, which had been categorized as  \u201cleave as is\u201d by the 1996 programmatic agreement, because the agency  had a need for them.", "Since 2012, FWS has also demolished seven historic properties\u2013\u2013actions  that were not contemplated by the 1996 programmatic agreement or the  2010 historic preservation plan (see table 2 and figs. 3, 4, and 5)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FWS Has Not Adequately Notified the Public, Including Key Parties, under the Section 106 Process", "paragraphs": ["For undertakings with adverse effects on historic properties not  contemplated by the 1996 programmatic agreement and 2010 historic  preservation plan, FWS is to complete the section 106 process before  deciding to undertake such actions but FWS did not do so for four  undertakings affecting eight historic properties. The four undertakings  included demolishing seven buildings and rehabilitating a cable station  building with materials from three other cable station buildings that were  dismantled (see table 3).", "For all four of these undertakings, we found that FWS did not adequately  notify the public and seek comments and input on the adverse effects the  undertakings would have on the historic properties.

However, FWS did not  directly notify key parties that were involved in prior historic  preservation matters on Midway, such as the 2010 Historic  Preservation Plan. For example, FWS did not directly inform the  International Midway Memorial Foundation and other parties that had  served on the defunct Battle of Midway National Memorial Advisory  Committee about the CERCLA removal action. According to  Advisory Council on Historic Preservation officials, because FWS  knew these parties had an interest in historic preservation issues at  Midway, the method of notifying these parties about these  undertakings with adverse effects on historic properties was not  sufficient under section 106 unless these parties received the notice  directly.", "For the undertaking that demolished the SK1 warehouse, the  document containing the analysis of removal alternatives made  available to the public in January 2011 did not include demolition as  an alternative, so the public and key parties did not have any notice  about FWS\u2019s decision to demolish it, either under the CERCLA or the  section 106 process.", "As a result, FWS\u2019s decisions regarding all four undertakings that had  adverse effects on historic properties were not informed by public  comment and input, straining its relationship with at least one key  stakeholder. According to the regulations implementing section 106 of  the National Historic Preservation Act, the views of the public are  essential to informed federal decision making in the section 106 process.", "For all four of these undertakings, FWS consulted with the Hawaii State  Historic Preservation Office and the Historic Hawaii Foundation but did  not receive requests from other interested parties to participate in the  consultations. However, since the public and potentially interested parties  did not have adequate notice about these four planned undertakings and  section 106 consultations, it is not clear that they would have known to  request participation in the consultations. FWS notified three parties for  the four undertakings, which is fewer than for other agreements, plans, or  activities. For example, FWS and the Navy notified seven parties about  the 1996 programmatic agreement, and FWS distributed the 2010  Historic Preservation Plan for Midway directly to 10 parties. According to  Advisory Council on Historic Preservation officials, it was unlikely that  these key parties could have requested to participate in these  consultations since, as described above, they did not have adequate  notice of the planned undertakings.", "In addition, according to Advisory Council on Historic Preservation  officials, the intent of the section 106 consultation requirements is for  such consultations to inform the agency\u2019s decision making. However,  FWS did not conduct consultations before approving three of the four  undertakings. While FWS consulted with the Hawaii State Historic  Preservation Officer and the Hawaii Historic Foundation and entered  into an MOA with the former to resolve the adverse effects of the 2009  undertaking on the cable station buildings, FWS did not conduct section  106 consultations before issuing its final CERCLA action memorandum  selecting demolition for the four cable station buildings and the two  Marine barracks in July 2011. The memorandum acknowledged that  consultation had not occurred but stated that FWS was to work with the  Hawaii State Historic Preservation Officer to reach agreement on how to  treat these buildings.", "Subsequently, FWS consulted with the Hawaii State Historic Preservation  Office and Hawaii Historic Foundation about the CERLCA removal  actions demolishing the four cable station buildings, Marine barracks, and  SK1 warehouse. The consultations resulted in FWS and the Hawaii State  Historic Preservation Officer signing MOAs for the demolition of the cable  station buildings and SK1 warehouse but not for demolition of the Marine  barracks. However, according to an FWS official, consultations over the  Marine barracks lasted 5 months and in 2012 resulted in a draft MOA  between FWS and the Hawaii State Historic Preservation Office. Although  neither party formally signed the agreement at that time, they began to  implement its provisions.", "These four undertakings were the first with adverse effects on historic  properties under FWS management of Midway, according to FWS. But as  properties continue to age and deteriorate in the future, FWS may need to  take additional actions that have adverse effects on historic properties.  Before approving such actions, FWS will need to complete the section  106 process detailed in regulations, which includes planning, in  consultation with the state historic preservation officer, for involving the  public in the process. An FWS official who works on historic preservation  issues on Midway noted that the extent of public notification and  involvement can vary based on the size of the undertaking. However,  officials with the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation pointed out  that another factor in the regulations that should be considered in  determining the extent of seeking and considering the views of the public  is the likely level of public interest in the action. They stated that the  Midway interest groups that are known to have a high level of interest in  Midway should have been notified of these undertakings and FWS should  have sought and considered their views.", "FWS officials told us that they are taking steps to better coordinate with  stakeholders on future actions. For example, as agreed with the Hawaii  State Historic Preservation Office, FWS is consulting with stakeholders on  developing a programmatic agreement for the treatment of a group of  18 historic buildings designed by architect Albert Kahn. According to an  FWS official, the intent of developing a programmatic agreement for all  the Kahn buildings is to consider actions taken on any of the buildings in  the context of all the historical buildings and to improve public  participation and standardize maintenance procedures and set priorities  for maintenance of the Kahn buildings. This programmatic agreement,  however, does not eliminate the need for FWS to complete the section  106 process, including notifying the public and providing an opportunity  for the public to express their views for future undertakings with adverse  effects on other historic properties that are outside of its scope. Without  ensuring that key parties that have previously expressed interest in  historic preservation issues on Midway are notified about future actions  that may have an adverse effect on historic properties, FWS will not have  reasonable assurance that it is adequately providing public notification  and an opportunity for public comment under the section 106 process."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FWS Faces Multiple Challenges in Reestablishing a Public Visitation Program on Midway", "paragraphs": ["FWS faces multiple challenges in reestablishing a public visitation  program on Midway, such as deteriorating infrastructure and infrequent  delivery of supplies.

The building that is available to  house visitors, known as Bachelor Officer Quarters Charlie Barracks, is  almost beyond the point of repairs and renovation, according to a  condition assessment conducted by contractors in 2009. During our 2015  site visit, we observed that the first floor of Charlie Barracks had  extensive water damage (see fig. 6). In addition, one of the guest rooms  on the second floor occupied by a GAO analyst had a leaking ceiling.  In 2009, a contractor estimated that updating and renovating Charlie  Barracks, which was constructed in 1957, could cost up to $14 million and  that replacing it could cost up to $20 million. According to FWS officials  we interviewed, the estimate for renovating Charlie Barracks is likely  understated, as the deterioration has continued since the completion of  the most recent assessment in 2009.", "In addition to providing accommodations, reestablishing a public visitation  program on Midway would likely entail increasing the capacity of existing  infrastructure systems to support visitors. Specifically, FWS and its  contractors operate and maintain the power system, water treatment and  distribution, facilities maintenance, waste management systems,  communications systems, and other operational necessities. Many of  these infrastructure systems were designed to accommodate the naval air  station and a population of up to 5,000 people and have deteriorated over  time. FWS has been replacing these systems to accommodate a  population of approximately 200 people. For example, in October 2007,  FWS installed a new fuel system with the capacity of up to  450,000 gallons to be used primarily for electricity generation. This new  system replaced an old fuel system with a capacity of about 4 million  gallons, which was deteriorating and was demolished in October 2015,  according to FWS officials.

The rats were  eradicated in the 1990s, and the Bonin petrel  population has rebounded with a current  population estimated at close to 1 million. The  petrels spend their days either in their burrows  or at sea. Starting at sundown, they emerge  from their burrows and congregate in the air  above their nesting grounds by the hundreds  of thousands.

An FAA official said that other ETOPS airports are  available in the Pacific region, including in Alaska, but commercial airlines  may prefer to designate Midway as their ETOPS airport in their flight  plans because it is a shorter flight than flying over Alaska. In addition,  according to an airline pilots\u2019 association representative, Midway\u2019s  availability as an ETOPS airport gives airlines more flexibility in  developing complex flight plans based on their routes, weather and wind  conditions, time, and fuel efficiency as well as ETOPS locations. If the  airport were not available, an official of an association representing  airlines said that airlines would need to alter their routes further north or  south, resulting in longer routes and incurring additional flight time and  fuel-related costs.

For example, FWS directed us to avoid all direct contact  with or disturbing of wildlife, including staying 150 feet away from  endangered species whenever possible. Midway is a seabird nesting  colony, and our site visit coincided with albatross breeding season. Other  seabirds were present in great numbers on Midway, such as the Bonin  petrel, a burrowing seabird.

Under the amended cooperative  agreement, FWS was responsible for establishing and enforcing national  wildlife refuge policies, rules, and regulations and providing staff and  expertise to assist in implementing and overseeing the public use  program. The Midway Phoenix Corporation, under the amended  cooperative agreement, was responsible for implementing and supporting  the public use program. The cooperative agreement also established that  the Midway Phoenix Corporation would provide the funding, staffing,  supplies, equipment, logistics, and services to accomplish its  responsibilities under the agreement. Under the agreement, the Midway  Phoenix Corporation retained revenue derived from the goods and  services it offered on Midway, including lodging and recreational  activities, such as boat and fishing trips. The agreement also required the  Midway Phoenix Corporation to provide the principal funding to develop,  implement, and maintain a compatible public use program on the refuge  and to contribute $200,000 per year to support FWS\u2019s responsibilities  under the agreement because FWS would not be able to meet its  responsibilities without those funds.", "Under the cooperative agreement, the Midway Phoenix Corporation  completed several capital improvement projects and coordinated air  transportation to and from Midway. Capital improvement projects included  the refurbishment of two barracks for overnight lodging, construction of a  new restaurant and bar (see fig. 10), and the installation of a cell phone  tower. According to the former executives of the Midway Phoenix  Corporation, their initial capital investments on Midway totaled  $15 million. Under the terms of the cooperative agreement, all newly  constructed property was property of the United States and the Midway  Phoenix Corporation did not have any claims to improvements made to  the government property. The Midway Phoenix Corporation, using the  Henderson Airfield runway, also coordinated air transportation from  Honolulu using Phoenix Air and Aloha Airlines. According to the former  Midway Phoenix Corporation executives we interviewed, air travel to  Midway was subsidized by the company.", "The Midway Phoenix Corporation hired contractors to facilitate  recreational activities and coordinated tours to Midway with several tour  providers. Specifically, recreational activities were supported by  contractors that operated catch and release sport fishing and scuba  diving excursions (see fig. 11). Tour providers organized packages for  visitors to Midway around those and other recreational activities, such as  historic interpretation. In 1999, cruise ships also began to transport  visitors to Midway, although their visits were typically for less than a day.", "FWS and the Midway Phoenix Corporation entered into a settlement  agreement in March 2002 that terminated their cooperative agreement  and a 2001 fuel delivery contract.

Although FWS allowed the public to visit  Midway during that time, the agency did not coordinate commercial or  charter flights for the public as was the case under the prior public use  program operated by the cooperator. As a result, visitors to Midway  during this time arrived primarily by cruise ship, with a few additional  visitors who arrived via private sailboats and aircraft. Visitors were  required to obtain permission to travel to Midway from the refuge  manager to ensure staff availability. In order to accommodate visitors,  FWS charged cruise ship visitors a refuge access fee, and other costs  were paid by the cruise lines to bring interpretative staff to Midway.

Midway was established as a special management area and is the only  location within the marine national monument that can be used for public  visitation and recreation. However, this public visitation program operated  differently from the previous iteration in that any activity that took place  within the marine national monument was subject to the approval of the  Monument Management Board. The Monument Management Board  comprises representatives from the three agencies designated as co- trustees to manage the marine national monument\u2014the state of Hawaii,  the Department of the Interior, and the Department of Commerce. Under  this public visitation program, tour providers were responsible for  obtaining monument permits through the application process. Those  permit applications were evaluated and approved by the co-trustees.", "Transportation to Midway under this public visitation program was  primarily by charter flights from Honolulu. Tour providers coordinated with  FWS to arrange for transportation to Midway on regularly scheduled  charter flights.
