In this report, GAO examines (1) the process VA uses to convene and conduct AIB investigations, (2) the extent to which VA collects data on AIB investigations, and (3) how VA has used the results of its AIB investigations. GAO focused on AIB investigations conducted within VHA; reviewed VA documents, including policies and procedures, and VHA data on AIBs conducted during fiscal years 2009 through 2011; and interviewed VA officials from headquarters and four medical centers.

The department\u0092s procedures contain requirements for convening and conducting AIB investigations, but according to VA officials, they also provide the flexibility to tailor an investigation to effectively meet diverse informational needs. For example, the VA official convening an AIB investigation is required to select AIB members who are impartial and objective, but has flexibility to vary the number of members appointed to each AIB based on the matter being investigated. VA is currently updating its AIB policy and procedures, but officials said the department plans to maintain flexibility in its AIB process.", "VA does not collect and analyze aggregate data on AIB investigations, including data on the number of AIB investigations conducted, the types of matters investigated, and whether the matters were substantiated, or on any systemic deficiencies identified by AIBs. Having aggregate data could provide VA with valuable information to systematically gauge the extent to which matters investigated by AIBs may be occurring throughout VA\u0092s Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and to take corrective action, if needed, to reduce the likelihood of future occurrences. Without such data, VA is unable to adequately assess the causes or factors that may contribute to deficiencies occurring within its medical centers and health care networks. Information on AIB investigations is maintained by different offices across VA. For example, each medical center or network maintains information on each AIB investigation that it conducts. In response to GAO\u0092s request for AIB data, VHA administered a web-based survey that collected data from all its medical centers and networks on AIB investigations they reported conducting during fiscal years 2009 through 2011. Survey data showed that medical centers and networks conducted more than 1,100 investigations during this time period, and the types of matters investigated included allegations of inappropriate employee behavior involving patients and other employees; individual employee wrongdoing, such as theft and fraud; and systemic deficiencies. VHA officials told us that although it administered the web-based survey, the department has no plans to collect and analyze aggregate data on AIB investigations conducted within VHA.", "VA has used the results of AIB investigations to inform corrective actions, but does not share information about improvements made that could have broader applicability. Specifically, VA has used the results of AIB investigations to inform systemic changes at the medical centers and networks where AIB investigations have been conducted. For example, VA has developed new policies and procedures for improving patient and employee safety and developed new training programs to expand employees\u0092 knowledge of VA policies and procedures. However, VA does not share information about these improvements that may have relevance for other areas within VHA. Such information could be used to improve not only the quality of patient care provided, but also the efficiency of VHA\u0092s overall operations. For example, one medical center included in GAO\u0092s review implemented a tracking system to ensure surgical instruments are delivered promptly to the operating room and a checklist to ensure the availability of needed equipment prior to starting surgery."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that VA establish processes to (1) collect and analyze aggregate data from AIB investigations conducted within VHA, and (2) share information about improvements that are implemented in response to the results of AIB investigations.

Although AIB investigations may be conducted  throughout VA, we focused our review only on AIB investigations that  were conducted within VHA. Additionally, we focused on AIB  investigations conducted during fiscal years 2009 through 2011. In  response to our request for AIB data, VHA administered a web-based  survey that collected data from all its medical centers and networks on  AIB investigations they reported conducting during fiscal years 2009  through 2011. We reviewed and analyzed the survey data on the number  of AIB investigations. VA officials told us that data resulting from the  survey included AIB investigations involving staff at the General Schedule  (GS) -15 level and below, but did not include AIB investigations involving  senior leadership or matters related to research misconduct within VA  medical centers or networks or within VHA headquarters. Thus, for AIB  investigations involving senior leadership and matters of research  misconduct conducted during fiscal years 2009 through 2011, we  collected and analyzed AIB data maintained by VHA\u2019s Office of Workforce  Management and Consulting and Office of Research Oversight,  respectively. We spoke with knowledgeable VHA officials about the data,  including the methodology used to conduct the web-based survey, and  their efforts to ensure the reliability of the data. Based on these  discussions, and our review of related documentation we determined the  data to be sufficiently reliable for our purposes. We did not evaluate the  appropriateness of the number of AIB investigations conducted.  Additionally, we reviewed VA-wide policy and procedures for taking  disciplinary actions, and specific VA policy and procedures for taking  corrective actions against staff involved in research misconduct. We also  reviewed VA\u2019s processes related to AIB investigations, in light of federal  internal control standards, as documented in GAO\u2019s Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government.", "For all three objectives, we interviewed officials from VA\u2019s Office of  Inspector General, Office of General Counsel, and Office of Human  Resources Management, as well as officials from VHA\u2019s Office of the  Principal Deputy Under Secretary for Health; Office of the Assistant  Deputy Under Secretary for Health for Quality, Safety, and Value,  including its National Center for Patient Safety; Office of Workforce  Management and Consulting; Office of Research Oversight; and Office of  the Medical Inspector.

These medical centers varied in terms of complexity, size,and the number of AIB investigations conducted during fiscal years 2009  through 2011. For each medical center, we interviewed human resources  staff; the medical center director, who also served as the convening  authority for the AIB investigations we reviewed during this time period;  and staff who had served as AIB chairs, to obtain information about their  experiences with the investigations. We also obtained and reviewed  investigation reports and related documents to identify the types of  matters investigated by AIBs and the corrective actions that were  informed by AIB investigations conducted during fiscal years 2009  through 2011 from the four medical centers included in our review.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2011 to April 2012 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

The procedures outlined in the handbook are mandatory,  except where otherwise indicated. According to VA officials, the policy  and procedures achieve their intended purpose, while also providing VA  convening authorities\u2014medical center directors, or any authorities senior  to them within networks or headquarters\u2014sufficient flexibility and  discretion to tailor an investigation to effectively meet diverse  informational needs. For example, convening authorities are required to  select AIB members who are impartial and objective, but they have  flexibility to vary the number of members appointed to each AIB based on  the matter being investigated.", "VA Directive 6330, Directives Management (Feb. 26, 2009).", "General Counsel said the department plans to maintain flexibility in its  AIB process.", "VA\u2019s AIB process begins with a convening authority determining the need  for an AIB investigation. Once convened, the AIB collects evidence, which  may include witness testimony, and documents its results in an  investigation report. (See fig. 1 for an overview of VA\u2019s process for  convening and conducting AIB investigations.)", "Convening an AIB investigation involves determining its need, scope, and  board composition. VA Handbook 0700 states that a convening authority  may determine whether an AIB investigation is needed based on several  factors, including the results of a preliminary investigation, any other  ongoing investigation, or the type of matter being investigated. A  preliminary investigation is an informal process whereby readily available  information is collected, for instance by obtaining witness statements.  According to one convening authority, an AIB investigation would likely be  convened after a preliminary investigation if, for example, conflicting  witness accounts were provided during this initial investigation. A  convening authority may also determine that another ongoing review into  the matter, such as root cause analysis or peer review, meets VA\u2019s needs  without convening an AIB. Moreover, AIBs are not to investigate matters  that may be criminal in nature without the convening authority first  coordinating with federal and state law enforcement authorities, including  VA\u2019s Office of Inspector General.", "A convening authority also determines the scope of the investigation and  composition of the AIB. An investigation\u2019s scope\u2014the matter to be  investigated\u2014may be focused on a specific incident involving alleged  employee misconduct or a broader systemic matter. For example, among  the investigation reports we reviewed, one AIB investigated alleged  physical and verbal abuse of a patient by a VA nursing assistant (an  employee misconduct matter), while another investigated the facts and  circumstances surrounding the death of a patient, including whether  changes to policies and procedures were effectively communicated to  staff and monitored (a systemic policy matter). In determining the  composition of the AIB\u2014the number and qualifications of members to be  appointed\u2014VA Handbook 0700 states that AIBs generally should be  comprised of one to three members, and the members are to be selected  primarily based on their expertise and investigative capability, as well as  their objectivity and impartiality. Convening authorities we interviewed\u2014 medical center directors\u2014said they typically appoint three members to  ensure that AIBs include a subject matter expert and at least one member  with investigative experience or training. Moreover, three of these  convening authorities have appointed AIB members from outside their  medical center when necessary to ensure the board\u2019s impartiality.", "Finally, if the convening authority determines that an AIB is needed, it  documents the AIB\u2019s scope and member composition in a charge letter,  which officially authorizes the AIB investigation. During the course of the  investigation, the convening authority may amend the charge letter, to  change the scope of the investigation or composition of the AIB, among  other things. For example, a convening authority included in our review  initially charged an AIB to investigate an incident involving sexual  harassment, but later expanded the investigation\u2019s scope to also include  an incident involving reprisal against the individual who reported the  harassment. According to one convening authority, it may be more cost  effective to expand the scope of an investigation to address additional  matters than to convene a second AIB. The charge letter also  communicates any waivers to VA\u2019s procedural requirements for the AIB  investigation. According to VA Handbook 0700, a convening authority  may waive any of the requirements established by the handbook on a  case-by-case basis, if, for example, requiring compliance with such  requirements would not be cost effective.", "The charge letter also may authorize the AIB to provide recommendations  for corrective actions. According to VA Handbook 0700, an AIB only may  provide recommendations if authorized to do so by the convening  authority. However, an AIB is prohibited from recommending a specific  level or type of corrective action, such as termination or suspension, and  instead may only recommend \u201cappropriate disciplinary action.\u201dMoreover, although an AIB may provide recommendations, convening  authorities are not required to implement them. Three of the four  convening authorities we interviewed have authorized AIBs to provide  recommendations, while one convening authority said that he generally  has not because AIB members are not privy to all information pertaining  to an employee who is the subject of the investigation, such as the  individual\u2019s employment history.", "After the investigation is convened, the AIB collects and analyzes  evidence, such as witness testimony and documentation, related to the  matter under investigation. An AIB may obtain witness testimony from VA  employees, who are obligated to cooperate with the investigation,  as  well as non-VA employees\u2014including patients\u2014who generally are not  obligated to cooperate with the investigation. According to VA Handbook  0700, testimony may be obtained under oath and transcribed by tape  recording, court reporter, or both. Additionally, the AIB may obtain all  available documents, records, and other information that are material to  the scope of the investigation, including VA policies, employee personnel  records, and e-mail correspondence. The AIB analyzes the collected  evidence and develops the findings and conclusions of the investigation,  including whether any matter investigated was substantiated.", "The AIB documents results\u2014evidence, findings, conclusions, and any  recommendations\u2014in an investigation report that is forwarded to the  convening authority.
