Given the requirements of P.L. 106-230, our  objectives were to determine the extent to which IRS (1) discloses to the  public in an accessible manner the data that Section 527 organizations file  with IRS, (2) oversees Section 527 organizations\u2019 compliance with the  specified filing requirements, and (3) develops a strategic plan for carrying  out its new responsibilities. To meet these objectives, we reviewed P.L.  106-230 and relevant Internal Revenue Code rulings on Section 527  political organizations. We interviewed responsible IRS officials and  obtained documentation about processes, plans, and initiatives for  disclosure and oversight related to Section 527 organizations. We also  interviewed officials at the Federal Election Commission (FEC), which  publicly discloses data about federal election activities, to understand the  similarities and differences in disclosure and oversight processes between  FEC and IRS. On disclosure to the public, we tested IRS\u2019s Section 527  disclosure Web site and spoke with public users of the Web site who also  represent public interest groups. Our scope and methodology are  discussed in more detail in a separate section of this report."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In July 2000, P.L. 106-230 was enacted. It created a reporting and public  disclosure process for Section 527 organizations that operate outside FEC  jurisdiction and that engage in political activities at the local, state, or  federal level. Under P.L. 106-230, Section 527 organizations are to notify  IRS of their formation and file periodic reports with IRS. At IRS, the  Exempt Organizations section of the Tax-Exempt and Government  Entities (TE/GE) division is responsible for public disclosure of data on  Section 527 organizations and oversight of them.", "IRS developed two forms to collect required data from Section 527  organizations. IRS released Form 8871 within 12 days of the law\u2019s passage  and Form 8872 within 17 days. An entity forming as a Section 527  organization must notify IRS within 24 hours by filing electronically and  in writing, using Form 8871 (Political Organization Notice of Section 527  Status). Section 527 organizations also must file either electronically or in  writing with IRS periodic reports of contributions and expenditures\u2014 using Form 8872 (Political Organization Report of Contributions and  Expenditures). In an election year, these reports are required (1) monthly  or quarterly, as selected by the filing organization; (2) not later than 12  days before an election if filing on a quarterly basis; and (3) not later than  30 days after a general election. Appendix II contains copies of these IRS  forms.", "Form 8871 on the notification of Section 527 status is to include the    name, address, business address (if a different address), and e-mail    purpose of the organization;    names and addresses of officers, highly compensated employees, contact  person, custodian of records, and members of Board of Directors; and    name and address of, and relationship to, any related organizations.", "The Form 8872 on the Section 527 contributions and expenditures is to  include the    name and address of a contributor and amount of each contribution and,  if the contributor is an individual, the occupation and name of the  employer and    name and address of a recipient of an expenditure and amount of the  expenditure and, if the recipient is an individual, the occupation and name  of the employer.", "IRS is required\u2014with no specified timeframe\u2014to publicly disclose in its  offices all data reported on Forms 8871. The law mandates that IRS  disclose on the Internet within 5 business days of receipt of the Form 8871  a list of organizations filing the form and data on the name, mailing  address, and electronic mailing address of each organization as well as the  custodian of records and contact person. For Form 8872 data, the law did  not require any disclosure over the Internet, providing the Secretary of the  Treasury with discretion on when and how to publicly disclose such data.", "Given such requirements, IRS created a Web site within about 10 weeks  of the law\u2019s passage to publicly disclose data on Forms 8871 and 8872.

In addition, you asked us to provide statistical  data on IRS\u2019s oversight of other tax-exempt organizations.", "For all three objectives, we reviewed P.L. 106-230 and relevant rulings on  Section 527 organizations. We also reviewed P.L. 107-155, a related law on  campaign finance reform that was passed during our work, and talked  with FEC and IRS officials to determine its potential impacts on IRS  disclosure and oversight.", "Specifically, for our objective on disclosure, we interviewed IRS officials  and reviewed documentation to understand how IRS implemented its  disclosure responsibilities immediately after passage of P.L. 106-230, how  implementation of these responsibilities changed over time, and what  plans IRS had. We also sought to understand how IRS officials interpreted  their disclosure responsibilities under the law and implemented their  discretionary authorities provided in the law. We interviewed IRS officials  on the timeliness of IRS\u2019s public disclosure of the Section 527 forms; we  did not verify their statements. To understand similarities and differences  in the IRS\u2019s and FEC\u2019s implementation of their disclosure responsibilities,  we interviewed responsible FEC officials and reviewed FEC  documentation.", "To determine whether IRS discloses Section 527 data in a manner  accessible to the public, we tested IRS\u2019s Section 527 disclosure Web site  for accessibility and user-friendliness. We developed the test instrument  by reviewing the literature on Web site accessibility and consulting with  GAO experts. We tested whether the disclosure Web site had (1) a  structure and navigation system that was consistent, intuitive, and  transparent; (2) information content that clearly described the site\u2019s scope,  content, services, and mission; (3) functionality that allowed links within  the site to work well and the site to respond quickly; and (4) interactivity  in which search and retrieval mechanisms on the site worked well for  users. Our test used 12 GAO analysts who were not familiar with the  Section 527 Web site. While the analysts do not represent all public users,  they can serve as a proxy. Appendix IV contains a copy of our test  instructions and results. We also interviewed 18 public users involved in  campaign finance reform issues about the extent to which the Section 527  Web site met their needs. We identified these individuals and groups using  an Internet search and referrals from other public interest groups,  congressional staff, and individuals who are knowledgeable about  campaign finance. Since we did not know the universe of public users, we  could not select a random sample. As a result, the views of those we  interviewed do not represent all users. Appendix V lists the groups we  interviewed.", "For our second objective on IRS oversight of Section 527 organizations,  we interviewed responsible IRS officials and reviewed documentation on  IRS\u2019s processes, plans, and initiatives. This included interviewing officials  at the Ogden Service Center, which receives, processes, and reviews  Forms 8871 and 8872, and obtaining documentation on the procedures to  be followed. We analyzed information we obtained on the number of  forms that IRS received from Section 527 organizations and IRS\u2019s actions  to ensure that the forms were timely, complete, and correct. We did not  verify the information provided by IRS. Finally, as with our work on  disclosure, we interviewed responsible FEC officials and reviewed FEC  documentation to understand similarities and differences in the IRS\u2019s and  FEC\u2019s implementation of their oversight responsibilities.", "For our third objective on strategic planning, we also reviewed IRS\u2019s  Strategic Planning, Budgeting and Performance Management Process, and  general planning principles, such as those in GPRA, to determine how  such a planning process and principles could guide IRS\u2019s planning on  implementation of its responsibilities for P.L. 106-230. We also talked with  IRS officials about any plans related to Section 527 forms or organizations.", "For the statistical data on IRS\u2019s oversight of other tax-exempt  organizations, we analyzed IRS data on the number of applications, audits,  and revocations of tax-exempt status (see app. III). We relied on the  publicly available data on the IRS Web site as well as data provided by IRS  on its audits.

The law requires the Form 8871 data to be posted to the Internet  and otherwise made available to the public within 5 business days of  receipt. The law specifies no timeframe for disclosing the Form 8872 data.  IRS officials said that IRS generally posts electronically filed Forms 8871  and 8872 within 48 hours of receipt and paper Forms 8871 within 5  business days.

Our  results generally echoed the shortcomings described by public interest  groups although they also note that it is still early in IRS\u2019s implementation  of the law. These difficulties hinder the public\u2019s capacity to effectively use  the data disclosed on the Section 527 disclosure Web site.", "IRS officials acknowledged that users had difficulty finding the Section  527 disclosure Web site in part, because the IRS home page initially had no  link to the disclosure Web site, and it often took users at least seven links  to locate the site. Most GAO analysts in our tests could not find the site  without assistance. Noting the absence of a link on its home page, IRS  officials distributed a one-page guide during public education talks that  showed the web address for the Section 527 disclosure welcome page.", "IRS provides two options for searching the disclosed data, but both have  shortcomings. The first option, called basic search, enables users to query  names of filing organizations but does not indicate the number of records  found, which prevents users from estimating the time it will take to view  all records. In addition, its keyword search feature can only query the first  part of an organization\u2019s name and does not query data contained on each  form. The second option, called advanced search, can query data by  simultaneously searching up to six fields, but only for electronically filed  forms. According to IRS officials, only 5 percent of the universe of Forms  8872 has been filed electronically as of March 2002. Yet, the Web site does  not inform users that the advanced search cannot query 95 percent of  Forms 8872 filed, which may lead users to misinterpret search results.", "The Section 527 disclosure Web site also falls short in helping users  interact with and understand the data disclosed. For example, IRS posts  forms filed by organizations that are exempt from filing under P.L. 106-230,  such as those who file reports with FEC, without indicating that such  forms are unnecessary. In addition, users have had problems  understanding technical terminology used in the site. For example, GAO  analysts in our tests had difficulty deciphering whether \u201ccontributions\u201d  refers to donation to or from a Section 527 organization. Some public  interest groups we interviewed expressed frustration over interactions  with the customer service tools, pointing to telephone calls and e-mailed  questions that have gone unanswered; at least one group was told by an  IRS operator that the unit was unable to answer its questions on Section  527 organizations.", "Furthermore, IRS\u2019s Web site does not post information to distinguish  between forms, such as those initially filed versus those filed after being  amended. In contrast, FEC officials said that they post written contacts  with the organizations, such as when a form is amended. Nor does IRS  indicate when it has contacted Section 527 organizations, such as when it  asks for clarifications on filed data, as does FEC. Some public users told  us that Forms 8871 and 8872 appear on the Section 527 disclosure Web site  months after they were due without explanation. As a result, they cannot  tell whether IRS was late in posting forms, these forms were filed late, or  IRS re-posted the forms after making corrections. For example, of 50 new  postings identified by one public interest group during 1 day in January  2002, only 10 forms were being posted for the first time, and 40 forms  appeared to be re-posted after corrections."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS Lacks Electronically Searchable Data", "paragraphs": ["Although not required by law, many of the forms filed by Section 527  organizations are not available to the public in an electronically searchable  and downloadable format.

Only the   Web-based electronic forms are electronically searchable and  downloadable, while filed paper forms appear in a non-searchable,  photograph-like format. Unlike FEC, IRS can receive only its Web-based  forms and not electronic forms generated by software packages used by  the large Section 527 organizations to file with states and FEC. As a result,  these organizations cannot electronically file Forms 8872 without  reentering data from their system into IRS\u2019s Web-based system.", "The usefulness of IRS\u2019s Section 527 Web site is limited by this lack of  electronically searchable data. Public interest groups told us that real  disclosure requires the data to be in an electronically searchable format,  rather than a photograph-like format, to be useful and timely for their  analyses of campaign financing and the relationships among organizations.  They cannot readily integrate photograph-like images into their databases  to identify the big donors in an election, the connections between  organizations, or the flow of funds. These groups said that without prompt  access to electronically searchable and downloadable data, they are  unable to effectively follow the flow of funds in campaigns for public  office and on specific legislative issues.", "Given the scarcity of electronically filed Forms 8872, users are left to  manually review one paper form at a time. To create an electronic  database, IRS or the public user would have to manually transcribe the  data from paper forms, which many public interest groups have described  as time-consuming and costly. At least one public interest group gave up  trying to manually transcribe data from paper Forms 8872 due to the time  and resources required."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "IRS\u2019s Improvements to Disclosure Web site Do Not Address Key Limitations", "paragraphs": ["IRS officials believe IRS has fulfilled its disclosure responsibility under the  law.

For example, in January 2002, IRS established a new link on the IRS  home page that more directly leads users to data on Section 527 political  organizations. However, neither this new link nor Web pages in  subsequent links clearly direct users to the Section 527 disclosure Web  site. The welcome page and the search page for the Web site lack clear  titles indicating the user\u2019s location. Furthermore, the new links bypass the  welcome page, thus depriving users of the orientation to the search site.  Figure 2 shows the link system from the IRS home page to the Section 527  disclosure Web site.", "Nor do the improvements increase the amount of electronically searchable  data. For example, IRS is exploring ways to add data to the Web site, such  as data from the annual Forms 990 on the income and expenditures of tax- exempt organizations. According to IRS officials, IRS is considering  posting portable document format (PDF) images (which can not be  electronically searched) of the Forms 990 filed by Section 527  organizations to the Section 527 Web site to provide the public a more  complete picture. IRS has a separate effort to allow optional electronic  filing of Forms 990 by 2004, which could increase the amount of  electronically searchable data reported by Section 527 organizations.", "While IRS officials have expressed an interest in making the site easier to  use and in increasing the electronically searchable data, they do not see  these as top priorities. For example, officials working on the Section 527  disclosure Web site have requested funds to make the site\u2019s search  features more user-friendly, including an expanded keyword search to  allow for \u201cwildcard operators\u201d and queries whereby a user could type in  any word to find all filers whose names contain that word. However, such  a request must compete for resources with other IRS priorities and IRS has  not funded the request.", "Despite IRS\u2019s emphasis on measuring its success in meeting the  expectations of customers, IRS has not identified the actual and potential  users of the disclosure Web site. Nor does IRS plan to survey whether  users can effectively access the disclosed data on Section 527  organizations or believe that the Web site can be enhanced to better meet  their needs.

Accordingly, IRS has provided little assurance to  the public that data disclosed on the Section 527 Web site are timely,  complete, and correct. In part, due to these limited oversight efforts, IRS  has not imposed any penalties that P.L. 106-230 created for failing to meet  the filing and reporting requirements. IRS officials say that the lack of  available resources and other higher priorities, have affected the oversight  they have given to Section 527 organizations.

These  data can help public users see relationships between Section 527  organizations and others. For Form 8872, no check is required of the  names of employers for contributors and recipients, or contribution and  expenditure amounts. Such data can help users find contributions made by  donors to Section 527 organizations and the related use of funds.", "Based on its checks, IRS will correct certain data, such as an EIN, on the  forms or in its computers without contacting a filing organization  according to IRS officials. For other discrepancies, such as forms that are  clearly incomplete or lack a signature, IRS will correspond with a Section  527 organization. IRS posts Forms 8871 and 8872 as received on its  disclosure site while discrepancies are resolved and then re-posts  corrected forms.", "In addition, IRS\u2019s procedures do not include checks to determine whether  it receives both electronic and paper versions of the Forms 8871 as   P.L. 106-230 requires. Data on forms filed between July 2000, when the law  became effective, and March 2002 suggest that many organizations are not  meeting this requirement. As of March 2002, IRS had received 11,586  electronic and 13,752 paper Forms 8871. An IRS official said IRS is aware  of this discrepancy of nearly 2,000 more paper forms than electronic  forms.", "Although the P.L. 106-230 penalties cover timeliness of filings, IRS does  not check the timeliness of Forms 8871 and only checks timeliness for one  aspect of Forms 8872. For Forms 8871, IRS officials said that they did not  check whether Section 527 organizations filed within the required 24  hours.

Thus, almost 9,000 more Section 527  organizations have notified IRS of their formation than have reported any  contributions or expenditures. Some of this discrepancy may not be a  problem because, for instance, some organizations do not have to file a  Form 8871 or a Form 8872 in certain circumstances. However, as of May  2002, IRS had not determined which organizations unnecessarily filed  Forms 8871, filed Forms 8871 but were not required to file Forms 8872, or  did not file required Forms 8872.

If not, IRS  would be able to follow up to determine whether a Section 527  organization should have been created and a Form 8871 should have been  filed. Similarly, Forms 990 are to include data reported by charitable  organizations about relationships with other tax-exempt organizations,  including Section 527 organizations.

An IRS official said she attended meetings\u2014 such as FEC events\u2014to speak about the law\u2019s requirements, and is  planning to continue outreach by publicizing the law\u2019s requirements, and  required forms to file. Also, IRS is preparing a publication to distribute on  Section 527 organizations as part of its educational outreach.", "In addition, IRS officials said that their resources to address Section 527  organizations\u2019 compliance have to compete with many other tax-exempt  priorities.

IRS officials said that IRS transcribes about 20  percent of the Forms 990 data into electronic format. Unlike for Forms  990, filers can choose to file their Forms 8872 electronically and have done  so for about 10 percent of the data on the Forms 8872 filed. To obtain  more electronic data, IRS would have to transcribe more data from these  forms or organizations would have to be required to file electronically.", "As for transcription, IRS officials said that transcribing the data into an  electronic format would be challenging and conflicts with IRS\u2019s goal to  increase voluntary electronic filing. IRS transcribes data from other forms,  such as the Form 1040 filed by individual taxpayers, into an electronic  format, but such data are predominantly numeric. Most of the Forms 8872  data is text, such as names and addresses. Transcribing these types of data  generally results in a higher error rate and requires more costly  verification than numeric data. Although not measured, the cost of  transcribing textual data into an electronic format would be high,  according to IRS officials.", "As for electronic filing, IRS is developing optional electronic filing of  Forms 990 for all tax-exempt organizations, including Section 527  organizations, which is slated to be available by January 2004. However,  IRS cannot accept electronic Forms 8872 generated by commercial  software. IRS officials said that completing Forms 8872 on the Web site  burdens Section 527 organizations that use such software to manage  contribution and expenditure data. To use the Web site, the organizations  must manually re-enter the data; organizations that do not use such  software would not face an increased burden because they would  manually enter their Forms 8872 data regardless. IRS officials also said  that some Section 527 organizations are reluctant to file electronically  because IRS does not provide proof of filing through a date-time stamp or  e-mail, as FEC does. Although IRS favors the capability to accept  electronic Forms 8872 generated by the software, it has not identified its  resource needs.

For example, Section 527  organizations that report to FEC on contributions received over $50,000  and expenditures made, generally are required to electronically file while  those that report to IRS are not and usually file paper forms. As a result,  data on FEC\u2019s web site are largely electronically searchable whereas data  on IRS\u2019s web site are largely not electronically searchable."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Determining Responsibility for Disclosure and Oversight", "paragraphs": ["Under P.L. 107-155, determining the level of IRS and FEC disclosure or  oversight of a Section 527 organization depends on the activities of the  organization. These include the timing, operations, and parties involved in  the activities. According to FEC officials, this raises the possibility that  Section 527 organizations will report some activities to IRS and others to  FEC, even during the same time in an election cycle. The overlapping  agency responsibilities for Section 527 organizations raises questions  about the degree and type of coordination that will be needed for future  Section 527 disclosure and oversight efforts by IRS and FEC.", "For example, Section 501(c)(5) unions will be prohibited from spending  their treasury funds for newly defined electioneering communications.  FEC will need to oversee union activities to enforce this prohibition while  IRS will continue to have responsibility for overseeing whether Section  501(c)(5) unions engage in political activities that exceed those  permissible for tax-exempt organizations. Similarly, if a Section 527  organization runs a \u201cpromote or attack\u201d advertisement as defined by P.L.  107-155, disclosure and oversight responsibility depends on whether the  organization coordinated with a candidate\u2019s committee. Thus, both  agencies will need to know whether the advertisements run by Section 527  organizations include such advertisements."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VII: Opportunities for Data Matching to Improve Oversight", "paragraphs": ["IRS does not use existing data, such as from the Form 990, that it receives  from Section 527 and other tax-exempt organizations to identify Section  527 organizations that might not be filing required Forms 8871 and 8872, or  Section 501(c)(4-6) organizations that should have established a separate  segregated fund for their political activities and filed Forms 8871 and 8872.  Some options exist for starting to match these data to identify  noncompliance such as unfiled Forms 8871 and 8872.", "IRS could use the Form 990 data to calculate the ratio of a Section 501(c)  organization\u2019s political activity expenditures to its total expenses. This  would give IRS information on the amount of reported political activity.  High amounts of political activity might merit follow up to determine  whether the organization should have notified IRS of its activities under  Section 527.", "IRS could use the Form 990 data to check the completeness and  correctness of reporting on relationship between Section 527 and  charitable organizations. These relationships are to be reported on the  Form 990 and Form 8871. These matches could identify Section 527  organizations that may have filed incomplete or incorrect data. In addition,  such matches could help to identify Section 527 organizations that did not  file the required Forms 8871 or 8872.", "A barrier to matching data across forms is the uncertainty that would exist  about whether IRS is matching the right names for people and  organizations listed on the forms. The Form 8871 and Form 990 require  organizations to list the names of related organizations. If a tax-exempt  organization were to list a Section 527 organization as the \u201cClean Water  Initiative\u201d but that organization identifies itself by a different name such as  the \u201cClean Water PAC,\u201d IRS could not match the names electronically to  determine whether these organizations are in fact the same. Also, similar  problems arise with common names of individuals such as \u201cJohn Smith\u201d in  assuring that IRS is matching or, public users are analyzing, the same  person versus someone else with the same name. Without the capability to  match names with the right organizations or people across forms, IRS  could not determine whether organizations have met the legal requirement  to file complete and correct data.", "One option that would allow IRS to match individual and organization\u2019s  names would require IRS to collect social security numbers and employer  identification numbers (EINs) for each individual or organization listed on  the forms filed by Section 527 and 501(c)(3-6) organizations. This option is  not without complications. According to IRS officials, IRS cannot protect  sensitive privacy information since IRS discloses Forms 8871 and 8872 in  their entirety. In addition, current law would compel filing organizations to  disclose such sensitive data whenever requested to provide copies of  forms filed with IRS. Furthermore, IRS officials said that unless the data  on the Forms 8871 and 8872 is filed electronically, IRS would face an  administrative burden to redact these data in time to meet its disclosure  requirements.", "Another option that would allow IRS to match individual and  organization\u2019s names entails establishing a system similar to one used by  FEC. FEC standardizes names of political committees and candidates who  file with them by manually assigning unique identification numbers. In  addition, if a political committee or candidate appears as a contributor or  recipient on the filings of another entity, FEC standardizes the names. For  example, when a PAC reports a contribution from \u201cSmith for Congress,\u201d  the FEC generates a list from its database of all organizations identified as  \u201cSmith for Congress.\u201d By manually comparing the submission with the  names and addresses of all \u201cSmith for Congress\u201d organizations, FEC can  determine whether that contributor is already in its database with a unique  identification number."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VIII: Comments from the Internal Revenue Service", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IX: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to those named above, Rodd Hobbs, Shirley Jones, Anne  Laffoon, Kristeen McLain, Dan Mesler, Cheryl Peterson, and Tama  Weinberg made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
