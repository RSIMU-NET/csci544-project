In fiscal year 2004, obligations to ANC firms represented 13 percent of total 8(a) dollars. Sole-source awards represented about 77 percent of 8(a) ANC obligations for the six procuring agencies that accounted for the vast majority of total ANC obligations over the 5-year period. These sole-source contracts can represent a broad range of services, as illustrated in GAO's contract file sample, which included contracts for construction in Brazil, training of security guards in Iraq, and information technology services in Washington, D.C. In general, acquisition officials at the agencies reviewed told GAO that the option of using ANC firms under the 8(a) program allows them to quickly, easily, and legally award contracts for any value. They also noted that these contracts help them meet small business goals. In reviewing selected large, sole-source 8(a) contracts awarded to ANC firms, GAO found that contracting officials had not always complied with certain requirements, such as notifying SBA of contract modifications and monitoring the percent of work that is subcontracted. ANCs use the 8(a) program to generate revenue with the goal of providing benefits to their shareholders. These benefits take many forms, including dividend payments, scholarships, internships, and support for elder shareholders. A detailed discussion of the benefits provided by the ANCs is included as appendix X of the report. Some ANCs are heavily reliant on the 8(a) program for revenues, while others approach the program as one of many revenue-generating opportunities. GAO found that some ANCs have increasingly made use of the congressionally authorized advantages afforded to them. One of the key practices is the creation of multiple 8(a) subsidiaries, sometimes in highly diversified lines of business. From fiscal year 1988 to 2005, ANC 8(a) subsidiaries increased from one subsidiary owned by one ANC to 154 subsidiaries owned by 49 ANCs. SBA, which is responsible for implementing the 8(a) program, has not tailored its policies and practices to account for ANCs' unique status and growth in the 8(a) program, even though SBA officials recognize that ANCs enter into more complex business relationships than other 8(a) participants. Areas where SBA's oversight has fallen short include: determining whether more than one subsidiary of the same ANC is generating a majority of its revenue in the same primary industry, consistently determining whether awards to 8(a) ANC firms have resulted in other small businesses losing contract opportunities, and ensuring that the partnerships between 8(a) ANC firms and large firms are functioning in the way they were intended. During our review, SBA officials agreed that improvements are needed and said they are planning to revise their regulations and policies."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In December 1971, Congress enacted the Alaska Native Claims Settlement  Act (ANCSA) to resolve long-standing aboriginal land claims and to foster  economic development for Alaska Natives.

ANSCA permitted the conveyance of about 44 million  acres of land to the ANCs, along with cash payments of almost $1 billion in  exchange for extinguishing the aboriginal land claims in Alaska. Regional  corporations were required to be formed as profit-making entities, while  village, urban, and group corporations could decide whether to be profit or  nonprofit entities. As of December 2005, there were 13 regional  corporations and 182 village, urban, and group corporations.

This program allows the government to award contracts to participating  small businesses without competition below certain dollar thresholds.  Congress has repeatedly emphasized in legislation the business  development aspects of the 8(a) program. Each 8(a) firm, including those  owned by ANCs, must qualify as small under an industry size standard as  measured by number of employees or average revenues from the previous  3 years, and must be majority-owned by a disadvantaged individual or a  qualified entity, such as an ANC. Firms approved as 8(a) participants can  receive business development assistance from SBA and are eligible to  receive contracts that agencies offer to SBA for the 8(a) program. In 1998,  SBA started negotiating memorandums of understanding (MOU) that  allowed federal agencies to contract directly with 8(a) firms. The MOUs  (also called partnership agreements), delegate contract execution  responsibility to the agencies and require them to monitor certain  requirements of the contract.", "Since 1986, Congress has extended special procurement advantages to  ANC firms beyond those afforded to other 8(a) businesses.

We planned to include the Department of  Homeland Security\u2019s data in our trend analysis but did not do so for two  reasons.

In most cases, the regional corporations received a mixture of  surface and subsurface rights to land while the village, urban, or group  corporations received only surface rights. Some village corporations opted  out of the ANCSA settlement to receive surface and subsurface rights to  their former reservation lands and relinquished all ANSCA benefits,  including claims to additional land, monetary payments, or shares of stock  in a regional corporation. Additionally, in some cases, village corporations  merged with each other or with the regional corporation.", "The legislative history of ANSCA is focused on economic development for  the benefit of Alaska Natives.

As  shareholders, Alaska Natives are entitled to a voice in the management of  and a share in the lands, assets, and income as decided by the board of  directors of the corporations, which own and manage the land and money.  ANCSA implemented restrictions that generally allow original  shareholders to transfer shares only under certain circumstances, such as  divorce or through a gift or a will.

The State Department  negotiated extensively for over a month, requesting four different price  proposals from the contractor.

The contracting official acknowledged  that the scope change should have been coordinated with SBA, but her  understanding was that because it was an ANC firm, anything could be  added to the contract regardless of the dollar amount. By adding  additional lines of business to the contract, the contracting officer was  potentially improperly expanding beyond the scope of the contract.  Moreover, by not notifying SBA, the agency had no assurance that this  ANC firm qualified as small under the contract\u2019s additional lines of  business.", "We found that SBA\u2019s letters to the agencies approving 8(a) procurements  did not always reiterate the notification requirement.

This  does not mean that the 50-percent minimum requirement applies to work  performed under each individual task order or that a contractor must meet  the requirement cumulatively for all work performed under all task orders  at any given point in time.

In  the early 1990s, the corporation was required to pay off its debts before  paying any dividends. Its board and management attribute its return to  profitability to its heavy participation in the 8(a) program. By 2004, the  ANC paid out dividend amounts that were among the highest of all  regional corporations. An original shareholder owning 100 shares, for  example, received $3,500 in dividends in 2004. The ANC also provided a  number of other benefits to its shareholders, their spouses and  descendants, such as scholarships and a business assistance program.", "In contrast, another ANC with a high level of activity in the 8(a)  program is currently unable to provide a comparable level of monetary  benefits. This corporation encountered a few years of heavy losses due  to lawsuits and management malfeasance. Since being in financial  recovery for the past 5 years, it has not been allowed to issue dividends  to shareholders. However, it provides other benefits, such as  scholarships and protection of land and subsistence rights for its  shareholders.", "We also found that a high level of benefits can exist even if an ANC is not  participating in the 8(a) program at all.

Clearly, 6 of the 7 procuring agencies in our  review--which account for most of the government\u2019s 8(a) dollars to  ANC firms--agree that there is a need for them to work with SBA to  develop guidance for contracting officers in light of the unique  procurement advantages Congress has provided 8(a) ANC firms.", "SBA believes that our report should cite federal dollars to women- owned and other small business categories and the government\u2019s  achievement of small business goals in general. That information is  not relevant to this report. Our review focused specifically on ANC  activity in the 8(a) program, as set forth in appendix I, which  outlines our scope and methodology.", "SBA states that it has recently taken a number of steps to improve  oversight of the 8(a) program, including taking into consideration  special provisions afforded to 8(a) ANC firms, Native Hawaiian  Organizations, and Indian tribes. It is unclear what steps SBA is  referring to. While we note in our report that SBA officials told us  they were planning to revise regulations and policies, we were not  provided with any evidence that this or any other planned action  had been taken, despite our requests for the information.", "SBA states that it is \u201cconjecture\u201d to make recommendations  pertaining to data on 8(a) ANC activity until the lack of data  explaining 8(a) participants\u2019 economic activities, including ANC  firms, is resolved. Our recommendation on data collection is  intended to address this very gap. It is directed at SBA because that  agency is responsible for managing the 8(a) program. We found  that SBA lacked adequate data on the 8(a) program in general and  was not collecting any information on ANC firms\u2019 activity  specifically.", "SBA pointed out that the statutory language refers to \u201csubstantial\u201d  unfair competitive advantage, a change we have made to the  report. SBA found our focus on this issue unreasonable, stating  that all 8(a) participants have been accorded a competitive  advantage. During our review, it was clear that SBA had in place no  policy or procedure to make unfair competitive advantage  determinations. We do not understand how SBA can ignore the fact  that Congress has directed it to make these determinations  specifically for ANC firms in the 8(a) program.", "SBA refers to the tone of our report as \u201cunsettling\u201d and suggests  that it could lead readers to conclude that we have concerns with  the fact that agencies can count 8(a) ANC contracts toward their  federal small business goals. We express no concerns of the kind.  Rather, our concerns, as reflected in the recommendations to SBA,  pertain to the level of oversight it is exercising over 8(a) ANC  activity.", "In an e-mail sent after the comment letter, SBA expressed  disagreement with several of the recommendations but did not  address the others. It stated that its annual reviews track  ownership changes and the business mix of all 8(a) participants  and that its regulations require contracting officers to report  contract modifications. These comments are not responsive to our  recommendations. Our recommendations specifically discuss  monitoring ownership of ANC holding companies, tracking primary  revenue generators across 8(a) ANC subsidiaries, and establishing  thresholds for notification of 8(a) contract modifications. SBA  disagreed with the recommendation on determining whether other  small businesses are losing contracting opportunities, stating that  it already does so for all 8(a) sole-source offerings. As illustrated  by the examples in our report, this is not the case.", "SBA\u2019s written comments are included as appendix II.", "The Department of Homeland Security agreed with the recommendation  affecting it and indicated it would partner with SBA to ensure that the  department\u2019s contracting officers have a thorough understanding of all  contracting regulations on awarding contracts under SBA\u2019s 8(a) program.  Homeland Security requested that we reflect that the department has only  been in existence since 2003 and that FPDS data would not be available  for the 5-year period. We agreed and added this point to our explanation of  why we did not include the department in our trend analysis. In addition,  the department stated that, in providing us a list of contracts awarded to  firms with the DUNS numbers we provided, officials did not indicate that  it included all contracts awarded to ANC firms. Homeland Security  attempted to reconcile the identified missing contracts from the list of  contracts awarded to ANCs; however, we still determined that the  agency\u2019s data were inadequate to include in our trend analysis. Homeland  Security\u2019s written comments are included as appendix III.", "The Department of the Interior agreed with the recommendation affecting  it and proposed that an interagency work group be established and headed  by the SBA to develop guidance for contracting officers. The department  also provided specific comments on the contract awarded to an ANC firm  on behalf of DOD\u2019s Counter Intelligence Field Activity (CIFA). The Interior  Department said that the referenced contract was not awarded to the ANC  firm \u201cbecause CIFA\u2026had requested that firm.\u201d The evidence we gathered  from the contract file, as well as interviews with the contracting officer  and the ANC firm, support the facts as we have stated them. CIFA, through  a preauthorization letter, had arranged with the ANC firm to provide a  variety of urgently needed services and requested that GovWorks award  the contract to that firm. Interior\u2019s written comments are included as  appendix IV.", "NASA agreed with the recommendation affecting it and indicated that it  will work with the SBA to develop guidance and to provide whatever  assistance SBA may need to address the recommendations directed to it.  NASA\u2019s written comments are included as appendix V.", "The State Department agreed with the recommendation affecting it, stating  that it will work with the SBA to develop standardized guidance to  contracting officers on monitoring limitations on subcontracting and SBA  notification of contract modifications. The State Department noted that  the contract negotiations involving an 8(a) ANC joint venture took place in  a compressed acquisition cycle and that SBA was in direct contact with  the venturing parties at the time they were negotiating the contract. State  concludes that because of SBA\u2019s \u201csimultaneous interaction\u201d with the  venturing parties and with State\u2019s contracting officer, a formal request for  SBA intervention would have been superfluous. However, our discussion  focuses on the concerns about the extent of work being performed by the  8(a) ANC firm versus that of its joint venturing partner. These issues were  raised within the State Department several months after the contract was  awarded, and SBA was not notified at that time. The department also  suggested some technical changes, which we incorporated as appropriate.  The department\u2019s written comments are included as appendix VI.", "The Department of Energy did not comment on the recommendation. It  stated that our report gives the impression that agencies rely  \u201csignificantly\u201d on the ANC program to achieve small business goals. Our  report does not state or imply that. Rather, we note that contracting  officers have turned to 8(a) ANC firms as a way to help them meet their  goals. The department also pointed to a perceived inconsistency in the  report dealing with the \u201climitations on subcontracting\u201d clause as it  pertains to construction contracts. We disagree; the section in the report  on this matter clearly establishes that the limitation for construction  contracts is different than for other services. Energy\u2019s written response is  included as appendix VII.", "In official oral comments, DOD agreed with the recommendation, stating  that the development of additional guidance by the department to ensure  the effective oversight of 8(a) ANC contracts is necessary and that the  department will work closely with SBA to develop this guidance. DOD  added that, prior to commencement of these efforts, it is imperative that  SBA undertake the actions we recommended for revising its relevant  regulations and policies and improving its oversight practices concerning  8(a) ANC contracts, as these changes will form the basis of the new or  expanded DOD-specific guidance.", "In official oral comments, the Department of Transportation agreed with  the recommendation. Transportation also provided some technical  comments that we incorporated as appropriate.", "We also received written comments from the Native American Contractors  Association. The association believes that we should more fully  acknowledge the legal and policy basis of 8(a) program rules for Native  Entities. We believe the report thoroughly explains the legislative basis for  8(a) ANC firms\u2019 procurement provisions and that it sets forth the rules for  ANC firms as compared to those for other 8(a) firms. The association also  raised several broader issues that impact the entire federal procurement  system that it believes we should have included, such as in the areas of  contract bundling, acquisition workforce, improper counting toward small  business goals, and modifications to contract scope. While these are areas  that we have reported on in the past, the focus of this audit was on 8(a)  ANC contracting. Contrary to the association\u2019s assertion, we do place  certain findings\u2014particularly with regard to the limitations on  subcontracting and notification to SBA of contract modifications\u2014in the  context of the 8(a) program in general. For example, our  recommendations to SBA on these issues are not limited solely to 8(a)  ANC contracting activity. In technical comments provided separately, the  association suggested that, for context, we include reference to total  federal procurement spending on goods and services. We have added this  information as a note to figure 3. The association\u2019s comments are included  as appendix VIII.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretaries of Defense, Energy,  Homeland Security, the Interior, State, and Transportation; the  Administrators of SBA and NASA; the Director, Office of Management and  Budget; the Native American Contractors Association; and other interested  congressional committees.

We traveled to Alaska and met with  representatives of 30 Alaska Native corporations (ANC). We also met with  representatives of the Native American Contractors Association in  Washington, D.C. and interviewed officials from a number of small  businesses as well as representatives from an 8(a) association. We  reviewed relevant legislation, including the Alaska Native Claims  Settlement Act (ANSCA) for background on the ANC corporate structure  and the Small Business Act and other relevant legislation to understand  the pertinent procurement advantages that ANC firms receive in the 8(a)  program.", "To identify overall trends in the government\u2019s contracting with ANCs, we  obtained data from the Federal Data Procurement System (FPDS) for  fiscal years 2000 through 2004. To gather data on federal 8(a) contracting  with ANCs, we identified each ANC firm\u2019s Data Universal Numbering  System (DUNS) number and used this information to obtain data from  FPDS and agencies. To assess the reliability of the procurement data used  in our 5-year trend analysis, we (1) compared FPDS and agency data to  verify the accuracy of the data; (2) reviewed related documentation,  including contract files; and (3) worked closely with agency officials to  identify and resolve any data problems. When we found discrepancies, we  brought them to the agency\u2019s attention and worked with them to correct  the discrepancies before conducting our analyses. We determined that the  data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our report. We had  planned to include Homeland Security in our trend analysis, but did not do  so for two reasons. First, since FPDS only includes Homeland Security  contract data for part of fiscal year 2003 and beyond, we were unable to  confirm the reliability of the data for the purposes of our 5-year trend  analysis. Second, we found that the data from Homeland Security were  inconsistent and therefore questioned the reliability of the data overall.  For example, the data provided did not include contracts awarded by  Immigration and Customs Enforcement and contained other data errors,  such as contracts recorded with either an incorrect dollar value or as sole  source when awarded competitively.", "To assess the trends in government 8(a) sole-source contracting with  ANCs from fiscal years 2000 to 2004, we reviewed data from the six federal  agencies that, according to FPDS, comprise about 85 percent of total  federal dollars obligated to ANCs via the 8(a) program. These agencies  were the departments of Defense, Energy, the Interior, State, and  Transportation and NASA, which obligated about $2.5 billion in sole-  source contracts to ANCs for fiscal years 2000 through 2004. To  understand the facts and circumstances surrounding specific contract  awards, we reviewed contract files, interviewed agency contracting  officers, and reviewed any relevant bid protests for 16 large dollar value,  sole-source 8(a) contracts at seven agencies. Whereas we included six  agencies in our 8(a) sole source trend analysis, we added the Department  of Homeland Security to our contract file review. To identify two sole- source contracts awarded by Homeland Security, we began reviewing the  contracts with the largest dollar awards from the data provided, but had to  exclude a number of the largest contracts from our file review due to  errors in the data. We brought significant data errors to the attention of  Homeland Security officials and the department stated that it has initiated  corrective action. For the seven agencies, we selected contracts based on  high ultimate award values and high dollars obligated to date that  represented a variety of contractors and services. We made the initial  contract selections based on the available data at that time.", "To assess how ANCs use the 8(a) program, we reviewed documentation  and spoke with representatives from 30 Alaska Native corporations\u2014all   13 regional and 17 selected village or urban corporations\u2014and some of  their 8(a) subsidiaries. In selecting corporations to interview, we  considered diversity in geography, financial strategy and profitability, and  participation in the 8(a) program. Tables 5 and 6 show the corporations  included in our review.", "Additionally, we visited seven villages with populations that had a high  percentage of Alaska Natives to understand the lifestyle and livelihood of  the Alaska Native people. We selected these villages based on diversity in  geography, population, average per capita income, and shareholder culture  and history.
