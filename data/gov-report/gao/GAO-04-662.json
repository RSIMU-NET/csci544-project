DOE (1) has developed an overall plan to manage its program, (2) has selected two U.S. contractors to oversee the construction of replacement fossil fuel plants, and (3) is working with its U.S. contractors to review specific design and construction plans for the plants. DOE officials expressed concern that the number of organizations, 17, involved in the program makes coordination difficult and has led to delays. Additionally, DOE and U.S. contractor officials said that the primary Russian contractor may not have adequate experience and currently lacks enough staff to implement its part of the program. Final shutdown of the reactors is uncertain because DOE faces a number of challenges in implementing its program, including (1) ensuring Russia's commitment to the nonproliferation and safety goals of the program, (2) clarifying the existing reactor shutdown agreement, and (3) working with Russia to find employment for thousands of Russian nuclear workers who will lose their jobs when the reactors are closed. Russia's rejection of DOE's proposals to reduce the amount of plutonium produced by the reactors and to improve the safety of the reactors before they are shut down raises serious questions about Russia's commitment to key program goals. Furthermore, the existing reactor shutdown agreement contains shutdown dates that do not reflect DOE's planned program schedule. Finally, the challenge of finding employment for Russian nuclear workers could undermine the program by creating the potential for Russia to continue operating the reactors longer than necessary to ensure jobs for the workers. DOE has not developed a plan to address this issue. As of December 31, 2003, DOE had spent $7.8 million--about 4 percent of available funds on planning and developing the program, including travel, overhead, project administration, and document translation costs. Regarding future program costs, DOE officials told us that they expect the projected costs to build the replacement fossil fuel plants to be significantly higher than their original estimate of $466 million, possibly as much as $1 billion."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Russia\u2019s continued operation of three plutonium production reactors,  which together produce enough weapons-grade plutonium each year for  about 300 nuclear weapons, poses a serious proliferation threat. This  plutonium\u2014up to 1.2 metric tons produced annually\u2014is being added to  Russia\u2019s already vast stockpile of weapons-usable nuclear material. The  shutdown of these reactors has been a long-standing nonproliferation goal  of the United States, and efforts to secure their closure have continued for  over a decade. By 1992, Russia had shut down all but 3 of its 13 plutonium  production reactors\u20142 continue to operate in the closed nuclear city of  Seversk and 1 in the closed nuclear city of Zheleznogorsk. While the  primary role of plutonium production reactors in the former Soviet Union  was to produce weapons-grade plutonium, some of the reactors, including  the three that remain in operation, were also designed to generate heat and  electricity for nearby cities. Because temperatures in these cities can drop  to -40 degrees Fahrenheit in winter and the nearly 300,000 Russians living  there depend on the reactors for heat and electricity, alternate heat and  power sources must be made available before the reactors can be shut  down.", "In addition to producing weapons-grade plutonium, these reactors are  considered by U.S. and Russian experts to be among the most unsafe in the  world. These reactors do not have a containment structure, generally a  steel-lined concrete, dome-like structure that serves as the ultimate barrier  to the release of radioactive material during an accident. Furthermore, the  reactors, which were built in the 1960s, have exceeded their original  estimated operating life by 20 years.", "In 1994, Vice President Gore and Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin  signed an agreement whereby Russia pledged to (1) shut down its three  remaining plutonium production reactors by 2000; (2) not restart any other  plutonium production reactors that had been shut down prior to signing of  the agreement; and (3) not use plutonium produced by the three reactors in  nuclear weapons. At the same time, the United States agreed that it would  not restart any of its plutonium production reactors. However, the 1994  agreement never entered into force because the United States and Russia  could not agree upon who would pay for alternative sources of heat and  electricity to replace the reactors. A new agreement, signed by Gore and  Chernomyrdin in 1997, addressed this problem by committing the United  States and Russia to share the cost of modifying the cores of the reactors so  that they could continue to provide heat and electricity while no longer  producing spent (used) fuel that could be easily converted into weapons- grade plutonium. This agreement, which entered into force immediately,  banned the restart of previously shutdown plutonium production reactors,  prohibited Russia\u2019s use of newly produced plutonium in nuclear weapons,  and established a monitoring regime under which U.S. and Russian  personnel regularly inspect previously shutdown plutonium production  reactors. In addition, under the agreement, U.S. representatives verify the  quantities of plutonium that have been produced by the three Russian  reactors since 1997 and determine that this material is kept in storage  rather than being used in nuclear weapons. Also in 1997, the Department of  Defense (DOD) was assigned formal responsibility for managing the U.S.  effort to modify the reactors, with technical assistance from the  Department of Energy (DOE) and its national laboratories. Between fiscal  years 1994 and 2001, the United States spent approximately $42.5 million to  explore the feasibility of modifying the reactors. However, numerous  technical and political obstacles slowed the effort to modify the reactors,  and the program languished.", "In 2001, the United States and Russia agreed to pursue another option to  bring about the closure of the reactors: building or refurbishing fossil fuel  plants to replace a significant amount of the heat and electricity now  produced by the reactors. The management of the program was transferred  from DOD to DOE in December 2002, as the result of a review of all U.S.  nonproliferation programs led by the National Security Council. The  National Nuclear Security Administration manages DOE\u2019s effort, which is  known as the Elimination of Weapons-Grade Plutonium Production  program (hereafter referred to as the program). In March 2003, the  Secretary of Energy and the Minister of Atomic Energy of the Russian  Federation (MINATOM) signed an amendment to the 1997 agreement, as  well as a new implementing reactor shutdown agreement between DOE  and MINATOM, whereby the United States agreed to fund the construction  or refurbishment of two fossil fuel plants to replace the three plutonium  production reactors. Russia agreed to shut down all three reactors by 2006.  Specifically, Russia agreed to shut down the reactors as soon as the  replacement fossil fuel plants are able to provide sufficient heat and  electricity to the cities of Seversk and Zheleznogorsk. The agreement also  stated that Russia would (1) assume responsibility for the fuel, operation,  and maintenance of the replacement fossil fuel plants and for their  commissioning and (2) remain responsible for the decommissioning of the  plutonium production reactors following their shutdown.", "In this context, you asked us to review DOE\u2019s program to help Russia shut  down these reactors. This report (1) describes DOE\u2019s efforts to manage and  implement the program since it was transferred from DOD, (2) assesses the  challenges that DOE faces in achieving its goal of shutting down the  reactors, and (3) identifies DOE\u2019s current expenditures and projected costs  to implement the program. To address these objectives, we interviewed  U.S. officials from DOE, DOD, and the Department of State (State), the  Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Pacific Northwest National  Laboratory (PNNL), and the National Energy Technology Laboratory on  matters related to U.S. efforts to secure the shutdown of Russia\u2019s  plutonium production reactors. In September 2003, we interviewed  officials in Moscow from the Ministry of Atomic Energy of the Russian  Federation; Rosatomstroi, the primary Russian contractor; and  Gosatomnadzor, the Russian nuclear regulatory agency. In addition, we  went to the cities of Seversk and Zheleznogorsk, where the plutonium  production reactors are currently in operation and interviewed scientists,  plant managers, city officials, and reactor operators. We also analyzed  current program cost and expenditure data from DOE. More detail on our  scope and methodology can be found in appendix II. We conducted our  work between June 2003 and April 2004 in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["During the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union built a total of  27 nuclear reactors to produce weapons-grade plutonium for nuclear  weapons. Although all nuclear reactors produce plutonium as a byproduct  of their operation, plutonium production reactors are specifically designed  to produce a concentrated isotope of plutonium that is more readily used in  nuclear weapons. (See app. III for additional information about the  plutonium production nuclear fuel cycle.) The United States constructed 14  plutonium production reactors of which only one, the N-reactor at Hanford,  Washington, produced electricity in addition to weapons-grade plutonium.  This reactor was shut down in 1987 for safety upgrades following the  Chernobyl accident and never resumed operation. The United States had  shut down all of its plutonium production reactors by 1989.", "The Soviet Union built 13 plutonium production reactors, and all but 3 have  been shut down. (For a time line showing the history of these reactors and  efforts to bring about their closure, see app. IV.) The three remaining  reactors began operating between 1964 and 1968, and U.S. and Russian  nuclear experts told us that these reactors are among the most dangerous  in the world due to their age and poor design. In addition, the reactors lack  safety features such as a containment structure, which is generally a steel- lined concrete, dome-like structure that serves as a barrier to the release of  radioactive material during an accident. The lack of containment presents a  greater risk for the two reactors at Seversk because, unlike the reactor at  Zheleznogorsk, which is located inside a mountain, the Seversk reactors  are above ground. Figure 1 shows the location of the Russian reactors.", "According to Russian officials in Seversk, the two reactors currently  provide about 70 percent of the heat and electricity for the city\u2019s residents.  However, the reactors have the capacity to produce more heat and  electricity than is needed to meet the demands of Seversk\u2019s residents, and  both heat and electricity have been sold to the nearby city of Tomsk since  1973. Officials in Zheleznogorsk told us that the reactor there provides 60  percent of the city\u2019s heat and 98 percent of its electricity. The amounts of  replacement heat and electricity that the United States and Russia agreed  to in the March 2003 reactor shutdown agreement are less than what is  currently provided by the reactors, but Russian officials from both cities  told us the agreed upon amounts would be sufficient to meet their needs  once the reactors are shut down.", "Commissioned in the mid-1960s, the three reactors have continued to  operate although, according to Russian officials, they were originally  designed to have an operating life of 20 years. Officials from Russia\u2019s  nuclear regulatory agency, Gosatomnadzor, told us that since the 1960s,  there have been at least three serious accidents and several minor incidents  at one of the Seversk reactors. For example, in 1966, a coolant pipe  ruptured, resulting in the release of contaminants into the atmosphere near  the reactor site. Subsequently, the same reactor experienced a partial  meltdown that damaged part of the core. Finally, in 1999, the reactor  experienced another serious incident when spent fuel was ejected onto the  top of the reactor."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOE Has Overall Program Plan in Place, but the Large Number of Organizations Involved in the Program Could Delay Progress", "paragraphs": ["Since the program was transferred from DOD to DOE in December 2002,  DOE (1) has developed an overall program plan to manage the construction  of the fossil fuel plants, (2) has selected two U.S. contractors to oversee  work on the replacement fossil fuel plants, and (3) is working with its U.S.  contractors to review design and construction plans for the plants.

The program  management elements in DOE\u2019s plan are detailed in DOE order 413.3,  which the department uses for construction projects and the acquisition of  capital assets in the United States. Under DOE order 413.3, the program  will move through five critical decision points, the major stages of design  and construction, upon the approval of DOE\u2019s Deputy Secretary. These  critical decisions are formal determinations that allow the project to  proceed to the next phase and commit additional resources. Critical  decisions are required during the planning and execution of a project, for  example, before beginning conceptual design, before starting  construction, and when beginning operations. (For more detailed  information about DOE\u2019s management plan, see app. V.)", "DOE has also selected two U.S. contractors to oversee work on the two  plants. In mid-2003, DOE awarded contracts to (1) Washington Group  International (WGI) to oversee Russia\u2019s refurbishment of an existing fossil  fuel plant at Seversk and (2) Raytheon Technical Services (Raytheon) to  oversee Russia\u2019s construction of a new fossil fuel plant at Zheleznogorsk.  These contracts cover the preliminary design phase of the projects. DOE  plans to evaluate the performance of both contractors at the conclusion of  the preliminary design phase. According to DOE, an extension or new  contract would be required to cover the final design phase, construction,  and closeout phases. In addition, DOE employs the National Energy  Technology Laboratory, a DOE national laboratory that has historically  focused on the development of advanced technologies related to coal and  natural gas, to accomplish various management support tasks.", "Finally, DOE, together with its contractors, is reviewing the detailed design  and construction plans that Russian subcontractors are developing for the  fossil fuel plants at Seversk and Zheleznogorsk. At Seversk, DOE plans to  refurbish an existing fossil fuel plant, which was built in 1953. To meet the  heat and electricity production levels specified in the March 2003  agreement, DOE plans to replace one boiler (boilers burn coal to produce  heat and steam); upgrade the plant\u2019s 12 existing boilers to improve their  efficiency and performance; and replace three turbine-generators, which  use the steam produced by the boilers to generate electricity. (See app. VI  for more information about the operation of coal-fired power plants.) In  addition, DOE plans to improve the infrastructure at the plant by, among  other things, enhancing the coal-handling system and improving the plant\u2019s  water chemistry system. DOE plans to complete the refurbishment of the  fossil fuel plant at Seversk by 2008. At Zheleznogorsk, DOE plans to  construct a new fossil fuel power plant that is powered by coal to meet the  heat and electricity production levels specified in the March 2003  agreement. This new plant is scheduled for completion in 2011. Since the  plants are being built to Russian standards, DOE plans to use Russian  environmental, safety, and health standards in the construction of the fossil  fuel plants rather than U.S. standards. However, in addition to satisfying all  Russian regulations, DOE\u2019s contractors are responsible for identifying  potential environmental concerns resulting from emissions at the plants  and comparing the Russian environmental standards with applicable  international standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concerns Exist About the Large Number of Program Participants and the Primary Russian Contractor\u2019s Lack of Experience and Staff", "paragraphs": ["We identified 17 U.S. and Russian organizations that are participating in the  program. In total, these organizations have a variety of roles and  responsibilities, including setting policy and direction, providing technical  assistance, and managing and overseeing the program. In addition, there  are numerous Russian subcontractors who will be responsible for  supplying, manufacturing, or installing equipment for the replacement  fossil fuel plants. Specifically, in addition to DOE, the U.S. organizations  participating in the program include the following:  The National Nuclear Security Administration, a separately organized  agency within DOE that oversees the program;  Washington Group International is DOE\u2019s primary integrating contractor  for refurbishing the Seversk replacement fossil fuel plant;  Raytheon Technical Services is DOE\u2019s primary integrating contractor for  building the Zheleznogorsk plant. Raytheon has subcontracted some of  its work to the U.S. construction firm Fluor;  The National Energy Technology Laboratory performs various  management support tasks for DOE and has two primary  subcontractors, Energy and Environmental Solutions and Concurrent  Technologies Corporation, which provide management support to  DOE\u2019s program. Additionally, Concurrent Technologies Corporation  subcontracts some work on the program to Parsons; and  PNNL had been the lead contractor for DOE\u2019s planned Nuclear Safety  Upgrades Project. Though this project was cancelled in February 2004,  PNNL will still have limited participation in developing a reactor  shutdown plan.", "In addition to MINATOM, numerous Russian participants in the program  include the following:  Rosatomstroi, the primary Russian contractor working for MINATOM  on building the replacement fossil fuel plants;  Tvel-Finance supports WGI on the Seversk fossil fuel plant project and  is a subcontractor to Rosatomstroi;  The Siberian Chemical Combine in Seversk operates the two reactors  there and owns the fossil fuel plant that DOE plans to refurbish;  Tomsk Teploelectroproekt is a subcontractor to Rosatomstroi and is  responsible for developing the refurbishment design for the  replacement fossil fuel plant at Seversk;  The Mining and Chemical Combine operates the reactor in   The Experimental Design Bureau for Machine Building (OKBM) was  involved in the development of many of DOE\u2019s planned safety upgrades  for the reactors and is involved in developing the reactor shutdown plan.", "Figure 2 shows the relationships between key program participants.", "DOE officials told us that the numerous organizations involved in managing  this complex program makes coordination difficult and has led to delays.  For example, at Zheleznogorsk, the acquisition of the proposed site to build  the replacement fossil fuel plant was delayed for 9 months because a  dispute over the value of the land among MINATOM; the Mining and  Chemical Combine, which is responsible for operating the reactor; and a  local Siberian power utility. Raytheon officials told us that the project  experienced a \u201cday-to-day\u201d slippage while the land acquisition issue  remained unresolved. To improve program management, DOE plans to hire  a resident officer in charge of construction who will reside in Russia for the  duration of the program. Specifically, the resident officer\u2019s responsibilities  will include (1) ensuring that contractual work is carried out, (2) providing  daily reviews of contractor progress, (3) monitoring the quality of work  being performed, and (4) assisting in early identification and resolution of  construction problems.", "DOE and U.S. contractor officials also told us that the primary Russian  contractor, Rosatomstroi, has not previously worked with U.S. contractors  on large-scale construction projects and does not currently have staff to  effectively implement its part of the program, which may lead to additional  program delays. Rosatomstroi was created in 2002 and has a limited budget  and little authority to make decisions on behalf of the Russian government  without the approval of MINATOM. Because MINATOM designated  Rosatomstroi as the primary Russian integrating contractor, DOE must rely  on Rosatomstroi to manage Russia\u2019s part of the program, which includes  overseeing the numerous Russian subcontractors. Rosatomstroi officials  told us in September 2003 that they had 8 employees dedicated to the  program but that they plan to add about 40 additional staff as the Seversk  and Zheleznogorsk fossil fuel plant projects progress from the design phase  to construction. Officials from both U.S. contractors said that one of their  most difficult initial tasks has been to mentor Rosatomstroi personnel on  project management and Western business practices. WGI officials told us  that this task has taken much-needed time away from other planning  aspects of the Seversk project. For their part, Rosatomstroi officials  expressed concern that DOE\u2019s use of two U.S. integrating contractors to  provide day-to-day project oversight is burdensome because it forces them  to adapt to different management systems and reporting requirements.", "Despite their efforts to develop a sound management structure, DOE  officials told us that successful program implementation ultimately  depends on Russia\u2019s commitment and cooperation. A recent assessment of  DOE's program by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) reinforces  the need for Russia\u2019s cooperation to improve the program\u2019s chances for  success. OMB pointed out that DOE must rely on Russia to create  conditions that will not limit the effectiveness and efficiency of the  program to shut down the reactors. Furthermore, OMB stated that Russia\u2019s  creation of these conditions is largely out of DOE's control and is a  potential flaw in the structure of the program. However, a Department of  State official told us that he believes Russia has every incentive to  cooperate in the program because shutting down the reactors and  obtaining replacement heat and electricity sources is in Russia\u2019s interest."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOE Faces Challenges in Its Efforts to Shut Down the Reactors, Including Obtaining Russia\u2019s Support to Implement Key Nonproliferation and Safety Initiatives", "paragraphs": ["Final shutdown of Russia\u2019s three plutonium production reactors is  uncertain because DOE faces challenges in implementing its program.  Perhaps the most important of these challenges is ensuring Russia\u2019s  commitment to key aspects of the program. Russia\u2019s recent rejection of  DOE\u2019s initiatives to reduce the amount of plutonium being produced by the  reactors and to improve the safety of the reactors prior to their shutdown  raises serious questions about Russia\u2019s commitment to the fundamental  nonproliferation and safety goals of the program. A second challenge DOE  faces is that the existing reactor shutdown agreement does not specify the  steps needed to complete the shutdown of the reactors and the specific  requirements that must be met to license and commission the replacement  fossil fuel plants. Furthermore, the agreement contains shutdown dates  that are not realistic. Finally, thousands of Russian nuclear workers who  are currently employed at the reactors and related facilities will be  displaced when the reactors are closed.

Because closure of the reactors  will not occur until the fossil fuel plants are built and suitable heat and  electricity sources are provided, DOE and MINATOM discussed interim  measures to reduce the amount of plutonium produced by the reactors  before they are shut down, as well as measures to accelerate the reactors\u2019  shutdown. According to DOE officials, Russia\u2019s support for this initiative  would have clearly signaled a commitment to the nonproliferation goal of  the program. In July 2003, DOE and Russian officials identified three  options to reduce the reactors\u2019 output of plutonium while the replacement  fossil fuel plants are being built: (1) extending the period during the  summer when the reactors are shut down for maintenance and refueling,  (2) shutting down one of the two reactors at Seversk once the  refurbishment of the fossil fuel plant reaches an agreed-upon level of  completion, and (3) shutting down the reactor at Zheleznogorsk before the  fossil fuel plant is completed but after it is able to supply an adequate  amount of heat to the city. DOE believed that pursuing all of the reduction  options could reduce the amount of weapons-grade plutonium produced by  the reactors before their planned shutdown dates by up to 25 percent, or  one-third metric ton, annually.", "DOE officials told us that the first option, extending summer outage  periods, held the greatest promise for reducing plutonium production at  the earliest possible date, which DOE believed could occur in the summer  of 2004. Russian reactor officials in Zheleznogorsk told us that extending  summer outage periods would be the easiest option to reduce the  production of plutonium. Because the initiative to reduce the production of  plutonium is outside the scope of DOE\u2019s program to build replacement  fossil fuel plants, DOE obtained funding from the Department of State\u2019s  Nonproliferation and Disarmament Fund to support the estimated $380,000  cost of studying the three plutonium production reduction options. DOE  also planned to solicit participation from other countries to help fund these  efforts.", "In November 2003, the First Deputy Minister of MINATOM stated in a letter  to DOE that Russia no longer wanted to explore the possibility of reducing  the amount of plutonium produced while the reactors continue to operate  and that pursuing such options could affect the time frame of closing the  reactors. According to the letter, \u201c not find it worthwhile to  waste efforts on a project for reducing plutonium production prior to the  permanent shutdown of the reactors.\u201d The letter also stated that Russia\u2019s  main objective was to shut down the reactors as soon as possible. In  response to the letter, DOE is no longer pursuing extending summer  outages at the reactors as an option for reducing the amount of plutonium  produced. A Department of State official told us that Russia\u2019s decision to  reject this proposal was likely based on its security concerns about  providing U.S. personnel with access to the reactors for the purpose of  monitoring and verifying the reduced amount of plutonium that would be  produced.", "In December 2003, MINATOM requested that DOE fund a study to examine  the possibility of shutting down one of the Seversk reactors prior to the  completion of the replacement fossil fuel plant. To achieve the early  closure of one of the reactors, MINATOM proposed that the refurbishment  of the Seversk plant could be accelerated through the advanced  procurement of certain major components such as the boiler. However,  unlike extending the summer outage periods, this option could not be  implemented in mid-2004."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOE Canceled Its $21 Million Program to Improve the Safety of the Reactors after Russia Rejected DOE\u2019s Proposed Assistance", "paragraphs": ["As part of the reactor shutdown agreement, DOE pledged to improve the  safe operation of the reactors; and to accomplish this goal, DOE planned to  fund a $21 million effort, consisting of 28 safety upgrade projects\u2014such as  fire safety system improvements, enhancements to emergency electrical  power systems, and risk assessments. DOE selected PNNL to oversee the  installation of the safety projects. DOE\u2019s original plan called for work on  the upgrade projects, including design work and contracting activities, to  take place during a 24-month period\u2014beginning in mid-2003 and ending by  mid-2005\u2014in order to maximize the benefits of the safety enhancements  before the reactors are shut down.

In February 2004, the failure to resolve this issue led  MINATOM to reject DOE\u2019s planned assistance to improve the safety of the  reactors and instead to say it would undertake necessary safety  improvements on its own.

Additionally, he noted that even if  Russia decides to install the upgrades, they may not be of sufficient quality  or quantity to reduce the risk posed by the reactors\u2019 continued operation. A  PNNL program official also expressed doubt that Russia would pursue  upgrading the reactors. He noted that without DOE\u2019s planned safety  upgrades, the reactors would continue to deteriorate until they are finally  shut down. None of the reactors would be licensed for operation in the  United States or Western countries because they lack modern safety  controls, and at least one reactor has experienced structural damage  causing obstructions in the channels where control rods are inserted in  case the reactor must be shut down in an emergency. The control rods are  devices used to control the rate of nuclear reactions in a reactor. In the  view of the PNNL official, it is likely that all three reactors have  experienced such damage.", "The deteriorating safety conditions present a greater danger at the two  Seversk reactors than at Zheleznogorsk, because unlike the Zheleznogorsk  reactor, the reactors at Seversk are located above ground. Furthermore,  one of the Seversk reactors has experienced multiple accidents, including  one that resulted in the expulsion of fuel elements onto the top of the  reactor in 1999. Based on our analysis, the reactors are showing the wear of  having been run for a very long time at a high output. The danger that these  reactors present is the risk of a catastrophic reactor failure\u2014such as a loss  of coolant accident\u2014which would result in a fire expelling the highly  enriched uranium fuel and its fission byproducts such as plutonium and  strontium-90, all of which are highly toxic and carcinogenic. The danger  from such a fire is that radioactive particles would be dispersed and  breathed into the body, causing either kidney damage from particles of  uranium or cancer from particles of strontium-90 and plutonium. (For our  technical analysis of the safety problems posed by the reactors, see app.  VIII.)", "Regardless of the safety condition of the reactors, Russian officials stated  that they plan to run the reactors until replacement energy is provided to  the residents of Seversk and Zheleznogorsk.

DOE indicated that agreeing on these issues and developing a  specific plan of action to complete the program is critical to success.

However, according to DOE, Department  of State, and Russian officials, these dates are no longer realistic because  DOE does not plan to complete the replacement fossil fuel plant in Seversk  until 2008 or the plant in Zheleznogorsk until 2011. Russian officials have  reiterated that they will not shut down the reactors until the agreed-upon  replacement power and heat generating capacity are provided by the  United States. DOE and Department of State officials told us that the  current agreement would be amended to reflect DOE\u2019s planned schedule  for the completion of the fossil fuel plants once project designs are  completed. Failure to secure specific agreement on these changes could  put program success at risk as it has for other U.S. nonproliferation efforts.", "Specifically, in the past, some U.S. nonproliferation efforts that were  dependent on Russian cooperation have been canceled or adversely  affected in part because of a lack of specific agreements and coordination  between relevant U.S. and Russian organizations. Notable examples  include two large-scale construction projects in Russia that were managed  by DOD under the Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) program\u2014a  facility to dispose of liquid propellant used to fuel Russian ballistic missiles  at Krasnoyarsk and the Fissile Material Storage Facility at Mayak. In both  cases, DOD did not secure specific provisions in the agreements that  addressed all program risks to the projects.", "In 1993, DOD agreed to help Russia dispose of liquid propellant used to  fuel Russian ballistic missiles and eventually agreed to finance the  construction of a disposal facility. In February 2002, after $96 million  had been spent on the project, DOD officials learned that Russia had  used the liquid propellant in its space program but had failed to notify  DOD. As a result, DOD canceled construction of the facility and  terminated the project. The DOD Inspector General found that Russia  used the rocket fuel without DOD\u2019s knowledge because the agreements  with Russia did not require it to provide the fuel to DOD for disposal and  did not provide DOD with access rights over the fuel\u2019s storage.", "In another case, the United States agreed to build a storage facility in  Mayak, Russia, for fissile materials, including highly enriched uranium  and plutonium. However, the agreement did not provide DOD with  rights to verify the source of the fissile material to be stored in the  facility, nor did it specify the amount or type of fissile material Russia  was required to deposit in the facility. By July 2003, DOD had spent  $372.8 million on fissile material containers and the design and  construction of the facility. However, in July 2003, MINATOM notified  DOD that Russia would store only 25 metric tons of plutonium at the  facility, while converting its highly enriched uranium into low enriched  uranium to sell to the United States for use in civilian nuclear power  plants. As a result, only one-fourth of the facility\u2019s storage capacity will  be used.", "The DOD Inspector General concluded that for future CTR projects,  implementing agreements should be negotiated that would \u201crequire Russia  to provide the United States with all the necessary resources to assure that  assistance is used for intended purposes.\u201d As a result of congressional  concern and in response to recommendations from the DOD Inspector  General, the CTR program has taken several steps to protect the  investment of U.S. funds and improve program oversight, including  replacing good faith obligations from Russia with specific legal  commitments before proceeding with any current or future CTR projects."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOE Has Not Developed a Plan to Coordinate the Shutdown of the Reactors with Other U.S. Efforts to Employ Thousands of Displaced Russian Nuclear Workers", "paragraphs": ["DOE officials told us that worker transition issues at Seversk and  Zheleznogorsk have the potential to undermine efforts to shut down the  reactors and present major challenges for the program.

However, because DOE\u2019s estimates are based  on Russian cost projections developed between 2000 and 2001, which DOE  has not validated, the final cost to build the replacement fossil fuel plants is  uncertain. According to DOE officials, revised cost estimates are currently  being developed by DOE\u2019s contractors and are likely to be significantly  higher than the original estimate, possibly totaling as much as $1 billion.  For example, the original estimate did not include the costs of U.S. and  Russian integrating contractors. Several other factors contributing to the  projected cost increase include the high rate of inflation in Russia, higher  than expected Russian labor and overhead rates, and unanticipated  problems with the design plans for both plants. For example, DOE officials  told us that the initial cost estimates for the Seversk plant were based on an  existing Russian design for the refurbishment, which DOE believed to be at  an advanced stage. However, after DOE and WGI began examining the  design documents, they found that much of the design was incomplete. As  a result, Russian contractors will perform additional design work, which  will contribute to increased project costs.

The Department of State official also noted that the U.S.  government decided that the U.S. interest in pursuing the objective of the  earliest possible shutdown of the reactors overrode its interest in a  potentially fairer allocation of costs for building the replacement fossil fuel  plants.

However,  implementing this complex and technically challenging program is  becoming an increasingly risky undertaking for DOE. Some actions that  Russia has taken raise serious questions about its commitment to the  nonproliferation and safety-related goals of DOE\u2019s program. We believe, as  do some DOE officials, that Russia could have demonstrated good faith by  reducing the amount of plutonium produced by the reactors in the period  before they are shut down. This could have been accomplished by  extending the amount of time the reactors are shut down for maintenance  during the summer months\u2014a proposal that Russian officials told us could  be easily accomplished. However, Russia informed DOE that it had no  interest in pursuing this opportunity. While Russia\u2019s unwillingness to  consider this proposal represents a setback, we believe that extending the  summer outage periods for the reactors furthers U.S. nonproliferation  objectives and would meet an important national security goal. In addition,  DOE was willing to spend over $20 million to improve the safety of these  reactors, which have been characterized as being among the most unsafe  reactors operating today. In this case, Russia also rejected DOE\u2019s planned  assistance to improve the reactors\u2019 safety and claims that it will make its  own safety improvements. We believe that the continued operation of these  reactors, given their current age and condition, presents a significant and  growing safety risk. Without implementing DOE\u2019s proposed safety  upgrades, the safety risks posed by the reactors will continue to increase  dramatically.", "Although the existing agreement between DOE and Russia\u2019s Ministry of  Atomic Energy governing the shutdown of Russia\u2019s plutonium production  reactors provides a general framework for cooperation, there are no  guarantees that the reactors will be shut down within DOE\u2019s projected time  frames. Furthermore, the agreement does not specify what steps must be  taken to shut down the reactors and what specific requirements must be  met to certify the completion of the replacement fossil fuel plants. Without  defining these steps and specific requirements, DOE will be unable to  develop accurate estimates for the true scope and cost of its program or be  able to determine more precisely when the reactors will be shut down. The  history of U.S.-Russian nonproliferation activities has demonstrated that  some well-intentioned programs have had limited success because the  agreements governing them lacked specificity or oversight was inadequate.  The lessons of the past should be carefully considered as DOE moves  forward with its program. Furthermore, the existing time frames for  shutting down the reactors reflected in the agreement are neither accurate  nor achievable. DOE, Department of State, and Russian officials recognize  that the shutdown dates in the agreement are unrealistic and will need to  be revised to reflect DOE\u2019s schedule for the completion of the fossil fuel  plants. Because of the history of failed efforts to secure the reactors\u2019  closure and the inability to achieve previously agreed upon shutdown dates  for these reactors, we believe it would be in the best interests of the United  States to revise the agreement in order to have increased assurances that  the reactors will be permanently shut down.", "A major consequence of DOE\u2019s program to assist Russia\u2019s closure of the  reactors will be the displacement of thousands of Russian nuclear workers  who are currently employed at the reactors and related facilities. Many of  these workers have received specialized training in the manufacture and  reprocessing of weapons-grade nuclear material and could pose a serious  proliferation risk if unemployed because they might sell sensitive nuclear  information to terrorists or countries of concern. This looming problem, if  left unaddressed, has the potential to undermine the program. Although  DOE has started to coordinate the reactor shutdown program with the  department\u2019s other efforts to employ Russian nuclear workers\u2014 specifically the Russian Transition Initiatives\u2014it has not developed a plan  to coordinate these two nonproliferation programs. Moreover, there is no  overall U.S. government strategy that would integrate the Department of  State\u2019s International Science and Technology Center program with DOE\u2019s  programs to employ Russian weapons scientists, particularly in the cities  where the reactors will be shut down. A jointly planned effort could  strengthen U.S. nonproliferation efforts by leveraging resources and  expertise between these programs. Such a plan could also identify other  options to support employment opportunities in the two cities, including  seeking financial support from other countries.", "Estimated costs to construct the replacement fossil fuel plants are  expected to increase dramatically. With the total cost for the program  expected to be as much as $1 billion, DOE\u2019s program has taken on greater  financial risk and will require a more substantial investment of resources.  Because the United States has agreed to fully fund the costs of the  replacement plants, Russia has little incentive to control construction  costs. Russia would be more likely to show fiscal restraint if it were  responsible for funding a portion of the construction projects. In the final  analysis, this program will provide Russia with significant capital assets  that Russia would have had to finance itself if not for the assistance of the  United States. Additionally, DOE\u2019s approximately $179 million balance of  unobligated and unspent program funding raises concerns, especially in  light of the department\u2019s request for an additional $50.1 million in fiscal  year 2005.

Both agencies stated that Russia rejected these initiatives primarily due to  its security concerns about granting U.S. officials access to the reactors. In  our report, we recognized that Russia\u2019s security concerns may have played  a role in rejecting the extension of summer outages at the reactors as an  option for reducing plutonium production.

In fact, as we noted in the report,  MINATOM stated that \u201c not find it worthwhile to waste efforts  on a project for reducing plutonium production prior to the permanent  shutdown of the reactors.\u201d Instead, MINATOM claimed that it wanted to  focus on the earliest possible shutdown of the reactors. As we noted in our  report, both U.S. and Russian officials told us that extending summer  outages to reduce the current production of weapons-grade plutonium held  great promise and would be an easy option to implement.

All  three of the reactors were built using old designs derived from the original  reactor run by Enrico Fermi in the 1940s. According to officials from  MINATOM, the Russian nuclear regulatory agency Gosatomnadzor, and the  Kurchatov Institute\u2014the leading civilian nuclear research institute in  Russia\u2014the reactors must be shut down by 2010. However, the reactor  managers at Seversk believed that the continuous repairs to the reactors  over the years are increasing the operating life and that further safety  upgrades could allow the reactors to operate until 2014. In our view, all  three reactors are showing the wear of having been run for a very long time  at very high output, and all have had accidents\u2014some as recently as 5  years ago.", "The safety risks posed by these reactors are a function of three factors: (1)  all three reactors have been running at a very high output, producing both  high temperatures and high neutron flux (the number of neutrons passing  through a sphere one square-centimeter in cross-section during a unit of  time) for their entire lives; (2) all three reactors have run approximately  twice as long as they were originally designed to operate; and (3) none of  these reactors meet current reactor safety standards. The danger that these  reactors present is the risk of a catastrophic reactor failure\u2014such as a loss  of coolant accident\u2014which would result in a fire expelling the highly  enriched uranium fuel and its fission byproducts such as plutonium and  strontium-90, all of which are highly toxic and carcinogenic. The danger  from such a fire is that radioactive particles would be dispersed and  breathed into the body, causing either kidney damage from particles of  uranium or cancer from particles of strontium-90 and plutonium.", "All three reactors are designed to run at rated power, which is the original  power output level of a reactor in terms of temperature output (t), and  electrical output (e). According to Gosatomnadzor, the rating for the  reactors is 800 megawatts (t) each. A Gosatomnadzor official informed us  that the reactors could run at 20 percent higher than their original rating, or  at 960 megawatts (t), and that the reactors had run at an elevated level  during a 20-year period. In our opinion, Gosatomnadzor\u2019s estimates are  probably conservative because, based on the amount of fuel that can be  used by the reactors and the fuel type that has been used, each reactor has  the ability to run at a power level up to 2,500 megawatts (t) and has been  run at a power level of at least 2,000 megawatts. If these reactors were  originally designed to run at 800 megawatts (t), then they may have run at  three times their original design rating. This will definitely shorten the  operating life of the reactors, which makes their continued operation risky.", "Russian officials that we met disagree over both the original life spans of  the reactors and how much longer the reactors can be operated before the  risk of a catastrophic failure becomes too high. According to officials from  MINATOM, Gosatomnadzor, and the Kurchatov Institute, the original life  span for each of the reactors was 25 years. However, according to the  operators of the three Russian reactors, the original reactor life spans are  20 years. All three reactors have operated for approximately 40 years, or  roughly twice as long as originally designed. Gosatomnadzor confirmed  that the design life is a function of: (1) the graphite cladding\u2014which forms  the outer, protective layer of the fuel elements and (2) the steel  containment that surrounds the core. If it is assumed that the reactors have  operated at 2,500 megawatts (t) for 20 years, then the original design life of  20 years could be reduced by up to 10 years, since the super heating of the  graphite and the high neutron flux at the core center will cause much  higher degradation than if the reactors were run at their rated power levels  for their entire lives. These two factors will make the integrity of both the  graphite cladding and the steel containment highly questionable and will  increase the risk of a catastrophic failure of the reactors.", "None of the reactors meets current Russian, U.S., or international safety  standards because they lack modern safety controls and are therefore  dependent on direct operator intervention for both monitoring and safety.  MINATOM, Gosatomnadzor, and the Kurchatov Institute told us that the  personnel working at the reactors pose a safety threat because the quality  of the reactor staff is weakening due to attrition and old age. According to  Gosatomnadzor, the average age of reactor workers is 50, and the reactors  are experiencing an increased number of temporary emergency shutdowns  due to operator error, not the technology itself. Conversely, reactor officials  at Seversk were concerned that the attrition of older workers will result in  the loss of the knowledge and the ability of people that have become  familiar with the reactors over many years. Although the Russian  organizations disagree over the cause of the increased rate of accidents,  there is a consensus that workforce attrition will have an impact on the  safe operation of the reactors because it is likely that the reactor workers  are the first and last line of defense against reactor accidents."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Department of Energy", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Department of State", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": ["Jim Shafer, 202-512-3841."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual listed above, R.
