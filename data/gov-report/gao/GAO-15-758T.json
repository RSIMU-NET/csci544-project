These  control categories are (1) limiting, preventing, and detecting  inappropriate access to computer resources; (2) managing the  configuration of software and hardware; (3) segregating duties to  ensure that a single individual does not have control over all key  aspects of a computer-related operation; (4) planning for continuity of  operations in the event of a disaster or disruption; and (5)  implementing agency-wide security management programs that are  critical to identifying control deficiencies, resolving problems, and  managing risks on an ongoing basis. (See fig. 3.)", "Examples of these weaknesses include: (1) granting users access  permissions that exceed the level required to perform their legitimate  job-related functions; (2) not ensuring that only authorized users can  access an agency\u2019s systems; (3) not using encryption to protect  sensitive data from being intercepted and compromised; (4) not  updating software with the current versions and latest security  patches to protect against known vulnerabilities; and (5) not ensuring  employees were trained commensurate with their responsibilities. We  and agency inspectors general have made hundreds of  recommendations to agencies aimed at improving their  implementation of these information security controls.", "Enhancing oversight of contractors providing IT services. In  August 2014, we reported that five of six agencies we reviewed were  inconsistent in overseeing assessments of contractors\u2019  implementation of security controls.

In addition, the 6 agencies we reviewed  had not fully developed comprehensive policies, plans, and  procedures to guide their incident response activities.
