The methods and practices for testing and evaluating controls at the six agencies were not adequate to ensure that assessments were consistent, of similar quality, and repeatable. For example, these agencies did not always sufficiently document their test methods and results, did not define the assessment methods to be used when evaluating security controls, did not test security controls as prescribed, and did not include previously reported remedial actions or weaknesses in their test plans to ensure they had been addressed. As a result, agencies may not have reasonable assurance that controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements of the agency.
