GAO found that leadership responsibilities for UN procurement are highly diffused. While the UN Department of Management is responsible for UN procurement, field procurement staff are instead supervised by the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations, which currently lacks the expertise and capacities needed to manage field procurement activities. Also, the UN has not demonstrated a commitment to maintaining a qualified, professional procurement workforce. It has not established training requirements or a procurement career path. In addition, the UN has yet to establish specific ethics guidance for procurement staff in response to long-standing mandates by the UN General Assembly, despite recent findings of unethical behavior. GAO also found weaknesses in key control activities. For example, the UN has not addressed workload and resource problems that are impeding the ability of a key committee to review high-value contracts. Also, the UN has yet to establish an independent process to review vendor complaints, despite long-standing recommendations that it do so. In addition, the UN has not updated its procurement manual since 2004.

The Department of Management subsequently drafted a  delegation of procurement authority that would have required the  Peacekeeping Department to provide trained procurement staff at each  peacekeeping mission with procurement authority and to establish  headquarters systems to administer and monitor field procurement  activities. However, the Department of Management\u2019s delegation of  authority did not provide for a transfer of procurement staff to the  Peacekeeping Department.

For  example, a November 2005 consultant report stated that Procurement  Service staff did not appear to have a clear understanding of procurement  policies and procedures, resulting in inconsistent application of  procurement policies. In addition, OIOS found that field procurement  staff in one of the largest peacekeeping missions lack sufficient knowledge  of basic procurement policies and procedures. OIOS also found that, in  another mission, requisitioning units that lacked procurement authority  had directly purchased $9 million in goods and services during the start-up  phase, violating the principle of segregation of duties between  requisitioners and procurement staff. Moreover, most procurement staff  lack professional certifications attesting to their procurement education,  training, and experience.

While most field procurement chiefs stated that their  staff are adequately trained, all of them said that their staff would benefit  from additional training, citing areas such as contract drafting and  management, negotiation, business writing, and bid evaluation. Recently, a  UN interagency group developed common certification standards for  procurement staff in all UN agencies. However, the decision for a UN  agency to participate in the certification program is voluntary.

Some indicated that a single field individual\u2019s  attendance at an annual conference of chief procurement officers  consumed the mission\u2019s annual allotment for procurement training.  Peacekeeping Department officials noted that the lack of resources to train  field procurement officers is symptomatic of the general lack of  professional development funding for all peacekeeping mission personnel.", "The UN has not established a career path for professional advancement for  Procurement Service and peacekeeping procurement staff. Career paths,  if well designed by management, can actively encourage and support staff  to undertake progressive training and work experiences in order to prepare  them for increased levels of responsibility. A procurement career path also  would serve to recognize procurement as a specialized profession in the  UN. A November 2005 consultant report recommended that the Secretariat  establish and define career paths for Procurement Service management  and staff. In field missions, most procurement chiefs told us that the  absence of a career path is detrimental to the professional caliber of  procurement staff. In addition, 14 of 19 field procurement officials told us  that they do not have professional development plans for all of their staff.  UN auditors also have expressed concern that UN managers do not give  proper care to helping ensure the qualifications and integrity of  procurement staff.", "Difficult staffing conditions and practices in both the Procurement Service  and peacekeeping missions continue to expose the UN to significant risks.  The Procurement Service reported that it lacks the staffing resources to  implement recommended controls such as team-based rather than  individual procurement, peer review of major bidding, and periodic  rotation of staff. Peacekeeping staff said that staff turnover at the  Procurement Service has also hurt the continuity of their operations. In the  field, the Peacekeeping Department faces challenges in deploying qualified,  experienced staff to missions, especially during the critical start-up phase.  For example, OIOS noted that a staff member involved in leaking  confidential information to a UN supplier had been appointed to a post on a  short-term temporary duty assignment and was later competitively selected  for the post.", "The Peacekeeping Department has had difficulties in retaining high-quality  procurement staff for sustained periods in peacekeeping missions. For  example, a peacekeeping official informed us that about 23 percent of  procurement staff positions in peacekeeping missions were vacant as of  December 2005. Peacekeeping officials informed us that a chronic lack of  field procurement staff has helped to undermine existing control  mechanisms. The peacekeeping procurement workforce is adversely  affected by considerable staff turnover, especially in peacekeeping  missions where UN staff must operate in demanding, unpredictable, and  dangerous conditions. The current conditions of service in peacekeeping  missions are not competitive with those of other UN entities or similar  organizations, according to UN officials. For example, peacekeeping  officials stated that peacekeeping mission staff are not able to have their  families at their duty station and that the benefits and short-term nature of  employment contracts for peacekeeping mission staff are disadvantageous  compared with those at UN headquarters and other UN funds and  programs. In March 2006, the Secretary-General issued proposals to revise  the UN\u2019s human resource policies to address the unfavorable conditions of  service in peacekeeping missions.

As a result, the UN  may be vulnerable to favoring certain vendors or dealing with unqualified  vendors. Approved vendor rosters are an important procurement control  activity for limiting procurement to vendors that meet stated standards.  Vendors apply for registration to the list and are then evaluated by the  agency before placement on the approved list. Effective rosters are  impartial and provide sufficient control over vendor qualifications.", "The UN has long had difficulties in maintaining effective rosters of qualified  vendors. In 1994, a high-level group of international procurement experts  concluded that the UN\u2019s vendor roster was outdated, inaccurate, and  inconsistent across all locations. It warned that inconsistent and  nonstandardized rosters could expose the procurement system to abuse  and fraud. In 2003, an OIOS report found that the Procurement Service\u2019s  roster contained questionable vendors. For example, one vendor appeared  to have been awarded approximately $36 million in contracts without  completing its registration to the list. Another vendor appeared to not have  applied for registration to the list but was nonetheless awarded a $16.6  million contract. Although the Procurement Service corrected some of the  noted weaknesses, OIOS concluded that, as of 2005, the roster was not fully  reliable as a tool for identifying qualified vendors that could bid on  contracts.", "To address such concerns, the Procurement Service became a partner in an  interagency procurement vendor roster in 2004, which was intended to  serve as a single roster for potential suppliers to apply for registration with  participating organizations within the UN system and to be used by  peacekeeping field missions. It was seen as a common system that would  allow sharing of vendor performance information within the UN.", "The UN\u2019s use of the interagency procurement vendor roster, however, has  not fully addressed concerns regarding UN vendor lists. OIOS found that  many vendors that have applied through the interagency procurement  vendor roster have not submitted additional documents requested by the  Procurement Service to become accredited vendors. In addition to the  audited financial statements and income tax returns that a vendor must  submit to be registered in the UN interagency vendor roster, the  Procurement Service also requires the vendors to submit a copy of a  certificate of incorporation, copies of quality certification standards for the  goods and services to be registered, and letters of reference from at least  three clients to which the vendor has provided its goods or services over  the past 12 months. OIOS found that, as of December 2005, about 2,800  vendor applicants had not submitted the necessary documents for the  Procurement Service to review. OIOS expressed concern that the  Procurement Service vendor registration procedure remains vulnerable to  procurement officials who might manipulate it to favor certain vendors.", "In addition, most Peacekeeping Department field procurement officials we  spoke with stated that they prefer to use their own locally developed  rosters instead of the interagency vendor roster because the local lists were  shorter and contained more specific information regarding the goods and  services available in the area near their field missions. Moreover, some field  mission procurement staff also stated that they were unable to comply with  Procurement Service regulations for their vendor rosters due to the lack of  reliable vendor information in underdeveloped countries in which there  were conflicts, as is common in peacekeeping missions. One procurement  officer in the field stated that many of the local vendors could not prepare  financial statements required by the Procurement Service and the  interagency database because the country was just starting to recover from  a war. Other field procurement officers noted that issues such as low levels  of education and literacy and smaller vendors not being in a position to  deliver internationally prevented vendors from registering on the  interagency vendor list.

For example, OIOS issued recommendations relating to collusion  and conflicts of interest between UN staff and vendors, accountability for  theft of UN property, and misuse of UN equipment. In addition, senior UN  officials identified several major risks impacting peacekeeping  procurement. First, they stated that field procurement staff currently  operate under regulations that do not always reflect differences inherent in  operating in field locations. According to Peacekeeping Department  officials, present UN procurement rules and processes are difficult to apply  in peacekeeping missions during start-up. Second, field procurement staff  work in demanding operating environments, especially during the first few  months of a mission\u2019s start-up, and must expediently resolve issues such as  uncertainties regarding the free movement of goods, customs clearances,  and taxation. Finally, the Peacekeeping Department stated that its missions  do not have enough field procurement staff willing to serve under current  conditions of service. An environment laden with such considerable risks  demonstrates the need for management to establish a comprehensive  framework for continuously identifying, analyzing, and managing risks in  procurement operations.

A November 2005 consultant report found  that the Procurement Service does not have a formal and regular risk  management process to assess compliance, evaluate risks, implement  controls, and bring serious issues to the attention of management.   Similarly, OIOS reported in January 2006 that UN management had failed to  establish and implement a formal procurement risk management strategy.  An OIOS official also identified several risk areas in the UN\u2019s procurement  operations relating to individual span of control and supervision,  segregation of functions, access to bids, and the use of brokers and  subcontractors.", "Without a risk management strategy for procurement, the UN would not be  fully equipped to identify areas that would require stronger oversight. For  example, start-up peacekeeping missions constitute a high-risk area  because they require a significant volume of procurement activity under  demanding time pressures in challenging geographic regions.

We found that Procurement Service staff had limited access to data on  procurement activities conducted locally in field missions. No single  procurement database supports both the Procurement Service and  peacekeeping missions; they utilize two separate procurement systems. As  a result, no single UN entity was able to readily provide us with data on the  total value of purchase orders and contract awards issued by each  peacekeeping mission, including actions procured both locally and by the  Procurement Service at headquarters. These issues raise concerns about  the ability of headquarters managers to comprehensively oversee  procurement by the various field missions. Moreover, the Peacekeeping  Department has established only limited reporting requirements for field  missions and lacks a full-time manager at headquarters to review the  reports of all peacekeeping missions. A November 2005 consultant study  also found that the fragmented information systems limit the Procurement  Service\u2019s ability to generate comprehensive and timely management  reports. Furthermore, the study found that the current information systems  did not use fraud detection tools and exception reports.

Senior procurement  officials at headquarters stated that they rely heavily on the auditors to  monitor procurement activity.
