For Medicaid children, NHANES data from 1999 through 2006 suggest that 18 percent of children aged 2 through 20 were obese, 4 percent of children aged 8 through 20 had high blood pressure, and 10 percent of children aged 6 through 20 had high cholesterol. Furthermore, MEPS data from 2003 through 2006 suggest that many Medicaid children were not receiving well-child check ups. For Medicaid adults aged 21 through 64, NHANES data suggest that more than half were obese or had diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, or a combination. MEPS data suggest that receipt of preventive services varied widely by service: receipt of some services, such as blood pressure tests, was high, but receipt of several other services was low. MEPS data also suggest that a lower percentage of Medicaid adults received preventive services compared to privately insured adults. For children in Medicaid, who generally are entitled to coverage of comprehensive health screenings, including well-child check ups, as part of the federally required EPSDT benefit, most but not all states reported to GAO that they monitored or set goals related to children's utilization of preventive services and had undertaken initiatives to promote their provision. Nine states reported that they did not monitor children's utilization of specific preventive services. Forty-seven states reported having multiple initiatives to improve the provision of preventive services to children. For adults in Medicaid, for whom states' Medicaid coverage of preventive services is generally not required, most states reported to GAO that they covered most but not all of eight recommended preventive services that GAO reviewed. Nearly all state Medicaid programs, 49 and 48 respectively, reported covering cervical cancer screening and mammography, and three-quarters or more states reported covering four other preventive services. Two additional recommended services--intensive counseling to address obesity or to address high cholesterol--were reported as covered by fewer than one-third of states. For children in Medicaid, CMS oversees the provision of preventive services through state EPSDT reports and reviews of EPSDT programs, but gaps in oversight remain; for adults, oversight is more limited. For children, state reports showed that, on average, 58 percent of Medicaid children who were eligible for an EPSDT service in 2007 received one; far below the federal goal of 80 percent. CMS reviewed only 11 state EPSDT programs between April 2001 and June 2009. Few states reporting low rates of service provision were reviewed. CMS guidance to states may also have gaps: a 2006 study raised concerns that providers may not be aware of coverage of obesity-related services for Medicaid children. CMS has recognized the need for but has not yet begun drafting guidance on such coverage. For adults, CMS has provided some related guidance to states, but not on the reviewed preventive services."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As one of the nation\u2019s largest health insurers, Medicaid\u2014a joint federal  and state program that finances health care coverage for certain low- income individuals and families\u2014can play a critical role in helping ensure  that the nation\u2019s children and adults receive preventive services.  Preventive services can prevent health conditions from occurring, or  screen for or diagnose existing health conditions. For example, body mass  index (BMI) measurements are used to screen for obesity, and  mammograms for breast cancer. Preventive services also include services  to manage diagnosed health conditions and prevent certain conditions  from worsening, for example, weight-reduction counseling to help manage  obesity.", "Medicaid, overseen at the federal level by the Centers for Medicare &  Medicaid Services (CMS), an agency within the Department of Health and  Human Services (HHS), provided health coverage for over 60 million low- income individuals in 2008. CMS oversees state Medicaid programs in part  by providing guidance on federal requirements, approving state Medicaid  plans, and reviewing program operations. For managed care, whereby  states contract with managed care organizations to serve Medicaid  beneficiaries, CMS\u2019s oversight includes reviewing and approving states\u2019  managed care contracts. For eligible children in Medicaid under age 21,  preventive services are generally addressed through Medicaid\u2019s Early and  Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT) benefit. Under  federal law, the EPSDT benefit generally entitles children in Medicaid to  receive coverage of periodic screening services\u2014often termed well-child  check ups\u2014that include a comprehensive health and developmental  history, a comprehensive physical exam, appropriate immunizations,  laboratory tests, and health education. For adults aged 21 and older in  Medicaid, coverage of preventive services is generally not required.", "Ensuring that children and adults in the United States receive preventive  services is a federal priority. For example, CMS has a yearly goal that each  state provide EPSDT well-child check ups to at least 80 percent of the  Medicaid children in the state who should receive one, based on the state\u2019s  periodicity schedule. As part of its Healthy People 2010 initiative, HHS has  also established health goals for the nation, including increasing the  proportion of children and adults who receive several types of preventive  services, for example, cholesterol tests. In addition, HHS sponsors the  United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), which evaluates  a broad range of preventive services for specific age and risk groups and  makes recommendations that those that are clinically effective should be  incorporated routinely into primary health care for specific populations.  Certain preventive services, including USPSTF-recommended services\u2014 such as colorectal cancer screening, mammograms, and diabetes  screening\u2014are covered by the Medicare program, the federal health  program for individuals age 65 and over.", "Because of the importance of preventive services and the role Medicaid  can play in providing them, you asked for information about preventive  services for children and adults in the Medicaid program. This report  examines  1.  the extent to which children and adults in Medicaid have certain health  conditions that can be identified or managed by preventive services,  and the extent to which they receive such services; 2.  for children in Medicaid, for whom coverage of EPSDT services is  generally required, the extent to which state Medicaid programs  monitor and promote the provision of preventive services; 3.  for adults in Medicaid, for whom coverage of preventive services is  generally not required, the extent to which state Medicaid programs  cover recommended preventive services; and 4.  the extent to which CMS oversees the provision of preventive services  for children and adults in Medicaid.", "To provide information on health conditions and receipt of certain  preventive services, we analyzed data from different nationally  representative surveys that focus on each respective area.", "To examine health conditions, we analyzed data from HHS\u2019s National  Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), conducted by the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). NHANES directly  measures health conditions through physical examinations and laboratory  tests, and interviews participants about topics such as insurance coverage  and prior diagnoses of health conditions. We used data from 1999 through  2006 (the most recent available). We grouped NHANES data from surveys  conducted from 1999 through 2006 in order to include a sufficient number  of survey participants to reliably assess health conditions in the Medicaid  population. For children, we estimated the prevalence of certain health  conditions that can be identified or managed as part of EPSDT services  and were prevalent enough to examine reliably: high blood pressure, high  cholesterol, and obesity. For adults, we estimated the prevalence of  certain health conditions that can be identified or managed by USPSTF  recommended preventive services and were prevalent enough to examine  reliably: high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, and diabetes. For  both adults and children, we analyzed data for the Medicaid and privately  insured populations.", "To examine receipt of services, we analyzed available data from the  Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), administered by HHS\u2019s Agency  for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), which interviews  participants about reasons for medical visits and use of specific health  care services. We used data from 2003 through 2006 (the most recent  available). For children, we used available MEPS data from interviews  with a parent or other adult in the child\u2019s household to estimate receipt of  well-child check ups and certain other services that could occur during  EPSDT well-child check ups: blood pressure tests, weight and height  measurement, and diet or exercise counseling. For adults, we used MEPS  data to estimate receipt of seven recommended preventive services:  blood pressure tests, cholesterol tests, cervical cancer screening,  mammography, colorectal cancer screening, diet and exercise counseling,  and influenza immunizations. In addition, to estimate receipt of diabetes  screening, a recommended preventive service for which MEPS data were  not available, we analyzed data from a related HHS survey, the 2006  National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). For both adults and children,  we analyzed data for the Medicaid and privately insured populations.", "To assess state Medicaid programs\u2019 monitoring and promotion of the  provision of preventive services to children, we surveyed 51 state  Medicaid directors (in 50 states and the District of Columbia). The survey  asked about states\u2019 monitoring of children\u2019s utilization of specific  preventive services in their fee-for-service and managed care programs,  goals for children\u2019s utilization of specific services and whether or not they  were meeting these goals, and recent initiatives states had undertaken to  promote preventive services. All 51 state Medicaid directors responded to  the survey.", "To determine the extent to which state Medicaid programs cover  recommended preventive services for adults, we surveyed state Medicaid  directors about whether the state Medicaid program covered eight  recommended preventive services: cholesterol tests, cervical cancer  screening, mammography, colorectal cancer screening, intensive  counseling to manage obesity, intensive counseling to manage high  cholesterol, influenza immunizations, and diabetes screening. We also  asked about coverage of well-adult check ups and health risk assessments,  which provide an opportunity for beneficiaries to receive some  recommended preventive services such as blood pressure tests and  obesity screening. To examine the extent to which state Medicaid  programs delineate coverage of specific preventive services through their  contracts with managed care organizations, we obtained and reviewed  sections of contracts describing what services were covered for the largest  Medicaid managed care organizations from up to two states in each of the  10 CMS regions and interviewed an expert on Medicaid managed care  contracts. We did not evaluate these Medicaid managed care  arrangements to determine whether managed care organizations were  covering services for Medicaid enrollees. We limited our review to  contract provisions we identified to provide a description of such  provisions.", "To examine CMS oversight of the provision of preventive services for  children and adults in Medicaid, we interviewed and obtained related  documentation from CMS officials, including officials in CMS\u2019s 10 regional  offices, about their oversight activities and initiatives related to the  preventive services in our review. We reviewed data from 2000 through  2007 reported by state Medicaid programs to CMS on the provision of  EPSDT well-child check ups in their programs, CMS reports summarizing  results of their EPSDT program reviews (conducted between April 2001  and June 2009), and State Medicaid Director letters and other guidance  issued by CMS related to preventive services. We also surveyed state  Medicaid directors about the support states receive, or would like, from  CMS related to coverage or oversight of preventive services.

Generally, preventive services are intended  for the following three purposes:    Prevent a health condition from occurring at all. Immunizations to  prevent diseases such as influenza or pneumonia qualify as this first type  of preventive service, called primary prevention.", "Prevent or slow a condition\u2019s progression to a more significant  health condition by detecting a disease in its early stages.  Mammograms to detect breast cancer and other screening tests to detect  disease early are examples of this second type of preventive service, called  secondary prevention.", "Prevent or slow a condition\u2019s progression to a more significant  health condition by minimizing the consequences of a disease.  Services that help management of existing health conditions, such as diet  or exercise counseling to manage obesity or medication to manage high  blood pressure, are examples of this third type of preventive service,  called tertiary prevention.", "Preventive services can help prevent or manage a number of serious  health conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and cancer. For  example, heart disease and stroke are leading causes of death and  disability in the United States, and the risk of developing these conditions  can be substantially reduced if high blood pressure and cholesterol\u2014 which can develop in children as well as adults\u2014are detected early and  managed through diet, exercise, medication, or a combination. Similarly,  diabetes is a leading cause of blindness, renal disease, and amputation,  and also contributes to heart disease. Early diagnosis and management of  diabetes, by controlling levels of blood glucose, blood pressure, and  cholesterol, can reduce the risk of these and other diabetes complications.  Finally, the importance of obesity as a health problem for both children  and adults in the United States is increasingly apparent. Obesity is  associated with an increased risk of many other serious conditions,  including heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and several types of cancer.  Overweight and obese children are at risk of health problems during their  youth, such as diabetes, and are more likely than other children to become  obese adults. Intensive counseling about diet, exercise, or both can  promote sustained weight loss for obese adults.", "The federal government has established national health objectives and  goals to monitor the health of the U.S. population, and several reflect the  importance of preventive services. Healthy People 2010, coordinated by  the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion within HHS, is a  statement of national health objectives designed to identify the most  significant preventable threats to health and to establish national goals to  reduce these threats to certain target levels. Some of the national goals  established through Healthy People 2010 include  reducing the proportion of children and adults who are obese,  reducing the proportion of adults with high blood pressure and high blood  cholesterol, reducing the overall rate of diabetes and increasing the proportion of  adults with diabetes whose condition has been diagnosed, and increasing the proportion of children and adults who receive  recommended preventive screening tests and immunizations.", "Recent reviews of progress toward these goals, however, in some cases  show no progress or even movement away from certain goals,  underscoring the importance of continued attention to prevention."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "State Medicaid Programs Must Cover Comprehensive Health Check Ups for Children", "paragraphs": ["Under federal law, state Medicaid programs generally must cover EPSDT  services for children under age 21. A key component of EPSDT services  is that it entitles children to coverage of well-child check ups, which may  target health conditions for which growing children are at risk, such as  obesity. An EPSDT well-child check up must include a comprehensive  health and developmental history, a comprehensive unclothed physical  exam, appropriate immunizations and laboratory tests, and health  education. EPSDT well-child check ups may be a vehicle to provide  preventive services to children, such as measurement of height and  weight, nutrition assessment and counseling, immunizations, blood  pressure screening, and cholesterol and other appropriate laboratory tests.", "State Medicaid programs must provide EPSDT services at intervals which  meet reasonable standards of medical and dental practice as determined  by the state and as medically necessary to determine the existence of a  suspected illness or condition. Accordingly, states either develop their  own periodicity schedules, that is, age-specific timetables that identify  when EPSDT well-child check ups and other EPSDT services should  occur, or they may adopt a nationally recognized schedule, such as that of  the American Academy of Pediatrics, which recommends well-child check  ups once each year or more frequently, depending on age. State periodicity  schedules for fiscal year 2006 generally specified multiple well-child check  ups per year for children aged 0 through 2, one well-child check up per  year for children aged 3 through 5, and a well-child check up every 1 to   2 years for children aged 6 through 20.", "The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 (OBRA 89) required the  Secretary of HHS to set annual goals for children\u2019s receipt of EPSDT  services, and CMS established a yearly goal that each state provide  EPSDT well-child check ups to at least 80 percent of the Medicaid children  in the state who should receive one, based on the state\u2019s periodicity  schedule.

In 2007, we reported that officials from several  states and national health associations stated that, although the CMS 416  was limited in its usefulness for oversight, the quality and completeness of  the underlying data that states used to prepare the CMS 416, including the  data collected from managed care organizations, had improved since  2001.", "State Medicaid programs\u2019 CMS 416 reports continue to show gaps in the  provision of EPSDT services to Medicaid children.

The reviews look at how states meet  statutory requirements\u2014such as ensuring that all eligible Medicaid  beneficiaries under 21 are informed of and have access to EPSDT  services\u2014and are conducted with the intent of identifying deficiencies  and providing recommendations and guidance to states to help improve  their programs. For example, one review assessed a state\u2019s performance in  ensuring that managed care organizations and providers understood the  benefits available under EPSDT and their respective responsibilities for  providing these services. Another review investigated whether a state had  developed an appropriate periodicity schedule and examined coordination  of children\u2019s care in the context of a managed care service delivery  system.

Nevertheless, the estimates are useful in  indicating the maximum percentages of adults who may have received  certain recommended preventive services. For example, if 40 percent of  adults aged 50 through 64 reported receiving a colorectal cancer  screening, some may have received the screen for diagnostic purposes  after experiencing symptoms of colorectal cancer.

Using sampling weights, we estimated the percentage of  adults in each health insurance category for whom a cholesterol test was  recommended, who reported that they had their cholesterol tested during  the five years prior to the question being asked. USPSTF recommends  cholesterol tests for men aged 35 and older, and men and women aged 20  and older with health conditions that are risk factors for heart disease. We  used available information about risk factors for heart disease that was  self-reported by survey participants to determine whether a cholesterol  test was recommended on this basis; these risk factors were diabetes, high  blood pressure, or BMI greater than or equal to 30.", "Mammogram.

We developed the content of  the survey based on interviews with officials from the Centers for  Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and state Medicaid programs, and a  review of documents from CMS and external reports. Some content and  changes were made after pre-testing with state Medicaid programs.", "Many of our survey questions focused on specific preventive services. For  example, the survey included questions about states\u2019 coverage for adults,  and monitoring for adults and children, of several specific preventive  services including well-child and well-adult check ups, health risk  assessments, diabetes screening, cholesterol tests, cervical cancer  screening, mammography, colorectal cancer screening, and influenza  immunization. We asked about these specific preventive services because  they were related to recommended preventive services and to the services  we examined in our analysis of Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS)  and National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data (see appendix II). We  did not ask about coverage of services for children because the children\u2019s  Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment (EPSDT) benefit  is required to be covered under Medicaid.", "To establish the reliability of our survey data, we spoke with  knowledgeable agency officials in developing the survey, pre-tested the  survey questions, and followed up with state Medicaid officials to achieve  a 100 percent response rate. Survey responses were submitted  electronically. In a few cases, when states gave responses that were  unclear or signaled the question was not completed, we followed up with  states to clarify their responses in order to ensure that their responses  contained the most accurate and current information available. We  determined that the data submitted by states were sufficiently reliable for  the purposes of our engagement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the Department of Health and Human Services", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Katherine M.
