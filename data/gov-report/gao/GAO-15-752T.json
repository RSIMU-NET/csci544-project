Eight of the first 15 were new elements required under the DATA Act; the balance were required under the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006. GAO identified several issues that may impact the quality and ability to aggregate federal spending data. For example, GAO found: (1) the data standards may not provide a complete picture of spending by program unless OMB accelerates its efforts to produce an inventory of federal programs as required under the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 (GPRAMA); (2) the data standards and elements may not yet represent all that are necessary to fully capture and reliably report on federal spending; and (3) the draft technical specifications GAO reviewed may result in the reporting of inconsistent information.

We found that most of the elements adhere to the  definitions used in widely accepted government standards such as OMB  Circular A-11 and the Census Bureau\u2019s North American Industry  Classification System. For example, as required by the DATA Act, OMB  and Treasury provided a standard for \u201cprogram activity\u201d and finalized the  definition as \u201ca specific activity or project listed in the program and  financing schedules of the annual budget of the United States  Government.\u201d", "Program activities are a long-standing reporting structure in the federal  budget and are intended to provide a meaningful representation of the  operations funded by a specific budget account.

As the examples illustrate, OMB and Treasury will need to build  on the program activity structure and provide agencies with guidance if  they are to meet the stated purpose of the DATA Act to \u201clink federal  contract, loan, and grant spending information to federal programs to  enable taxpayers and policy makers to track federal spending more  effectively.\u201d To underscore the differences between program activities  and programs, our September 2005 Glossary of Terms Used in the  Federal Budget Process defines a program as \u201can organized set of  activities directed toward a common purpose or goal that an agency  undertakes or proposes to carry out its responsibilities.\u201d", "The GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 (GPRAMA), among other things,  requires OMB to make publicly available, on a central government-wide  website, a list of all federal programs identified by agencies.

As our annual reports on fragmentation, overlap, and duplication  have highlighted, creating a comprehensive list of federal programs along  with related funding and performance information is critical for identifying  potential fragmentation, overlap, or duplication among federal programs  or activities. The lack of such a list makes it difficult to determine the scope of the federal government\u2019s involvement in particular areas and the  results it is achieving, and therefore, where action is needed to eliminate,  reduce, or better manage fragmentation, overlap, or duplication. Until  these steps are taken and linked to the appropriate program activity data  element, OMB and Treasury will be unable to provide a complete picture  of spending by federal programs as required under the act.", "Our recent work reviewing implementation of GPRAMA identified a  number of challenges related to executive branch efforts to identify and  define federal programs. OMB staff explained that a one-size-fits-all  approach does not work well; agencies and their stakeholders use the  term \u201cprogram\u201d in different ways because agencies achieve their missions  through different programmatic approaches. Therefore, OMB issued  guidance allowing agencies flexibility to define their programs using  different approaches, but within a broad definition of what constitutes a  program\u2014a set of related activities directed toward a common purpose or  goal. Not surprisingly, our October 2014 report reviewing implementation  of GPRAMA\u2019s program inventory requirements showed that agencies did  indeed use different approaches to define their programs. We reported  that these differences limited the comparability of programs within and  across agencies.", "We made related recommendations in our October 2014 report aimed at  improving the completeness and comparability of the program inventory.  In commenting on that report, OMB staff generally agreed with those  recommendations. According to OMB staff, as of June 2015 they have  not taken any actions to address these recommendations, because  implementation of the program inventory requirements remains on hold  as OMB determines how best to merge that effort with implementation of  the DATA Act. One approach could be for OMB to explore ways to  improve the comparability of program data by using tagging or similar  approaches that allow users to search by key words or terms and  combine elements based on the user\u2019s interests and needs. This merging  could help ensure consistency in the reporting of related program-level  spending information. As a result, we recommend the following:   To ensure that federal program spending data are provided to the  public in a transparent, useful, and timely manner, we recommend  that the Director of OMB accelerate efforts to determine how best to  merge DATA Act purposes and requirements with the GPRAMA  requirement to produce a federal program inventory."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Data Standards and Elements Proposed by OMB and Treasury May Not Yet Represent All That Are Necessary to Fully Capture and Reliably Report on Federal Spending", "paragraphs": ["The DATA Act requires Treasury, in consultation with OMB, to publish a  report of funds made available to, or expended by, federal agencies and  their components on USAspending.gov or an alternative system.

As Treasury and OMB continue establishing the DATA Act  data standards and elements, linking them to established financial  accounting and reporting processes will be important in helping ensure  consistency and comparability of the information reported and could  provide a means for determining data quality between new financial  information reported under the DATA Act and information in audited  agency financial statements. For example, certain data standards and  elements used by agencies in reporting financial data in their audited  Statement of Budgetary Resources may also be used to report certain  agency budgetary data under the DATA Act. In addition, the DATA Act  requires Treasury to include certain financial information similar to that  reported in the Schedule of Spending, which is included in agency annual  financial reports, as required by OMB Circular No. A-136, Financial  Reporting Requirements.

For  example, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has  developed data standards such as one that describes an internationally  accepted way to represent dates and times which may help address the  DATA Act requirement to establish a standard method of conveying a  reporting period. The ISO also has a standard for a digital object  identification system which may help address the DATA Act requirements  to have a unique identifier and use a widely accepted, nonproprietary,  searchable, platform-independent, machine-readable format.

For instance:", "The Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) OIG used the ROC\u2019s  capabilities to analyze text from A-133 single audit data to search for  indications of risk and identify the highest risk grantees for review.  This approach allowed the ARC OIG to identify 30 to 40 grantees out  of approximately 400 grants per year based on risk rather than  selecting grantees randomly based on geography and grant type.", "The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) OIG used the ROC\u2019s  data visualizations of a link analysis, which identifies relationships  among entities involved in activities such as a fraud ring or an effort to  commit collusion, to present to juries. An EPA OIG official said that  the visualization of these relationships made it easier for juries to  understand how entities had collaborated in wrongdoing.", "Since 2012, after its mandate was expanded to cover all federal funds,  over 50 federal OIGs and agencies have asked the ROC for help. Based  on requests for analysis compiled in the Recovery Board\u2019s Annual  Reports, the ROC researched roughly 1.7 million entities associated with  $36.4 billion in federal funds during fiscal years 2013 and 2014. The  largest single user of ROC assistance over this time was the ARC OIG in  2012 and the Department of Homeland Security OIG in fiscal years 2013  and 2014."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Treasury Decided Not to Transfer the ROC\u2019s Assets, Citing Cost and Other Challenges", "paragraphs": ["To facilitate a potential transition, Recovery Board officials provided a  transition plan to Treasury in late spring of 2014. The plan provided an  overview of the ROC\u2019s assets and presented possible scenarios for a  transition and steps needed including estimated time frames assuming a  transfer by September 30, 2015. In May 2015, Treasury officials told us  that the agency does not plan to transfer any of the ROC\u2019s assets,  identifying the following challenges to assuming ROC\u2019s assets:", "Hardware. Although Treasury officials viewed hardware as being  feasible to transfer, in their assessment it was not cost effective to do  so because the ROC\u2019s hardware is aging, lessening the value of  these assets.", "Human capital. The agency would have to use the competitive hiring  process to hire key ROC employees, which can be time consuming. In  addition, because some ROC staff were term-limited hires or  contractors, a competitive hiring process would not guarantee that  ROC staff would ultimately be selected for employment.", "Data sets. The ROC obtained access to federal datasets through  memoranda of understanding, which are not transferrable and  therefore would need to be negotiated. Commercially procured data  sets also are not transferrable but would instead have to go through a  procurement process.", "Software contracts. Because the Recovery Board extended its  software contracts on a sole source basis when it was re-authorized  for 2 additional years, Treasury would need to use a competitive  procurement process to obtain these data analytic tools.", "Because of these challenges, Treasury focused on facilitating information  sharing through meetings between the ROC and Treasury\u2019s Do Not Pay  (DNP) initiative, which assists agencies in preventing improper payments.  Treasury officials stated that the expertise developed at the ROC was its  most valuable asset, so officials focused on meeting with the ROC staff to  discuss best practices and share knowledge with the DNP staff. In  addition, Treasury officials noted that they had hired the former Assistant  Director for Data and Performance Metrics at the Recovery Board as the  Director of Outreach and Business Process for DNP. Officials further  noted that the Director\u2019s experience at the ROC included leveraging data  to identify high risk entities and conducting outreach to the ROC\u2019s user  community\u2014skills that Treasury officials said were complementary to  DNP\u2019s activities. (See figure 3.)", "In 2013, the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency  (CIGIE) explored the viability of assuming some ROC assets to continue  providing analytic capabilities to the OIG community. CIGIE estimated  that it would cost $10.2 million per year to continue to run the ROC and  because CIGIE is primarily funded by membership dues, CIGIE  determined the additional cost to operate the ROC would be too  burdensome for the organization. A CIGIE official indicated they have  continued to look for opportunities to provide centralized data analytic  resources to OIGs. However, this official said given its financial  resources, any resources CIGIE might provide would be at a significantly  scaled back level compared to the ROC.", "Some large OIGs that previously used the ROC intend to develop their  own analytic capabilities. However, according to some OIG officials, the  ROC\u2019s closure may impact the audit and investigative capabilities of  some small and medium-sized OIGs who do not have the resources to  develop independent data analytics or pay fees for a similar service.  According to some OIG officials, the loss of the ROC\u2019s analytical  capabilities could also result in auditors and investigators working more  staff hours to research the same types of linkages rather than verifying  the information that the ROC could provide in a shorter time. Treasury  officials stated that the Fiscal Service operations assist federal  agencies\u2014including OIG and other law enforcement agencies\u2014in  identifying, preventing, and recovering improper payments under existing  authorities. However, as noted earlier, our work on the potential impact of  the ROC\u2019s sunset on the oversight community is on-going, and we have  not independently compared the services of Fiscal Service operations to  the ROC.

The HHS  DATA Act Program Management Office manages an online repository of  agreed-upon standardized data elements, called the Common Data  Element Repository (C-DER) Library, to be an authorized source for data  elements and definitions used by the federal government in agency  interactions with the public. The C-DER is designed to include data  standards that have been approved through the implementation of the  DATA Act. Specifically, as of July 16, 2015, the C-DER is populated  with 112 data elements from a variety of sources.finalized by OMB and Treasury under the DATA Act on May 8, 2015, are  included in the C-DER; however the remaining 12 that have been  finalized since then are not yet included. A number of the terms included  in the C-DER go beyond the data elements that are required to be  standardized under the DATA Act, such as definitions for audit finding,  auditee, auditor, and hospital.", "According to HHS officials, the C-DER was developed through an  analysis of 1,000 data elements from 17 different sources. HHS officials  stated that key findings that led to the creation of the C-DER were (1)  lessons learned from the development of Uniform Grants Guidance that  different communities, such as grants, acquisitions, and procurement, use  terms and concepts differently; (2) that it is difficult for the public to  access common definitions across these different communities; and (3)  that data standards in and of themselves are not helpful unless they are  used. The purpose of the C-DER is to reconcile these three findings and  accommodate different data standards as they are developed under the  act.", "Providing grants-related resources. The third component of the pilot is  the launch of a portal that provides the public with grants resources and  information on the grants lifecycle, known as the Grants Information  Gateway (GIG). Available on Grants.gov, the GIG is intended to serve as  a clearinghouse for information on the federal grants management  process and lifecycle.
