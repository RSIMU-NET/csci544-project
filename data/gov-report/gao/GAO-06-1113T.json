Tax preferences\u2014which are legally known as  tax expenditures\u2014are often aimed at policy goals similar to those of  federal spending programs. For example, there are different tax  expenditures intended to encourage economic development in  disadvantaged areas and stimulate research and development, while there  are also federal spending programs that have similar purposes.

Tax treatment that is not neutral across  different types of capital investment causes significant economic  inefficiency by guiding investments to lightly taxed activities rather than  those with high pretax productivity.", "However, the goal of tax policy is not to eliminate efficiency costs. The  goal is to design a tax system that produces a desired amount of revenue  and balances economic efficiency with other objectives, such as equity,  simplicity, transparency, and administrability.

My point in raising them here is not that these features need to be  changed\u2014that is a policy judgment for Congress to make as it balances  various goals. Rather, my point is that these economic consequences of  tax policy need to be considered as we think about reform. The following  are among the most noted cases of nonneutral taxation in the federal  business tax system:  Income earned on equity-financed investments made by C corporations  is taxed twice\u2014under both the corporate and individual income taxes,  whereas no other business income is taxed more than once. Moreover,  even noncorporate business investment is taxed more heavily than  owner-occupied housing\u2014a form of capital investment that receives  very preferential treatment. As a result, resources have been shifted  away from higher-return business investment into owner-occupied  housing, and, within the business sector, resources have been shifted  from higher-return corporations to noncorporate businesses. Such  shifting of investment makes workers less productive than they would  be under a more neutral tax system. This results in employees receiving  lower wages because increases in employee wages are generally tied to  increases in productivity.  As noted above, such efficiency costs may  be worth paying in order to meet other policy goals. For example, many  policymakers advocate increased homeownership as a social policy  goal.", "Depreciation allowances under the tax code vary considerably in  generosity across different assets causing effective tax rates to vary  and, thereby, favoring investment in certain assets over others. For  example, researchers have found that the returns on most types of  investments in equipment are taxed more favorably than are most  investments in nonresidential buildings. These biases shift resources  away from some investments in buildings that would have been more  productive than some of the equipment investments that are being  made instead.", "Tax rules for corporations favor the use of debt over shareholder  equity as a source of finance for investment. The return on debt- financed investment consists of interest payments to the corporation\u2019s  creditors, which are deductible by the corporations. Consequently, that  return is taxed only once\u2014in the hands of the creditors. In contrast,  the return on equity-financed investment consists of dividends and  capital gains, which are not deductible by the corporation. These forms  of income that are taxed under the individual tax are paid out of  income that has already been subject to the corporate income tax. The  bias against equity finance induces corporations to have less of an  \u201cequity cushion\u201d against business downturns.", "Capital gains on corporate equity are taxed more favorably than  dividends because that tax can be deferred until the gains are realized  (typically when shareholders sell their stock). This bias against  dividend payments likely means that more profits are retained within  corporations than otherwise would be the case and, therefore, the flow  of capital to its most productive uses is being constrained.", "The complex set of rules governing U.S. taxation of the worldwide  income of domestic corporations (those incorporated in the United  States) leads to wide variations in the effective rate of tax paid on that  income, based on the nature and location of each corporation\u2019s foreign  operations and the effort put into tax planning. In effect, the active  foreign income of some U.S. corporations is taxed more heavily than if  the United States followed the practice of many other countries and  exempted such income from tax. However, other U.S. corporations are  able to take advantage of flexibilities in the U.S. tax rules in order to  achieve treatment that is equivalent to or, in some cases, more  favorable than the so-called \u201cterritorial\u201d tax systems that exempt  foreign-source active business income. As a consequence, some U.S.  corporations face a tax disadvantage, while others have an advantage,  relative to foreign corporations when competing in foreign countries.  Those U.S. corporations that have a disadvantage are likely to locate a  smaller share of their investment overseas than would be the case in a  tax-free world; the opposite is true for those U.S. corporations with the  tax advantage. Moreover, the tax system encourages U.S. corporations  to alter their cash-management and financing decisions (such as by  delaying the repatriation of profits) in order to reduce their taxes.", "The taxation of business income is part of the broader taxation of income  from capital. The taxation of capital income in general (even when that  taxation is uniformly applied) causes another form of inefficiency beyond  the inefficiencies caused by the aforementioned cases of differential  taxation across types of investments. This additional inefficiency occurs  because taxes on capital reduce the after-tax return on savings and,  thereby, distort the choice that individuals make between current  consumption and saving for future consumption. However, although  research shows that the demand for some types of savings, such as the  demand for tax exempt bonds, is responsive to tax changes, there is  greater uncertainty about the effects of tax changes on other choices, such  as aggregate savings.", "Sometimes the concerns about the negative effects of taxation on the U.S.  economy are couched in terms of \u201ccompetitiveness,\u201d where the vaguely  defined term competitiveness is often defined as the ability of U.S.  businesses to export their products to foreign markets and to compete  against foreign imports into the U.S. market. The goal of those who push  for this type of competitiveness is to improve the U.S. balance of trade.  However, economists generally agree that trying to increase the U.S.  balance of trade through targeted tax breaks for exports does not work.  Such a policy, aimed at lowering the prices of exports, would be offset by  an increase in the value of the dollar which would make U.S. exports more  expensive and imports into the Unites States less expensive, ultimately  leaving both the balance of trade and the standard of living of Americans  unchanged.", "An alternative definition of competitiveness that is also sometimes used in  tax policy debates refers to the ability of U.S.-owned firms operating  abroad to compete in foreign markets.

If the price paid by the  affiliate to the U.S. operation is understated, the profits of the U.S.  operation are reduced and U.S. taxable income is inappropriately reduced  or eliminated.

Abusive shelters often are complex transactions that manipulate  many parts of the tax code or regulations and are typically buried among  legitimate transactions reported on tax returns. Because these  transactions are often composed of many pieces located in several parts of  a complex tax return, they are essentially hidden from plain sight, which  contributes to the difficulty of determining the scope of the abusive shelter  problem. Often lacking economic substance or a business purpose other  than generating tax benefits, abusive shelters have been promoted by  some tax professionals, often in confidence, for significant fees,  sometimes with the participation of tax-indifferent parties, such as foreign  or tax-exempt entities.

Furthermore, the complexity of, and frequent revisions to, the tax  system make it more difficult and costly for taxpayers who want to comply  to do so and for IRS to explain and enforce tax laws. The lack of  transparency also fuels disrespect for the tax system and the government.  Thus, a crucial challenge in evaluating our business tax system will be to  determine how we can best strengthen enforcement of existing laws to  give businesses owners confidence that their competitors are paying their  fair share and to give wage earners confidence that businesses in general  bear their share of taxes.

Our current  system for taxing corporate-source income involves taxation at both the  corporate and individual level in a manner that results in the double  taxation of the same income."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Territorial vs. Worldwide Taxation under an Income Tax", "paragraphs": ["Under a pure worldwide tax system the United States would tax the  income of U.S. corporations, as it is earned, regardless of where it is  earned, and at the same time provide a foreign tax credit that ensures that  the combined rate of tax that a corporation pays to all governments on  each dollar of income is exactly equal to the U.S. corporate tax rate. Some  basic differences between the current U.S. tax system and a pure  worldwide system are that (1) in many cases the U.S. system permits  corporations to defer U.S. tax on their foreign-source income until it is  repatriated and (2) the U.S. foreign tax credit is limited to the amount of  U.S. tax that would be due on a corporation\u2019s foreign-source income. In  cases where the rate of foreign tax on a corporation\u2019s income exceeds the  U.S. tax rate, the corporation is left paying the higher rate of tax.", "Under a pure territorial tax system the United States would simply exempt  all foreign-source income. (No major country has a pure territorial system;  they all tax mobile forms of foreign-source income, such as royalties and  income from securities.) The current U.S. tax system has some features  that result in some cases in treatment similar to what would exist under a  territorial system. First, corporations can defer U.S. tax indefinitely on  certain foreign-source income, as long as they keep it reinvested abroad.  Second, in certain cases U.S. corporations are able to use the excess  credits that they earned for taxes they paid to high-tax countries to  completely offset any U.S. tax that they would normally have to pay on  income they earned in low-tax countries. As a result, that income from  low-tax countries remains untaxed by the United States\u2014just as it would  be under a territorial system. In fact, there are some cases where U.S.  corporations enjoy tax treatment that is more favorable than under a  territorial system. This occurs when they pay no U.S. tax on foreign-source  income yet are still able to deduct expenses allocable to that income. For  example, a U.S. parent corporation can borrow money and invest it in a  foreign subsidiary. The parent corporation generally can deduct its  interest payments from its U.S. taxes even if it defers U.S. tax on the  subsidiary\u2019s income by leaving it overseas.", "Proponents of a worldwide tax system and proponents of a territorial  system both argue that their preferred systems would provide important  forms of tax neutrality. Under a pure worldwide system all of the income  that a U.S. corporation earns abroad would be taxed at the same effective  rate that a corporation earning the same amount of income domestically  would pay. Such a tax system is neutral in the sense that it does not  influence the decision of U.S. corporations to invest abroad or at home. If  the U.S. had a pure territorial tax system all of the income that U.S.  corporations earn in a particular country would be taxed at the same rate  as corporations that are residents of that country. The pure territorial  system is neutral in the specific sense that U.S. corporations investing in a  foreign country would not be at a disadvantage relative to corporations  residing in that country or relative to other foreign corporations investing  there. In a world where each country sets its own tax rules it is  impossible to achieve both types of neutrality at the same time, so  tradeoffs are unavoidable.", "A change from the current tax system to a pure territorial one is likely to  have mixed effects on tax compliance and administration. On the one  hand, a pure worldwide tax system, or even the current system, may  preserve the U.S. tax base better than a territorial system would because  U.S. taxpayers would have greater incentive under a territorial system to  shift income and investment into low-tax jurisdictions via transfer pricing.  On the other hand, a pure territorial system may be less complex for IRS  to administer and for taxpayers to comply with than the current tax  system because there would be no need for the antideferral rules or the  foreign tax credit, which are among the most complex features of the  current system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Destination-Principle vs. Origin-Principle Consumption Tax", "paragraphs": ["Broad-based consumption taxes can differ depending on whether they are  imposed under a destination principle, which holds that goods and  services should be taxed in the countries where they are consumed, or an  origin principle, which holds that goods and services should be taxed in  the countries where they are produced. In the long run, after markets have  adjusted, neither type of tax would have a significant effect on the U.S.  trade balance. This is true for a destination-based tax because products  consumed in the United States would be taxed at the same rate, regardless  of where they were produced. Therefore, such a tax would not influence a  consumer\u2019s choice between buying a car produced in the United States or  one imported from Japan. And at the same time, U.S. exports of cars  would not be affected by the tax because they would be exempted. An  origin-based consumption tax would not affect the trade balance because  the tax effects that taxes have on prices would ultimately be countered by  the same price adjustment mechanism that we discussed earlier with  respect to targeted tax subsidies for exports.", "A national retail sales tax limited to final consumption goods would be a  destination-principle tax; it would tax imports when sold at retail in this  country and would not tax exports. Value-added taxes can be designed as  either destination or origin-principle taxes.", "A personal consumption tax, collected at the individual level, would apply  to U.S. residents or citizens and could be formulated to tax their  consumption regardless of whether it is done domestically or overseas.  Under such a system, income earned abroad would be taxable but funds  saved or invested abroad would be deductible. In that case, foreign- produced goods imported into the United States or consumed by U.S.  citizens abroad would be taxed.

For example, one transition  issue involves whether tax credits and other tax benefits already earned  under the current tax would be made available under a new system.  Businesses that are deducting depreciation under the current system  would not have the opportunity to continue depreciating their capital  goods under a VAT unless special rules were included to permit it. Similar  problems could arise with businesses\u2019 carrying forward net operating  losses and recovering unclaimed tax credits. Depending on how these and  other issues are addressed, taxpayer compliance burden and tax  administration responsibilities could be greater during the transition  period than they currently are or than they would be once the transition  ends. Transition rules could also substantially reduce the new system\u2019s tax  base, thereby requiring higher tax rates during the transition if revenue  neutrality were to be achieved."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Criteria for a Good Tax System Provide Principles to Guide Decisions and Issues for Consideration", "paragraphs": ["Our publication, Understanding the Tax Reform Debate: Background,  Criteria, and Questions, may be useful in guiding policymakers as they  consider tax reform proposals. It was designed to aid policymakers in  thinking about how to develop tax policy for the 21st century. The criteria  for a good tax system, which our report discusses, provide the basis for a  set of principles that should guide Congress as it considers the choices  and tradeoffs involved in tax system reform. And, as I also noted earlier,  proposals for reforming business taxation cannot be evaluated without  considering how that business taxation will interact with and complement  the other elements of our overall future tax system.", "The proposed system should raise sufficient revenue over time to fund our  expected expenditures. As I mentioned earlier, we will fall woefully short  of achieving this end if current spending or revenue trends are not altered.  Although we clearly must restructure major entitlement programs and the  basis of other federal spending, it is unlikely that our long-term fiscal  challenge will be resolved solely by cutting spending.", "The proposal should look to future needs. Like many spending programs,  the current tax system was developed in a profoundly different time. We  live now in a much more global economy, with highly mobile capital, and  with investment options available to ordinary citizens that were not even  imagined decades ago. We have growing concentrations of income and  wealth. More firms operate multinationally and willingly move operations  and capital around the world as they see best for their firms.", "As an adjunct to looking forward when making reforms, better information  on existing commitments and promises must be coupled with estimates of  the long-term discounted net present value costs from spending and tax  commitments comprising longer-term exposures for the federal budget  beyond the existing 10-year budget projection window.", "The tax base should be as broad as possible. Broad-based tax systems with  minimal exceptions have many advantages. Fewer exceptions generally  means less complexity, less compliance cost, less economic efficiency  loss, and by increasing transparency may improve equity or perceptions of  equity. This suggests that eliminating or consolidating numerous tax  expenditures must be considered. In many cases tax preferences are  simply a form of \u201cback-door spending.\u201d We need to be sure that the  benefits achieved from having these special provisions are worth the  associated revenue losses just as we must ensure that outlay programs\u2014 which may be attempting to achieve the same purposes as tax  expenditures\u2014achieve outcomes commensurate with their costs. And it is  important to supplement these cost-benefit evaluations with analyses of  distributional effects\u2014i.e., who bears the costs of the preferences and  who receives the benefits. To the extent tax expenditures are retained,  consideration should be given to whether they could be better targeted to  meet an identified need.", "If we must raise revenues, doing so from a broad base and a lower rate will  help minimize economic efficiency costs. Broad-based tax systems can  yield the same revenue as more narrowly based systems at lower tax rates.  The combination of less direct intervention in the marketplace from  special tax preferences, and the lower rates possible from broad-based  systems, can have substantial benefits for economic efficiency. For  instance, one commonly cited rule of thumb regarding economic  efficiency costs of tax increases is that they rise proportionately faster  than the tax rates. In other words, a 10 percent tax increase could raise the  economic efficiency costs of a tax system by much more than 10 percent.", "Aside from the base-broadening that minimizes targeted tax preferences  favoring specific types of investment or other business behavior, it is also  desirable on the grounds of economic efficiency to extend the principle of  tax neutrality to the broader structural features of a business tax system.  For example, improvements in economic efficiency can also be gained by  avoiding differences in tax treatment, such as the differences in the  current system based on legal form of organization, source of financing,  and the nature and location of foreign operations. Removing such  differences can shift resources to more productive uses, increasing  economic performance and the standard of living of Americans. Shifting  resources to more productive uses can result in a step up in the level of  economic activity which would be measured as a one-time increase in the  rate of growth. Tax changes that increase efficiency can also increase the  long-term rate of economic growth if they increase the rate of  technological change; however, not all efficiency-increasing tax changes  will do so.", "Impact on the standard of living of Americans is also a useful criterion for  evaluating policies to improve U.S. competitiveness. As was discussed  earlier, narrower goals and policies, such as increasing the U.S. balance of  trade through targeted tax breaks aimed at encouraging exports, are  generally viewed as ineffective by economists. What determines the  standard of living of Americans and how it compares to the standard of  living in other countries is the productivity of American workers and  capital. That productivity is determined by factors such as education,  technological innovation, and the amount of investment in the U.S.  economy. Tax policy can contribute to American productivity in several  ways. One, discussed in this statement, is through neutral taxation of  investment alternatives. Another, which I have discussed on many  occasions, is through fiscal policy. Borrowing to finance persistent federal  deficits absorbs savings from the private sector reducing funds available  for investment. Higher saving and investment from a more balanced fiscal  policy would contribute to increased productivity and a higher standard of  living for Americans over the long term.", "A reformed business tax system should have attributes associated with  high compliance rates. Because any tax system can be subject to tax gaps,  the administrability of reformed systems should be considered as part of  the debate for change. In general, a reformed system is most likely to have  a small tax gap if the system has few tax preferences or complex  provisions and taxable transactions are transparent. Transparency in the  context of tax administration is best achieved when third parties report  information both to the taxpayer and the tax administrator.", "Minimizing tax code complexity has the potential to reduce  noncompliance for at least three broad reasons. First, it could help  taxpayers to comply voluntarily with more certainty, reducing inadvertent  errors by those who want to comply but are confused because of  complexity. Second, it may limit opportunities for tax evasion, reducing  intentional noncompliance by taxpayers who can misuse the complex  code provisions to hide their noncompliance or to achieve ends through  tax shelters. Third, reducing tax-code complexity could improve  taxpayers\u2019 willingness to comply voluntarily.", "Finally, the consideration of transition rules needs to be an integral part of  the design of a new system. The effects of these rules can be too  significant to leave them simply as an afterthought in the reform process."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["The problems that I have reviewed today relating to the compliance costs,  efficiency costs, equity, and tax gap associated with the current business  tax system would seem to make a strong case for a comprehensive review  and reform of our tax policy. Further, businesses operate in a world that is  profoundly different\u2014more competitive and more global\u2014than when  many of the existing provisions of the tax code were adopted. Despite  numerous and repeated calls for reform, progress has been slow. I  discussed reasons for the slow progress in a previous hearing on  individual tax reform before this committee. One reason why reform is  difficult to accomplish is that the provisions of the tax code that generate  compliance costs, efficiency costs, the tax gap and inequities also benefit  many taxpayers. Reform is also difficult because, even when there is  agreement on the amount of revenue to raise, there are differing opinions  on the appropriate balance among the often conflicting objectives of  equity, efficiency, and administrability. This, in turn, leads to widely  divergent views on even the basic direction of reform.", "However, I have described some basic principles that ought to guide  business tax reform. One of them is revenue sufficiency. Fiscal necessity,  prompted by the nation\u2019s unsustainable fiscal path, will eventually force  changes to our spending and tax policies. We must fundamentally rethink  policies and everything must be on the table. Tough choices will have to  be made about the appropriate degree of emphasis on cutting back federal  programs versus increasing tax revenue.", "Other principles, such as broadening the tax base and otherwise  promoting tax neutrality, could help improve economic performance.  While economic growth alone will not solve our long-term fiscal problems,  an improvement in our overall economic performance makes dealing with  those problems easier.", "The recent report of the President\u2019s Advisory Panel on Federal Tax  Reform recommended two different tax reform plans. Although each plan  is intended to improve economic efficiency and simplify the tax system,  neither of them addresses the growing imbalance between federal  spending and revenues that I have highlighted. One approach for getting  the process of comprehensive fiscal reform started would be through the  establishment of a credible, capable, and bipartisan commission, to  examine options for a combination of selected entitlement and tax reform  issues.", "Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, this concludes my  statement.
