Most lease sales have had a single bidder and were leased the first time offered. The amount of coal produced from federal leases and associated revenues have increased since 1990, although production has leveled off since 2002. Revenues from federal coal leases have generated about $1 billion annually in recent years. Royalties paid when coal is sold and bonus bids paid for the right to mine a federal coal tract account for nearly all of these revenues.", "BLM's guidance offers flexibility in how to estimate fair market value, and BLM state offices vary in the approaches they used to develop an estimate of fair market value. In estimating fair market value, some BLM state offices used both the comparable sales approach--where bonus bids received for past sales are used to value the tract being appraised--and the income approach--which uses estimates of the future net revenue streams from the sale of coal from the appraised tract. However, some offices relied solely on the comparable sales approach and may not be fully considering future market conditions as a result. In addition, GAO found that BLM did not consistently document the rationale for accepting bids that were initially below the fair market value presale estimate. Furthermore, some state offices were not following guidance for review of appraisal reports, and no independent review of these reports was taking place. Adequate review of the fair market value process is critical to ensure that its results are sound and key decisions are fully documented. In addition, BLM is not currently taking advantage of a potential independent third-party reviewer with appraisal expertise within the Department of the Interior (Interior), specifically, the Office of Valuation Services.", "BLM considers exports to a limited extent when estimating fair market value and generally does not explicitly consider estimates of the amount of coal that can be mined economically, known as domestic reserve estimates. As a result, BLM may not be factoring specific export information into appraisals or may not be fully considering the export potential of a lease tract's coal as called for in agency guidance. The Wyoming and Montana BLM state offices considered exports, but they generally included only generic statements about exports in the reports they prepared. In the other seven states with leasing activity, exports were generally not considered during the appraisal process. According to BLM officials, domestic reserve estimates, which vary based on market conditions and the costs to extract the coal, are not considered due to their variable nature.", "BLM generally provides limited information on federal coal lease sales to the public because of the sensitive and proprietary nature of some of this information. The Wyoming BLM state office posts information on its website, including information on past lease sales, but most state office websites provide only general information. BLM's guidance states that redacted public versions of its appraisal reports should be prepared, but no BLM state office has prepared such reports. BLM supplied redacted versions of fair market value documents in response to a recent public information request only after being advised to do so by Interior's Solicitor's office."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends, among other things, that BLM require state offices to use more than one approach to estimate fair market value where practicable, develop a mechanism to ensure that reviews of appraisal reports take place, and take steps to release additional summary information on its websites, including past lease sales.

Under this program, BLM leases out federal coal tracts to mining  companies who extract the coal from both surface and underground  mines. In fiscal year 2012, about 42 percent of the 1.05 billion tons of  coal produced in the United States came from federal coal lease tracts.  The coal leasing program also generates significant revenue for federal  and state governments; in fiscal year 2012, about $1.2 billion was  generated from coal leasing.

Competitive leasing provides an  opportunity for any interested party to competitively bid for a federal coal  lease. There are two procedures that can be used for competitive leasing:  (1) regional leasing, where the Secretary of the Interior selects tracts  within a region for competitive sale based on, among other things,  expected demand for coal resources and potential economic impacts and  (2) lease-by-application, where companies submit an application to  nominate lease tracts that they are interested in leasing. Under both of  these methods, BLM examines the potential environmental impact that  could result from coal leasing.", "In April 1982, the first regional coal lease sale was held for 13 lease tracts  containing 1.6 billion tons of coal located in the Powder River Basin in  Montana and Wyoming, and a follow-up sale was held in October 1982  for 2 lease tracts. Controversy surrounded the 1982 sale. Specifically,  there were allegations that confidential appraisal information was  disclosed to coal companies prior to the lease sale and that appraisal and  sale procedures failed to assure that the public received fair market value  for the leased coal tracts. These allegations led to an investigation by the  House Appropriations Committee and a report that we issued in May  1983. Later that year, Congress directed the Secretary of the Interior to  establish a commission to review the coal leasing procedures to ensure  the receipt of fair market value, known as the Commission on Fair Market  Value Policy for Federal Coal Leasing or the Linowes Commission.  Congress imposed a moratorium on lease sales until after the  commission\u2019s final report was issued in 1984. Among its key findings on  the fair market value process, the Linowes Commission found that Interior  used appraisal methods that were widely accepted by industry and  government, but that Interior needed to, among other things, enhance its  capacity to perform appraisals and seek independent reviews of its  appraisals and, more broadly, of the federal coal leasing program. From  March 1984 through February 1987, coal leases were subject to another  moratorium to enable development and implementation of revised coal  leasing procedures based on the commission\u2019s recommendations.", "Two other coal regions were decertified in 1981 and 1982. mines or new mines could begin operations.

The geologic report contains a legal description of the tract,  along with an estimate of the amount of coal that can be recovered on the  lease tract along with the characteristics of the coal, including its heating  content. An engineering report generally contains a mining plan, along  with estimates of the costs to extract the coal based on the number of  employees and capital equipment necessary to carry out this plan, among  other costs.

For example, as shown in figure 4, tracts submitted for  lease-by-application that are north and west of the Black Thunder mine  are less likely to be bid on by the operators of the North Antelope  Rochelle or Antelope mines. This is because it would be too costly and  take significant time for these mine operators to move their heavy  equipment to extract coal from these lease tracts, which are not directly  adjacent to their existing operations. In contrast, the lease tracts that are  located between two mines are more likely to be bid on by multiple mine  operators, according to BLM officials.", "BLM officials told us that, where possible, BLM uses the tract modification  process to encourage competition for lease sales.

During this period there was an  increase in U.S. western coal production, where a majority of federal coal  is located, and a corresponding decline in production from eastern coal  regions. In particular, BLM officials told us that Powder River Basin coal  grew in demand over eastern coal because it enabled utilities to meet the  stricter emissions limits due to its low sulfur content.

A United States  Geological Survey (USGS) study reported that this shift reflected the fact  that western mines, which typically rely on surface mining, can extract  coal more cheaply than eastern mines, where coal is generally mined  using underground methods.", "Since fiscal year 2002, coal production from federal leases remained  relatively steady, averaging near 450 million tons annually, or about 41  percent of total U.S. production. Production peaked in fiscal year 2008 at  483 million tons and has since declined by 8 percent to 442 million tons in  fiscal year 2012. In October 2012, we reported the amount of electricity  generated using coal has decreased recently due to a decline in overall  electricity demand and growth in the use of natural gas to fuel power  plants.", "In fiscal year 2012, 85 percent of the coal produced from federal leases  came from Wyoming. As shown in figure 6, Wyoming and three other  western states\u2014Montana, Colorado, and Utah\u2014accounted for 97 percent  of coal produced from federal leases. The remaining 3 percent of coal  (about 12 million tons) was produced from federal leases in five other  states\u2014Alabama, Kentucky, New Mexico, North Dakota, and Oklahoma.", "The total revenue generated from federal coal leases has nearly doubled  from $682 million in fiscal year 2003 to $1.2 billion generated in fiscal  year 2008 and again in fiscal year 2012. Total revenues from federal  coal leases have remained relatively steady since fiscal year 2005  averaging about $1.0 billion per year according to our analysis of ONRR  data. There are three sources of revenue from federal coal leases\u2013\u2013 royalties, bonus bids, and rents\u2013\u2013but royalties and bonus bids account for  nearly 100 percent of the revenues from the federal coal leasing program.", "Royalties. Royalties comprised the majority of the revenue from federal  coal leases\u2014nearly two-thirds of the total revenue over the period from  fiscal years 2003 to 2012. Royalty rates for coal depend on the mine  type and are generally calculated based on a proportion of sales value,  less allowable deductions, such as transportation and processing  allowances. BLM generally sets royalty rates at 12.5 percent for surface  mines, the required minimum royalty rate, and 8 percent for underground  mines, the rate prescribed by regulation. In total, royalties generated  from federal coal leases have more than doubled since fiscal year 1990,  from $392 million to $796 million in fiscal year 2012 (see fig. 7). In  addition, as with coal production from federal leases, royalties generated  from the sale of coal from federal leases in Wyoming comprise an  increasing proportion of the royalty stream ranging from 50 percent of  total royalties in 1990 to 80 percent in 2012 (see fig. 6).", "Coal prices have been a major driver of the increases in royalty revenues.  For instance, from fiscal years 1990 to 2000, royalty revenues remained  relatively steady even though production of federal coal increased over  this period related to a decline in coal prices. Since then, coal royalty  revenues have steadily increased, even with a recent decline in  production. Specifically, from fiscal years 2008 to 2012 the amount of coal  produced from federal leases declined by about 41 million tons of coal (or  8 percent); however the reported sales value of this coal increased 15  percent from $6.7 billion to $7.7 billion, reflecting growth in coal prices.", "The effective royalty rate\u2014the rate actually paid by lessees after  processing and transportation allowances have been factored in along  with any royalty rate reductions\u2013\u2013generated from coal produced from  federal leases has remained on average at about 11 percent since fiscal  year 1990. Royalty rate reductions may be approved by BLM in cases  where a reduction is needed to promote mining development. For  example, BLM officials told us they may approve royalty rate reductions to  enable continued operations in cases where mining conditions may be  particularly challenging and costly, or to enable expanded recovery of  federal coal. The effective royalty rate varies by state due to differences in  mine type and other factors. For example, the effective royalty rate is  higher in Wyoming and Montana where most coal is extracted using  surface mining. In fiscal year 2012, the effective royalty rates for the top  federal coal producing states were: Wyoming (12.2 percent), Montana  (11.6 percent), Utah (6.9 percent), and Colorado (5.6 percent).", "Bonus bids. Bonus bids are generally expressed in cents per ton of coal  that is recoverable from the lease tract. The total bonus bid paid is the  cents per ton multiplied by the estimated recoverable tons of coal from  the lease tract. According to BLM officials, typically an initial payment of  20 percent of the total bonus bid is provided with the sealed bid, and the  remaining 80 percent is paid in four equal annual installments over a 4- year period, but it may also be paid in full by the lessee at the time of a  lease sale. ONRR revenue data from fiscal years 2003 to 2012 show total  bonus bids received from all federal coal leases averaged $335 million  annually, or about one-third of the total revenues from federal coal leases,  as shown in figure 8. Since fiscal year 2003, revenue from bonus bids has  fluctuated from year to year related to lease sale activity. For example,  since fiscal year 2003, revenue from bonus bids has fluctuated from a  peak of about $521 million in fiscal year 2005, when bonus bids made up  49 percent of the total revenue generated from coal leases, to a low of  $116 million in fiscal year 2010, when bonuses comprised 13 percent of  total revenue.", "Based on our analysis of BLM data on coal lease sales, BLM accepted  $6.4 billion in total bonus revenue for the 107 tracts leased since 1990,  with total bids ranging from $5,000 to more than $800 million for a lease  tract. In addition, successful bonus bid amounts for coal leases varied  across states, with bonus bids received in Wyoming showing the greatest  increase since 1990 when compared with the other seven states with  active federal coal leases. Successful bonus bids for lease sale tracts in  Wyoming ranged from $0.04 to $1.37 per ton of coal, after adjusting for  inflation, and generally increased from 1990 to 2012. In comparison,  successful bonus bids in Colorado bids ranged from $0.02 to $0.55 per  ton and slightly increased from 1990 to 2012, and in North Dakota all  successful bonus bids were $100 per acre in nominal dollars, the  minimum bid BLM can accept for a lease tract and did not vary  meaningfully over time when measured on a per ton scale. In other  states, trends in bonus bids were not discernable due to variation in the  successful bids over time or there being too few sales in these states.  According to officials from coal companies we spoke with, bonus bids for  federal coal leases depend on many factors, including coal quality, mine  type (e.g., underground or surface mining), and the price of coal at the  time of the sale.", "Even when coal quality, mine type, and price are similar, successful  bonus bids can vary greatly because of other factors. For example,  mining conditions in Colorado and Utah are similar in several respects\u2014 most mines are underground, the energy content of the coal being mined  generally exceeds 11,500 BTUs per pound of coal, and coal prices were  in a similar range from 1990 to 2011. Yet, the total bonus bids accepted  by Colorado since 1990 have been about $22 million less after adjusting  for inflation than those accepted by Utah despite the fact that Colorado  has leased out almost 76 million tons more coal than Utah. When asked  about the differences in total bonus bids, BLM officials reiterated that  differences in conditions affecting coal marketability across these states,  such as access to transportation options and proximity of customer base,  make direct comparison of bonus bid values across these states difficult.  Specifically, BLM officials told us that most of the coal produced in Utah is  consumed locally by power plants in state; this proximity to the customer  could be considered an advantage. In contrast, much of the coal  produced in Colorado needs to be transported out of state.", "Rents. Rents, which are set at $3 per acre, are also collected annually  from federal coal leasing tracts but comprise an insignificant amount of  the revenue stream. generated from federal coal leases, composing 0.1 percent of the annual  revenue related to coal.", "43 C.F.R. \u00a7 3473.3-1(a)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "BLM\u2019s Implementation of the Fair Market Value Process Lacks Sufficient Rigor and Oversight", "paragraphs": ["BLM\u2019s guidance offers flexibility in how to estimate fair market value, and  BLM state offices vary in the approaches they use to develop an estimate  of fair market value.

BLM\u2019s guidance lays out two  approaches to develop an estimate of fair market value\u2014comparable  sales and income\u2014but does not say that both approaches must be  used. Under the comparable sales approach, bonus bids received for  past sales are used to value the tract being appraised. Adjustments may  be made to these comparable sales based on how the characteristics of  these past lease tract sales compare with the lease tract being appraised.  For example, if a past lease sale involved coal that had lower heating  content than the lease tract being appraised, BLM might conclude that the  current tract should have a higher fair market value than the bonus bid  received for this past sale. In contrast, under the income approach, the  revenues received from selling the coal and costs to extract it are  projected into the future, and this net revenue stream is discounted back  to the present. The resulting net present value of this revenue stream  becomes an estimate of the fair market value for the lease tract. See  table 2 for a summary of methods used and information needed for the  comparable sales and income approaches.", "BLM\u2019s guidance states that the comparable sales approach is preferred to  the income approach when similar comparable sales are available  because it is assumed that this method will provide the best indication of  value. When comparable sales are not available, the guidance states that  the income approach is a viable alternative, but the guidance highlights  the uncertainty associated with using the income approach. This  uncertainty stems from its reliance on projections of future market  conditions, such as demand for coal, coal prices, and the costs to extract  the coal. The guidance also provides examples for how the results of the  comparable sales and income approaches can be used together. For  example, information from comparable sales can be used as a  comparison point for results from the income approach. In addition,  results from the income approach can be used to adjust past comparable  sales. Specifically, if the net present value of the tract being appraised is  less than the net present value of a past lease sale, a conclusion can be  made that the tract being appraised is less valuable than the past lease,  and a numeric adjustment can be made to the actual sales prices of the  past lease sale to account for this difference."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "BLM State Offices Differ in Their Appraisal Approaches, and Some Offices May Not Be Fully Considering Future Market Conditions as a Result", "paragraphs": ["During our interviews with BLM officials, we found that BLM state offices  use different approaches to develop an estimate of fair market value of  coal leases, and we confirmed this during our case file review. For  example, for lease sales in Wyoming, Montana, and New Mexico,BLM state offices use both the comparable sales and income  approaches, based on our review of case files. Moreover, the BLM  Wyoming state office goes a step further to numerically adjust its  comparable sales using the results of the income approach. In contrast,  for lease sales in Colorado, North Dakota, Oklahoma, and Utah, the BLM  state offices have generally used just the comparable sales approach in  recent years. For the two lease sales we reviewed in both Alabama and  Kentucky, one of the sales used both approaches, while the other used  just the comparable sales approach. When using the comparable sales  approach, BLM state offices generally only used sales information for coal  sales that occurred in their state. (See app. III for specific information on  the approaches used for the lease sales that we reviewed.)   the  BLM officials in some state offices said that they did not have the  resources to perform appraisals using the income approach. In particular,  the income approach may require the help of an economist, and some  BLM state offices do not have an economist on staff. For example,  officials in both the Utah and Colorado state offices said they did not have  economists on staff. For this reason, the Utah BLM office recently  contracted with a firm to help them perform the income approach for a  lease under consideration. However, BLM headquarters officials told us  that the income approach did not require an economist and that some  mining engineers in state offices could perform appraisals using this  method. Officials in other state offices said they could not justify using the  income approach due to the market for coal in their states. For example,  they said that most coal mining in Oklahoma involves privately held coal,  and a bonus bid is not required to obtain the rights to mine the coal, while  in North Dakota, bonus bids offered as part of private sales have  generally been less than or equal to the $100/acre minimum required for  federal coal leases. When using these private sales as comparable sales,  BLM officials in these states concluded that the minimum bonus bid of  $100/acre should be the estimate of fair market value. BLM officials told  us that if they did not set fair market value at this level, the coal on the  federal lease tracts would be bypassed and never mined.", "The reliance solely on the comparable sales approach among certain  BLM state offices contrasts with the recommendations of officials from  appraisal organizations we spoke with, who generally supported using  both the comparable sales and income approaches when conducting  mineral valuations.

In addition, we reviewed  general appraisal standards in the United States and industry-developed  standards for mineral valuation in Canada and Australia, as identified by  appraisal organizations we spoke with, and we found that mineral  valuation standards in Canada were the most prescriptive in terms of  using multiple appraisal methods. Specifically, the Canadian standards  require that more than one appraisal approach be used unless  justification is provided, and these standards recommend use of both the  income and comparable sales approaches. All of the standards we  reviewed stated that appraisal reports should include a discussion of the  rationale for the appraisal approaches used, as well as the rationale for  any approaches not used. Similarly, representatives from one of the  appraisal groups we interviewed said that if only a single approach is  employed, the reasons for doing so should be documented and justified.  According to BLM\u2019s guidance, officials must document the rationale for  choosing a certain appraisal approach in the appraisal report but, during  our review of case files, we generally did not find this rationale  documented in states where one approach was used. In contrast,  appraisal reports prepared for lease sales in New Mexico, North Dakota,  Montana, and Wyoming contained explanations for the appraisal  approaches they chose to use.", "Because the income approach examines estimates of future market  conditions while the comparable sales approach focuses on past coal  lease sales, BLM state offices that rely solely on the comparable sales  approach may not be fully considering current or new trends in coal  markets when estimating fair market value. This is particularly true if a  state office is using comparable sales from a time during which market  conditions were different. During our case file review, we found there  were several comparable sales used that were over 5 years old. One  official from an appraisal organization told us that he would hesitate to  use comparable sales that were older than 5 years because of changes in  market conditions.

In total, the accepted bonus  bid amounts related to all four tracts was more than $2 million below the  presale estimate of fair market value. Three of these sales occurred in the  1990s, and one occurred in 2007. As outlined in BLM\u2019s guidance, bonus  bids below the presale estimate of fair market value may be considered  as long as the bid is above the minimum bonus bid requirement of $100  per acre, among other factors. Furthermore, BLM\u2019s guidance allows for  additional information to be considered or additional analysis to be  completed as part of a postsale review process to address technical  errors or in cases where appraisal standards are not met. BLM\u2019s  guidance states that postsale analysis be documented and any revised  fair market value be reviewed, but it does not clearly describe what  postsale documentation is needed. According to BLM headquarters  officials, this postsale analysis must be documented and a new estimate  of fair market value needs to be completed and reviewed. We did not,  however, find this documentation in the case files we reviewed for these  four sales. Specifically, we found no documented evidence of a single,  revised fair market value estimate against which to compare the bids. The  files contained general statements about additional information that was  considered during the postsale review process, such as changes in  mining plans or changes in coal prices.

Furthermore, both the Uniform Standards of  Professional Appraisal Practice and the Uniform Appraisal Standards for  Federal Land Acquisition note that independent appraisal review is an  important tool for ensuring that the valuation estimate is credible. BLM  headquarters officials currently have a very limited role in reviewing  appraisal reports prior to a lease sale, and they told us that headquarters  officials receive copies of between 5 and 10 percent of appraisal reports  prior to a lease sale occurring.

Because there is typically little competition for federal leases, BLM plays  a critical role in ensuring that the public receives fair market value for the  coal that is leased. However, we found differences across BLM state  offices in the approaches they use to estimate fair market value and the  rigor of these reports. Moreover, BLM state offices are not documenting  the rationale for choosing their approaches for the appraisal process.", "Adequate oversight of the fair market value process is critical to ensuring  that its results are sound and properly reviewed. However, BLM\u2019s  guidance on the valuation of coal properties is out of date, and officials  are not reviewing and signing appraisal reports in accordance with BLM\u2019s  guidance. Without a mechanism to ensure consistent reviews by three  officials, as specified in the guidance, and independent third-party  reviews, appraisal reports may not be receiving the scrutiny they deserve.", "BLM\u2019s guidance allows for additional information and analyses to be  considered as part of the postsale review process, which could result in a  lower revised fair market value estimate and acceptance of bids below  the presale fair market value estimate but above the revised estimate.  The guidance calls for such decisions to be fully justified and that a  revised fair market value be clearly documented and reviewed. However,  we found instances where BLM\u2019s justification to accept such bids was not  adequately documented. Without proper documentation of these  decisions, adequate oversight cannot take place, and BLM does not have  assurance that accepted bids were in compliance with the Minerals  Leasing Act.", "Coal exports make up a small but growing proportion of total U.S. coal  production, yet BLM state offices were generally not tracking the export  activity for mines on federal leases and were including only generic  statements about exports in their appraisal reports, and some state  offices were not routinely including export information in appraisal reports.  Moreover, BLM officials were largely unaware of the various sources of  mine-level information about exports, such as the information that EIA  collects and the information collected by private companies. By not  tracking and considering all available export information, BLM may not be  factoring specific export information into appraisals for lease tracts that  are adjacent to mines currently exporting coal or keeping abreast of  emerging trends in this area.", "BLM state offices are not following agency guidance because they have  not prepared public versions of appraisal reports, and there is a lack of  agreement within the agency on the extent and type of information related  to the estimation of fair market value to be shared in response to public  requests. Without updated guidance and a consensus, there may  continue to be a disconnect between BLM\u2019s guidance and its standard  practice of not releasing this information publicly.
