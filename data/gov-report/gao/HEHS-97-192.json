With the aging of World War II veterans, the numbers of veteran deaths and interments performed by NCS continue to grow each year and are projected to peak between 2005 and 2010. In addition, due to the depletion of available grave sites, over half of the national cemeteries will be unable to accommodate casket burials of \u201cfirst family members\u201d before then. Therefore, it is important that NCS develop long-range plans for addressing veterans\u2019 future burial needs.", "This letter responds to your concerns about NCS\u2019 ability to accommodate the increasing demand for burial benefits. Specifically, you requested that we (1) assess NCS\u2019 plans for addressing veterans\u2019 future burial demands; (2) determine the relative 30-year costs of three types of cemeteries: one providing only casket interment, another providing only interment of cremated remains in columbarium niches, and a third providing only in-ground interment of cremated remains; and (3) identify what NCS can do to extend the service period of existing national cemeteries.", "To address your request, we met with NCS officials responsible for planning, expanding, and constructing national and state veterans\u2019 cemeteries.

We selected the national cemeteries in the first three localities because they offered interment of cremains in both columbaria and in-ground sites during fiscal year 1996. Moreover, the Los Angeles National Cemetery operates and maintains the oldest columbarium in the system. Tahoma National Cemetery, in the fourth locality, is the most recently constructed national cemetery, and its cost figures are the basis for our 30-year cost estimates.

NCS determines the number and type of burial options available at each of its national cemeteries. The standard size of casket grave sites, the most common burial choice, is 5 feet by 10 feet, and the grave sites are prepared to accommodate two caskets stacked one on top of the other. A standard in-ground cremains site is 3 feet by 3 feet and can generally accommodate one or two urns. The standard columbarium niche used in national cemeteries is 10 inches wide, 15 inches high, and 20 inches deep. Niches are generally arrayed side by side, four units high, and can hold two or three urns, depending on urn size. Figure 1 shows a columbarium and in-ground cremains sites at national cemeteries.", "Armed forces members who die while on active duty and certain veterans are eligible for burial in a national cemetery. Eligible veterans must have been discharged or separated from active duty under other than dishonorable conditions and have completed the required period of service. People entitled to retired pay as a result of 20 years\u2019 creditable service with a reserve component of the armed services are also eligible. U.S. citizens who have served in the armed forces of a government allied with the United States in a war may also be eligible. The benefit of burial in a national cemetery is further extended to spouses and minor children of eligible veterans and of active duty members of the armed forces. A surviving spouse of an eligible veteran who later marries a nonveteran, and whose remarriage is terminated by death or divorce, is also eligible for burial in a national cemetery.", "Burial in a VA cemetery includes, at no cost to the veteran, one grave site for the burial of all eligible family members. Also included are the opening and closing of the grave, perpetual care of the site, and a government headstone or marker and grave liner. Veterans\u2019 families are required to pay for services provided by funeral directors and additional inscriptions on the headstone or marker. Generally grave sites may not be reserved; space is assigned at the time of need on the basis of availability.", "In addition to burying eligible veterans and their families, NCS manages three related programs: (1) the Headstones and Markers Program, which provides headstones and markers for the graves of eligible people in national, state, and private cemeteries; (2) the Presidential Memorial Certificates Program, which provides certificates to the families of deceased veterans recognizing their contributions and service to the nation; and (3) the State Cemetery Grants Program, which provides aid to states in establishing, expanding, or improving state veterans\u2019 cemeteries.", "In 1978, Public Law 95-476 authorized NCS to administer the State Cemetery Grants Program, under which states receive financial assistance to provide burial space for veterans and eligible dependents. State veterans\u2019 cemeteries supplement the burial service provided by NCS. The cemeteries are operated and permanently maintained by the states. A grant may not exceed 50 percent of the total value of the land and the cost of improvements. The remaining amount must be contributed by the state. The State Cemetery Grants Program has funded the establishment of 28 veterans\u2019 cemeteries, including three cemeteries currently under development, located in 21 states, Saipan, and Guam. The program has also provided grants to state veterans\u2019 cemeteries for expansion and improvement efforts.", "While VA strongly encourages states to adopt the eligibility criteria applied to national cemeteries, states have been allowed to establish eligibility criteria for interments that differ from VA-established criteria, but only if their criteria are more restrictive than those established for national cemeteries. In other words, state veterans\u2019 cemeteries cannot be used for the interment of people who are not eligible for burial in a national cemetery.

The plan sets forth four specific strategies for achieving this goal. First, NCS plans to establish, when feasible, new national cemeteries. NCS is currently establishing five new national cemeteries, which are in various stages of development, and projects that all will be operational by 2000.", "A second strategy for addressing veterans\u2019 burial demand is to develop available space for cremated remains. NCS plans to survey national cemeteries to determine what space is available for use as in-ground cremains sites, construct additional columbaria at eight existing cemeteries, and include columbaria at the five new cemeteries.", "Third, NCS plans to acquire land through purchase or donation. NCS plans to use this land to extend the burial capacity and service period of national cemeteries currently projected to run out of available grave sites.", "Fourth, NCS plans to encourage states to provide additional burial sites for veterans through participation in the State Cemetery Grants Program. According to the plan, NCS plans to identify and prioritize those states most in need of a veterans\u2019 cemetery; design a marketing strategy for those states; visit a minimum of four of those states annually until all prioritized states have been visited; and participate in the state conferences of at least three veterans\u2019 service organizations (for example, the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars) each year.", "In addition to the strategic and performance goals, the plan also discusses assumptions, such as veterans\u2019 demographics (the projected increases in veteran deaths and interments), and external factors, such as resource constraints, that could delay achievement of the plan\u2019s performance goals. However, the plan does not tie the strategic and performance goals to its assumptions. For example, while the plan includes some data on demographic trends in the veteran population, it does not explain how these data were used in setting strategic goals, or how they will be used to measure progress in achieving these goals. Neither does the plan tie its strategic and performance goals to external factors\u2014such as preferences for VA, state, or private cemeteries and preferences for casket, in-ground cremains, or columbaria niche burial\u2014that will affect the need for additional VA and state cemetery capacity. NCS tracks actual burial practices in national cemeteries, monitors trends in the private cemetery sector, and in 1992 surveyed veterans to determine their preferences for type of cemetery (national, state, or private) and burial option (casket or cremation burial).", "Despite NCS plans to ensure that burial in a national or state veterans\u2019 cemetery is an available option, officials acknowledge that large numbers of veterans currently do not have access to a veterans\u2019 cemetery within a reasonable distance of their place of residence. For example, NCS estimates that of the approximately 26 million veterans in 1996, about 9 million (35 percent) did not have reasonable access to a national or state veterans\u2019 cemetery. According to NCS officials, most underserved areas are major metropolitan regions with a high concentration of veterans. With the completion of the five new cemeteries, NCS officials estimate that the percentage of veterans who will have reasonable access to a veterans\u2019 cemetery will increase from about 65 percent in fiscal year 1996 to about 77 percent in fiscal year 2000."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "How NCS Plans to Address Burial Demand Beyond the Year 2000 Is Unclear", "paragraphs": ["Although NCS has a 5-year strategic plan for addressing veterans\u2019 burial demand during fiscal years 1996 through 2000, it is unclear how NCS plans to address the demand beyond 2000.

According to NCS\u2019 Chief of Planning, although its strategic plan does not address long-term burial needs, NCS is always looking for opportunities to acquire land to extend the service period of national cemeteries. For example, NCS is working to acquire land for one of its west coast cemeteries that is not scheduled to run out of casket sites until the year 2011. Also, to help address long-range issues, NCS compiles key information, such as mortality rates, number of projected interments and cemetery closures, locations most in need of veterans\u2019 cemeteries, and cemetery-specific burial layout plans. In addition, the planning chief pointed out that the Government Performance and Results Act requires a strategic plan to cover only a 5-year period. However, the Results Act allows an agency to extend its strategic plan beyond a 5-year period to address future goals. Although NCS\u2019 strategic plan notes that annual veteran deaths are expected to increase about 20 percent between 1995 and 2010, the plan does not indicate how the agency will begin to position itself to handle this increase in demand for burial benefits.

For example, NCS plans to enhance its relationship with states to establish state veterans\u2019 cemeteries through the State Cemetery Grants Program. According to NCS\u2019 Chief of Planning, NCS will encourage states to locate cemeteries in areas where it does not plan to operate and maintain national cemeteries. Since the State Cemetery Grants Program\u2019s inception in 1978, fewer than half of the states have established veterans\u2019 cemeteries primarily because, according to NCS officials, states must provide up to half of the funds needed to establish, expand, or improve a cemetery, as well as pay for all equipment and annual operating costs. Furthermore, the Director of the State Cemetery Grants Program told us that few states, especially those with large veteran populations, have shown interest in legislation that VA proposed in its 1998 budget submission in order to increase state participation. This legislation would increase the federal share of construction costs from 50 to 100 percent and permit federal funding for up to 100 percent of initial equipment costs. In fact, according to the Director, state veterans\u2019 affairs officials said that they would rather have funding for operating costs than for construction.", "In addition, VA does not plan to request construction funds for more than the five new cemeteries, which will be completed by the year 2000, because of its commitment to deficit reduction. Officials said that even with the new cemeteries, interment in a national or state veterans\u2019 cemetery will not be \u201creadily accessible\u201d to all eligible veterans and their family members.

The difference in costs is due primarily to the higher land development and operations/maintenance costs of a casket cemetery.

As table 1 shows, over 30 years the development and construction cost for a columbarium cemetery would be, on average, about three times as much as that for an in-ground cremains cemetery. This difference in costs is primarily due to the cost of building the columbarium structure.

Furthermore, at the end of fiscal year 1996, only 9 of the 114 national cemeteries offered interment in a columbarium, while the majority of cemeteries provided casket and in-ground cremains sites. According to NCS officials, NCS has not made greater use of columbaria primarily because of their substantial up-front construction costs. Officials said they generally develop casket and in-ground cremains sites first because they believe the initial costs are less. However, our analysis showed that the total cost per burial would be lower for a columbarium because of its low operations and maintenance costs.", "Columbaria would be particularly useful in metropolitan areas where interment rates are high; past or projected cremation demand is significant; land is scarce, expensive, or both; and no state veterans\u2019 cemetery exists to compensate for the lack of available national cemetery grave sites. For example, at one midwestern cemetery, NCS plans to add about 8,000 casket sites, but no cremation sites, to its last acres. With the additional casket sites, the cemetery is projected to deplete all burial spaces about the time veteran deaths peak, and no state veterans\u2019 cemetery exists to compensate for the lack of burial spaces. However, by incorporating columbaria into 1/2 acre of land, this cemetery could continue to provide a burial option to thousands of additional veterans, who otherwise would have no burial option available to them within a reasonable distance of their homes, and keep the cemetery open well beyond the peak years.", "While historical data imply that the majority of veterans and eligible dependents prefer a casket burial, NCS national data show that the demand for cremation at national cemeteries is increasing. For example, while about 70 percent of veterans prefer a casket burial, veterans choosing cremation increased from about 20 percent of the veteran population in 1990 to nearly 30 percent in 1996, and NCS officials expect demand for cremation to continue to increase in the future. At cemeteries offering both types of interments, the ratio of casket to cremation interments varies significantly. For example, cremation accounts for over 40 percent of interments at some cemeteries and less than 5 percent at others. In addition, according to cemetery directors, veterans choosing cremation do not strongly prefer either in-ground burial or interment in a columbarium niche.", "The incidence of cremation also continues to increase in the general population. For example, cremation was chosen for about 14 percent of nationwide burials in 1985 and about 21 percent in 1995. The Cremation Association of North America (CANA) projects that cremations will account for about 40 percent of all burials by 2010. Like other interment options, cremation is an individual\u2019s decision and is subject to influences such as culture, religion, geographic area of the country, and age and generational preferences.

Although NCS has a 5-year strategic plan, it does not address veterans\u2019 burial needs beyond the year 2000, when the demand for burial benefits will be greatest. Specifically, while the World War II veteran population is entering its peak years of need, many national cemeteries are depleting their inventory of available casket grave sites. As a result, additional burial sites are needed to help meet future burial demand. In some cases, state veterans\u2019 cemeteries could reduce the negative impact of the loss of available casket spaces from a national cemetery. However, it does not appear that state veterans\u2019 cemeteries will be able to accommodate all veterans seeking interment. Therefore, NCS needs to rely more on extending the service periods of its existing national cemeteries. Columbaria can more efficiently utilize available cemetery land at a lower average burial cost than the other interment options and can also extend the service period of existing national cemeteries. Using columbaria also adds to veterans\u2019 choice of services and recognizes current burial trends.

We recognize that NCS has developed valuable information from such sources as the Management and Decision Support System and cemetery master plans to help it address long-range issues, but even with this information, NCS is unable to specify the extent to which veterans will have access to a national or state veterans\u2019 cemetery during the peak years.

While the Director stated that NCS carefully tracks actual burial practices in national cemeteries and monitors trends in the private cemetery sector, and that these indexes offer a reliable method of planning for the future, he said that additional data on veterans\u2019 preferences would assist NCS in its planning efforts. Therefore, he stated that NCS will include questions pertaining to personal burial preferences in the next VA National Survey of Veterans.", "Finally, the Director of NCS concurred with our recommendation to identify opportunities to construct columbaria in existing cemeteries for the purpose of increasing burial capacity and extending the service delivery period of these cemeteries. He asserted that NCS is already accomplishing what our recommendation was intended to achieve in that it (1) plans to add columbaria at eight existing cemeteries and five new cemeteries and (2) annually considers all sites that may warrant the establishment of columbarium units. We acknowledge, as stated in our report, that NCS plans to add columbaria at 8 of the 114 existing national cemeteries and include columbaria in its 5 new cemeteries. However, the intent of our recommendation was to encourage VA to identify opportunities to construct columbaria in cemeteries that are nearing depletion of casket grave sites for first family members or have already run out. This will involve at least 72 cemeteries by 2010.", "Although NCS acknowledges that columbaria could extend service at a cemetery that would otherwise be closed to veteran use, they have only been used for this purpose at one national cemetery. While the NCS Director stated in his comments that NCS considers the anticipated ratio of casket burial to cremains burial when planning for the future, during our review, NCS officials stated that they primarily use historical usage data. For example, at one cemetery, NCS planned to allocate more than 30 percent of the burial spaces for cremation sites, although the cremation rate for the state in which the cemetery was located was more than 50 percent in 1995, and projected to increase to more than 60 percent in 2000 and to about 80 percent in 2010. As our report states, by including other factors in the decision process, such as projected cremation demand, availability and cost of land, and availability of grave sites at state veterans\u2019 cemeteries, officials may identify additional national cemeteries that warrant the establishment of columbaria.", "NCS also provided technical comments in an attached white paper. Comments 1 through 3 repeat points made in the letter. Comments 4 and 5 question the results of our analysis of the cost of extending the service period of existing cemeteries, since it was based on the maximum number of burial sites available in an acre of land. Specifically, NCS commented that it may not be feasible to devote a single 1-acre plot entirely to columbarium niches because using the \u201cabsolute maximum\u201d would not allow space between structures. However, in our analysis we did not envision a single 1-acre plot. Rather, we assumed several parcels of land dispersed around the cemetery that totaled 1 acre of available burial space. Accordingly, we have revised our discussion to clarify this issue.", "Comment 6 questions our assumption that first family member interments would be evenly spaced over 30 years for all three modes of burial. Specifically, NCS suggests an analysis in which the annual interment rates are assumed to differ for the three alternatives (casket, in-ground cremains, and columbarium burials), reflecting current use patterns. However, our objective was to perform a cost comparison. For a valid cost comparison, the alternatives being compared must be evaluated in terms of the same outcome\u2014in this case, to inter a given number of eligible veterans and their dependents according to a given schedule. The specific assumption we adopted\u2014evenly spaced first family member interments for all alternatives\u2014was previously suggested to us by NCS, and our analysis is similar to the one NCS used in its 1996 study. The type of analysis that NCS is now suggesting is outside the scope of our work.", "NCS offered other technical comments, which we incorporated where appropriate.

They told us that a cemetery exclusively devoted to casket burial would require 114.8 acres, of which 57.4 acres would be used for grave sites and 57.4 acres for infrastructure (parking lots, driveways, buildings, landscaping, and so on). A cemetery devoted exclusively to in-ground cremains burial would require 34.3 acres (10.3 acres for burial sites and 24.0 acres for infrastructure).

VA said that the GS administrative and interment requirements would be the same for all three modes but that the WG labor associated with each mode would vary. According to NCS assumptions, the WG labor required for casket burials was 6.7 FTEs.

These costs vary depending on the area of the country in which the headstones and markers are purchased. For this analysis, we used the middle price in the range of prices VA said they pay. For a casket burial, we assumed a headstone cost of $120; for an in-ground cremains burial, we assumed a grave marker cost of $70; and for a columbarium burial, we assumed a niche cover cost of $15. Casket burials require grave liners, at an estimated cost of $240 apiece.", "Labor associated with maintenance. VA uses the standard of 1 FTE per 10.7 developed acres for casket cemeteries. Using this ratio, under the casket scenario, we estimated that maintenance of developed acreage would require 3.5 WG FTEs during phase 1 (years 4 through 13), 7 FTEs during phase 2 (years 14 through 23), and 10.5 FTEs during phase 3 (years 24 through 33), at the annual pay rates stated above.

VA uses an estimate of 1 FTE per 7,844 developed grave sites in its planning for new cemeteries. Using this ratio, it would require about .2 FTE a year for the 30-year burial period in a casket cemetery. We adjusted this amount to reflect the lesser acreage of the other modes. For in-ground cremains sites, .04 FTE per year would be required; for columbaria, .002 FTE would be required. The cost differences among the three alternatives are proportional to the differences in the number of burial acres (as opposed to infrastructure acres) that each alternative requires.
