GAO was asked to determine if these problems exist for entities who receive federal grants or direct assistance and (1) describe the magnitude of taxes owed, (2) provide examples of grant recipients involved in abusive and potentially criminal activity, and (3) assess efforts to prevent delinquent taxpayers from participating in such programs. To perform this work, GAO analyzed data from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), three of the largest grant and direct assistance payment systems, representing over $460 billion in payments in fiscal years 2005 and 2006, and the Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Section 8 tenant-based housing program. GAO investigated 20 cases to provide examples of grant recipients involved in abusive activity."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["While most recipients of payments federal grant and direct assistance programs pay their federal taxes, tens of thousands of recipients collectively owed $790 million in federal taxes as of September 30, 2006. This included over 2,000 individuals and organizations that received $124 billion of payments directly from the federal government and who owed more than $270 million of unpaid taxes (almost 6 percent of such recipients) and about 37,000 landlords participating in HUD's Section 8 tenant-based housing program who owed an estimated $520 million of unpaid taxes (almost 4 percent of such landlords). The $790 million estimate is likely substantially understated because GAO's analysis excluded the 80 percent of federal grants that are directly given to state and local governments which, in turn, disburse the grants to the ultimate recipients. GAO selected 20 grant and direct assistance recipients with high tax debt for a more in-depth investigation of the extent and nature of abuse and criminal activity. For all 20 cases GAO found abusive and potential criminal activity related to the federal tax system, including failure to remit individual income taxes and/or payroll taxes to IRS. Rather than fulfill their role as ''trustees'' of payroll tax money and forward it to IRS, these grant recipients diverted the money for other purposes. Willful failure to remit payroll taxes is a felony under U.S. law. Individuals associated with some of these recipients diverted the payroll tax money for their own benefit or to help fund their businesses. GAO referred these 20 cases to IRS for additional collection and investigation action, as appropriate. Federal law and current governmentwide policies do not prohibit individuals and organizations with unpaid taxes from receiving grants or direct assistance. Several federal agencies established policies against awarding grants to tax delinquent applicants; however, federal agencies do not verify applicants' certification that they do not owe taxes. Further, federal law generally prohibits the disclosure of taxpayer data to federal agencies. Eleven grant recipients that GAO investigated appeared to have made false statements by not disclosing their tax debt as required. Further, agencies that award grants are not required to inquire as to recipients' tax debt status prior to providing direct assistance payments."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["This report continues a series of audits and investigations we have  performed at your request to help address the large tax gap facing our  nation. The tax gap represents the difference between what taxpayers  should pay on a timely basis and what the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)  collected through voluntary compliance and enforcement activities. To  help address the tax gap, beginning in February 2004, we have issued a  series of reports detailing how some organizations and individuals abused  the federal tax system at the same time they were doing business with or  receiving benefits from the federal government and the lack of agency  controls to prevent such abuses from occurring. We determined there are  few consequences of abusing the tax system for these organizations and  individuals, which included defense, civilian agency, and General Services  Administration (GSA) contractors; tax-exempt (not-for-profit)  organizations (including charities participating in the Federal  government\u2019s Combined Federal Campaign); and Medicare physicians.  While we performed this work it came to our attention that some  organizations and individuals who were recipients of federal grants were  also abusing the tax system. Thus, you asked us to perform additional  work and report specifically on organizations and individuals who abuse  the federal tax system at the same time they receive federal grants or other  similar types of federal assistance known as direct payments for specified  use (direct assistance) programs.", "Based on your request, we initiated a forensic audit and related  investigations to determine, to the extent practical, whether recipients of  federal grants and direct assistance have unpaid federal taxes. Because the  vast majority of federal grants and direct assistance programs, an  estimated 80 percent of awarded funds, are administered and disbursed  through state and local governments, detailed payment data on the final  recipients needed for us to perform an electronic match with IRS taxpayer  delinquency files are not available at the federal level. Thus, the specific  objectives of our work were to (1) determine to the extent practical the  magnitude of federal taxes owed by individuals and organizations  receiving grants and direct assistance administered and disbursed at the  federal level and to further determine, using a selected case study of a  federal direct assistance program that administers and disburses payments  at the state and local level, tax debts owed by state and local recipients of  such programs; (2) provide examples of grant and direct assistance  recipients involved in abusive or criminal activity related to the federal tax  system; and (3) assess efforts by awarding agencies to prevent delinquent  taxpayers from participating in federal grant and direct assistance  programs.", "To determine to the extent practical the magnitude of taxes owed by  individuals and organizations receiving grants or direct assistance  administered at the federal level, we utilized disbursements data from  three of the largest federal payment systems that processed payments for  the majority of federal grant and direct assistance excluding Medicare and  Medicaid during fiscal years 2005 and 2006. For our case study of  recipients receiving federal payments at the state and local levels, we  selected the Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s (HUD)  Section 8 tenant-based housing assistance program, a direct assistance  program to aid low-income families, because this program is a large  federal program that is administered at the state or local government level.  To determine the extent to which grant and direct assistance recipients  had unpaid federal taxes, we utilized IRS unpaid tax data as of September  30, 2006. Using the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), we  electronically matched IRS\u2019s tax debt data to payment and other  management information that represented payments to the various grant  and direct assistance recipients we identified.", "To illustrate indications of abuse or criminal activity related to the federal  tax system in grant and direct assistance programs, based on our data  mining, we performed investigative work on a nonrepresentative selection  of 20 organizations and individuals that participated in federal grant and  direct assistance programs during fiscal years 2005 and 2006. We selected  these organizations and individuals based upon factors such as the amount  of tax debt and the number of delinquent tax periods. Our investigative  work included reviewing tax records and performing additional searches  of criminal, financial, and other public records.", "To determine the actions that responsible federal agencies take to prevent  individuals and organizations with significant tax delinquencies from  receiving grants and direct assistance, we examined governmentwide and  selected agency policies and procedures, reviewed selected application  files, and interviewed officials from the Office of Management and Budget  (OMB); IRS; and Departments of Agriculture, Education, Health and  Human Services (HHS), Homeland Security, and HUD. For details on our  scope and methodology, see appendix I.", "We conducted our audit between January 2007 and August 2007.

A Direct  Payment for Specified Use (direct assistance) is an award of financial  assistance from the federal government to individuals, private firms, and  other private institutions to encourage or subsidize a particular activity by  conditioning the receipt of the assistance on a particular performance by  the recipient. As such, federal grants and direct assistance programs do  not include solicited contracts for the procurement of goods and services  for the federal government.", "Based on our analysis of fiscal years 2004 and 2005 data from the Federal  Assistance Award Data System (FAADS), federal agencies collectively  awarded grants and direct assistance of approximately $300 billion  annually. Further analysis of the FAADS data indicates that  approximately 80 percent of federal grants and direct assistance consist of  federal funds provided to state and local governments, which, in turn,  disburse funds to the ultimate recipients. Consequently, only about 20  percent of awarded funds are provided directly from the federal  government to the organization that ultimately spends the money.", "Governmentwide policies affecting the award and administration of grants  to nongovernmental entities are covered in OMB Circular No. A-110,  Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements with  Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals, and Other Non-Profit  Organizations. OMB Circular No. A-102, Grants and Cooperative  Agreements with State and Local Governments, provides  governmentwide guidance for administering grants provided to state and  local governments and prescribes similar procedures as those included in  Circular No. A-110. Direct assistance programs are not subject to the same  governmentwide policies as grants; procedures governing the application  and award processes for direct assistance are prescribed in guidance and  regulations promulgated by the cognizant federal agency responsible for  administering the program.", "Most grant applicants that apply directly to the federal government are  required to complete an Application for Federal Assistance, Standard  Form (SF) 424. The SF 424 provides federal agencies with entity  information, such as name, employer identification number, address, and a  descriptive title of the project for which the grant will be used. The  applicant is required to certify that the information provided on the SF 424  is true and correct and whether the applicant is currently delinquent on  any federal debt."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Grant and Direct Assistance Recipients Owe About $790 Million in Taxes", "paragraphs": ["While most federal grant and direct assistance recipients pay their federal  taxes, we identified tens of thousands of grant and direct assistance  recipients that collectively owed about $790 million in federal taxes as of  September 2006. These tax debts were owed by entities who received  federal payments directly from federal payment systems during fiscal  years 2005 and 2006 and individuals who participated in HUD\u2019s Section 8  tenant-based housing program as landlords during fiscal years 2005 and  2006. We used IRS\u2019s September 2006 unpaid assessments file data to  calculate the amount of taxes owed at or about the time the various grant  recipients received their grant payments. Specifically, we found    2,000 of about 32,000 recipients (about 6 percent) who received federal  grant and direct assistance benefits directly from three of the largest  federal payment systems had more than $270 million of unpaid federal  taxes. About $110 million of the $270 million in unpaid taxes represents  unpaid payroll taxes.    37,000 of over 1 million landlords (about 4 percent) participating in the  HUD Section 8 program had about $520 million of unpaid federal taxes.  Most of these tax debts were unpaid individual income taxes.", "In our audit, we found that grant recipients had a substantial amount of  unpaid payroll taxes. Employers may be subject to civil and criminal  penalties if they do not remit payroll taxes to the federal government.  When an employer withholds taxes from an employee\u2019s wages, the  employer is deemed to have a fiduciary responsibility to hold these funds  \u201cin trust\u201d for the federal government until the employer makes a federal  tax deposit in that amount. To the extent these withheld amounts are not  forwarded, the employer is liable for these amounts, as well as the  employer\u2019s matching Federal Insurance Contribution Act contributions for  Social Security and Medicare. Individuals employed by the employer (e.g.,  owners or officers) may be held personally liable for the withheld amounts  not forwarded and assessed a civil monetary penalty known as a trust fund  recovery penalty (TFRP). Willful failure to remit payroll taxes can also be  a criminal felony offense punishable by imprisonment of up to 5 years,  while the failure to properly segregate payroll tax funds can be a criminal  misdemeanor offense punishable by imprisonment of up to a year. The  law imposes no penalties upon an employee for the employer\u2019s failure to  remit payroll taxes since the employer is responsible for submitting the  amounts withheld. The Social Security and Medicare trust funds are  subsidized or made whole for unpaid payroll taxes by the federal  government\u2019s general fund. Thus, personal income taxes, corporate  income taxes, and other government revenues are used to pay for these  shortfalls to the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.", "Although grant and direct assistance recipients had about $790 million in  unpaid federal taxes as of September 30, 2006, this amount likely  understates the full extent of unpaid taxes for these or other organizations  and individuals. For example, except for our case study involving HUD\u2019s  Section 8 tenant-based housing program, our estimate of grant and direct  assistance recipients was limited to data from three of the largest  government payment systems and thus did not include all federal grant  and direct assistance disbursements. Further, our analysis of the three  payment systems did not include recipients of payments who received  their payments through state and local government entities. Based on our  analysis of data from the FAADS, we estimated that payments paid by the  federal government to final recipients account for only about 20 percent of  the total grant and direct assistance funds awarded by the federal  government. The remaining 80 percent of grant and direct assistance funds  are provided to states and local governments, which, in turn, disburse  them to the ultimate recipient.", "Further, to avoid overestimating the amount owed, we limited our scope  to tax debts that were affirmed by either the taxable entity or a tax court  for tax periods prior to 2006. We did not include the most current tax year  because recently assessed tax debts that appear as unpaid taxes may  involve matters that are routinely resolved between the taxpayer and IRS,  with the taxes paid, abated, or both within a short period. We eliminated  these types of debt by focusing on unpaid taxes for tax periods prior to  calendar year 2006 and eliminating tax debt of $100 or less.", "The IRS tax database reflects only the amount of unpaid taxes either  reported by the individual or organization on a tax return or assessed by  IRS through its various enforcement programs. The IRS database does not  reflect amounts owed by organizations and individuals that have not filed  tax returns and for which IRS has not assessed tax amounts due. Further,  our analysis did not attempt to account for organizations or individuals  that purposely underreported income and were not specifically identified  by IRS as owing the additional taxes. According to IRS, underreporting of  income accounted for more than 80 percent of the estimated $345 billion  annual gross tax gap. Consequently, the full extent of unpaid taxes for  grant and direct assistance participants is not known."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Examples of Selected Recipients of Grants and Direct Assistance Involved in Abusive and Criminal Activity Related to Federal Tax System", "paragraphs": ["For all 20 cases of grant and direct assistance recipients we investigated  for examples of abusive and criminal activity related to the federal tax  system based on the large amount of tax debt and number of delinquent  tax periods, we found in all cases evidence that indicated the existence of  such abusive and criminal activities. Of these 20 cases, 14 cases were not- for-profit organizations that received grant payments and also had unpaid  payroll taxes, some dating as far back as the 1990s. For example, one  educational institution failed to submit employee payroll withholding  taxes several times within a 3-year period and accumulated an unpaid tax  liability of almost $4 million. For the cases of payroll tax delinquencies we  investigated, officials responsible for these organizations failed to fulfill  their role as \u201ctrustees\u201d of employees\u2019 payroll tax withholdings and forward  this money to IRS as required by federal tax laws. Instead, these officials  diverted the withholdings to fund the organizations\u2019 operations or for  personal benefits, such as their own salaries or extravagant vacations. The  other 6 cases involved individuals who owed individual income taxes and  who also received government subsidy payments through HUD\u2019s Section 8  low-income housing program. In one of these cases, the landlord  attempted to evict renters who were instructed by IRS to pay the rent  directly to IRS instead of the landlord. In all 20 cases, we saw significant  evidence of IRS collection activity occurring, but in only a couple of cases  did we see action related to investigating these entities and individuals for  criminal violations of federal tax laws.", "Table 1 highlights 10 cases of grant recipients we investigated with unpaid  taxes. The other 10 cases are summarized in appendix II.", "The following provide illustrative detailed information on several of these  cases:  Case 4: This landlord participating in the Section 8 tenant-based housing  program was involved in a fraudulent real estate transaction in addition to  owing over $3 million in delinquent income taxes. The landlord was  indicted on mortgage fraud and racketeering for attempting to sell real  estate at an inflated price using false appraisals. Previously, the landlord\u2019s  family member was convicted of conspiracy to commit mail fraud, wire  fraud, and money laundering in a scheme to sell fraudulent vacation club  memberships. In addition, the landlord was charged with fraudulent  conveyance of over $3 million worth of property to defraud creditors.", "Case 7: This grant recipient organization, which provides medical care to  low-income families, has experienced financial problems throughout most  of the 2000s and has several hundred thousand dollars in delinquent  payroll taxes. During these years, while failing to properly fund its  employee pension plan, the grant recipient paid hundreds of thousands of  dollars in consulting fees to a former employee. Grant recipient could not  document to other auditors over a million dollars in expenses relating to  grants. Grant recipient has not made required contributions totaling tens  of thousands of dollars to its pension plan. In addition, IRS assessed a  TFRP against key grant recipient officials.", "Case 9: This not-for-profit grant recipient has been in operation since the  1980s to provide social services to disadvantaged individuals and families  and has another closely related not-for-profit entity that also received  federal grants. The recipient has over $1 million in unpaid payroll taxes  dating back to the early 2000s, and IRS has placed several tax liens against  the grantee\u2019s property. The grant recipient has had recurring financial  problems and an independent audit report raised concerns about the  entity\u2019s ability to continue operating. The recipient has also been cited for  commingling funds among related grant recipients and for not having a  functioning Board of Directors as represented to the granting agency. The  recipient has been recommended for disbarment.", "Case 10: This not-for-profit grant recipient stopped making payroll tax  deposits for several years beginning mid-2000s, accumulating unpaid  payroll taxes totaling several hundreds of thousands of dollars. IRS filed  liens against grantee assets and assessed the exempt organization with  payroll tax violation penalties and interest totaling tens of thousands of  dollars. A key grant recipient officer had a prior conviction for tax evasion  and was again investigated for improperly using grant funds to purchase  expensive clothing, a luxury vehicle, and lavish vacations and to pay taxes  assessed from a prior tax evasion conviction. A key grantee officer had  numerous individual income tax delinquencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Agencies Do Not Prevent Delinquent Taxpayers from Participating in Federal Grant or Direct Assistance Programs", "paragraphs": ["Neither federal law nor current governmentwide policies for administering  federal grants or direct assistance prohibit applicants with unpaid federal  taxes from receiving grants and direct assistance from the federal  government. Even if such requirements did exist, absent consent from the  taxpayer, federal law generally prohibits IRS from disclosing taxpayer data  and, consequently, federal agencies have no access to tax data directly  from IRS. Moreover, federal agencies we reviewed do not prevent  organizations and individuals with unpaid federal taxes from receiving  grants or direct assistance for the specific programs they administer.", "With regard to administering federal grants, federal law and current  governmentwide policies, as reflected in OMB Circulars, do not prohibit  individuals and organizations with unpaid taxes from receiving grants.  OMB Circulars provide only general guidance with regard to considering  existing federal debt in awarding grants. Specifically, the Circulars state  that if an applicant has a history of financial instability, or other special  conditions, the federal agency may impose additional award requirements  to protect the government\u2019s interests. However, the Circulars do not  specifically require federal agencies to take into account an applicant\u2019s  delinquent federal debt, including federal tax debt, when assessing  applications. While they require grant applicants to self-certify in their  standard government application (SF 424) whether they are currently  delinquent on any federal debt, including federal taxes, the Circulars  contain no provision instructing the agencies to verify such certifications  or describing how such verification should be done. No assessment of tax  debt is required by OMB on a sampling or risk-based assessment.", "Although current governmentwide policies do not require it, federal  agencies, such as HHS and Department of Education, have policies against  awarding grants to applicants that owe federal debts. These policies state  that a grant may not be awarded until the debt is satisfied or arrangements  are made with the agency to which the debt is owed. However, awarding  agencies rely extensively on applicants\u2019 self-certifications that they are not  delinquent on any federal debt, including tax debt. Certain agencies, such  as HHS, stated that they check credit reports to see if the grant applicant  has any outstanding tax liens prior to award of the contract. While it is  difficult to validate the agencies\u2019 assertions, none of these agencies could  provide us examples where grant officials denied a grant based on self- disclosed tax delinquencies or required applicants to make repayment  arrangements with the agency to which debt was owed.", "Even if requirements to verify applicants\u2019 disclosures did exist, federal law  poses a significant challenge to federal granting agencies in determining  the accuracy of representations made by organizations applying for grants.  Specifically, the law does not permit IRS to disclose taxpayer information,  including tax debts, to federal agency officials unless the taxpayer  consents. Thus, unless an applicant provides consent requesting that IRS  provide taxpayer information to federal agencies, certain tax debt  information generally can only be discovered from public records when  IRS files a tax lien against the property of a tax debtor. Further,  representatives of one federal agency that has attempted to develop an  approved consent form discovered that IRS may not accept certain signed  consent forms because a requirement for an applicant to sign a consent  form as a precondition to the agency\u2019s acceptance of the application may  be considered a form of duress and thus raise a disclosure issue.  Notwithstanding, while information on filed tax liens is generally publicly  available, IRS does not file tax liens on all tax debtors nor does IRS have a  central repository of tax liens to which grant-awarding agencies have  access. Further, available information on tax liens may not be current or  accurate because other studies have shown that IRS has not always  released tax liens from property when the tax debt has been satisfied.", "Of the 20 organizations and individuals that we selected for additional  investigation of abuse and criminal activity, 14 were grant recipients that  were required to submit an application in order to be awarded a grant. In  our review of the grant applications for the 14 grant cases, we found that  11 applicants certified in their applications that they were not currently  delinquent in any federal debt, even though IRS had current tax  assessments on file for these entities at the time the applications were  filed. As a result, these 11 cases appear to have violated the False  Statements Act because they did not declare their existing tax debt in their  applications even though they were required to do so.", "Direct assistance programs are generally not subject to the same  governmentwide guidance for grants. Instead, the cognizant federal  agencies implement the necessary regulations for administering the  program. With regard to our HUD\u2019s Section 8 tenant-based program case  study, HUD regulations do not require local housing authorities to identify  whether landlords who participate in HUD\u2019s housing assistance program  and receive housing subsidies have outstanding federal tax delinquencies  or prohibit payments if such delinquencies are identified. HUD regulations  do permit local housing authorities to deny program participation if a  landlord has not paid state or local real estate taxes, fines, or assessments.

With regard to grants, allowing individuals and  organizations to receive federal grants while not paying their federal taxes  is not fair to the vast majority of grant applicants that pay their fair share  of taxes.

Because identifying information on the  final recipients of payments provided at the state and local level is not  available at the federal level, our analysis was limited to those payments  provided directly by the federal government to final recipients. We  estimated these direct payments to final recipients represented about 20  percent of total federal grant and direct assistance payments.", "Because identifying information for final recipients of payments provided  at the state and local levels was not available at the federal level and not  practical for us to obtain, we selected one major federal program that  disburses funds at the local level for a case study analysis.
