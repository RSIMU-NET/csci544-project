Many experts believe that the lack of health insurance discourages families from seeking preventive and other needed care for their children. However, some question the extent to which children need coverage and whether an expansion of coverage would appreciably affect children\u2019s access to health care. In response to concerns about the millions of uninsured children, the Congress has allotted, through the Balanced Budget Act (P.L. 105-33), almost $40 billion over the next 10 years to help states expand insurance coverage to more children, through either Medicaid or other health plans. Now states are considering how much of their funding they will contribute to match this federal investment in children\u2019s health care and how they can best implement an expansion of coverage.", "In light of these events, you asked us to determine what effect health insurance has on children\u2019s access to health care, whether expanding publicly funded insurance improves their access, and what barriers besides lack of insurance might deter children from getting health care. As we agreed with your office, we analyzed evaluations published during the past 10 years on the relationship between health insurance and health care access.", "The evaluations and our analysis of them have several limitations. Access is the ability to obtain preventive or acute care and cannot be measured directly. Therefore, most studies measure access in one of several ways\u2014by how families adhere to a recommended schedule for preventive care, whether they can identify a source of care, their use of health care, or their self-reported access problems. Looking at use cannot by itself distinguish appropriate from inappropriate use. Therefore, some researchers have analyzed specific types of use by recommended schedules, such as children\u2019s making at least one visit to a physician every year.", "In addition, while insurance may influence children\u2019s access to care, a number of other factors, such as their family income or their ethnicity, also influence their health care use. We focused on studies that attempted to control for such factors. Because we reviewed articles published over the past 10 years, generally based on analyses of large national surveys, most of the studies analyzed data collected in the late 1980s. However, the similarity of findings from analyses of surveys done at different times suggests that findings from earlier surveys still apply. Finally, we did not validate the results from any of the studies that we cite. We did our work between June and October 1997 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In 1996, only 66 percent of U.S. children younger than 18\u201447 million\u2014 were covered by private health insurance. Most private insurance for children is acquired through a parent\u2019s employer. However, in 1993, almost one-fourth of the workforce worked for an employer that did not cover dependents. In addition, even if employers offer coverage, the amount that employees have to pay toward it for their families may make health insurance unaffordable. Since the late 1980s, workers\u2019 costs for family coverage have risen sharply. Increases in insurance costs may affect children disproportionately, since the 71 million children younger than 18 represent 27 percent of the U.S. population but 42 percent of the poor. Even if children have insurance, their coverage\u2014and their relationship with their providers\u2014may be disrupted if their parents lose their jobs or change jobs frequently.", "Public health insurance for children is generally provided through the Medicaid program. Currently about 15.5 million (22 percent) of children younger than 18 are covered through Medicaid. The majority of low-income children (65 percent) in Medicaid have a working parent and, of those that do, about half have a parent working full time. To remain in Medicaid, families generally have their eligibility redetermined at least every 6 months. If family income or other circumstances change, children may go in and out of the Medicaid program during a year, disrupting their coverage. This can delay needed care, which can have long-term health consequences.", "Children are uninsured when they have neither public nor private coverage. In 1996, 10.6 million children (14.8 percent) were uninsured, living generally in lower-income working families. Compared with privately insured children, a higher proportion of their parents worked for small employers\u2014the group least likely to offer health insurance. In 1993, only a quarter of employees in firms with fewer than 10 employees and about half in firms with 10 to 24 employees reported that their employer offered a health insurance plan for workers and their dependents, compared with 89 percent in firms with 1,000 or more employees."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Health Insurance Increases Children\u2019s Access to Preventive, Primary, Acute, and Hospital Care", "paragraphs": ["Health insurance does not always cover the preventive care, such as immunizations, that children need to develop optimally. Nevertheless, most of the studies we analyzed used many different measures of access and found that insured children were more likely to have access to both preventive and acute or chronic health care. Children who were insured were more likely to be connected to the health care system through a physician.

In addition, they were more likely to have seen a doctor recently and to have been up to date with their well-child care.", "A child\u2019s having a usual source of care increases the likelihood he or she will receive preventive or acute health care. One research study based on nationally representative data found that 20 percent of all uninsured children lacked a usual source of care, compared with 7 percent of insured, white, nonpoor children. Using regression analysis to isolate the effect of insurance from race, income, and ethnicity, this study found that uninsured children were twice as likely to lack a usual source of care as insured children. Uninsured children were also more likely to lack after-hours care and to spend more time traveling and more time waiting to receive care. Similarly, another study found that 33 percent of uninsured children did not go to a physician\u2019s office for their routine care, compared with 14 percent of insured children (insured privately or through Medicaid). Controlling for factors other than insurance, the study found that uninsured children were more than twice as likely as insured children to get care in places other than a physician\u2019s office.", "Generally, lower-income children (whether uninsured or receiving public insurance) are less likely to go to a physician\u2019s office for their care. The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) found that 94 percent of U.S. children\u2014more than 65 million\u2014had a usual source of care in 1993. Of these, 94 percent of privately insured children, 62 percent of publicly insured children, and 74 percent of uninsured children used a doctor\u2019s office as their usual source of care. Conversely, 5 percent of privately insured children, 30 percent of publicly insured children, and 20 percent of uninsured children used a clinic as their regular source of care.", "Most experts believe that preschool children need regular visits to physicians to stay current in their immunizations and to be screened for health problems, but researchers found access problems for preschool children. About one-quarter of U.S. 3-year-olds born in 1988 had a gap in their health insurance coverage of at least 1 month, and almost 15 percent had a gap of 7 months or more or had never been covered. Preschool children who had gaps in coverage were more likely to have gone to multiple sites for care than children who had continuous insurance coverage, suggesting that the care they received was more likely to be sporadic and fragmented. Just over 40 percent of preschool children went to two or more sites of care (not counting emergency care). However, controlling for other factors affecting access, preschool children who had a gap in coverage of more than 6 months were 74 percent more likely to have gone to more than one site for care. Disruption of insurance coverage seems to be the salient factor because children who had no insurance were no more likely than insured children to have gone to multiple sites of care.", "Experts have stated that adolescents can benefit from the guidance of a trusted health provider to help them through a period when their bodies are changing and they may be tempted to take risks, such as having unprotected sex or using drugs, alcohol, or tobacco products.

One study showed that children in Medicaid or who had no insurance were much less likely to have contacted a primary care physician before they came to the hospital with appendicitis. Children whose families did not contact a primary care physician before hospital admission were operated on less quickly if they were admitted on weekends and were more likely to have a perforated appendix. Contact with a primary care provider, not insurance status, was the key to differing rates of this complication, but having private insurance did increase the likelihood that a child would have a relationship with a primary care physician.", "Six studies that controlled for other factors affecting access found that uninsured children were less likely to receive routine checkups, dental care, or any kind of doctor\u2019s visit. Some of them compared routine visits made with the number of visits recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) (see table 2) and found that uninsured children were less likely to meet such standards.", "For example, one study found that 30 percent of uninsured children were not up to date with well-child care visits, as AAP recommends, compared with 22 percent of insured children. Compared with insured children, and controlling for other factors that affect access, uninsured children were 50-percent more likely not to have made any visits to a physician in the past year and almost twice as likely never to have had routine care. In a local California study, lack of insurance was the strongest predictor that children older than 5 had not seen a dentist in the past year, compared with privately insured children.", "Uninsured children were less likely to have received care when it was not an emergency. An analysis of the 1980 National Medical Care Utilization and Expenditure Survey, after adjusting for other factors affecting access, found that uninsured children had a 69-percent likelihood that they would use nonemergency ambulatory care during the year, compared with 81 percent for privately insured children.

In 1988, children younger than 18 had total injury rates of 16.3 per 100. Serious injuries that resulted in restricted activity, bed days, surgery, hospitalization, or substantial pain represented about half of total injuries. A study that compared injury treatment for insured children (private insurance and Medicaid combined) and uninsured children found that the uninsured were less likely to be brought in for the treatment of injuries. The study\u2019s researchers estimated that for children who had no coverage in 1988, the year of the study, between 20 and 30 percent of total injuries may not have been examined and treated by a health professional. At least 40 percent of serious injuries to uninsured children younger than 11 might not have been examined and treated.", "These researchers also found that Medicaid-insured children had treatment rates similar to privately insured children, suggesting that public insurance helped ensure that children would receive treatment for injuries. Their finding that families that had Medicaid coverage for their children would seek health care for them, while families of uninsured children would not, is consistent with the findings from the Rand Health Insurance Experiment that families of poor children in cost-sharing plans were less likely to seek care for diagnoses related to trauma or accidents than families of poor children with free care.", "Uninsured children were less likely to receive treatment for some of the common illnesses of childhood. Uninsured children were about twice as likely to have received no care from a physician for pharyngitis, acute earache, recurrent ear infections, and asthma. (See fig. 3.) These are common conditions\u2014with an incidence rate of 8 to 10 per 100 children\u2014for which medical care is considered necessary. They can also have serious consequences for some children if they are left untreated. For example, pharyngitis, if caused by untreated group A streptococci, can lead to rheumatic fever. Untreated middle-ear infections can lead to long-term hearing loss and sometimes to related speech and language difficulties. Severe asthma can cause respiratory failure and death.", "Looking at more rare conditions, one study examined severity of illness when privately insured and underinsured children were diagnosed with inflammatory bowel diseases. Inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis) can result in absence from school, progressive malnutrition, weight loss, anemia, depression, and fatigue. Early diagnosis can catch these diseases before they have progressed so that they can be treated with less-aggressive therapies. The study\u2019s authors, comparing a limited number of cases of underinsured children who had these rare illnesses with insured children who had the same illnesses, found that children who were underinsured had 2-1/2 times the weight loss of insured children and had waited 8 months longer before diagnosis. The children\u2019s laboratory results also indicated that they were sicker before diagnosis and were more likely to be anemic. The authors suggested that delay in diagnosis could have occurred for several reasons, such as seeing different physicians at the same clinic or emergency room or not being able to get timely appointments with subspecialists."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Uninsured Children Are Hospitalized More Frequently for Lack of Primary Care", "paragraphs": ["A lack of appropriate ambulatory care can cause children to be inappropriately hospitalized when they could have been treated as outpatients.

In contrast, hospital admissions in Spain for conditions sensitive to ambulatory care did not vary for children living in lower- and higher-income neighborhoods.", "Lower-income U.S. neighborhoods had higher avoidable hospitalization rates compared with higher-income neighborhoods for both children and adults. Income differences in avoidable hospitalizations dropped for persons 65 years old or older, probably because of their Medicare coverage. Compared with privately insured patients in the same age category, uninsured patients had higher rates of avoidable hospitalization.", "Medicaid patients had even higher rates. Most of the potentially avoidable hospitalizations for children younger than 15 were for pneumonia or asthma.

Self-rated access to care was lower in communities that had greater proportions of uninsured residents, Medicaid beneficiaries, and persons without a usual source of care.", "Analysis of crossnational data also suggests that broader access to primary care reduces the number of hospitalizations for conditions sensitive to ambulatory care. Several researchers compared such admissions for children in Spain and several U.S. cities. Although rates of hospital admission were higher in general for children in Spain, rates of hospitalization for conditions sensitive to ambulatory care were lower. In addition, lower-income communities in Spain, unlike the United States, did not have higher rates of children\u2019s hospital admissions sensitive to ambulatory care.

For children between ages 1 and 17, uninsured black males and white females rated significantly higher on a risk-adjusted mortality index, indicating that they were sicker on admission. The differences for uninsured black females and white males were not significant. Another measure of children\u2019s being sicker on admission is admission on weekends, which was more likely for all uninsured children except black males. For the entire sample of all ages, uninsured people had shorter lengths of stay for conditions for which physicians had more discretion over the length of stay, and they had a lower probability of getting selected procedures that were either costly or more likely to be done at the physician\u2019s discretion.
