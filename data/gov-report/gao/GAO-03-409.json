More important, several provisions of the act have prevented some agencies from fully adjusting their penalties for inflation. One provision limited the agencies' first adjustments to 10 percent of the penalty amounts, even if the penalties were decades old and hundreds of percent behind inflation. The resultant \"inflation gap\" can never be corrected under the statute and grows with each subsequent adjustment. Also, the act's calculation and rounding procedures require agencies to lose a year of inflation each time they adjust their penalties, and can prevent some agencies from making adjustments until inflation increases by 45 percent or more (i.e., 15 years or more at recent rates of inflation). Finally, the act exempts penalties under certain statutes from its requirements entirely. Consequently, more than 100 exempted penalties have declined in value by 50 percent or more since Congress last set them."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Civil monetary penalties are one method by which agencies enforce federal  laws and regulations, with penalty assessments and collections totaling  hundreds of millions of dollars per year.  Dozens of federal agencies are  currently authorized to levy such penalties for violations involving such  issues as public health and safety, environmental protection, securities  transactions, and international trade.  For example, within the past few  years,   a major automobile manufacturer agreed to pay $425,000 in civil  penalties to settle charges that it failed to promptly recall vehicles with  ignition-switch problems and withheld information in investigations into  fires in its vehicles,    a furniture manufacturer agreed to pay a $900,000 civil penalty to settle  allegations that it knowingly failed to report a substantial hazard in  cedar chests involved in the suffocation deaths of five children, and     a company agreed to pay civil penalties totaling $30,000 to settle  allegations that it violated export control and antiboycott laws by  shipping chemicals to Iran through the United Arab Emirates.", "Congress generally establishes civil penalty maximums in the underlying  statutes, and those maximum penalties are generally reserved for the worst  offenses.  In 1996, Congress amended the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation  Adjustment Act of 1990 to require agencies to issue regulations adjusting  their covered penalties for inflation.  The statute as amended (hereinafter  referred to as the \u201cInflation Adjustment Act\u201d) required agencies with  covered penalties to publish initial penalty adjustments in the Federal  Register by October 23, 1996, and to examine their penalties for additional  inflation adjustments at least once every 4 years thereafter.  The act  limited the first such adjustment to 10 percent of the penalty amount and  required specific calculation and rounding procedures to be followed, but  excluded penalties under certain statutes from coverage (e.g., the  Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 and the Internal Revenue Code  of 1986).", "This report examines the implementation of the Inflation Adjustment Act.   Specifically, our objectives were to determine (1) whether, as of June 30,  2002, agencies with penalties covered by the act had made the required  penalty adjustments and (2) whether provisions in the act have prevented  agencies from keeping their penalties in pace with inflation.  A complete  discussion of our scope and methodology is included later in this report.  In  brief, we focused part of our work on six agencies that the most recent data  available indicated had large penalty assessments.  We also focused on the  five agencies that levy penalties under the excluded statutes. We conducted  this review under our basic legislative authority to undertake work  supporting Congress, and are reporting the results to you as the current  Chairmen and Ranking Minority Members of the two Committees that  sponsored the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Prior to 1996, agencies generally did not have the authority to adjust civil  penalty maximums that were established in statute.  Congress would  occasionally adjust individual penalties or specific groups of penalties, but  not all civil penalties.  As a result, by 1990, many penalties had not been  changed for decades.  When the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation  Adjustment Act of 1990 was enacted, Congress noted in the \u201cFindings\u201d  section of the legislation that inflation had weakened the deterrent effect of  many civil penalties.  The stated purpose of the 1990 act was \u201cto establish a  mechanism that shall (1) allow for regular adjustment for inflation of civil  monetary penalties; (2) maintain the deterrent effect of civil monetary  penalties and promote compliance with the law; and (3) improve the  collection by the Federal Government of civil monetary penalties.\u201d   However, the act did not give agencies the authority to adjust their civil  penalties for inflation.  Instead, the 1990 act required the President to  report to Congress every 5 years on how much each covered civil penalty  had to be increased to keep pace with inflation.  In addition, the act  required the President to report annually on penalty assessments and  collections.", "In July 1991, the Office of Management Budget (OMB) submitted the first  (and ultimately the only) report to Congress under the Federal Civil  Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act describing the penalty increases needed  to keep pace with inflation. Based on submissions from dozens of  agencies, the report identified almost 1,000 civil monetary penalties that  were covered by the act, and listed, by agency, the statutory modifications  that were required to fully adjust the penalties for inflation.  Also, in  satisfaction of the annual reporting requirement, the report also provided  information on civil penalty assessments and collections during fiscal year  1990.  At the request of OMB\u2019s Office of Federal Financial Management, the  Department of the Treasury\u2019s Financial Management Service (FMS)  published those reports until 1998 (providing information on assessments  and collections through fiscal year 1997).  Congress abolished this annual  reporting requirement as part of the Federal Reports Elimination Act of  1998.", "Congress amended the 1990 act in 1996, replacing the 5-year reporting  obligation with a requirement that agencies publish regulations in the  Federal Register adjusting each of their covered civil penalties for inflation.   The act as amended required each agency\u2019s first inflation adjustment  regulation to be published by October 23, 1996, and requires the agencies to  examine their covered penalties at least once every 4 years thereafter and,  where possible, make penalty adjustments.  However, the act limited the  agencies\u2019 initial penalty adjustments to 10 percent of the penalty amounts.   The Inflation Adjustment Act also exempted penalties under the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986, the Tariff Act of 1930, the Occupational Safety and  Health Act of 1970, and the Social Security Act."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Adjustment Procedures", "paragraphs": ["The Inflation Adjustment Act requires agencies to follow specific  procedures when making penalty adjustments.  For example, section 5 of  the act defines a \u201ccost-of-living adjustment\u201d as the following: \u2026the percentage (if any) for each civil monetary penalty by which -   (1) the Consumer Price Index for the month of June of the calendar  year preceding the adjustment, exceeds (2) the Consumer Price Index  for the month of June of the calendar year in which the amount of such  civil monetary penalty was last set or adjusted pursuant to law.", "Therefore, if an agency made its first round of adjustments in October 1996  and the penalty was last set or adjusted in October 1990, the agency was  required to calculate the unrounded cost-of-living adjustment by comparing  the June 1995 Consumer Price Index (CPI) with the CPI for June 1990.", "The Inflation Adjustment Act also provides specific criteria for how  agencies should round any penalty increase. Section 5 of the act says the  following: Any increase determined under this subsection shall be rounded to the  nearest (1) multiple of $10 in the case of penalties less than or equal to  $100; (2) multiple of $100 in the case of penalties greater than $100 but  less than or equal to $1,000; (3) multiple of $1,000 in the case of  penalties greater than $1,000 but less than or equal to $10,000;  (4) multiple of $5,000 in the case of penalties greater than $10,000 but  less than or equal to $100,000; (5) multiple of $10,000 in the case of  penalties greater than $100,000 but less than or equal to $200,000; and  (6) multiple of $25,000 in the case of penalties greater than $200,000.", "For example, if a maximum civil penalty of $5,000 was last set in 1990, and  there had been 17 percent inflation from June 1990 through June 1995 (the  relevant time frame for an adjustment in 1996), the unrounded increase  would be $850 ($5,000 times 0.17).  Because the $5,000 penalty was greater  than $1,000 but less than or equal to $10,000, the statute indicates that the  $850 increase should be rounded to the nearest multiple of $1,000, which is  $1,000.  Therefore, the adjusted penalty after rounding would be $6,000.", "However, section 6 of the Inflation Adjustment Act states that the first  penalty adjustment under these procedures \u201cmay not exceed 10 percent of  such penalty.\u201d  Therefore, in the above example the $1,000 rounded  increase would be limited to 10 percent of the $5,000 penalty amount, or  $500.  As a result, the adjusted penalty after the 10 percent cap would be  $5,500.

Civil  penalty maximums are generally reserved for the most egregious cases  (e.g., those involving willful intent to violate the law and/or fatalities).   Agencies investigate potential violations and determine the amount of  penalty to be sought based on a variety of factors, including the severity of  the incident, whether the individual or organization involved has a previous  history of violations, and the individual or organization\u2019s ability to pay the  fine.  In February 2001, we reported on the implementation of a statutory  provision that required federal agencies to provide small entities (e.g.,  small businesses and small governments) with civil penalty relief.  We  concluded that the requirement was being implemented by the agencies  differently, and that small entities may not be receiving any more relief than  larger entities.", "We have reported several other times on the assessment of civil penalties  and the collection of civil penalty debt.

We questioned this approach, and  recommended that the agency determine the impact of the reduced use  of fines on compliance with safety requirements.  We subsequently  reported that OPS had increased its use of fines.", "In December 2001, we reported on the growth in civil monetary penalty  receivables at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).   In that report, OMB stated that it has broad oversight responsibility in  monitoring and evaluating governmentwide debt collection activities.

In September 1993, the National Performance Review (NPR)  recommended that federal civil monetary penalties be adjusted for  inflation.  Specifically, NPR recommended that a \u201ccatch-up\u201d penalty  adjustment be made to bring penalties up to date, and that the need for  additional inflation adjustments be automatically reassessed every 4 years.   NPR estimated that implementation of the recommendation would  increase federal receipts by nearly $200 million during the fiscal year 1994  through fiscal year 1999 period.

To address the first objective, we electronically searched the  Federal Register and determined whether the required penalty adjustment  regulations had been published by all federal agencies that the 1991 OMB  report and the 1997 Department of the Treasury report indicated had civil  penalty authorities that were covered by the Inflation Adjustment Act.

Specifically, we used certain commonly occurring penalty amounts to  demonstrate how the statute requires the penalties to be adjusted and  rounded, and developed projections of how closely the resultant penalties  tracked a possible rate of inflation.

We interviewed officials in each of the five agencies, asking if they  knew why their agencies\u2019 penalties had been excluded, the effect of the  exclusions on their ability to keep their penalties in pace with inflation, and  whether they believed their penalties should now be adjusted for inflation.

We are doing so  before the passage of four years in order to enhance the deterrent  effect of these penalties because of their importance to our  enforcement programs. Even with these increases, these penalties  appear less than adequate as a full deterrent to violations of the statutes  that we enforce.

One representative said he was not  aware of any instance in which his agency had imposed its largest penalty  (an $1,100 penalty for each day a violation occurred), so he did not believe  a catch-up adjustment to account for lost inflation would have any effect on  the agency\u2019s enforcement actions.  However, he indicated that the same  situation might not be true for the agency\u2019s other civil penalties.

Specifically, the act provides that any increase should  be rounded to the nearest  multiple of $10 in the case of penalties less than or equal to $100,   multiple of $100 in the case of penalties greater than $100 but less than  or equal to $1,000,   multiple of $1,000 in the case of penalties greater than $1,000 but less  than or equal to $10,000,  multiple of $5,000 in the case of penalties greater than $10,000 but less  than or equal to $100,000,  multiple of $10,000 in the case of penalties greater than $100,000 but less  than or equal to $200,000, and  multiple of $25,000 in the case of penalties greater than $200,000.", "For example, if the CPI increased by 10 percent during the relevant period  since a $7,500 penalty was last set or adjusted, the resultant penalty  increase ($750) would be rounded to the nearest multiple of $1,000\u2014which  is $1,000.

For  example, after a first round of adjustments in July 1997, one of PWBA\u2019s  seven civil penalty maximums at the time was $11, five were $110, and one  was $1,100.  Under the statute, any effort by the agency to increase its  penalties during calendar year 2001 (4 years after the agency\u2019s last  adjustment) could include any increase in inflation that occurred from June  1997 through June 2000.  During that period, the CPI increased by about 7.5  percent.

However, virtually all of the  difference between these two figures is caused by the CPI lag feature  discussed earlier (in which only a portion of the amount of inflation  occurring during an adjustment period is counted).  As figure 8 shows,  rounding penalty adjustments based on the size of the increase without the  CPI lag allows the agency to make adjustments each year, and the result is  a much closer fit to the projected rate of inflation.

Agencies\u2019  failure to comply with those requirements may have cost the government  millions of dollars in lost penalties from individuals and organizations that  are the worst offenders of health, safety, environmental, and other statutes.   We believe that an agency charged with monitoring agencies\u2019 compliance  with the Inflation Adjustment Act could have identified the compliance  problems earlier in the act\u2019s implementation, and may have been able to  prevent them from occurring.  For example, an oversight agency could  have developed a database that would determine when penalties were due  for an adjustment and notified the agencies of their responsibilities under  the act.

In  addition, detailed guidance to the agencies regarding the Inflation  Adjustment Act\u2019s requirements might have prevented some of the questions  and problems that have arisen during its implementation.  Finally, an  oversight agency could collect information regarding civil penalty  assessments and collections that has been unavailable for the past 5 years.

As such, the staff said that it is  the responsibility of each agency to comply with the act\u2019s requirements,  and that oversight of each agency\u2019s compliance with the act resides first  with that agency\u2019s inspector general office.  The OMB staff also said they  did not agree that a centralized role of providing guidance and oversight of  governmentwide compliance with the act was necessarily needed.   However, they said that if it were concluded that a federal agency should  take on this added responsibility, an agency other than OMB would likely  be more appropriate for serving this role.  As we indicated in our response  to a similar comment from the Commissioner of FMS, we agree that agency  inspectors general can help oversee the act\u2019s implementation within  particular agencies. However, we also believe some type of central  oversight and guidance function is also needed to ensure consistency in  how the act is interpreted and applied.  Therefore, we did not change our  matter for congressional consideration.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of the Treasury, the  Attorney General, and the Director of OMB.

The tables also identify the initial and subsequent penalty  adjustment final rules that had been published as of June 30, 2002.

In other  cases, agencies within the departments each made their own adjustments  (e.g., the Department of Transportation).

The phrase \u201cnot  required\u201d in a cell in the \u201csubsequent adjustment\u201d column indicates that no  adjustment was required as of June 30, 2002, either because 4 years had not  elapsed since the initial adjustment or because not enough inflation had  occurred to permit an adjustment under the rounding rules in the statute."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Amount of Inflation and Estimated Length of Time Needed to Trigger Penalty Adjustments in Selected Agencies", "paragraphs": ["Table 8 illustrates, for six selected agencies, the (1) size of the agencies\u2019  penalty amounts after the first round of adjustments, (2) the number of  covered penalties at each amount, (3) the relevant rounding category in the  Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act, as amended (Inflation  Adjustment Act), for each penalty amount, (4) the amount of inflation  needed to trigger a second round of penalty adjustments at that penalty  amount, (5) the rounded penalty amount after adjustment, (6) the  percentage increase that rounded penalty represents (when compared to  the earlier amount), and (6) the number of years it will take (at 2.5 percent  inflation per year) to trigger this adjustment.  The amount of inflation  needed to trigger an adjustment is calculated by taking half of the rounding  multiple and dividing that by the size of the penalty.  For example, for the  $11 Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration penalty, half of the $10  rounding multiple is $5, which when divided by $11 equals 45.4 percent.  As  the table shows, some of the agencies\u2019 penalties cannot be adjusted for  more than 15 years under the rounding rules, and the rounded increases are  twice the amount of actual inflation to trigger an adjustment."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO\u2019s Mission", "paragraphs": ["The General Accounting Office, the audit, evaluation and investigative arm of  Congress, exists to support Congress in meeting its constitutional responsibilities  and to help improve the performance and accountability of the federal government  for the American people.
