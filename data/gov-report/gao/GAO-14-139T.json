The DNI reported that more than 4.9 million federal government and contractor employees held or were eligible to hold a security clearance in 2012. GAO has reported that the federal government spent over $1 billion to conduct background investigations (in support of security clearances and suitability determinations--the consideration of character and conduct for federal employment) in fiscal year 2011.", "This testimony addresses policies and procedures executive branch agencies use when (1) first determining whether federal civilian positions require a security clearance and (2) periodically reviewing and revising or validating existing federal civilian position security clearance requirements. This testimony is based on a July 2012 GAO report (GAO-12-800), in which GAO (1) reviewed relevant federal guidance and processes, (2) examined agency personnel security clearance policies, (3) obtained and analyzed an OPM tool used for position designation, and (4) met with officials from ODNI and OPM because of their Directors' assigned roles as Security and Suitability Executive Agents. Because DOD and DHS grant the most security clearances, that report focused on the security clearance requirements of federal civilian positions within those agencies."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In July 2012, GAO reported that the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), as Security Executive Agent, had not provided executive branch agencies clearly defined policy and procedures to consistently determine if a position requires a personnel security clearance. Absent this guidance, agencies are using an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) position designation tool to determine the sensitivity and risk levels of civilian positions which, in turn, inform the type of investigation needed. OPM audits, however, found inconsistency in these position designations, and some agencies described problems implementing OPM's tool. For example, in an April 2012 audit OPM assessed the sensitivity levels of 39 positions, and its designations differed from the agency in 26 positions. Problems exist, in part, because OPM and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) did not collaborate on the development of this tool, and because their respective roles for suitability and security clearance reform are still evolving. As a result, to help determine the proper designation, GAO recommended that the DNI, in coordination with the Director of OPM, issue clearly defined policy and procedures for federal agencies to follow when determining if federal civilian positions require a security clearance. The DNI concurred with this recommendation. In May 2013, the DNI and OPM jointly drafted a proposed revision to the federal regulation on position designation which, if finalized in its current form, would provide additional requirements and examples of position duties at each sensitivity level. GAO also recommended that once those policies and procedures are in place, the DNI and the Director of OPM, in their roles as Executive Agents, collaborate to revise the position designation tool to reflect the new guidance. ODNI and OPM concurred with this recommendation and recently told GAO that they are revising the tool.", "GAO also reported in July 2012 that the DNI had not established guidance to require agencies to periodically review and revise or validate existing federal civilian position designations. GAO reported that Department of Defense (DOD) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) component officials were aware of the requirement to keep the number of security clearances to a minimum, but were not always required to conduct periodic reviews and validations of the security clearance needs of existing positions. GAO found that without such a requirement, executive branch agencies may be hiring and budgeting for initial and periodic security clearance investigations using position descriptions and security clearance requirements that do not reflect current national security needs. Further, since reviews are not done consistently, executive branch agencies cannot have assurances that they are keeping the number of positions that require security clearances to a minimum. Therefore, GAO recommended in July 2012 that the DNI, in coordination with the Director of OPM, issue guidance to require executive branch agencies to periodically review and revise or validate the designation of all federal civilian positions. As of October 2013, ODNI and OPM are finalizing revisions to the federal regulation on position designation. While the proposed regulation requires agencies to conduct a one-time reassessment of position designation within 24 months of the final rule's effective date, it does not require a periodic reassessment of positions' need for access to classified information. GAO continues to believe that periodic reassessment is important."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to be here to discuss executive branch  agencies\u2019 requirements for personnel to have access to classified  information.

In 2008, I testified that  developing a sound requirements process to determine whether a  position requires a security clearance for access to classified information  is important because unnecessary requests for clearances have the  potential to increase investigative workload and related costs. As you  know, a high volume of clearances continue to be processed and a sound  requirements determination process is needed to effectively manage  costs, since agencies spend significant amounts annually on national  security and other background investigations.", "In addition to cost implications, limiting the access to classified  information and reducing the associated risks to national security  underscore the need for executive branch agencies to have a sound  process to determine which positions require a security clearance.

Additionally, the order designated  the Director of OPM as the Suitability Executive Agent. Determinations of  suitability for government employment include consideration of aspects of  an individual\u2019s character or conduct. Accordingly, the Suitability Executive  Agent is responsible for developing and implementing uniform and  consistent policies and procedures to ensure the effective, efficient, and  timely completion of investigations and adjudications relating to  determinations of suitability.", "The order also established a Suitability and Security Clearance  Performance Accountability Council, commonly known as the  Performance Accountability Council, to be the government-wide  governance structure responsible for driving implementation and  overseeing security and suitability reform efforts. Further, the executive  order designated the Deputy Director for Management at the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) as the chair of the council and states  that agency heads shall assist the Performance Accountability Council  and Executive Agents in carrying out any function under the order, as well  as implementing any policies or procedures developed pursuant to the  order.", "The relevant orders and regulations that guide the process for  designating national security positions include executive orders and  federal regulations. For example, Executive Order 10450, which was  originally issued in 1953, makes the heads of departments or agencies  responsible for establishing and maintaining effective programs for  ensuring that civilian employment and retention is clearly consistent with  the interests of national security. Agency heads are also responsible for  designating positions within their respective agencies as sensitive if the  occupant of that position could, by virtue of the nature of the position,  bring about a material adverse effect on national security.", "In addition, Executive Order 12968, issued in 1995, makes the heads of  agencies\u2014including executive branch agencies and the military  departments\u2014responsible for establishing and maintaining an effective  program to ensure that access to classified information by each employee  is clearly consistent with the interests of national security. This order also  states that, subject to certain exceptions, eligibility for access to classified  information shall only be requested and granted on the basis of a  demonstrated, foreseeable need for access. Further, part 732 of Title 5 of  the Code of Federal Regulations provides requirements and procedures  for the designation of national security positions, which include positions  that (1) involve activities of the government that are concerned with the  protection of the nation from foreign aggression or espionage, and (2)  require regular use of or access to classified national security  information.", "Part 732 of Title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations also states that  most federal government positions that could bring about, by virtue of the  nature of the position, a material adverse effect on national security must  be designated as a sensitive position and require a sensitivity level  designation. The sensitivity level designation determines the type of  background investigation required, with positions designated at a greater  sensitivity level requiring a more extensive background investigation. Part  732 establishes three sensitivity levels\u2014special-sensitive, critical- sensitive, and noncritical-sensitive\u2014which are described in figure 1.  According to OPM, positions that an agency designates as special- sensitive and critical-sensitive require a background investigation that  typically results in a top secret clearance. Noncritical-sensitive positions  typically require an investigation that supports a secret or confidential  clearance. OPM also defines non-sensitive positions that do not have a  national security element, but still require a designation of risk for  suitability purposes. That risk level informs the type of investigation  required for those positions. Those investigations include aspects of an  individual\u2019s character or conduct that may have an effect on the integrity  or efficiency of the service.", "As previously mentioned, DOD and DHS grant the most security  clearances.

We reported in July 2012 that in order to assist with position  designation, the Director of OPM\u2014the Executive Agent for Suitability\u2014 has developed a process that includes a position designation system and  corresponding automated tool to guide agencies in determining the  proper sensitivity level for the majority of federal positions. This tool\u2014 namely, the Position Designation of National Security and Public Trust  Positions\u2014enables a user to evaluate a position\u2019s national security and  suitability requirements so as to determine a position\u2019s sensitivity and risk  levels, which in turn dictate the type of background investigation that will  be required for the individual who will occupy that position.", "In most agencies outside the Intelligence Community, OPM conducts the  background investigations for both suitability and security clearance  purposes. The tool does not directly determine whether a position  requires a clearance, but rather helps determine the sensitivity level of the  position. The determination to grant a clearance is based on whether a  position requires access to classified information and, if access is  required, the responsible official will designate the position to require a  clearance.", "OPM developed the position designation system and automated tool for  multiple reasons. First, OPM determined through a 2007 initiative that its  existing regulations and guidance for position designation were complex  and difficult to apply, resulting in inconsistent designations. As a result of  a recommendation from the initiative, OPM created a simplified position  designation process in 2008. Additionally, OPM officials noted that the  tool is to support the goals of the security and suitability reform efforts,  which require proper designation of national security and suitability  positions.", "OPM first introduced the automated tool in November 2008, and issued  an update of the tool in 2010. In August 2010, OPM issued guidance      (1) recommending all agencies that request OPM background  investigations use the tool, and (2) requiring agencies to use the tool for  all positions in the competitive service, positions in the excepted service  where the incumbent can be noncompetitively converted to the  competitive service, and career appointments in the Senior Executive  Service. Both DOD and DHS components use the tool. In addition, DOD  issued guidance in September 2011 and August 2012 requiring its  personnel to use OPM\u2019s tool to determine the proper position sensitivity  designation. A DHS instruction requires personnel to designate all DHS  positions\u2014including positions in the DHS components\u2014by using OPM\u2019s  position sensitivity designation guidance, which is the basis of the tool.  Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) officials told us that  they believe OPM\u2019s tool is useful for determining a position\u2019s sensitivity  level. However, although the DNI was designated as the Security  Executive Agent in 2008, ODNI officials noted that the DNI did not have  input into recent revisions of OPM\u2019s position designation tool.", "This lack of coordination for revising the tool exists, in part, because the  execution of the roles and relationships between the Director of OPM and  the DNI as Executive Agents are still evolving, although Executive Order  13467 defines responsibilities for each Executive Agent. Accordingly, we  found in July 2012 that the Director of OPM and the DNI had not fully  collaborated in executing their respective roles in the process for  determining position designations. For example, OPM has had long- standing responsibility for establishing standards with respect to suitability  for most federal government positions. Accordingly, the sections of the  tool to be used for evaluating a position\u2019s suitability risk level are  significantly more detailed than the sections designed to aid in  designating the national security sensitivity level of the position. While  most of OPM\u2019s position designation system, which is the basis of the tool,  is devoted to suitability issues, only two pages are devoted to national  security issues. Moreover, OPM did not seek to collaborate with the DNI  when updating the tool in 2010.", "During our review completed in 2012, human capital and security officials  from DOD and DHS and the selected components we examined affirmed  that they were using the existing tool to determine the sensitivity level  required by a position. However, in the absence of clearly defined policy  from the DNI and the lack of collaborative input into the tool\u2019s design,  officials explained that they sometimes had difficulty in using the tool to  designate the sensitivity level of national security positions.", "OPM regularly conducts audits of its executive branch customer agency  personnel security and suitability programs, which include a review of  position designation to assess the agencies\u2019 alignment with OPM\u2019s  position designation guidance. In the audit reports we obtained as part of  our 2012 review, OPM found examples of inconsistency between agency  position designation and OPM guidance, both before and after the  implementation of OPM\u2019s tool. For instance, prior to the implementation of  the tool, in a 2006 audit of an executive branch agency, OPM found that  its sensitivity designations differed from the agency\u2019s designation in 13 of  23 positions.", "More recently, after the implementation of the tool, in an April 2012 audit  of a DOD agency, OPM assessed the sensitivity levels of 39 positions,  and OPM\u2019s designations differed from the agency\u2019s designations in 26 of  those positions. In the April 2012 report, the DOD agency agreed with  OPM\u2019s recommendations related to position designation, and the audit  report confirmed that the agency had submitted evidence of corrective  action in response to the position designation recommendations. OPM  provided us with the results of 10 audits that it had conducted between  2005 and 2012, and 9 of those audit reports reflected inconsistencies  between OPM position designation guidance and determinations of  position sensitivity conducted by the agency. OPM officials noted,  however, that they do not have the authority to direct agencies to make  different designations because Executive Order 10450 provides agency  heads with the ultimate responsibility for designating which positions are  sensitive positions. ODNI conducted a separate position designation audit  in response to the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010. In  that 2011 report, ODNI found that the processes the executive branch  agencies followed differed somewhat depending whether the position was  civilian, military, or contractor.", "During the course of our 2012 review, DOD and DHS officials raised  concerns regarding the guidance provided through the tool and  expressed that they had difficulty implementing it. Specifically, officials  from DHS\u2019s U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement stated that the  use of the tool occasionally resulted in inconsistency, such as over- or  underdesignating a position, and expressed a need for additional clear,  easily interpreted guidance on designating national security positions.  DOD officials stated that they have had difficulty implementing the tool  because it focuses more on suitability than security, and the national  security aspects of DOD\u2019s positions are of more concern to them than the  suitability aspects.", "Further, an official from DOD\u2019s Office of the Under Secretary of Defense  for Personnel and Readiness stated that the tool and DOD policy do not  always align and that the tool does not cover the requirements for some  DOD positions. For example, DOD\u2019s initial implementing guidance on  using the tool stated that terms differ between DOD\u2019s personnel security  policy and the tool, and the tool might suggest different position sensitivity  levels than DOD policy required. Also, officials from the Air Force  Personnel Security Office told us that they had challenges using the tool  to classify civilian positions, including difficulty in linking the tool with Air  Force practices for position designation. Moreover, an Air Force official  stated a concern that the definition for national security positions is  broadly written and could be considered to include all federal positions.", "Because we found that the executive branch had not provided clear  guidance for the designation of national security positions, we  recommended that the DNI, in coordination with the Director of OPM and  other executive branch agencies as appropriate, issue clearly defined  policy and procedures for federal agencies to follow when determining if  federal civilian positions require a security clearance. In written comments  on our July 2012 report, the ODNI concurred with this recommendation  and agreed that executive branch agencies require simplified and uniform  policy guidance to assist in determining appropriate sensitivity  designations.", "We routinely monitor the status of agency actions to address our prior  report recommendations. As part of that process, we found that a January  25, 2013 presidential memo authorized the DNI and OPM to jointly issue  revisions to part 732 of Title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations, which  is intended to provide requirements and procedures for the designation of  national security positions. Subsequently, ODNI and OPM drafted the  proposed regulation, published it in the Federal Register on May 28,  2013, and obtained public comment on the regulation through June 27,  2013. ODNI and OPM officials told us they plan to jointly adjudicate public  comments and prepare the final regulation for approval from OMB during  October 2013.", "In reviewing the proposed regulation, we found that it would, if finalized in  its current form, meet the intent of our recommendation to issue clearly  defined policy and procedures for federal agencies to follow when  determining if federal civilian positions require a security clearance.  Specifically, the proposed regulation appears to add significant detail  regarding the types of duties that would lead to a critical-sensitive  designation, or those national security positions which have the potential  to cause exceptionally grave damage to national security. Critical- sensitive positions detailed in the proposed regulation include positions  that develop or approve war plans, major or special military  operations, or critical and extremely important items of war, involve national security policy-making or policy-determining positions, with investigative duties, including handling of completed counter- intelligence or background investigations, having direct involvement with diplomatic relations and negotiations,  in which the occupants have the ability to independently damage  public health and safety with devastating results, and in which the occupants have the ability to independently compromise  or exploit biological select agents or toxins, chemical agents, nuclear  materials, or other hazardous materials, among several others.", "Further, we also recommended in 2012 that once clear policy and  procedures for position designation are issued, the DNI and the Director  of OPM should collaborate in their respective roles as Executive Agents  to revise the position designation tool to reflect that guidance. ODNI  concurred with this recommendation in its written comments on our report  and stated that it planned to work with OPM and other executive branch  agencies to develop a position designation tool that provides detailed  descriptions of the types of positions where the occupant could bring  about a material adverse impact to national security due to the duties and  responsibilities of that position. OPM also concurred with this  recommendation, stating that it was committed to revising the tool after  revisions to position designation regulations are complete.", "The proposed revisions to part 732 of Title 5 of the Code of Federal  Regulations appeared in the Federal Register, but have not yet been  issued, and we recommended that the position designation tool be  revised once policies and procedures for position designation are issued.  We note that the proposed regulation states that OPM issues, and  periodically revises, a Position Designation System, which describes in  greater detail agency requirements for designating positions that could  bring about a material adverse effect on the national security. Further, the  proposed regulation would require that agencies use OPM\u2019s Position  Designation System to designate the sensitivity level of each position  covered by the regulation.", "As part of our ongoing processes to monitor agency actions in response  to our recommendations, ODNI and OPM officials told us that actions  were underway to revise the tool. For example, officials stated that an  interagency working group had been established to oversee the updates  to the current tool, while also determining the way forward to creating a  new tool, and that officials were developing a project plan to guide the  revision process. We plan to continue to review OPM guidance on the  Position Designation System and to review steps taken by OPM and the  DNI to revise the associated position designation tool to determine if the  revised regulation and actions taken to revise the tool meet the intent of  our recommendation."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Executive Branch Does Not Have a Process for Periodically Reviewing and Validating Existing Security Clearance Designations for Civilian Positions", "paragraphs": ["In July 2012, we reported that the executive branch did not have a  consistent process for reviewing and validating existing security clearance  requirements for federal civilian positions.

In addition, agency officials told us that  their policies are implemented inconsistently. DOD\u2019s personnel security  regulation and other guidance provides DOD components with criteria to  consider when determining whether a position is sensitive or requires  access to classified information, and some DOD components also have  developed their own guidance. For example, we found that:", "An Air Force Instruction requires commanders to review all military  and civilian position designations annually to ensure proper level of  access to classified information.", "The Army issued a memorandum in 2006 that required an immediate  review of position sensitivity designations for all Army civilian positions  by the end of the calendar year and requires subsequent reviews  biennially. That memorandum further states that if a review warrants  a change in position sensitivity affecting an individual\u2019s access to  classified information, then access should be administratively adjusted  and the periodic reinvestigation submitted accordingly. However,  officials explained that improper position sensitivity designations  continue to occur in the Army because they have a limited number of  personnel in the security office relative to workload, and they only spot  check clearance requests to ensure that they match the level of  clearance required.", "Officials from DOD\u2019s Washington Headquarters Services told us that  they have an informal practice of reviewing position descriptions and  security designations for vacant or new positions, but they do not  have a schedule for conducting periodic reviews of personnel security  designations for already-filled positions.", "According to DHS guidance, supervisors are responsible for ensuring that  (1) position designations are updated when a position undergoes major  changes (e.g., changes in missions and functions, job responsibilities,  work assignments, legislation, or classification standards), and               (2) position security designations are assigned as new positions are  created. Some components have additional requirements to review  position designation more regularly to cover positions other than those  newly created or vacant. For example,", "U.S. Coast Guard guidance states that hiring officials and  supervisors should review position descriptions even when there is no  vacancy and, as appropriate, either revise or review them.", "According to officials in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement,  supervisors are supposed to review position descriptions annually  during the performance review process to ensure that the duties and  responsibilities on the position description are up-to-date and  accurate. However, officials stated that U.S. Immigration and Customs  Enforcement does not have policies or requirements in place to  ensure any particular level of detail in that review.", "Some of the components we met with as part of our 2012 review were, at  that time, in the process of conducting a onetime review of position  designations. In 2012, Transportation Security Administration officials  stated that they reevaluated all of their position descriptions during the  last 2 years because the agency determined that the re-evaluation of its  position designations would improve operational efficiency by ensuring  that positions were appropriately designated by using OPM\u2019s updated  position designation tool. Further, those officials told us that they review  position descriptions as positions become vacant or are created. Between  fiscal years 2010 and 2011, while the Transportation Security  Administration\u2019s overall workforce increased from 61,586 to 66,023, the  number of investigations for top secret clearances decreased from 1,483  to 1,127.", "Conducting background investigations is costly. The federal government  spent over $1 billion to conduct background investigations in fiscal year  2011. Furthermore, this does not include the costs for the adjudication or  other phases of the personnel security clearances process. DOD and  DHS officials acknowledged that overdesignating a position can result in  expenses for unnecessary investigations. When a position is  overdesignated, additional resources are unnecessarily spent conducting  the investigation and adjudication of a background investigation that  exceeds agency requirements.", "Specifically, the investigative workload for a top secret clearance is about  20 times greater than that of a secret clearance because it must be  periodically reinvestigated twice as often as secret clearance  investigations (every 5 years versus every 10 years) and requires 10  times as many investigative staff hours. The fiscal year 2014 base price  for an initial top secret clearance investigation conducted by OPM is  $3,959 and the cost of a periodic reinvestigation is $2,768. The base  price of an investigation for a secret clearance is $272. If issues are  identified during the course of an investigation for a secret clearance,  additional costs may be incurred.", "Agencies employ varying practices because the DNI has not established  a requirement that executive branch agencies consistently review and  revise or validate existing position designations on a recurring basis.  Such a recurring basis could include reviewing position designations  during the periodic reinvestigation process. Without a requirement to  consistently review, revise, or validate existing security clearance position  designations, executive branch agencies\u2014such as DOD and DHS\u2014may  be hiring and budgeting for both initial and periodic security clearance  investigations using position descriptions and security clearance  requirements that do not reflect national security needs. Finally, since  reviews are not being done consistently, DOD, DHS, and other executive  branch agencies cannot have reasonable assurance that they are  keeping to a minimum the number of positions that require security  clearances on the basis of a demonstrated and foreseeable need for  access.", "Therefore, we recommended in July 2012 that the DNI, in coordination  with the Director of OPM and other executive branch agencies as  appropriate, issue guidance to require executive branch agencies to  periodically review and revise or validate the designation of all federal  civilian positions. In written comments on that report, the ODNI concurred  with this recommendation and stated that as duties and responsibilities of  federal positions may be subject to change, it planned to work with OPM  and other executive branch agencies to ensure that position designation  policies and procedures include a provision for periodic reviews. OPM  stated in its written comments to our report that it would work with the DNI  on guidance concerning periodic reviews of existing designations, once  pending proposed regulations are finalized.", "ODNI and OPM are currently in the process of finalizing revisions to the  position designation federal regulation. As part of our ongoing processes  to routinely monitor the status of agency actions to address our prior  recommendations, we note that the proposed regulation would newly  require agencies to conduct a one-time reassessment of position  designations within 24 months of the final regulation\u2019s effective date,  which is an important step towards ensuring that the current designations  of national security positions are accurate. However, the national security  environment and the duties and descriptions of positions may change  over time, thus the importance of periodic review or validation. The  proposed regulation does not appear to require a periodic reassessment  of positions\u2019 need for access to classified information as we  recommended. We believe this needs to be done and, as part of  monitoring the status of our recommendation, we will continue to review  the finalized federal regulation and any related guidance that directs  position designation to determine whether periodic review or validation is  required.", "In conclusion, the correct designation of national security positions is a  critical first step for safeguarding national security and preventing  unnecessary and costly background investigations. We are encouraged  that in response to our recommendations, ODNI and OPM have drafted a  revised federal regulation and plan to jointly address comments and  finalize these regulations. We will continue to monitor the outcome of the  final federal regulation as well as other agency actions to address our  remaining recommendations.", "Chairman Tester, Ranking Member Portman, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this concludes my prepared statement.
