DOD defines  \u201ccontingency operations\u201d as small, medium, or large-scale campaign-level  military operations, including but not limited to support for peacekeeping  operations, foreign disaster relief efforts, and noncombatant evacuation  operations, and international disaster relief efforts. In contrast, regular or  \u201cbase\u201d activities include, for example, operating support for installations,  training and education, and civilian personnel pay, which are costs that  would be incurred, regardless of contingency operations. Since fiscal year  2010, DOD has submitted separate requests for both base and OCO  funding as part of its annual budget request to Congress. Congress  separately appropriates amounts for base and OCO activities into the  same appropriation accounts and directs how funds are to be spent by  designating specific amounts at the activity level in conference reports or  explanatory statements accompanying annual appropriations acts.  However, congressionally designated amounts are not binding unless  they are also incorporated by reference into an appropriations act or other  statute. In addition, DOD\u2019s OCO budget request now includes some  funding for enduring activities\u2014activities that would continue in the  absence of contingency operations that could be transitioned to DOD\u2019s  base budget. According to the Congressional Budget Office, for each year  since 2006, about $53 billion of the total funding designated for OCO has  been used to pay for enduring costs. It further estimates that about 70  percent of all OCO funding in DOD\u2019s Fiscal Year 2019 OCO budget is  expected to be used for enduring costs.", "We have reported on multiple issues associated with OCO funds since  2007, including efforts to transition enduring costs to DOD\u2019s base budget.  In June 2014, we reported that DOD recognized that the U.S. Central  Command and its service components have enduring headquarters costs,  but the majority of the costs to operate and support U.S. Central  Command, two of its service component commands, and its theater  special operations command headquarters were funded with OCO  appropriations. We recommended that DOD develop guidance to  transition enduring costs funded with OCO appropriations to DOD\u2019s base  budget. DOD partially concurred with this recommendation, stating that  the transition\u2019s time frame depends on the evolution of threats in U.S.  Central Command\u2019s area of responsibility and the impact of the caps  enacted in the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended, on the  department\u2019s ability to migrate additional requirements to the base  budget. In January 2017, we reported that DOD had developed an initial  estimate of costs being funded with OCO appropriations that are likely to  endure beyond current operations, but had not finalized or reported its  estimate outside of the department. We recommended that DOD  develop a complete and reliable estimate of enduring costs to report in  future budget requests. DOD also partially concurred with this  recommendation, stating that until there is relief from the budgetary caps  established by the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended, DOD would  need OCO to finance counterterrorism operations.", "In May 2018, DOD officials indicated that the department was taking  steps to implement our January 2017 recommendation. According to  these officials, they received direction from the Office of Management and  Budget (OMB) to develop a plan for the fiscal year 2020 President\u2019s  Budget to shift the enduring costs in the OCO budget to the base budget,  reducing the size of the OCO budget. According to DOD, the  department\u2019s guidance for the fiscal year 2020 budget directs the  movement of enduring costs to the base budget, and the remaining OCO  budget funds only those costs directly associated with combat operations.  DOD officials told us that this plan is still under consideration. The step  DOD has taken also addresses our 2014 recommendation for DOD to  develop guidance to transition enduring costs funded with OCO  appropriations to DOD\u2019s base budget. Further, based in part on our work,  Congress, in the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2019, required the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)  to submit an annual report for fiscal years 2020 through 2024 that  includes, among other elements, an estimate of the costs of operations  that are likely to continue beyond such operations and that are currently  supported in part or in whole by requested funding for OCO.", "Another issue we have previously highlighted relates to criteria for  determining which activities belong in DOD\u2019s annual base and OCO  funding requests to Congress. We reported in January 2017 that OMB  collaborated with DOD in 2010 to issue these criteria. However, we  found that the criteria were outdated and did not address the full scope of  activities included in DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2017 OCO budget request. We  recommended that DOD collaborate with OMB to revise the criteria, and  DOD concurred. In October 2017, a DOD official stated that the  department had discussed modifications to the criteria with the military  departments and combatant commands, but that it had not made  recommendations to OMB to revise the criteria. The National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 included a provision requiring DOD  and OMB to update their OCO criteria by September 2018. However, in  January 2019, a DOD official confirmed that neither OMB nor DOD had  released updated criteria.", "Section 1523 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  2018 included a provision for us to report on the feasibility of separating  DOD\u2019s OCO expenditures from its other expenditures. In this report we  (1) describe internal controls that selected DOD components use to  separately account for OCO and base amounts during budget execution,  and (2) identify and examine alternatives that Congress or DOD could  use to separate funding for DOD\u2019s OCO and base activities.", "For our first objective, we reviewed documentation of the internal control  activities that DOD organizations in our review have designed to account  for OCO amounts separately from base amounts in their operation and  maintenance (O&M) appropriation accounts during budget execution. We  focused our review on O&M accounts because Congress appropriates  the majority of OCO amounts to DOD\u2019s multiple O&M accounts. In  addition, we focused our review on the military services and two non- service DOD components (U.S. Special Operations Command and the  Defense Security Cooperation Agency) that are allotted the most OCO  funding to the O&M Defense-wide account. We collected information for  this objective through interviews and written requests for information from  financial management officials in the Office of the Secretary of Defense  (Comptroller), the offices of the military services, U. S. Special Operations  Command, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, and the Defense  Finance and Accounting Service. Our review focused on the design of the  internal control systems and did not assess the effectiveness of these  internal controls.", "For our second objective, we searched for relevant literature from 2001  through July 2018. Specifically, we searched for alternative processes  that (1) DOD could use to separately account for OCO funding or (2)  Congress could use to provide separate OCO funding to DOD because  both DOD and Congress could be involved in implementing alternatives  to separate funding for OCO and base activities. We did not identify any  alternatives for DOD to separately account for OCO funding; therefore we  do not address this in our report. We did identify alternatives related to  how Congress provides OCO funding to DOD and how DOD requests  OCO funding from Congress. We identified and summarized four  alternatives related to this in our report based on the literature search and  review by our internal subject matter experts.", "We developed and administered a questionnaire to solicit opinions from  knowledgeable individuals (\u201crespondents\u201d) regarding Congress\u2019 and  DOD\u2019s current processes and the four alternatives. We included the  summaries of all processes in the questionnaire. We asked respondents  to identify positive and negative aspects of Congress\u2019 and DOD\u2019s current  processes and of the alternatives, as well as the costs and requirements  associated with each. We also asked respondents to describe any  additional alternatives. We identified questionnaire respondents within  and outside DOD, and we included questions in our questionnaire to help  us determine whether the respondents were sufficiently knowledgeable  about Congress\u2019 and DOD\u2019s current processes. The respondents were  predominantly current officials in DOD financial management offices,  former DOD officials, and defense budget analysts from think tanks. We  received 17 usable questionnaires, which is a response rate of 81  percent. Fifteen of the 17 respondents to our questionnaire were current  or former DOD officials. Results of this questionnaire are not  generalizable beyond our respondents. We conducted a content analysis  of the responses received to identify similarities, defined for our purposes  as when two or more respondents gave the same or very similar answers  to a particular question. More detailed information on our scope and  methodology can be found in appendix I of this report.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2018 to January 2019  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe the  evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The appropriation and execution of DOD\u2019s base and OCO amounts is  part of the broader federal budget process. In this process, Congress, the  President, and federal agencies take a number of steps to formulate a  budget, enact appropriation acts, and execute the federal budget for each  fiscal year. A summary of the budget process is depicted in figure 1  below.", "In DOD\u2019s budget process, the military services and defense agencies  submit a budget request\u2014known as the Budget Estimate Submission\u2014 that addresses their estimated annual funding requirements for both base  and OCO activities. In building their OCO budget requests, the military  services and defense agencies use criteria that OMB developed in  collaboration with DOD, for deciding whether items belong in the base  budget or in OCO funding requests. The services also use guidance  issued within their own organizations, as well as utilize OCO-specific  budget guidance included in DOD\u2019s Financial Management Regulation.", "Congress then takes action on the budget request and appropriates  funding for both base and OCO activities into the same appropriation  accounts, such as service-specific O&M accounts. Explanatory  statements or conference committee reports accompanying annual  appropriations acts provide congressional direction on how OCO and  base funding amounts should be obligated. However, the congressional  direction for funding is generally not legally binding. Congress also has  the discretion to make available amounts for base activities or enduring  costs through OCO appropriations, even if DOD considers such costs to  be part of the base budget. The Budget Control Act of 2011, amending  the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985,  imposes government-wide discretionary spending limits for fiscal years  2012 through 2021 to reduce projected spending by about $1 trillion. All  amounts appropriated to DOD are subject to limitations on discretionary  spending. Appropriated amounts designated by Congress for OCO that  would otherwise exceed the annual limits established for discretionary  spending will instead result in an adjustment to the overall spending limit  established for a particular fiscal year, and will not trigger a sequestration,  which is an automatic cancellation of budgetary resources provided by  discretionary appropriations or direct spending laws.", "Upon enactment of an appropriation, the Secretary of the Treasury issues  a warrant to federal agencies, which is an official document that  establishes the amount of moneys authorized to be withdrawn from the  central accounts that the Department of Treasury maintains. The  Treasury does not employ a process to separate OCO funding from base  funding in its role in warranting funds to federal agencies, including DOD.  After receiving budget authority, agencies make allotments, delegating  budget authority to various agency officials allowing them to incur  obligations. Agencies then disburse amounts by cash or cash equivalents  to liquidate obligations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Components We Reviewed Use Coding and Other Control Activities to Separately Account for OCO and Base Amounts during Budget Execution", "paragraphs": ["The DOD components in our review use coding and other internal control  activities to separately account for OCO and base amounts in their O&M  accounts during budget execution. To record and track OCO and base  amounts separately, the DOD components use coding in their financial  systems during the allotment, obligation, and disbursement of funds. For  example, during the allotment phase, the Army and the Defense Security  Cooperation Agency use codes in their financial systems to divide,  distribute, and track their appropriated funds into separate categories\u2014 including one for OCO and one for base. Army and Defense Security  Cooperation Agency officials stated that the separate categories are  maintained through the obligation phase. The Air Force, the Marine  Corps, and the Navy use specific codes to track OCO transactions within  multiple systems they use to allot and obligate OCO and base amounts.  For example, the Air Force uses an Emergency and Special Program  code to track and record allotments and obligations of OCO amounts within its budgeting and accounting systems. The Marine Corps uses  three-digit, alphanumeric codes called Special Interest Codes to track and  record costs associated with high-interest activities, such as OCO, during  obligation. Figure 2 describes the steps that DOD takes to separate OCO  and base amounts.", "We identified some internal control activities that the DOD components in  our review have put into place to ensure separate accounting of OCO and  base amounts, such as controls over information processing. A variety  of control activities can be used in information processing, including  controls incorporated directly into computer applications to ensure  accuracy, as well as policies and procedures that apply to information  systems. For example, Army and Defense Security Cooperation Agency  officials stated that the financial systems they use incorporate system  controls that automatically maintain the categories of funding designated  during allotment through subsequent actions, including obligation, which  ensures an amount in the OCO category maintains its OCO-specific  coding throughout the budget execution process. Also, the Army restricts  the number of personnel who are able to reassign the coding of funding  from one category to another. Navy officials explained that two of three  financial accounting systems used by the Navy receive OCO allotments  automatically from the Navy\u2019s budgeting information system, which  eliminates the need for manual entry of allotment amounts. Also, Marine  Corps guidance requires entry of an identifying OCO code in the Marine  Corps\u2019 financial system when recording an OCO-related transaction,  which can prevent data reporting errors.", "In addition to controls over information processing, each DOD component  in our review incorporates reviews of their OCO execution as one of their  internal control activities. Internal control activities also include reviews,  such as reviews of data or expected results, by management throughout  an organization. The financial management offices of these components  periodically review the OCO-related allotments they make within their  components to confirm the amounts are properly recorded. For example,  the Air Force, the Army, the Marine Corps, the Navy, the Defense  Security Cooperation Agency, and U.S. Special Operations Command  review OCO-related execution amounts at least monthly to determine if  amounts are within their established spending plans and that OCO coding  is recorded correctly, among other things. In addition, officials from each  service and the Defense Security Cooperation Agency stated that officials  review OCO-related obligations and verify they are legitimate OCO  expenses.", "The DOD Inspector General and the services\u2019 audit agencies have found  weaknesses in the services\u2019 processes of accounting for OCO costs or in  other related internal control activities. For example, in March 2018, the  US Army Audit Agency found that while the Army had a strategy and  processes to capture and report its financial data for Operation Inherent  Resolve for fiscal year 2016, processes to account for some obligation  data needed improvement. Moreover, an official from the Office of the  Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) stated that, while the DOD  components included in our review have processes to separate OCO and  base amounts, other DOD components may not have similar processes,  and not all components have auditable financial systems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Four Alternatives to the Current Processes That Congress and DOD Use to Separate Funding for OCO and Base Activities Would Entail Tradeoffs", "paragraphs": ["We identified at least four alternatives to the processes Congress and  DOD use to separate funding for DOD\u2019s OCO and base activities.

In its budget justification materials for fiscal  year 2019, DOD estimated that it would shift between $45.8 billion and  $53.0 billion from its OCO request to its base budget request from fiscal  years 2020 through 2023. However, moving DOD\u2019s enduring costs to its  base budget request may require increased base O&M appropriations  provided in annual DOD appropriations acts.

For example, there could be an  O&M appropriation account for the Army\u2019s base activities and an O&M  appropriation account for the Army\u2019s OCO activities.

Two  analysts independently reviewed the full text of the literature sources to  determine which were relevant. When they disagreed, a third analyst  independently reviewed the full text of a source to make the final  determination. We determined that 22 sources were relevant. We did not  identify any sources that described alternative processes for DOD to  separately account for OCO funding; therefore, we do not address this in  our report. We did identify three alternatives related to how Congress  provides OCO funding to DOD and how DOD requests OCO funding from  Congress. We summarized these alternatives and obtained feedback  from our internal subject matter experts familiar with Congress\u2019 process  for providing funding for OCO and DOD\u2019s process for separating OCO  and base funds.

The other two respondents did not reply to our clarification  email, and we excluded their responses to the misunderstood questions.  Not all respondents provided answers to all questions in our  questionnaire. We extracted the data from the Word questionnaires and  imported them into Excel for qualitative analyses. We inspected the Excel  files to ensure that data were not missing or were not imported incorrectly  and made iterative corrections to the process to ensure accurate data  were analyzed. Because we did not pretest the questionnaire, we do not  report the number of respondents who provided any answers but rather  we present qualitative positive and negative aspects based on the  responses.", "We conducted a content analysis in which two analysts independently  categorized each response from each questionnaire to identify  similarities. For our purposes, similarities existed when two or more  respondents gave the same or very similar answers to a particular  question. The summaries of the responses we developed were based on  comments from two to nine respondents. The analysts discussed any  discrepancies in their categorizations until they reached agreement.  Subsequently, an internal subject matter expert provided feedback on the  summary. Using that feedback, the analysts consolidated summaries that  were related and clarified the wording of all the summarized responses.  We identified positive and negative aspects for questions regarding the  current processes and the four alternatives presented in the  questionnaire. We did not summarize positive and negative aspects for  questions regarding the additional alternatives described by respondents.  We did not include this information because although two respondents  described similar alternatives, they did not identify similar positive and  negative aspects about this alternative. In addition, none of the remaining  questionnaires included similar responses. We list any additional  alternatives identified by respondents in appendix II. The verbatim  wording from key sections of the questionnaire we administered is  presented in appendix III.", "In addition, section 1523 of the National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2018 contained additional provisions for us to review other  processes related to the execution of OCO funds. In particular, section  1523 contained a provision for us to review the processes the Department  of the Treasury employs to separate expenditures of amounts  appropriated for OCO from expenditures of all other amounts  appropriated for DOD. We assessed the steps that the Department of the  Treasury takes in the execution of the federal budget after funds have  been appropriated and determined that the Department of the Treasury  does not employ a process to separate OCO funding from base funding in  its role in making appropriations available to DOD. In addition, section  1523 of the act included another provision for us to compare the  processes DOD and the Department of Treasury use to separate  expenditures of OCO amounts to the generally accepted accounting  principles. The Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board issues  federal financial accounting standards and provides guidance on federal  generally accepted accounting principles. The Federal Accounting  Standards Advisory Board\u2019s Handbook of Federal Accounting Standards  and Other Pronouncements, as Amended (Current Handbook) is the most  up-to-date, authoritative source of generally accepted accounting  principles developed for federal entities. However, the Current Handbook  does not address the separation of OCO from non-OCO appropriations,  obligations, and disbursements. Therefore, it is not possible to compare  the processes DOD and the Department of the Treasury use to the  generally accepted accounting principles based on existing standards and  guidance.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2018 to January 2019  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

We also show the  verbatim wording of any clarification text sent via email to respondents  who misunderstood the description of the alternative.", "DOD could move requests for funding of enduring activities from its  OCO budget to its base budget request. Enduring activities are those  that began in response to contingency operations but have continued  after these operations ended. An example of an enduring cost would be  maintaining residual headquarters staff at U.S. Central Command in  Qatar to train, advise, and assist as missions have evolved from  contingency to ongoing activities. We understand that in the in FY 2020,  the Department plans to move funding for enduring activities from its  OCO budget to its base budget request. DOD\u2019s OCO funding request  would then reflect only the incremental costs of existing contingency  operations.", "The Congress could specify activities for which DOD should use  OCO amounts within the annual appropriations acts. Currently, DOD  determines what activities constitute OCO activities based on criteria  developed in 2010 in coordination with OMB. Under this alternative,  explicit purpose language designating specific funds for specific activities  would be added directly into the appropriations acts or the explanatory  statement, then incorporated into the appropriations act by reference. \u201cUnder the current approach, funds are designated for specific sub-activities in the  explanatory statement. However, these designations are generally not legally binding  unless incorporated by reference into the appropriations act itself. Under this alternative  approach , specific purpose language or language of incorporation would  be included in the appropriations act. The distinction between the current approach and  the alternative presented here is that legally binding language concerning specific  amounts for specific OCO activities would appear in the appropriation act.\u201d", "The Congress could create separate appropriation accounts for  amounts designated for OCO and amounts designated for base  activities. \u201cIn the current approach, amounts are designated for OCO and base activities within a  single appropriation account. In the alternative proposed in Question 5, the Congress  would create two separate appropriation accounts for OCO and base activities amounts.  For example, there would be one appropriation account for OCO amounts for O&M, and  another appropriation account for base activity amounts for O&M.\u201d", "DOD could use a transfer account (such as the Overseas  Contingency Operations Transfer Fund, or OCOTF) through which  the Department could meet operational demands by transferring  funds to the military services and agencies based on execution  needs as the year progresses. The Congress would appropriate funds  into a transfer account. These funds would not expire and be available for  DOD\u2019s use during multiple fiscal years. DOD would use its base activities  appropriations to fund OCO activities and later draw from the transfer  account as needed to reimburse its base appropriation accounts.", "Below we show the verbatim wording from key sections of the  questionnaire we administered. We used Questions 2 and 3 as screening  questions to help determine if respondents were sufficiently  knowledgeable about the current congressional or DOD processes.  Question 4 and its sub-questions below were repeated for each  alternative presented above (i.e., as Questions 4 through 7 in the  questionnaire).
