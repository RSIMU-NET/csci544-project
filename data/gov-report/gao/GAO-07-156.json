For example, changes in the number of tax refunds frozen by IRS coincided with changes in the number of frozen refund cases at TAS. While TAS made changes after fiscal year 2004 to its guidance for accepting new taxpayer cases, this did not notably influence TAS's caseload increase in fiscal years 2005 and 2006. For example, TAS created two additional case acceptance criteria in fiscal year 2006 that resulted in a little more than 500 of the approximately 244,000 cases received that year. TAS measures customer satisfaction and found that the taxpayers TAS serves remained satisfied from fiscal years 2002 to 2006. TAS also measures the quality of its case advocacy and found that this improved from 2002 to 2004 and stayed about the same in 2005 and 2006. While these case advocacy measures are sound, there is important missing information in that TAS does not have meaningful measures of case advocacy efficiency or cost. A meaningful measure of efficiency would consider the ratio of cases closed to the time spent on them and take into account case complexity and the quality of the work, and unit cost information is needed to fully understand this information. TAS is developing the means to capture time per case, the key component of unit cost, and case complexity. TAS currently does not measure the effectiveness of its systemic advocacy efforts. TAS is piloting a program to study systemic advocacy effectiveness in a few areas, but not broadly. Also, it is difficult to determine what actions were taken to address systemic issues raised in the annual report to Congress, TAS's primary method for providing information to Congress and the public about its systemic advocacy efforts. For example, the report describes serious problems faced by the taxpayers but does not include the status of addressing those issues."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In response to concerns about the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s (IRS)  handling of taxpayers\u2019 problems, Congress created the Taxpayer Advocate  Service (TAS). TAS was designed to be largely independent of the rest of  IRS and able to promptly and fairly handle taxpayer problems not resolved  through normal IRS channels. TAS divides its work into two primary  functions: assisting taxpayers in resolving individual problems with IRS,  called case advocacy, and proposing administrative and legislative  changes to mitigate problems affecting groups of taxpayers, called  systemic advocacy.", "TAS deals with a range of taxpayer problems including delays in cases,  lost payments, and economic hardship (for example, when a refund check  needs to be expedited). In fiscal year 2006 TAS assisted over 240,000  taxpayers, or about 0.2 percent of all individual tax return filers. Between  fiscal years 2004 and 2006, TAS\u2019s case advocacy caseload has grown  substantially, increasing by 43 percent. Such growth matters for at least  two reasons. First, it may be an indicator of TAS and IRS performance at  preventing and resolving taxpayer problems. Second, it is relatively costly  for TAS to get involved in resolving taxpayers\u2019 problems\u2014TAS\u2019s budget  was about $170 million and TAS employed 1,894 staff, or about 2 percent  of IRS\u2019s workforce, in 2006.", "Because of Congress\u2019s concerns about whether taxpayers\u2019 issues are  addressed and the resources devoted to TAS, you asked us to review TAS\u2019s  performance.

We assessed the reliability of  TAMIS data and determined the data were sufficiently reliable for our  purposes. We compared the existing TAS performance measures to  attributes of successful performance measures using criteria we have  previously developed. In terms of reporting systemic advocacy efforts, we  focused on the annual reports to Congress since they are the primary  method used by TAS to report on systemic advocacy efforts. We  interviewed the National Taxpayer Advocate (the head of TAS, hereafter  referred to as the Advocate) and TAS officials involved with both case and  systemic advocacy in both headquarters and TAS field offices. We also  interviewed officials in the Wage and Investment Division (W&I), Small  Business/Self Employed Division (SB/SE), and Criminal Investigation (CI)  office to obtain their views about coordinating and collaborating with TAS  in order to address taxpayers\u2019 problems and why TAS\u2019s caseload has  increased.

TAS is the successor to the Problem  Resolution Program (PRP) which IRS founded in 1976 to provide an  independent means of helping taxpayers solve problems that they  encountered in dealing with IRS. Initially, PRP units were established in  IRS district offices. In 1979, IRS expanded PRP to its service centers and  created the position of Taxpayer Ombudsman to head PRP. Generally,  PRP personnel were district or service center employees who did not  report directly to the Ombudsman. The Ombudsman was appointed by and  reported to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.", "Congress has since renamed the Ombudsman the \u201cNational Taxpayer  Advocate\u201d and taken steps to enhance the independence of the Advocate.", "While the Advocate continues to report to the Commissioner of Internal  Revenue, the Advocate is now appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury  after consultation with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and the IRS  Oversight Board. In the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998,  Congress required that the individual not be an IRS employee for 2 years  preceding his or her appointment and that the individual agrees to not  accept a position elsewhere in IRS for 5 years following his or her tenure  as the Advocate. In addition, Congress replaced the prior PRP  organization with an independent reporting structure of taxpayer  advocates who report directly to the Advocate and mandated that a local  taxpayer advocate be available to taxpayers in each state. TAS currently  has 65 local offices with at least one in each state, Puerto Rico, and the  District of Columbia. TAS also has 10 offices located at IRS campuses. The  current Advocate was appointed in 2001.", "Section 7803 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended by the  Restructuring Act of 1998, provides that the National Taxpayer Advocate is  entitled to compensation at the same rate as the highest rate of basic pay  established for the Senior Executive Service under 5 U.S.C. Section 5382  or, if the Secretary of the Treasury so determines, at a rate fixed under the  streamlined critical pay authority set out in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 9503 (up to the  equivalent of the Vice President\u2019s salary, or $212,100 in 2006). The  Advocate is also eligible to receive bonuses. On January 10, 2001, the  Secretary of Treasury approved the appointment of Nina Olson as the  National Taxpayer Advocate under section 7803 and chose to set her pay  using the streamlined critical pay authority. The Advocate\u2019s salary was  $162,100 and her bonus was $22,900 in 2006.", "TAS has two primary functions\u2014case advocacy and systemic advocacy,  although it is also responsible for administering the Low Income Taxpayer  Clinic (LITC) Grant Program and overseeing the Taxpayer Advocacy Panel  (TAP). Figure 1 shows TAS\u2019s primary functions as well as sources of work.", "TAS receives case advocacy cases through several sources including  referrals from IRS, direct taxpayer contact via walk-in, phone calls, or  mail, and the National Taxpayer Advocate toll-free line. The acceptance  criteria for case advocacy fall into four general categories: economic  burden, systemic burden, best interest of the taxpayer, and public policy.  Economic burden cases involve a tax-related issue that has caused  financial difficulty for the taxpayer. Procedural burden cases involve an  IRS process, system, or procedure that has failed to operate as intended  and, as a result, IRS has failed to resolve or respond to the taxpayer issue.  Best interest of the taxpayer cases are those that raise questions of equity  or taxpayer\u2019s rights in how the tax laws are administered. Finally, public  policy cases are those that the Advocate decided should be worked based  on specific issues or areas of public concern. TAS uses TAMIS to track its  case advocacy activities.", "In some cases, TAS is able to use its statutory or delegated authorities to  take the necessary steps to resolve a case. When TAS does not have  statutory or delegated authority to take action, TAS issues an Operations  Assistance Request (OAR) to the function within IRS that can take the  needed action to resolve the taxpayer\u2019s problem. If IRS and TAS are  unable to agree on the proper course of action, TAS might use a Taxpayer  Assistance Order (TAO) to require IRS to take a certain action as  permitted by law, cease an action currently being taken, review an action,  refrain from taking any action, or release property previously levied. In  fiscal year 2006, TAS issued 46 TAOs. Figure 2 provides an overview of the  case advocacy process.", "Currently, TAS and IRS are renegotiating the procedures TAS and IRS  functions will follow to process an OAR. Also, officials told us that the  Advocate has reviewed TAS\u2019s delegated authorities with Office of Chief  Counsel, Appeals, Tax Exempt/Government Entities, W&I, and SB/SE  officials and plans to make recommendations to the Commissioner on  possible changes.", "TAS receives suggestions for systemic advocacy projects from TAS and  IRS employees and the public. Systemic advocacy officials evaluate each  suggestion to determine if it meets the definition of an immediate  intervention\u2014an administrative issue which could cause immediate,  significant harm to multiple taxpayers that needs quick resolution. For  those issues that do not become immediate interventions, systemic  advocacy officials apply the general criteria described in figure 1 in order  to score each issue. TAS creates a systemic advocacy project for those  issues that meet or exceed the current threshold for converting an issue  into a systemic advocacy project. This threshold can change depending on  available resources to work on systemic advocacy projects. For immediate  interventions and advocacy projects, systemic analysts research the issue  and develop recommendations for IRS. For additional details about  creating immediate interventions and systemic advocacy projects  including a complete list of the criteria used to score systemic issues, see  appendix II.", "TAS also conducts systemic advocacy through participation in TAS and  IRS research initiatives and task forces, hosting town hall meetings,  conducting focus groups, and through TAS\u2019s two required annual reports  to Congress. One of the two reports, the annual report to Congress,  hereafter referred to as the annual report, is due by December 31, and  summarizes TAS\u2019s activities during the prior fiscal year. It must include,  among other things, a discussion of at least 20 of the most serious  problems encountered by taxpayers and administrative and legislative  recommendations for resolving taxpayer problems. For details about how  the most serious problems are selected, see appendix IV. The other report,  due by June 30 of each year, must identify the objectives of the Office of  the Taxpayer Advocate for the fiscal year beginning in that calendar year.", "Responsibility for the LITC Grant Program was transferred from W&I to  TAS in May 2003.

TAS has responsibility for selecting LITC grant recipients and conducting  site visits to ensure that LITCs are fulfilling their obligations. See appendix  V for more information on the LITC Grant Program.

In the earlier years the  closure rate exceeded the number of cases coming in, so TAS was  decreasing its backlog of cases. In fiscal years 2005 and 2006, however,  TAS closed fewer cases than it received, and its backlog of cases increased  by around 7,500 cases in each of those years.

For example, the National Taxpayer Advocate\u2019s 2007 Objectives  Report to Congress states that \u201cThe impact of the IRS\u2019s substantial  increases in enforcement activities is evident in the corresponding  increase in TAS Taxpayer Delinquent Investigation, Levy, and Automated  Underreporter case receipts.\u201d Data from TAS and IRS are consistent with  this argument, showing a correlation between increases in TAS\u2019s caseload  and increases in IRS\u2019s overall enforcement activities since fiscal year  2004. The data also show correlations between the growth in particular  IRS enforcement programs and the corresponding TAS issues.", "However, IRS\u2019s enforcement programs were also growing between fiscal  years 2002 and 2004, a time when TAS\u2019s caseload was shrinking. A senior  TAS official said that increases in IRS enforcement were leading to new  TAS cases in fiscal years 2002\u20134, but that the increases in caseload were  more than offset by declines for other reasons. For example, the official  stated that in 2000\u20131, TAS was still clearing out a backlog of taxpayer  problems from the late 1990s and new problems were also arising from  confusion stemming from the major reorganization of IRS from divisions  based on processes to divisions based on types of taxpayers being served.  As TAS dealt with the backlog of cases and as the IRS reorganization was  completed, the number of cases fell. Data for testing this explanation were  not available.", "Overall, IRS enforcement activities have been increasing, as shown by the  number of individual examinations in figure 4 and the amount of  enforcement revenue collected in figure 5.", "At the same time, the majority of the growth in TAS\u2019s caseload was due to  issues that are enforcement related, as shown in table 2. Table 2 combines  TAS\u2019s 114 types of taxpayer issues into a few broad categories. Categories  that consist largely of enforcement issues, as shown by the shaded rows in  the table, accounted for over half of the growth in TAS caseload between  fiscal years 2004 and 2006. Moreover, there are also enforcement-related  issues in other categories. For example, a case that TAS classifies as  \u201cdocument processing\u201d may involve a taxpayer having trouble filing an  amended return after an audit.", "The correlation between TAS caseload growth and IRS enforcement  increases can also be seen for particular enforcement actions. The two  types of TAS cases that increased the most\u2014CI cases in fiscal year 2005  and levy cases in fiscal year 2006\u2014are examples. While we could not  verify that there was a causal relationship between IRS activity and TAS  caseload, for CI and levy cases, we found a positive correlation. The  number of CI refund freezes increased by 23 percent in fiscal year 2005  over fiscal year 2004 and at the same time the number of TAS CI cases  increased by roughly 71 percent, as shown in figure 6. In December 2005,  the Advocate issued a report critical of the number of taxpayers whose  refunds were frozen and then later released, as well as the lack of  information given to taxpayers about the status of their refund in these  cases and the number of years that freezes are in effect. CI officials said  that they subsequently made significant changes to the program in early  2006, freezing fewer refunds in 2006 and issuing fewer multiyear freezes.  TAS and CI officials said that this likely caused the number of taxpayers  seeking TAS assistance for refund freezes to decrease. While data on the  number of CI refund freezes for fiscal year 2006 were not yet available  when we completed our work, the number of TAS CI cases decreased by  25 percent that year.", "Similarly, as shown in figure 7, the number of IRS levy cases increased  between fiscal years 2002 and 2005, including a 35 percent increase in  fiscal year 2005 over fiscal year 2004.

However, our analysis of TAS data does not support this. The Advocate  made changes to TAS\u2019s case acceptance guidance twice since fiscal year  2004, which is when TAS\u2019s caseload started to increase. On January 13,  2005, the Advocate issued an internal memorandum to all TAS staff called  \u201cCommon Sense and Good Judgment in Case Processing.\u201d According to  the Advocate, the memo did not change the criteria but sought to clarify  the criteria and ensure that staff were not creating unnecessary obstacles  for taxpayers seeking TAS assistance. In January 2006, TAS implemented  an expanded version of its case acceptance criteria. The revisions included  slight modifications to some of the existing criteria and the creation of  criteria 8 and 9.", "The January 2005 memorandum clarified that TAS should accept all cases  (1) where a taxpayer specifically requests TAS assistance and (2) that  were referred from IRS even if the case does not meet TAS\u2019s case  acceptance criteria to avoid sending the taxpayer back to IRS. According  to the memorandum, in these situations, the case should be classified as  meeting criteria 7\u2014a system or procedure failed to operate as intended or  failed to resolve the taxpayer\u2019s problem. Therefore, if following the  memorandum contributed to the increase in TAS\u2019s caseload, we would  expect to see a disproportionate increase in criterion-7 cases. However,  criterion-7 cases did not increase disproportionately in 2005 and 2006,  rather the number of these cases grew at a slower rate than other cases, as  shown in table 3. Furthermore, the changes made by TAS in January 2006  did not significantly affect TAS\u2019s caseload given that the two added criteria  resulted in just over 500 of the approximately 244,000 cases received in  fiscal year 2006."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Taxpayers Report Being Satisfied, and Quality Improved in Most Years, but TAS Lacks Measures of Efficiency and Cost", "paragraphs": ["TAS tracks its case advocacy performance in several dimensions.

The eight standards  and their point values are shown in table 5.", "In the past, TIGTA has raised issues with TAS\u2019s timeliness and has made  recommendations that TAS take additional steps to improve timeliness.  TIGTA based its findings on a review of a sample of cases. Although the  Advocate disagreed with TIGTA\u2019s conclusions on specific cases, the  Advocate agreed to make changes to improve timeliness by introducing  two types of case management reviews. The first type is an early  intervention review where a TAS manager must be involved in a minimum  of 25 percent of open cases within 10 calendar days from the received date  for criteria 1\u20134 cases and within 30 calendar days for criteria 5\u20139 cases.  The second type of review is a 100-day review where a manager must  review all cases that have been open for 100 days within 15 days of  reaching the 100-day mark, and a minimum of once every 60 days  thereafter. According to the Advocate, these reviews help ensure that  cases are resolved in a timely manner. TAS\u2019s efforts to improve timeliness  are reflected in three timeliness standards that are part of the TAS quality  standards shown in table 5. For example, the score for timeliness standard  number 3, \u201cDid TAS take all subsequent actions timely?\u201d increased from  81.5 percent in fiscal year 2004 to 86.5 percent in fiscal year 2005.

TAS is  working to develop processes to capture components of a meaningful case  advocacy efficiency measure, which will be useful for the development of  a useful efficiency measure in the future.", "TAS\u2019s case advocacy efficiency measure is not linked to TAS\u2019s case  advocacy mission. According to the Advocate, TAS developed its  efficiency measure with the thought that the percentage of procedural  burden case receipts should eventually decrease as IRS fixes systemic  problems in response to TAS\u2019s systemic advocacy efforts. However, the  current TAS measure is really a measure of systemic advocacy  effectiveness rather than case advocacy efficiency. The Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) agrees. OMB\u2019s Program Assessment  Rating Tool (PART) review described TAS\u2019s efficiency measure as a proxy  measure for TAS\u2019s success in helping IRS fix systemic problems. However,  it provides only limited information on the success of TAS\u2019s systemic  advocacy mission because it is sensitive to a number of outside factors  unrelated to TAS activities. For example, the number of procedural burden  cases could increase because of an increase in new IRS errors, regardless  of how well TAS had identified corrections for earlier systemic problems.", "In addition, TAS\u2019s efficiency measure lacks clarity because it is not a true  measure of efficiency. Simply put, efficiency is the ratio of the outcome or  output to the input of any program. TAS\u2019s efficiency measure includes no  information on inputs into the program, such as time, and does not  adequately measure output.", "To develop a true measure of case advocacy efficiency, TAS would need  information on case advocacy outputs, such as the number of cases  closed, and inputs\u2014primarily the amount of time spent on those cases.", "Currently, TAS managers do not have information on inputs because TAS  does not track the amount of time spent working each case; however, TAS  plans on implementing a method to track time in January 2007. TAS would  also need to adjust the number of cases closed for the complexity of the  cases and the quality of the work. In a past report, we said that efficiency  measures that are not adjusted for quality and complexity could yield  misleading information. For example, an increase in cases closed per  case advocate would not be a true increase in efficiency if cases were  becoming less complex.", "According to TAS officials, cases have been becoming more complex in  recent years; however, we could not verify this because TAS only has a  limited way to measure complexity. At this time, TAS classifies cases as  routine or complex. However, TAS is in the process of developing a more  sophisticated method for determining case complexity. TAS is currently  testing a model for determining the complexity of a case and plans on  making changes to TAMIS in order to collect complexity data. A more  sophisticated complexity index should provide the ability to adjust case  output to reflect changes in complexity over time.", "TAS also does not have information on the cost of working each case,  preventing interpretation of efficiency information in light of cost  effectiveness. Having data on the cost of each case would allow TAS  managers, and external stakeholders, to make better decisions about  where to allocate both TAS\u2019s case advocacy resources and systemic  advocacy efforts. Without such data, TAS managers do not know if some  categories of taxpayer issues are noticeably more costly to resolve than  others. The high cost of case advocacy might become a factor in deciding  how to prioritize systemic advocacy efforts. OMB also recommended in its  PART report that TAS introduce a case advocacy unit cost measure. TAS  officials indicated that they will start collecting unit cost data once they  implement a method for tracking time on case."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TAS and IRS Are Working Jointly to Improve Coordination", "paragraphs": ["As discussed in the Background section, TAS has limited authorities to  take action on some cases. When TAS does not have authority to take  action on a case, it must request that IRS take the action through an  Operations Assistance Request (OAR). TAS and IRS operating divisions  have agreements in place that govern the OAR process. Several IRS and  TAS officials identified coordination problems regarding the OAR process  that could delay the resolution of taxpayer problems. Some of the  problems that IRS officials identified include the following:    TAS sends OARs when TAS could have resolved the case using their  authorities or conversely TAS takes the action when they should have sent  an OAR.", "TAS does not always do the necessary research or collect the necessary  documentation before sending an OAR.    OARs have to either be mailed or faxed.    TAS routes OARs to the incorrect area.    TAS accepts cases that do not meet its criteria or where the taxpayer has  not taken the necessary steps to resolve his or her problem with IRS,  which increases OAR volume and circumvents normal case processing.", "Some TAS officials also reported some confusion over the OAR process.  For example, officials stated that it is not always clear what  documentation is required and the procedures for taking certain actions in  the Internal Revenue Manual are vague, leaving room for interpretation.  The Advocate\u2019s 2007 Objectives Report to Congress stated that it is a  challenge for TAS employees to identify when an OAR should be sent,  given the continuing state of change in IRS operating division personnel  and procedures. These types of issues could lead to IRS rejecting more  OARs, which causes delays for the taxpayer and unnecessary rework for  TAS and IRS.", "The Advocate plans to take actions to reduce the number of rejected  OARs, including identifying TAS and IRS operating division training needs,  improving the clarity of the IRM, and working with IRS operating divisions  to ensure TAS routes OARs to the right place. TAS is also working with  IRS operating divisions to develop a method to send OARs electronically.", "TAS has taken actions to deal with past issues related to TAS-IRS  coordination. In 2002, TIGTA found that TAS employees were taking  actions on taxpayer cases that were outside of their authority. In  response to TIGTA\u2019s findings, the Advocate agreed that there was  confusion about the scope of TAS authorities and outlined corrective  actions TAS had taken. As part of those actions, TAS provided additional  training and modified the case quality review to include an accuracy  standard that ensures actions taken are technically and procedurally  correct and within TAS\u2019s authorities. TAS is looking for ways to improve  the quality review and one of the proposals is to isolate the OAR process  during the review so that they can better identify gaps in the OAR process.  Senior TAS officials have provided the Advocate with recommendations  for improving the quality review.", "IRS and TAS are also currently reviewing the need to change TAS\u2019s  authorities. The Advocate said that she supports certain additional  authorities, but only those that do not undermine the unique responsibility  of TAS, namely, advocating for the taxpayer inside the IRS. The Advocate  said that she is concerned that her role may become blurred if she is  asking IRS to take an action while simultaneously possessing authority to  take the same action directly.

Without measures of case advocacy efficiency and cost, TAS  management lacks information potentially useful for managing its case  advocacy staff and prioritizing its systemic advocacy efforts.  Understanding efficiency is especially important in light of the challenge  posed by a growing caseload. Without a broad-based measure of the  effectiveness of systemic advocacy, TAS, IRS, and Congress lack  information about whether efforts to prevent taxpayer problems, rather  than resolve them after they arise, are achieving any success. Similarly,  TAS\u2019s current reporting leaves key information about the status of the  issues it raises and IRS and congressional responses to past  recommendations unmentioned. TAS may have options about the best way  to provide more complete information to Congress and the public and to  do so does not necessarily mean adding to the length of the annual report.

TAS officials  considered several factors when developing the list including effect on  taxpayer rights, the number or percentage of taxpayers affected,  congressional interest, effect of noncompliance on tax administration or  tax revenue, and barriers to taxpayer compliance. The Advocate and the  systemic advocacy officials then met and developed a list of serious  problems which was sent to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for  comment. If IRS officials provided information that illustrated one of the  proposed problems was not a serious issue, TAS dropped the issue.  Systemic advocacy officials then prepared the final list of serious  problems and the Advocate made the final decision on which problems  were included in the annual report.", "When preparing the 2006 annual report, TAS officials used essentially the  same process, plus additional sources of information to identify the  serious problems. First, TAS officials summarized an environmental scan  of documents that described issues that taxpayers have with IRS.  Examples of documents included newspaper articles, letters to the  Commissioner of Internal Revenue, and a Department of the Treasury  news release. Examples of issues included the alternative minimum tax  and offers in compromise. Second, TAS officials analyzed the \u201cmost  serious problems\u201d included in the 2001\u20135 annual reports. This process  involved ranking the problems as critical, high, medium, low, or resolved  based on the steps IRS had taken to address them. Third, they reviewed  information related to immediate interventions, task forces, operations  assistance requests, and low-income taxpayer clinics. They combined  these three sources of data with input from the Advocate, the Advocate\u2019s  advisors, and the local taxpayer advocates along with TAMIS and SAMS  data in order to develop the proposed list of serious problems for the 2006  annual report.

TAS has responsibility for selecting LITC grant recipients and conducting  site visits to ensure that LITCs are fulfilling their obligations.", "LITC grant applications go through a three-step selection process  involving an eligibility screening, a technical evaluation, and a program  office evaluation. To be eligible, grantees must offer services for free or for  no more than a nominal fee and either represent low-income taxpayers in  controversies with IRS or provide information to English as a second  language (ESL) taxpayers about their rights and responsibilities as U.S.  taxpayers. Next, a panel of TAS staff knowledgeable about the purpose  and mission of LITCs conducts a technical evaluation of the eligible  applicants. Panel members rank each LITC applicant based on four  weighted criteria: the quality of their programs, their experience in  sponsoring a clinic, the quality of their grant administration and  accounting procedures, and the number of low-income or ESL taxpayers  in the geographic area. Finally, LITC program staff conduct the program  office evaluation during which they evaluate the rankings for  inconsistencies or discrepancies. The LITC Program Office Director makes  recommendations to the National Taxpayer Advocate who makes the final  decision on who will receive the grants.", "TAS conducts several types of site visits to LITC grantees. Someone from  the LITC Program Office visits each new clinic during the first 6 months to  educate them on program requirements and to verify operational  requirements listed in the grant guidelines such as keeping taxpayer  information in a secure location and developing and maintaining  relationships with other community-based organizations in order to reach  targeted audiences. There are three tiers of additional site visits. The first  tier visit is conducted by the local taxpayer advocate and includes  checking items such as are the clinic\u2019s hours posted and easily visible, are  brochures and posters visible, and does file security appear adequate. The  second tier site visit is usually done by someone from the LITC Program  Office and is more in-depth than the first tier visit. He or she reviews 30  items such as determining if the goals stated in the program plan are  reflected in the program\u2019s actual activities, client records are maintained  in a confidential manner, and the clinic has a written process to control  and monitor costs and expenditures. If as a result of the second tier visit,  the staff member identifies issues that need further review, then the LITC  Program Office Director conducts a third tier visit. During this visit, the  Director reviews requirements including financial/Office of Management  and Budget, personnel, and program requirements in addition to other  items including standards of operation and ethical considerations. Third  tier visits can result in freezing funds for a grantee.", "For the 2006 grant cycle, TAS awarded $8 million in matching grants,  ranging from $5,000 to $97,250, to 150 nonprofit organizations and  accredited academic institutions.
