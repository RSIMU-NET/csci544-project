Any additional supervisory step, such as imposing an asset pledge or asset maintenance requirement, is to be implemented largely based on the condition and nature of the U.S. operations.

While we did review a judgmental sample of finalized SOSAs and discuss the weaknesses we found, our efforts were not principally directed toward this review. The report describes each of the products of the FBO program and their interrelationships, and it discusses the benefits of all parts of the program realized to date.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Chairmen and Ranking Minority Members of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and the House Committee on Banking and Financial Services, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, the Chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Comptroller of the Currency, and other interested parties.

However, this variation is not necessarily a problem provided that important information\u2014such as the likelihood of home country support or other details necessary for accurate analysis\u2014is included in the SOSA reports. 3.

We added information on the procedures to review SOSAs on page 9. However, for the case of inconsistency between the country report and final SOSA we described on page 19, the SOSA had been approved through these new procedures, and this problem had not been corrected. 6.
