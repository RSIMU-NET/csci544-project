In recent years, facilities and equipment requests have grown faster than funding could permit because of budget constraints, making these decisions more difficult for FAA. In fiscal year 1991, 65 percent, or $612 million, of FAA\u2019s $949 million initial requests for facilities and equipment located at or near airports (terminal areas) was funded.

ILS is a critical component of an all-weather aviation system, because it provides the technology for allowing aircraft to approach and land at airports during adverse weather.", "Each year, FAA\u2019s Budget Office initiates a Call for Estimates requesting that regional offices submit candidate locations for ILS equipment. Once locations are identified, FAA\u2019s planning standard requires that ILS locations meet two-phase criteria. FAA regional offices use the Phase 1 criterion to determine which locations will be submitted to headquarters for further consideration. Under Phase 1, a ratio is computed by dividing the actual number of instrument approaches at a runway by FAA\u2019s standard for the minimum number of such approaches that qualify locations to have an ILS. Runways with a ratio of at least 1.0 are eligible for funding. The traffic activity ratio is an efficiency measure; runways with higher ratios are presumed to accommodate more traffic with given resources. The Phase 2 criterion is a benefit-cost analysis that FAA headquarters prepares on all locations that met the Phase 1 criterion. But since the number of locations meeting the Phase 2 criterion is much larger than budget constraints will allow, some locations may not be funded, even if economically justified. A location that is not funded must recompete in the following year and be subject to the reevaluation process. Because of special safety considerations, some locations will receive ILS equipment regardless of the criteria.", "For fiscal years 1992 through 1994, the program sponsor for the ILS project\u2014the Flight Standards Service\u2014told us that FAA regional offices developed the necessary justifications needed for each eligible ILS location submitted in response to the annual Call for Estimates. Regional offices also assign a numerical ranking to all locations within their respective regions. Priorities are established at the regional level on the basis of an analysis of such factors as weather history and air traffic needs. The program sponsor then ensures that candidate locations at the national level meet the Phase 1 criterion. Once the program sponsor ensures that candidate locations qualify for funding, cost estimates are finalized. The number of ILS locations that make it into FAA\u2019s annual budget submission depends on the funding levels of the agency\u2019s facilities and equipment budget and the ILS program.", "The program sponsor said that each regional office\u2019s number one priority location was generally selected for inclusion in the budget submissions for fiscal years 1992 and 1993. For fiscal year 1992, seven regions submitted requests and received funding for their first-priority location. In addition, one system was designated for the FAA Academy, and one region also received its second priority. For fiscal year 1993, seven regions submitted requests and received funding for their first priority, and two regions also received funding for their second priority. In addition to the locations FAA requested in its budget submission, the Congress added a total of 27 ILS locations in fiscal years 1992 and 1993, along with additional funding for those locations. (See app. I for more details.) The sponsor told us that in 1992 and 1993, locations were not ranked numerically from a national perspective. Furthermore, there was no documentation of what factors\u2014including benefit-cost analysis\u2014were considered in deciding which terminal locations received the new ILS.", "For fiscal year 1994, the ILS program sponsor decided to institute a numerical ranking system in which each eligible ILS location that the regions submitted in response to the Call for Estimates would be prioritized. The sponsor and regional representatives met to decide how to rank 179 candidate ILS locations on a national basis. Priorities for the first 78 locations were established on the basis of an analysis of 12 factors, such as safety, weather, and potential to improve air traffic flow. However, the program sponsor could not show how each factor was used to develop this national priority list. The program sponsor then requested benefit-cost analyses for the top 16 locations that were to be submitted to OMB for funding in order to ensure that they met the minimum Phase 2 criterion. Priorities for the candidate locations numbered 79 to 179 were based on Phase 1 traffic activity ratios. As OMB and the Congress made reductions to this FAA budget line item, the program sponsor deleted lower-ranked locations. The sponsor told us that changing conditions, such as a problem with an environmental impact statement or a delay in an anticipated land acquisition, could also force modification to the overall priorities. Seven regions received funding for between one and four new ILSs. The Congress did not direct additional ILS locations in fiscal year 1994.", "Despite the agency\u2019s additional emphasis on ILS in fiscal year 1994, the program sponsor told us that documentation does not exist to show how the 12 factors were used to select certain locations over others. As a result, while fiscal year 1994 was an improvement over prior years, questions remain about the ranking of ILS locations. For example, the program sponsor could not explain how traffic activity ratios were factored into the ranking process. The sponsor could not show why one location with a Phase 1 traffic activity ratio of 3.71 was ranked 6th nationally, yet another location with a Phase 1 traffic activity ratio of 49.08 was ranked 81st nationally. Nor could the sponsor show why a location with a ratio of 1.67 was ranked 4th nationally, yet another with a ratio of 35.66 was ranked 39th nationally.

Approximately six to eight towers are replaced each year. FAA\u2019s Air Traffic Plans and Requirements Service is the program sponsor for the Tower Replacement project.", "The program sponsor said that FAA used a consistent methodology based on APS-1 and agency policy for selecting locations for replacement towers in fiscal years 1992 through 1994. Each year, regional offices screened and ranked eligible locations on the basis of an analysis of operational requirements, space requirements, facility condition, airport traffic activity, safety conditions, and future growth. Because of funding limitations, the program sponsor told the nine regional offices to submit only their top three locations in any given budget year. An important element in the regional decision as to which location or locations are submitted is the availability of the regional office\u2019s work force to implement the projects.", "The program sponsor then reduced the 25 to 30 locations submitted by the regions to a top-priority group of 8 to 10, without any numerical ranking, after reviewing the regions\u2019 written justifications for tower replacement projects. The program sponsor could not show how each factor used by the regions\u2014such as airport traffic activity or facility condition\u2014was considered and how each factor was weighed in developing this list of 8 to 10 top locations. The sponsor did not use benefit-cost analyses to develop the list. According to the sponsor, the original tower siting was based on a benefit-cost analysis, and tower replacement is based on a review of continuing need, so the sponsor did not believe further analysis was needed. Generally one priority location was recommended for funding in each FAA regional office, although in some cases a regional office had two candidate locations funded in one year.", "Once the top locations had been identified, the program sponsor and regional representatives conducted an on-site inspection of these locations. If the on-site inspection revealed that the location was not in need of a replacement, it was removed as a replacement candidate. Moreover, the sponsor told us that changing conditions do arise that force modifications to the list of top locations, such as the identification of asbestos in a facility, a major shift of traffic activity, or natural disasters that weaken existing structures. Another factor that the sponsor told us affects FAA\u2019s decision-making process regarding tower replacement is congressional additions to FAA\u2019s budget request. In fiscal year 1992, the Congress added seven Tower Replacement locations to FAA\u2019s funding request. However, in fiscal years 1993 and 1994, the Congress added no additional locations for funding. (See app. I.) FAA recognizes the importance of congressional direction as a major determinant in naming towers for replacement and occasionally defers otherwise qualified locations to accommodate congressionally directed locations. \u201c built in 1972. . . .

The tower cab is limited in size and not adequate to handle the current and projected staffing levels for a safe and efficient air traffic operation. The support facilities are limited in area and very poorly arranged for a functional office environment. Support systems, such as the cab heating and air conditioning system, the power supply system, and the basic utility system, have either outlived their normal useful lives or are in need of extensive refurbishing and maintenance.\u201d", "Had FAA documented the factors it considered in arriving at its list of tower replacements to be funded and prioritized those locations, its ability to show why certain locations were selected over others would be enhanced.", "The D-BRITE system is an extension of an airport surveillance radar system. D-BRITE provides additional radar display positions at busy air traffic control towers and establishes positions at remote towers that do not currently have a radar display. The new equipment also reduces the need for verbal coordination and increases safety at both hub and remote towers. Additionally, the equipment assists the air traffic controller in identifying and sequencing aircraft traffic and provides traffic advisories to aircraft in visual flight rules conditions.", "Regional offices screened and ranked eligible locations for the D-BRITE project on the basis of traffic activity levels and the operational needs of the towers associated with a surveillance radar. Locations with the highest traffic activity were given the highest regional priorities. The program sponsor\u2014FAA\u2019s Air Traffic Plans and Requirements Service\u2014grouped the regional priorities into a national delivery schedule. According to the sponsor, this schedule takes into consideration the regional offices\u2019 ranking of locations, funding levels, and the ability of the offices\u2019 work force to install systems. The individual currently acting as the program sponsor was not involved with D-BRITE funding decisions for fiscal years 1992 to 1994. However, this individual believed that, in those years, each regional office generally received funding for its top-priority locations. The program sponsor said that D-BRITE locations were not ranked numerically from a national perspective. The sponsor also said that the locations were not analyzed from a benefit-cost perspective because they were linked to the establishment of airport surveillance radars for which benefit-cost analysis had already been considered.

First, national directives, such as APS-1, the Call for Estimates, and FAA\u2019s acquisition policy, do not require program sponsors to rank locations numerically from a national perspective. The officials pointed out that current guidance only requires regional offices to assign a numerical priority to all locations recommended to receive equipment. Second, although a national ranking may result in the allocation of equipment unevenly across regions, some program sponsors said that no useful purpose would be served in trying to determine whether one regional office\u2019s number two or lower-priority location was of a higher national importance than another office\u2019s number one location. According to the program sponsors, the cost of conducting such an analysis would consume significant resources and would create tension among regional offices about methodologies used to justify individual locations.", "We believe that because regional offices are required to rank candidate locations numerically for funding in their geographic area, FAA headquarters could do the same from a national perspective. This would provide FAA and the Congress with greater assurance that scarce resources are targeted to the highest-priority needs. Such a ranking would also expedite decision-making as program sponsors review, reprioritize, and defer lower-priority locations in response to changes made during each phase of the budget cycle. Moreover, such a ranking would quickly identify the importance of each location at any given point in time and demonstrate that FAA is taking a businesslike approach to investment decisions. While some FAA program sponsors said that no useful purpose is served in trying to determine whether one office\u2019s number two or lower-priority location is of a higher national importance than another office\u2019s number one priority, we believe that such analyses are warranted, under today\u2019s budget constraints, to ensure that the highest-priority locations are selected as the first to receive equipment.

For the ILS project, sponsors used benefit-cost analysis to screen locations for compliance with minimum criteria, not to rank alternative locations. Sponsors believe that regional staff have the most up-to-date information on locations in need of equipment. Therefore, they believe that the process for ILS selection must look beyond benefit-cost analysis and emphasize other factors, such as safety, weather, and potential to improve air traffic flow. Otherwise, benefit-cost considerations bias the selection process in favor of projects at large airports if qualitative criteria and judgment are excluded from the process. For the Tower Replacement and the D-BRITE establishment projects, program sponsors told us that FAA guidance currently does not call for any location-specific benefit-cost analysis. This is because the original tower siting was based on a benefit-cost analysis, and tower replacement is based on a review of continuing need. Decisions on D-BRITE siting are dependent on the airport surveillance radar siting decision, which is itself based on benefit-cost analysis. Furthermore, the sponsors believe that such analysis would serve no useful purpose but would overwhelm FAA\u2019s resources. The sponsors contended that 25- to 30-year-old towers must be replaced in order to continue serving an established need and that no useful purpose is served if the cost of conducting a benefit-cost study for an eligible D-BRITE location exceeded the cost of the project.", "We believe that good business management practices suggest that benefit-cost analysis can provide a useful, quantifiable means for weighing the value of alternative investments. We recognize that there are other considerations, such as a major shift in traffic activity or congressional direction. However, benefit-cost ratios provide a good starting point for ranking eligible locations. FAA\u2019s guidance also states that sound economic justification should be an important factor in the evaluation process. This guidance recognizes that benefit-cost analysis enables FAA to prioritize alternative investments so as to maximize the return on investment dollars. We recognize that the cost of an elaborate benefit-cost analysis for less expensive projects such as D-BRITE may be prohibitive, but a less rigorous analysis could be appropriate. For example, a simplified methodology, to save analytical resources, may allow FAA to approximate benefits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Documentation", "paragraphs": ["The Call for Estimates and APS-1 provide detailed guidance for how regional offices should prepare location justifications and assign priorities to locations recommended for funding.

This system, if available to inspection by offices within FAA, the Congress, and aviation system users, would facilitate answers to queries from those groups about the relative ranking of locations. Moreover, documentation would greatly help program sponsors to explain to these groups the small differences that can determine whether a location is approved or not approved for funding. In addition, GAO\u2019s Standards for Internal Controls in the Federal Government stresses the need for agencies to clearly document significant events so that they are readily available for examination.
