The program provides support to carriers in all states. However, small carriers receive more support than large carriers. As a result, carriers serving similar rural areas can receive different levels of support. Currently, the high-cost program provides support for the provision of basic telephone service, which is widely available and subscribed to in the nation. But, the program also indirectly supports broadband service, including high-speed Internet, in some rural areas, particularly those areas served by small carriers. The program provides support to both incumbents and competitors; as a result, it creates an incentive for competition to exist where it might not otherwise occur. There is a clearly established purpose for the high-cost program, but FCC has not established performance goals or measures. GAO was unable to identify performance goals or measures for the program. While FCC has begun preliminary efforts to address these shortcomings, the efforts do not align with practices that GAO has identified as useful for developing successful performance goals and measures. For example, FCC has not created performance goals and measures for intermediate and multiyear periods. In the absence of performance goals and measures, the Congress and FCC are limited in their ability to make informed decisions about the future of the high-cost program. While some internal control mechanisms exist for the high-cost program, these mechanisms are limited and exhibit weaknesses that hinder FCC's ability to assess the risk of noncompliance with program rules and ensure cost-effective use of program funds. Internal control mechanisms for the program consist of (1) carrier certification that funds will be used consistent with program rules, (2) carrier audits, and (3) carrier data validation. Yet, each mechanism has weaknesses. The carrier certification process exhibits inconsistency across the states that certify carriers, carrier audits have been limited in number and reported findings, and carrier data validation focuses primarily on completeness and not accuracy. These weaknesses could contribute to excessive program expenditures."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["For many decades, federal policy has called for making affordable  residential telephone service available to the greatest possible number of  Americans\u2014a policy known as \u201cuniversal service.\u201d Provision of this  service is often a concern in rural areas, where the cost of providing  telephone service can be particularly high. For example, in 2002, we  reported that the cost of providing telephone service in rural areas was  nearly three times the cost of providing service in central cities of  metropolitan areas. As a result, universal service policy traditionally  targeted financial support to rural areas where the costs of providing  telephone service are high. In the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (1996  Act), the Congress codified universal service which, among other things,  specified that consumers in \u201crural, insular, and high-cost areas\u201d should  have access to services and rates that are \u201creasonably comparable\u201d to  consumers in urban areas, and required that all companies providing  interstate telecommunications service contribute to a mechanism that  would fund universal service.", "To implement the 1996 Act, the Federal Communications Commission  (FCC) modified and expanded the high-cost program.

However, rather than decreasing,  the cost of the high-cost program has grown substantially to $4.3 billion in  2007, increasing nearly 153 percent between calendar years 1998 and 2007.  This significant growth has raised concerns about what the program is  accomplishing, whether it has clear objectives, and whether it has  effective controls over expenditures. In response to your request that we  examine the federal high-cost program\u2019s operation, this report addresses  three main questions:  1.  What effect has the structure of the program had on levels of support  received and types of services available in rural areas?  2.  To what extent does the program have performance goals and  measures?  3.  To what extent does the program have mechanisms in place to prevent  and detect fraud, waste, and abuse?", "To respond to the objectives of this report, we reviewed documents and  interviewed officials from FCC and USAC. We also interviewed officials  from industry associations, national wireline and wireless carriers, the  National Exchange Carrier Association (NECA), and other individuals  with knowledge of the high-cost program. To develop an understanding of  how the program works in specific locations, we conducted site visits in  six states: Alabama, Iowa, Montana, Oklahoma, Oregon, and Wisconsin.  We chose these six states on the basis of such criteria as the extent of  rural population, geographic diversity, and the number of wireline and  wireless carriers present in the state. Within each state, we interviewed  the state regulatory commission, rural and nonrural incumbent carriers,  and competitive carriers. To test our structured interview and site  selection methodology, we also conducted site visits in the following  states: Arizona, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and New Mexico.  For additional information about the types of mechanisms in place for  preventing waste, fraud, and abuse, we conducted a survey of state  regulatory commissions. The survey sought information pertaining to the  state\u2019s regulation of telephone service and the state\u2019s internal control  procedures for incumbent and competitive carriers receiving high-cost  program support in the state. The survey was available online to officials  in the 50 states and the District of Columbia on a secure Web site.

At that time, increasing amounts of the costs  associated with providing local telephone service were recovered from  rates for long-distance services. This had the effect of lowering local  telephone rates and raising long-distance rates, which was intended to  make local telephone service more affordable. Because American  Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T) provided both nationwide  long-distance service and local telephone service to approximately 80  percent of the nation\u2019s telephone subscribers, universal service was largely  promoted by shifting costs between different customers and services.", "Following the divestiture of AT&T\u2019s local telephone companies in 1984,  FCC made several changes to universal service policy. First, the costs  associated with local telephone service could no longer be shifted  internally within AT&T. FCC therefore implemented access charges\u2014fees  that long-distance companies pay to originate and terminate long-distance  telephone calls over the local telephone network. Access charges were  intended to not only recover the cost of originating and terminating long- distance telephone calls over the local telephone networks, but also to  subsidize local telephone service. Second, FCC initiated several federal  efforts that targeted support to low-income customers to bring the rates  for basic telephone service within their reach. At this time, federal  universal service was for the most part funded through charges imposed  on long-distance companies.", "The Congress made significant changes to universal service policy through  the 1996 Act. First, the 1996 Act provided explicit statutory support for  federal universal service policy. Second, the 1996 Act extended the scope  of federal universal service\u2014beyond the traditional focus on low-income  consumers and consumers in rural and high-cost areas\u2014to include eligible  schools, libraries, and rural health care providers. Third, the 1996 Act  altered the federal mechanism for funding universal service. Every  telecommunications carrier, and other entities, providing interstate  telecommunications services were required to contribute to federal  universal service, unless exempted by FCC; and their contributions were  to be equitable, nondiscriminatory, and explicit. Contributions are  deposited into the federal Universal Service Fund (USF), from which  disbursements are made for the various federal universal service  programs. Fourth, the 1996 Act established a Federal-State Joint Board on  Universal Service (Joint Board).

The four  components are high-cost loop, high-cost model, interstate access, and  interstate common line. The fifth component, local switching support,  provides support for very small carriers to offset the cost of their  switching equipment.

Figure 1 illustrates the  growth in the high-cost program, including both incumbents and  competitors. Several factors have contributed to the growth in the high- cost program. In the early years of the program, support grew as FCC  reduced access charges (a form of implicit support for carriers) to  incumbents and offset those reductions with greater high-cost program  support (a form of explicit subsidy). However, in recent years, the high- cost program has grown because of support provided to competitors,  especially wireless companies.", "In response to concerns about the long-term sustainability of the high-cost  program, FCC issued several Notices of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) in  January 2008, seeking comment on proposals for comprehensive reform of  the program.

FCC released an NPRM  seeking comment on a Joint Board recommendation that the high-cost  program be divided into three separate funds: broadband service, mobility  (or wireless) service, and traditional provider of last resort service. FCC  also released an NPRM seeking comment on changing the current funding  mechanism for CETCs, namely eliminating the identical support rule and  requiring CETCs to submit cost data. Finally, FCC released an NPRM that  sought comment on implementing reverse auctions to determine the  amount of high-cost program support to be given to an ETC; with reverse  auctions, support generally would be determined by the lowest bid to  serve the auctioned area.

Generally, carriers operating in states with below-average population  densities received more support than those in more densely populated  states.

Thus, at a  broad, national level, high-cost program support flows to more rural  states.", "However, the high-cost program does not provide support consistently to  carriers operating in similar rural locations. To a large extent, this  situation arises because of the program\u2019s structure: the five different high- cost program components, each with different eligibility and methods to  determine support. As mentioned earlier, rural carriers typically receive  high-cost program support through components that base support on the  carrier\u2019s incurred costs. Thus, in the case of a rural carrier, the higher its  actual costs, the more funding it receives. Because of this, the funding that  a rural carrier receives depends on how much money it chooses to spend  on its network. Additionally, the disparity between rural and nonrural  carrier is even greater, as support to one carrier can be significantly more  generous than support provided to another carrier for serving comparable  areas. As mentioned earlier, nonrural carriers typically receive part of  their high-cost program support (high-cost model) through a component  that utilizes an FCC cost model; this model assumes the most efficient  carrier providing service to existing customers. Since this model is not  based on an individual carrier\u2019s actual costs, investment in new network  infrastructure will not lead to greater high-cost program support. Further,  the threshold to receive support is greater for nonrural carriers; a rural  carrier\u2019s costs must exceed 115 percent of the national average whereas  the statewide average cost must exceed approximately 131 percent of the  national average for nonrural carriers. As such, nonrural carriers in 10  states currently are eligible for this funding, yet nonrural carriers in other  states serve high-cost locations as well. Overall, rural carriers receive  more funding than nonrural carriers and in 2007, rural carriers received  $1.7 billion more in high-cost program support than nonrural carriers. In  November 2007, the Joint Board recognized this situation itself, noting that  \u201csupport for customers served by one kind of carrier can be significantly  more generous than for comparably situated customers served by the  other kind of carrier.\u201d", "We found similar results in our site-visit states. In the 11 states we visited,  9 states had rural carriers receiving more funding than nonrural carriers.  While rural carriers generally serve only rural areas, nonrural carriers also  can serve large swaths of rural areas. In fact, carriers providing service in  similar, even adjacent, areas can receive vastly different levels of high-cost  program support. For example, as shown in figure 2, in Wisconsin, there  are two nonrural carriers (areas in dark shading) that provide service to  rural areas, yet these carriers do not qualify to receive the same types of  support as rural carriers serving comparable adjacent areas. Similarly, in  Oregon, 25 percent of the lines served by a large, national carrier are  located in rural areas of the state; this carrier does not qualify to receive  the same type of support for these lines that rural carriers in the same area  do."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The High-Cost Program Supports Basic Telephone and Wireless Service, and Indirectly Supports Broadband Service", "paragraphs": ["The high-cost program directly and indirectly supports several types of  service including (1) basic telephone service, (2) broadband service, and  (3) wireless telephone service."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Basic Telephone Service", "paragraphs": ["Currently, the high-cost program provides support for the provision of  basic telephone service.

However, the Congress did not  define universal service or specify a list of services to be supported by the  program. Instead, the 1996 Act recognized universal service as an evolving  level of telecommunications services and directed FCC, after  recommendations from the Joint Board, to establish a definition of the  services to be supported by the program.

In 2007, the overall  penetration rate in the United States was 95 percent, representing an  increase of 0.9 percent since the inception of the high-cost program in  1998. While the penetration rate has increased marginally, there are  several factors that could contribute to this result in addition to the high- cost program, including changes in income levels, greater diffusion of  communications technology, or state-level programs.

Our site visit  interviews similarly suggest that rural carriers depend on high-cost  program support to provide customers with access to affordable telephone  rates. For example, one carrier with whom we spoke received nearly 80  percent of its annual operating revenues from the high-cost program.  Moreover, many of the rural carriers we met with told us that they would  be unable to provide the same range or quality of service to their  customers without support from the high-cost program.

Additionally,  carriers that receive high-cost program support may only use this support  for the \u201cprovision, maintenance, and upgrading of facilities and services  for which the support is intended.\u201d While one of the universal service  principles adopted in the 1996 Act is that all regions of the country should  have access to advanced telecommunication and information services, the  high-cost program does not explicitly support access to broadband  services.", "While access to advanced services, such as broadband, is not included  among the designated list of services supported by the high-cost program,  the program has indirectly facilitated broadband deployment in many rural  areas. In recent years, some carriers have been using high-cost program  support to upgrade their telephone networks, including upgrading to fiber  optic cable and extending it closer to their customers. Because of  advances in telecommunications technology, these upgrades increase the  capacity of the network, thereby facilitating the provision of advanced  services, such as broadband. For example, many rural carriers with whom  we spoke have or are replacing their copper wire with fiber optic cable.  One carrier was in the early phases of a 7-year, $1.8 million expansion to  install fiber-to-the-home for each customer in one of its exchanges that  served about 700 lines. In addition to transitioning from copper to fiber,  carriers are investing in modern switching equipment and remote  terminals to improve the connection speeds available to their customers.  For example, one carrier told us that it is currently installing more remote  terminals to provide higher-speed broadband service, and that it currently  has 96 remote terminals to serve customers spread out across a 1,300  square mile area.", "The availability of high-cost program support can, in part, determine  whether deployment of broadband service is feasible in a rural area. In  rural areas served by rural carriers, the high-cost program allows the  carrier to recoup a large portion of the investment that facilitates  broadband service since, as we mentioned earlier, these carriers receive  high-cost program support based on their costs. Alternatively, in rural  areas served by nonrural carriers, which generally do not receive as much  funding as rural carriers and do not receive funding based on their costs,  the network upgrades necessary for broadband service are less likely. As a  result, the availability of broadband services to rural customers is largely  determined by the type of carrier they are served by, and not where they  are located.", "Rural carriers. Most rural carriers with whom we spoke had or were  deploying advanced network features, such as fiber optic cable.

Beginning  in 1997, FCC adopted a series of measures intended to encourage  competition between carriers in rural areas to promote the principles of  universal service. Among the actions taken by FCC was adopting the  principle of \u201ccompetitive neutrality\u201d as part of the high-cost program.  Under this principle, one carrier should not be favored over another  carrier, and support should be available to any carrier that meets the  requirements for operating as an ETC, regardless of the type of technology  the carrier employs (such as wireline, wireless, or satellite). This principle  was supported by granting high-cost program support to CETCs. While  incumbents\u2014both rural and nonrural\u2014receive support based on their  costs of providing service in an area or FCC\u2019s cost model, CETCs receive  support based on the number of lines they serve through a mechanism  known as the identical support rule. Under this rule, CETCs in an area  receive the same level of high-cost program support, on a per-line basis, as  the incumbent carrier in that area. For example, if the incumbent carrier  receives support that, based on the number of lines it serves, results in $20  of support per line, every competitor designated as an ETC in that area  also will receive $20 in support for each line it serves in the same area  regardless of its costs.", "ETC status is not required for a competitive carrier to operate in an area,  but it is required if the carrier wants to receive high-cost program funding.  As a result, the number of carriers seeking CETC status has increased  dramatically, and the majority of newly designated carriers are wireless.  Since 1998, the number of CETCs receiving support through the high-cost  program has risen from a total of 2 carriers in 1998, to 362 competitive  carriers in 2007. Of these 362 CETCs, 260 carriers\u2014over 70 percent\u2014are  wireless carriers. Along with an increase in the number of carriers, the  amount of funding provided to CETCs has increased over this time period,  growing from $535,104 in 1999, with 100 percent going to wireless carriers,  to $1.2 billion by 2007, with 98 percent of all CETC funding going to  wireless carriers.", "A recent report by FCC estimated that at the end of 2006, wireless carriers  had achieved an 80 percent penetration rate across the country, and  according to the wireless carriers with whom we spoke, high-cost program  support has allowed them to invest in improving and expanding their  networks in rural areas where they would otherwise be unable to  economically justify the investment. For example, one carrier told us that  it can cost from $350,000 to $500,000 to install a cell tower in rugged or  mountainous terrain, in addition to other installation expenses such as  land rent and maintenance costs, but that in most cases, low population  density in the area would not yield enough customers to recover the  investment. Additionally, wireless companies and regulators with whom  we spoke stated that the availability of wireless communication is a public  safety concern; travelers along rural highways expect to be able to use cell  phones in the event of an emergency. However, wireless carriers often  lack the economic incentive to install cell phone towers in rural areas  where they are unlikely to recover the installation and maintenance costs,  but high-cost program support allows them to make these investments."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "While There Is a Clearly Established Purpose for the High- Cost Program, FCC Has Not Established Performance Goals and Measures", "paragraphs": ["In the 1996 Act, the Congress established the principles underlying  universal service, which provide a clear purpose for the high-cost  program.

It is up to the states to determine if carriers are  operating in accordance with these guidelines. Generally, states do so by  collecting information from carriers regarding their use of high-cost  program funds. However, states have different requirements for what  information carriers must submit. Additionally, if a state does not have  jurisdiction over a carrier, then the carrier provides annual certification  data directly to FCC. As a result, carriers are subject to different levels of  oversight and documentation requirements to demonstrate that high-cost  program support was used appropriately.", "FCC established requirements for information that must be submitted by  the carriers it designates as ETCs.

Nevertheless, in our survey of state  regulatory commissions, we found that many states require carriers to  provide information similar to some of the information collected by FCC,  particularly with respect to quality-of-service data. For example, FCC  requires carriers to submit annual information on the number of  unfulfilled service requests from potential customers, the number of  complaints per 1,000 handsets or lines, as well as detailed information on  outages the carrier experienced. According to our survey, we found that  many states require similar information from carriers. Additionally, in our  survey, we asked the state regulatory commissions to specify the types of  quality-of-service measures they require for incumbent, competitive  wireline, and wireless carriers. We found that state requirements are  somewhat varied across the three different types of carriers. For example,  of the 45 states that indicated they measure consumer complaints, 22  states indicated they require this information for at least one type of  carrier but not all types of carriers. (See table 5.)", "In addition to the quality-of-service information, we found that state  regulatory commissions collect a variety of information pertaining directly  to the annual certification process. States most frequently require carriers  to submit affidavits that future support will be used for its intended  purpose; plans for quality, coverage, or capacity improvements; and  evidence that past support was used for its intended purposes. However,  according to our survey, 10 state regulatory commissions require  incumbent carriers to submit only an affidavit, with no additional  information.

USAC operates an audit program to determine if carriers are  complying with the program\u2019s rules. This audit program has been limited;  according to USAC officials, since 2002, USAC has conducted about 17  audits, from more than 1,400 carriers participating in the high-cost  program (approximately 1.2 percent coverage). USAC officials told us  these audits are time-consuming, and have yielded limited findings  because participants did not maintain adequate documentation to validate  their information. This occurred for two reasons: (1) the high-cost  program had no requirement that carriers retain documents and (2) rural  carriers receive funding as a reimbursement for costs incurred 2 years  prior to the receipt of support and therefore carriers did not keep records  going back a sufficient period of time for the audit. To address these  problems, in August 2007, FCC imposed and USAC implemented  document retention rules for high-cost program participants; participants  are now required to maintain records that can be used to demonstrate to  auditors that support received was used consistent with the 1996 Act and  FCC\u2019s rules for 5 years.", "FCC audits. In 2006 and 2007, FCC\u2019s Office of Inspector General (OIG)  instructed USAC to begin conducting audits and assessments to determine  the extent to which high-cost program beneficiaries were in compliance  with program rules. These audits and assessments have two objectives: (1)  validate the accuracy of carrier self-certifications\u2014audits\u2014and (2)  provide a basis for identifying and estimating improper payments under  the Improper Payments and Information Act of 2002 (IPIA)\u2014 assessments. To conduct these audits and assessments, a random sample  of 65 out of about 1,400 carriers was selected by OIG. In meeting its first  objective, findings were similar to USAC\u2019s audit findings, in that it could  not be determined if the information that carriers attested to in their  annual certifications was accurate because carriers did not have proper  documentation to validate their information. For the second objective,  OIG reported that the high-cost program had an estimated 16.6 percent  rate of improper payments. In response to these findings, USAC  maintained that this error rate was primarily indicative of carrier  noncompliance with program rules, and not a result of payments made to  carriers for inaccurate amounts. For example, USAC stated that these  payments were categorized as erroneous because the carrier failed to  comply with high-cost program rules such as meeting filing deadlines or  completing required documentation. In November 2007, a second round  of beneficiary audits and assessments was begun to further review  program compliance and should be completed by the end of calendar year  2008.", "State audits. In addition to the USAC and FCC OIG audits, 7 of the 50 state  regulatory commissions that responded to our survey reported that they  audit incumbent carriers. These audits focus on the appropriate use of  high-cost program funding, the accuracy of carrier-reported costs, and the  compliance with quality-of-service standards. Two of the 7 states reported  that they audit all incumbent carriers, while the remaining 5 states  reported that audits are based on a risk assessment of the carrier, or  triggered by unusual behavior on the part of the carrier. While these 7  states conduct audits, states generally do not revoke carrier\u2019s ETC status.  According to our survey, since 2002, one state reported it had revoked a  carrier\u2019s ETC status (for a competitive carrier).

In some instances, carriers receive high-cost program  support based on their costs. Historically, carriers often were subject to  rate-of-return regulation, wherein a state regulatory commission would  assess the carrier\u2019s costs and investments to ensure these were  appropriate and necessary. Of the 50 respondents to our survey of state  regulatory commissions, 33 apply rate-of-return regulation to rural  incumbent carriers, 13 apply it to nonrural incumbent carriers, and 4 apply  it to competitive wireline carriers. Further, during our site visits, several  state commissions told us that rate cases in which a state regulatory  commission evaluates a carrier\u2019s costs and investments are very  infrequent, if they take place at all. As such, there is limited assessment of  the cost-effectiveness of carriers and their investments. Further, as OMB  noted, there is no evidence that the program explicitly encourages carriers  to achieve efficient and cost-effective delivery of service; rather, the  program simply makes rural incumbent carriers whole, regardless of their  investment decisions or business model, or the presence of competition in  the market by guaranteeing \u201creasonable\u201d rates of return.

To respond to this  task, FCC modified and expanded the high-cost program. In the  intervening 10 years, FCC has distributed over $30 billion to carriers, with  much of this support coming from fees charged to consumers. Yet, FCC  has not established performance goals or measures for the program. Thus,  it is neither clear what outcomes the program is intended to produce nor  what outcomes the program has achieved. What we and the Joint Board  found were differences in telecommunications services in rural areas  across the country. For example, in some rural areas, carriers receive  generous support and provide advanced services, such as fiber-to-the- home, while in other rural areas, carriers receive little or no support and  provide basic services. In addition to the lack of performance goals and  measures, the internal control mechanisms in place have weaknesses,  which hinder FCC\u2019s ability to assess the risk of noncompliance with  program rules and ensure cost-effective use of program funds. The internal  control mechanisms are inconsistent, limited in number, and appear more  concerned with data completeness than accuracy. Thus, for example, it is  not clear that the program ensures the most cost-effective delivery of  services to rural areas. Therefore, program expenditures may be higher  than necessary. These problems raise concerns about past and current  program expenditures. But, they also raise concerns about the future of  the program. In January 2008, FCC issued several notices proposing  fundamental, policy-oriented reform of the program. For example, FCC  proposed reverse auctions for the program, but it is not clear how FCC  can assess this proposal when it does not know what goals the program  should achieve or how it will measure program outcomes. Additionally,  the Joint Board proposed separate funds for broadband, mobility, and  provider-of-last resort services, with a $4 billion funding level that was  based on the current level of program expenditures. But, it is not clear that  the $4 billion is the correct funding level. Without performance goals,  measures, and adequate internal controls, it will be difficult for FCC to  assess these proposals.

To help ensure that the survey questions were clear and  understandable to respondents, and that we gathered the information we  desired, we conducted pretests with relevant officials in Mississippi, North  Carolina, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Washington. The survey was  available online to officials in the 50 states and the District of Columbia on  a secure Web site. We received complete responses from 50 of the 51  commissions we surveyed, for an overall response rate of 98 percent. This  report does not contain all the results from the survey. The survey and a  more complete tabulation of the results can be viewed at GAO-08-662SP.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2007 through June 2008 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

While we did not specifically cite the Memorandum of Understanding  (MOU), we did discuss elements of this document. With respect to  internal controls, the MOU states that USAC \u201cshall implement a  comprehensive audit program to ensure that USF monies are used for  their intended purpose, to verify that all USF contributors make the  appropriate contributions in accordance with the  rules, and to  detect and deter potential waste, fraud, and abuse.  shall work  under the oversight of the OIG in hiring contractors and auditing  contractors . . .\u201d While we acknowledge these recent efforts to conduct  audits of USF (Universal Service Fund) program contributors and  beneficiaries, as discussed in this report, we found that with respect to  the high-cost program, these efforts have been limited and yielded  limited results. For example, USAC has conducted about 17 audits,  from more than 1,400 participating carriers, and participants did not  maintain adequate information for the auditors to validate their  information. The MOU also states that USAC \u201cshall implement  effective internal control over its operations, including the  administration of the USF and compliance with applicable laws and  regulations.  will implement an internal control structure  consistent with the standards and guidance contained in OMB Circular  A-123, including the methodology for assessing, documenting, and  reporting on internal controls. . .\u201d During our review, USAC officials  made us aware of the actions they are taking to develop a  comprehensive, internal control framework for USAC\u2019s internal  operations, such as procedures to ensure that cash disbursements are  consistent with funds due to participating carriers. While we  encourage these efforts, USAC\u2019s internal operations were not in the  scope of our objectives, and these efforts do not address the issues we  raised in the report\u2014weak and limited internal control mechanisms  specifically aimed at the high-cost program beneficiaries.  2.  We are aware that efforts to promote universal service in rural areas  pre-date the 1996 Act, and include background information on these  efforts on pages 7-8 of the report. However, to avoid any confusion, we  modified the report text to note that FCC modified and expanded the  high-cost program after the Telecommunications Act of 1996.  3.  Again, while we did not specifically cite the MOU, on page 28 of the  report, we did discuss the performance data that FCC requires USAC  to collect and report on a quarterly basis. Interestingly, in a previous  meeting with USAC and in USAC\u2019s written comments, USAC noted that  it is not authorized to collect all the performance data required by  FCC. In particular, of the seven categories of performance data, USAC  said it was not authorized to collect some portions of three categories,  including the number of program beneficiaries per wire center, the  number of lines per wire center (except for the high-cost model  component), and the rate of telephone subscribership in urban vs.  rural areas. Thus, it is unclear how effective this data collection effort  will be in developing performance goals and measures.  4.  We changed the text to be consistent with the 1996 Act.  5.  We did not assert that FCC had the authority to impose mandatory  standards on state regulatory commissions, although, since the issue  has not been adjudicated, it is unclear whether the statute prohibits  FCC from imposing mandatory standards. Irrespective of FCC\u2019s  authority to impose mandatory standards, the inconsistent  requirements imposed by the states represent a weakness in the high- cost program\u2019s internal controls. As USAC noted in its written  comments, \u201cif states adopted similar requirements there would be  more standardized requirements across all ETCs thereby enabling  USAC to conduct more comprehensive audits to ensure ETCs are  using High Cost funds for the purposes intended.\u201d  6.  We changed the text to be consistent with the 1996 Act.  7.  On page 37 of this report, we discuss the steps NECA takes to verify  the accuracy of the data that carriers submit, including analyzing  trends and comparing cost data with information in carriers\u2019 audited  financial statements. Although, as we also discuss, NECA is  responsible only for collecting carrier cost and line count data for the  high-cost loop support component, representing only one of the five  high-cost program components. Further, trend analysis does not  necessarily ensure the accuracy of the underlying data. In its  comments on this report, USAC, which also performs extensive  trending validations, noted that \u201cabsent a full-scale audit, it is difficult  to determine the level of accuracy of the information provided by the  carriers.\u201d  8.  We acknowledge that FCC\u2019s Office of Inspector General (OIG)", "Improper Payments and Information Act of 2002 (IPIA) audits included  a component to determine carrier compliance with high-cost program  rules. While FCC\u2019s comments state these audits were designed to  render an auditor\u2019s opinion on the accuracy of carrier data, it was  unclear to us that these audits specifically addressed accuracy of  carrier cost and line counts. In the OIG\u2019s Initial Statistical Analysis of  Data from the 2006/2007 Compliance Audits, the reasons for carrier  noncompliance focused on procedural noncompliance. These reports  attributed inadequate document retention; inadequate auditee  processes or policies and procedures; inadequate systems for  collecting, reporting, or monitoring data; auditee weak internal  controls; and auditee data entry error. These reports do not discuss the  accuracy of carrier\u2019s cost or line-count data.  9.  We acknowledged the Notice of Proposed Rulemakings that FCC  issued to address the growth in the high-cost program\u2019s expenditures  and provided background information on these proposals. However,  we did not provide an assessment of these proposals since FCC was  actively seeking comments on the proposals, and the outcome of the  proposals was speculative. Further, our findings and recommendations  regarding management and oversight of the high-cost program are  applicable to the program in general, regardless of the specific reform  proposal adopted. In making our recommendations, we are not  implying that FCC should discontinue policy-oriented reform of the  high-cost program; rather, these efforts are complementary.  10. On page 14 of the report, we provide a discussion of the factors  contributing to the growth of high-cost program expenditures, and  figure 1 provides a visual illustration of the growth in both incumbent  and competitive support. Further, on page 24, we provide detailed  information on the growth in the number of CETCs and the overall  financial support provided to CETCs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the Universal Service Administrative Company", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Michael Clements, Assistant  Director; Tida Barakat; Brandon Haller; Amanda Krause; Carla Lewis;  Michael Meleady; Joshua Ormond; Donell Ries; Stan Stenerson; Mindi  Weisenbloom; Crystal Wesco; and Elizabeth Wood made key contributions  to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
