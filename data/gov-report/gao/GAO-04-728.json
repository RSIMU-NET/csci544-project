The act also contained provisions directing TSA to take actions to improve the security of airport perimeters, access controls, and airport workers. GAO was asked to assess TSA's efforts to: (1) evaluate the security of airport perimeters and the controls that limit access into secured airport areas, (2) help airports implement and enhance perimeter security and access controls by providing them funding and technical guidance, and (3) implement measures to reduce the potential security risks posed by airport workers."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["TSA has begun evaluating the security of airport perimeters and the controls that limit access into secured airport areas. Specifically, TSA is conducting compliance inspections and vulnerability assessments at selected airports. These evaluations--though not complete--have identified perimeter and access control security concerns. While TSA officials acknowledged that conducting these airport security evaluations is essential to identifying additional perimeter and access control security measures and prioritizing their implementation, the agency has not determined how the results will be used to make improvements to the entire commercial airport system. TSA has helped some airport operators enhance perimeter and access control security by providing funds for security equipment, such as electronic surveillance systems. TSA has also begun efforts to evaluate the effectiveness of security-related technologies, such as biometric identification systems. However, TSA has not begun to gather data on airport operators' historical funding of security projects and current needs to aid the agency in setting funding priorities. Nor has TSA developed a plan for implementing new technologies or balancing the costs and effectiveness of these technologies with the security needs of individual airport operators and the commercial airport system as a whole. TSA has taken some steps to reduce the potential security risks posed by airport workers. However, TSA had elected not to fully address all related ATSA requirements. In particular, TSA does not require fingerprint-based criminal history checks and security awareness training for all airport workers, as called for in ATSA. Further, TSA has not required airport vendors to develop security programs, another ATSA requirement. TSA said expanding these efforts would require a time-consuming rulemaking process and impose additional costs on airport operators. Finally, although not required by ATSA, TSA has not developed a plan detailing when and how it intends to address these challenges."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In November 2001, shortly after the September 11 terrorist attacks,  President Bush signed into law the Aviation and Transportation Security  Act, or ATSA (Pub.

One of TSA\u2019s first challenges  imposed by the act was to improve the security of airline passenger and  baggage screening activities, activities for which TSA has direct  responsibility. The agency is also taking action to address provisions of  the act to improve three other areas of aviation security: the security of  airport perimeters (such as airfield fencing and access gates), the  adequacy of controls restricting unauthorized access to secured areas  (such as building entry ways leading to aircraft), and security measures  pertaining to individuals who work at airports. Recent media reports of  security breaches and other illegal activities, such as drug smuggling,  taking place at some airports highlight the importance of strengthening  security in these areas. Taken as a whole, these areas, along with  passenger and baggage screening, comprise key elements of the aviation  security environment at commercial airports, both individually and as a  nationwide system.", "You requested that we examine TSA\u2019s efforts to strengthen security related  to perimeter and access controls.  This report assesses TSA\u2019s efforts to   (1) evaluate the security of airport perimeters and the controls that limit  access into secured airport areas, (2) help airports implement and enhance  perimeter security and access controls by providing funding and technical  guidance, and (3) implement measures to reduce the potential security  risk posed by airport workers.  Due to TSA\u2019s concern that the public  release of some of our detailed findings could compromise aviation  security, we also issued a restricted version of this report.", "To perform these assessments, we analyzed TSA data on security  evaluations conducted and funds distributed to commercial airports for  security improvements. We also reviewed pertinent legislation, regulatory  requirements, and policy guidance. To determine to what extent TSA had  met requirements, we discussed with our Office of General Counsel  specific requirements contained in three sections of the act:    Section 106 (requirements for evaluating airport access controls, testing  and evaluating security technologies, and providing technical and financial  support to small and medium-sized airports);   Section 136 (recommending commercially available measures to prevent  access to secure airport areas and developing a deployment strategy for  available technology at all large airports); and    Section 138 (performing background checks for all employees with  unescorted access to secured airport areas, among others).", "We obtained and analyzed TSA data on security breaches, covert testing,  inspections of airport compliance with security regulations, and  vulnerability assessments. (TSA\u2019s covert testing data and information on  the test program are classified and are the subject of a separate classified  GAO report.) We discussed the threat scenarios used in TSA vulnerability  assessments with TSA officials to identify those related to perimeter and  access control security. We obtained and analyzed data from the Federal  Aviation Administration (FAA) and TSA on perimeter and access control- related security funds distributed to commercial airport nationwide. We  reviewed reports on aviation security issued previously by GAO and the  Department of Transportation Inspector General.", "In addition, we conducted site visits at 12 commercial airports to observe  airport security procedures and discuss issues related to perimeter and  access control security with airport operator officials. These were Boston  Logan International Airport, Atlanta Hartsfield Jackson International  Airport, Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, Washington Dulles  International Airport, Orlando International Airport, Tampa International  Airport, Miami International Airport, Los Angeles International Airport,  San Francisco International Airport, Middle Georgia Regional Airport,  Chattanooga Metropolitan Airport, and Columbus Metropolitan Airport. At  10 of these airports, we analyzed a sample of records to verify that the  procedures to reduce the security risk of airport workers were followed.  We also discussed security issues with TSA airport and headquarters  officials, airport security coordinators at each of the nation\u2019s 21 largest  and busiest airports (referred to by TSA as \u201ccategory X\u201d airports), as well  as airport industry representatives.

While airport operators, not  TSA, retain direct day-to-day operational responsibility for these areas of  security, ATSA\u2019s sections 106, 136, and 138 direct TSA to improve the  security of airport perimeters and the access controls leading to secured  airport areas, as well as measures to reduce the security risks posed by  airport workers, as shown in figure 1.", "On February 17, 2002, TSA assumed responsibility from FAA for certain  aspects of security at the nation\u2019s commercial airports, including FAA\u2019s  existing aviation security programs, plans, regulations, orders, and  directives. Soon thereafter, on February 22, 2002, the Department of  Transportation issued regulations to reflect the change in jurisdiction from  FAA to TSA. Also, TSA reissued security directives originally issued by  FAA after September 11, 2001, related to perimeter and access control  security.", "TSA hired 158 federal security directors (FSDs) to oversee the  implementation of these requirements at airports nationwide. The FSDs  also work with inspection teams from TSA\u2019s Aviation Regulatory  Inspection Division to conduct compliance inspections. In addition, as part  of its oversight role, TSA headquarters staff conducts covert testing and  vulnerability assessments to help individual airport operators determine  how to improve security and to gather data to support systemwide  analysis of security vulnerabilities and weaknesses. Airport operators are  responsible for implementing TSA security requirements for airport  perimeters, access controls, and airport workers. Each airport\u2019s security  program, which must be approved by TSA, outlines the security policies,  procedures, and systems the airport intends to use in order to comply with  TSA security requirements.", "There are about 450 commercial airports in the United States. Depending  upon the type of aircraft operations, airport operators must establish  either complete, supporting, or partial security programs. Complete  security programs include guidelines for performing background checks  on airport workers, providing security training for these workers, and  controlling access to secured airport areas, among other things. Federal  regulations also require that commercial airports with complete security  programs designate areas where specific security practices and measures  are in place and provide a diagram of these areas. Figure 2 is a diagram of  a typical commercial airport and the security requirements that apply to  each airport area."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Secured area/", "paragraphs": ["Air Operations Area (AOA)", "Signs at access points and perimeters that warn against   this area.", "Access controls used that meet performance standards (e.g.   proximity cards and personal identification number)", "TSA classifies airports into one of five categories (X, I, II, III, and IV) based  on various factors, such as the total number of take-offs and landings  annually, the extent to which passengers are screened at the airport, and  other special security considerations. U.S. commercial airports are divided  into different areas with varying levels of security. Individual airport  operators determine the boundaries for each of these areas on a case-by- case basis, depending on the physical layout of the airport. As a result,  some of these areas may overlap. Secured areas, security identification  display areas (SIDA), and air operations areas (AOA) are not to be  accessed by passengers, and typically encompass areas near terminal  buildings, baggage loading areas, and other areas that are close to parked  aircraft and airport facilities, including air traffic control towers and  runways used for landing, taking off, or surface maneuvering. On the other  hand, sterile areas are located within the terminal where passengers wait  after screening to board departing aircraft. Access to these areas is  controlled by TSA screeners at checkpoints where they conduct physical  screening of passengers and their carry-on baggage for weapons and  explosives.", "According to TSA estimates, there are about 1,000,000 airport and vendor  employees who work at the nation\u2019s commercial airports. About 900,000 of  these workers perform duties in the secured or SIDA areas. Airport  operators issue SIDA badges to these airport workers. These badges  identify the workers and grant them the authority to access the SIDA and  secured areas without an escort. Examples of workers with unescorted  access to the SIDA and secured areas include workers who access aircraft,  including mechanics, catering employees, refuelers, cleaning crews,  baggage handlers, and cargo loaders. TSA estimates there are an  additional 100,000 employees who work in sterile airport areas, such as  the concourse or gate area where passenger flights load and unload.  Examples of employees who work or perform duties in the sterile area  include those operating concessions and shops, and other air carrier or  vendor employees. Other workers may, from time to time, need to enter  the SIDA or secured area and must be accompanied by an escort who has  been granted unescorted access authority. According to TSA, only a  relatively small number of airport workers need regular escorted access to  the SIDA and secured areas. Job functions in this category would include  delivery personnel, construction workers, and specialized maintenance  crews.", "Methods used by airports to control access through perimeters or into  secured areas vary because of differences in the design and layout of  individual airports, but all access controls must meet minimum  performance standards in accordance with TSA requirements. There are a  variety of commercially available technologies that are currently used for  these purposes or are used for other industries but could be applied to  airports.

TSA  acknowledged the importance of conducting these evaluation efforts as an  essential step to determine the need for, and prioritization of, additional  perimeter security and access control security measures. But the agency  has not yet established several elements needed for effective short- and  long-term management of these evaluations, such as schedules for  conducting its efforts and an analytical approach to using the results of its  evaluations to make systematic improvements to the nation\u2019s commercial  airport system."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "TSA Has Revised Its Approach to Conducting Airport Compliance Inspections but Has Not Determined How to Use Results to Strengthen Security", "paragraphs": ["ATSA, (Sec. 106 (c)(2)), requires TSA to assess and test for airport  compliance with federal access control security requirements and report  annually on its findings. TSA originally planned to conduct comprehensive  assessments at each commercial airport periodically.  Staff from TSA\u2019s  Aviation Regulatory Inspection Division along with local airport inspection  staff working under federal security directors completed relatively few  comprehensive airport inspections in fiscal year 2002, although TSA  completed considerably more in 2003. In addition, TSA records indicated  that a significant number of individual, or \u201csupplemental\u201d inspections of  specific areas of security or local airport security concerns were  conducted in fiscal years 2002 and 2003, respectively. TSA, however, did  not identify the scope of these inspections, or how many airports were  inspected through its supplemental inspections. In addition, the agency did  not report on the results of these comprehensive or individual  supplemental inspections, as required by ATSA. According to TSA, the  agency was limited in its ability to analyze these data because compliance  reports submitted during this time frame were compiled in a prototype  reporting system that was under development. In July 2003, TSA deployed  the automated system\u2014Performance and Results Information System  (PARIS)\u2014and began to compile the results of compliance reviews.", "In TSA\u2019s Annual Inspection and Assessment Plan for fiscal year 2004, TSA  revised its approach for reviewing airport operator compliance with  security regulations. According to TSA, the new inspection process uses  risk management principles that consider threat factors, local security  issues, and input from airport operators and law enforcement to target key  vulnerabilities and critical assets. Under the new inspection process, the  local federal security director at each airport is responsible for  determining the scope and emphasis of the inspections, as well as  managing local TSA inspection staff. According to the agency, the  continuous inspections approach resulted in completion of a significant  number of individual inspections of airport access controls and other  security requirements in the first few months of fiscal year 2004.", "The percentage of inspections that found airport operators to be in  compliance with security requirements, including those related to  perimeters and access control, was high. According to TSA, its goal is for  airport operators to be in 100 percent compliance with security  requirements. Despite the generally high compliance rates, TSA identified  some instances of airport noncompliance involving access controls.", "According to TSA, the agency\u2019s new approach to conducting compliance  inspections is designed to be a cooperative process based on the premise  that voluntary and collaborative airport operator compliance to facilitate  solutions to security issues is more effective than the use of penalties to  enforce compliance. This approach is intended to identify the root causes  of security problems, develop solutions cooperatively with airport  operators, and focus the use of civil enforcement actions on the most  serious security risks revealed by TSA\u2019s inspections. As a result, TSA said  that the majority of airport inspection violations related to airport security  was addressed through on-site counseling with airport operator officials,  rather than administrative actions or civil monetary penalties, which TSA  is authorized to issue when airport operators fail to address identified  areas of noncompliance. According to TSA, on-site counseling is used  only for minor infractions that can be easily and quickly corrected.  Administrative actions progress from a warning notice suggesting  corrective steps to a letter of correction that requires an airport operator  to take immediate action to avoid civil penalties. TSA was able to provide  the number of cases in which it recommended the issuance of civil  penalties to airport operators for violations of security requirement.  Table 1 shows the various types of enforcement actions used by TSA to  address airport operator noncompliance with security requirements for  the period between October 2003 and February 2004.", "TSA had not assessed the effectiveness of these penalties in ensuring  airport compliance with security requirements as required by ATSA (Sec.  106 (c)(2)). TSA said the agency was not able to conduct inspections at all  commercial airports in prior years, or assess the effectiveness of the use of  penalties to ensure airport compliance because of limited personnel  assigned to perform these tasks and agency decisions to direct these  resources to address other areas of aviation security, such as passenger  and baggage screening operations. According to TSA, the primary focus of  field inspectors was to monitor passenger and baggage screening  operations immediately following the attacks of September 11. As a result,  routine inspections were not assigned as high a priority during the months  following the attacks. For example, while DHS authorized TSA to use 639  full-time employees for the purpose of performing airport security  inspections in fiscal year 2003, TSA allocated 358 full-time employees for  this purpose. TSA said that the agency is hiring new regulatory inspectors  at airports to help conduct required inspections. In its fiscal year 2005  budget submission, TSA requested over 1,200 full-time employees to  conduct compliance inspections.", "TSA said airport compliance inspections are needed to ensure that airport  operators take steps to address deficiencies as they are identified. TSA  also said that the agency has proposed measuring the performance of  individual airport against national performance averages, and airports that  fall below accepted levels of compliance will receive additional  inspections or other actions. However, TSA has not yet developed a plan  outlining how the results of its compliance inspections will be used to  interpret and help analyze the results of airport vulnerability assessments  and covert testing. For example, at the time of our review, a majority of  airports tested had high compliance rates, indicating that these airports  are implementing most security regulations. However, assessing airport  operator compliance with security requirements as a stand-alone measure  does not provide a complete picture of the level of security at these  airports. Covert testing and vulnerability assessments provide additional  information that, taken together with the results of compliance  inspections, provide a more complete picture of the security environment  at commercial airports on a systemwide basis."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Initial Airport Vulnerability Assessments Reveal Security Concerns, but TSA Lacks Both a Timetable for Completion and a Plan for Making Systematic Improvements", "paragraphs": ["From September to December 2003, TSA conducted vulnerability  assessments at some of the nation\u2019s commercial airports to help individual  airport operators determine how to improve security.  At the time of our  review, TSA had not established a schedule for completing assessments at  the remaining airports. TSA is conducting these vulnerability assessments  as part of a broader effort to implement a risk management approach to  better prepare for and withstand terrorist threats. A risk management  approach is a systematic process to analyze threats, vulnerabilities, and  the criticality (or relative importance) of assets to better support key  decisions. (See app. II for a description of risk management principles and  TSA\u2019s tools for implementing these principles.) TSA uses various threat  scenarios that describe potentially dangerous situations as a basis for  conducting its vulnerabilities assessments.  During the assessments, TSA  and airport operators review the scenarios and rank them according to the  risk each poses to the individual airport.", "As part of each vulnerability assessment, TSA provided airport operators  with a report on the results and recommended short- and long-term  countermeasures to reduce the threats identified. According to TSA, some  of these countermeasures may be difficult for (1) airport operators to  implement because of limited availability of security funding and (2) TSA  to mandate because issuing new security regulations is an often time- consuming process that involves public comment and analysis of potential  impacts. However, TSA does have authority under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(l)(2) to  issue regulations or security directives immediately in order to protect  transportation security.", "Various sources have highlighted the importance of TSA\u2019s continuing  efforts to assess airport vulnerabilities. For example, in December 2003,  the President issued a directive calling for assessments of the  vulnerability of critical infrastructure, including airports, to assist in  developing the nation\u2019s homeland security strategy. In addition, TSA data  on reported security breaches of airport access controls revealed that  such known breaches have increased in recent years. Further, airport  operator officials we spoke with noted the importance of vulnerability  assessments as the key step in determining needed security enhancements  at each airport. Specifically, airport security coordinators at 12 of the  nation\u2019s 21 largest and busiest airports said that a TSA vulnerability  assessment would facilitate their efforts to comprehensively identify and  effectively address perimeter and access control security weaknesses.", "At the time of our review, TSA had allocated 9 staff to conduct the  vulnerability assessments and another 5 staff to analyze the results.  According to TSA, these staff also perform other assessment and  analytical tasks. Although TSA initially said that it expected to conduct  additional assessments in 2004, the agency suspended its efforts to use  established threat scenarios to assess vulnerabilities in January 2004. TSA  said that the agency elected to redirect staff resources to conduct higher  priority assessments of the threat posed by shoulder-fired missiles, also  referred to as man portable air defense systems (MANPADS). In addition,  TSA said that the agency planned to begin conducting joint vulnerability  assessments with the FBI. The FBI previously conducted joint  assessments with FAA in response to requirements established in the  Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Act of 1996. At the time  of our review, TSA said that the agency had not yet determined how to  allocate its resources to conduct vulnerability assessments using  established threat scenarios versus initiating joint assessment efforts with  the FBI. When TSA resumes its scenario-based assessment efforts, the  agency plans to prioritize its efforts by focusing on the most critical  airports. (TSA said the agency intends to determine the criticality of  commercial airports based on factors such as current threat intelligence,  the number of fatalities that could occur during an attack on the airport,  and the economic and sociopolitical importance of the facility.)", "After TSA resumes its assessment efforts, the agency intends to compile  baseline data on security vulnerabilities to enable it to conduct a  systematic analysis of airport security vulnerabilities on a nationwide  basis. TSA said such an analysis is essential since it will allow the agency  to determine minimum standards and the adequacy of security policies  and help the agency and airports better direct limited resources.  Nonetheless, at the time of our review, TSA had not yet developed a plan  that prioritizes its assessment efforts, provides a schedule for completing  these assessments, or describes how assessment results will be used to  help guide agency decisions on what, if any, security improvements are  needed."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "TSA Has Begun Efforts but Has Not Fully Developed Plans to Fund Security Enhancements and Assess Security Technologies", "paragraphs": ["Through funding of a limited number of security enhancements, TSA has  helped to improve perimeter and access control security at some airports.  However, at the time of our review, TSA had not yet developed a plan to  prioritize expenditures to ensure that funds provided have the greatest  impact in improving the security of the commercial airport system.  Concerning evaluations of security technologies, ATSA contained three  provisions (Secs. 136, 106(b), and 106(c)) directing TSA to assess security  technologies related to perimeter and access control security and develop  a plan to provide technical (and funding) assistance to small- and medium- sized airport operators.

As we reported in October 2002, perimeter and  access control security measures\u2014fencing, surveillance and fingerprinting  equipment, and access control systems\u2014accounted for almost half of  fiscal year 2002 AIP funding for security projects, as shown in table 2.", "In fiscal year 2003, FAA provided a total of $491 million for security- related AIP projects, including about $45.6 million for perimeter fencing  projects and another $56.9 million for access control security, a total of  about 21 percent of security funding. In addition, Congress appropriated a  $175 million supplement to the program in January 2002 to reimburse   317 airports for post-September 11 security mandates.", "TSA said that FAA\u2019s AIP served as its plan to provide the financial  assistance to small and medium-sized airports required by Section 106(b)  of ATSA. According to TSA, local federal security directors worked with  FAA officials to review and approve security-related AIP grant  applications submitted by individual airports, evaluating their merits on an  airport-by-airport basis based on guidelines developed and provided by  TSA. TSA has not, however, developed an approach to prioritize funding  for perimeter and access control security projects at small- and medium- sized (or larger) airports. Without a plan to consider airports\u2019 security  needs systematically, including those of small- and medium-sized airports,  TSA could not ensure that the most critical security needs of the  commercial airport system were identified and addressed in a priority  order. More importantly, because TSA has assumed primary responsibility  for funding security-related projects, FAA\u2019s AIP cannot continue to serve  as TSA\u2019s plan for providing financial assistance to small- and medium-sized  airports. Without a plan, TSA could be less able to document, measure,  and improve the effectiveness of the agency\u2019s efforts to provide funding  support for enhancing perimeter and access control security.", "While acknowledging the lack of a specific plan, TSA said the agency had,  in conjunction with FAA, deployed and installed explosive detection  systems, explosive trace detection and metal detection devices, and other  security equipment at many small- and medium-sized airports for use by  federal screeners at those airports and that over 300 small- and medium- sized airports had received technical support and equipment of some kind.  However, in advising FAA throughout this process, TSA did not compile  and analyze historical information on the cost and types of technology  used or the specific airports receiving AIP assistance for perimeter and  access control-related security enhancement projects (although TSA  stated that historical data were available that could be used to conduct  such analyses). FAA has historically maintained data on the uses of AIP  funding (including the types of projects funded, amounts, and locations) in  a commonly used commercial database system (Access). In addition,  airport associations, such as the American Association of Airport  Executives, also collect and disseminate information on the use of AIP  funds for security enhancements. Without analyses of such historical  information, TSA\u2019s ability to establish a baseline of security funding for  current and future planning efforts to enhance perimeter and access  controls could be limited.", "In addition to consulting with FAA to provide funding for airport security  projects through the AIP, TSA recently began providing security funding  directly to airport operators. Specifically, in December 2003, TSA awarded  approximately $8 million in grants to 8 airports as part of $17 million  appropriated by Congress for enhancing the security of airport terminals,  including access controls and perimeter security. Table 3 provides a brief  description of the perimeter and access control security-related projects at  the 8 airports TSA selected for funding.", "The Vision 100\u2014Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act shifted most of  the responsibility for airport security project funding from FAA and the  AIP to TSA by establishing a new Federal Aviation Security Capital Fund  in December 2003. Through the new fund, Congress authorized up to  $500 million for airport security for each fiscal year from 2004 through  2007. Of the total, $250 million will be derived from passenger security  fees, along with an additional authorization of up to $250 million. Of this  amount, half of the money from each funding source is to be allocated  pursuant to a formula that considers airport size and security risk.  The  other half would be distributed at the Under Secretary's discretion, with  priority given to fulfilling intentions to obligate under letters of intent that  TSA has issued. TSA said it is working on, but had not yet developed  policies and procedures for, first, defining how the agency will fund and  prioritize airport security projects under the new program or second,  determining how much, if any, of the new funding will be used for  perimeter security and access control projects.  However, TSA said that  the administration requested in its 2005 budget justification that Congress  eliminate the allocation formula so that the agency could allocate funds  according to a threat-based, risk assessment approach, regardless of the  size of the airport."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TSA Lacks a Technology Plan to Guide Future Enhancements to Airport Perimeter Security and Access Controls", "paragraphs": ["TSA has begun efforts to test commercially available and emerging  security technologies to enhance perimeter and access control security.

The first provision (Sec. 136)  required that TSA (1) recommend commercially available security  measures or procedures for preventing access to secured airport areas by  unauthorized persons within 6 months of the act\u2019s passage and (2) develop  a 12-month deployment strategy for commercially available security  technology at the largest and busiest airports (category X).  TSA has not  explicitly addressed the requirements in this provision and did not meet  the associated legislative deadlines. For example, TSA has not  recommended commercially available technologies to improve  surveillance and use of controls at access points by May 2002 or developed  a deployment strategy. TSA said the agency failed to meet these deadlines  because resources and management attention were primarily focused on  meeting the many deadlines and requirements associated with passenger  and baggage screening, tasks for which TSA has direct operational  responsibility.", "The second technology provision of ATSA (Sec. 106(d)) requires that TSA  establish a pilot program to test, assess, and provide information on new  and emerging technologies for improving perimeter and access control  security at 20 airports. TSA\u2019s $20 million Airport Access Control Pilot  Program is intended to assist the agency in developing minimum  performance standards for airport security systems, assess the suitability  of emerging security technologies, and share resulting information with  airport operators and other aviation industry stakeholders. In October  2003, TSA selected a systems integrator to oversee the program and  coordinate testing; however, the agency has not selected the specific  technologies to be evaluated. TSA plans to look at four areas: biometric  identification systems, new identification badges, controls to prevent  unauthorized persons from piggybacking (following authorized airport  workers into secured areas), and intrusion detection systems. TSA said  the agency will conduct the technology assessments in two phases and  that the second phase is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2005.  However, TSA has not developed a plan describing the steps it will take  once the program is completed, although TSA said the agency intends to  communicate the results of both assessment phases to airport operators.  TSA also said the agency will determine how to use results of the  technology assessments and if it will issue any new security or  performance standards to airports nationwide when both program  assessment phases are completed. Without a plan that considers the  potential steps the agency may need to take to effectively use the results  of the pilot tests\u2014for example, by issuing new standards\u2014TSA\u2019s ability to  take effective and immediate steps once the program is completed could  be limited.", "In addition to the pilot program, testing of a national credentialing system  for workers in all modes of transportation\u2014the Transportation Workers  Identification Credential (TWIC) Program\u2014is another effort that may help  TSA address the requirement in Section 136 of ATSA related to testing and  recommending commercially available security technologies to enhance  perimeter and access control security. According to TSA, the program is  intended to establish a uniform identification credential for 6 million  workers who require unescorted physical or cyber access to secured areas  of transportation facilities. The card is intended to combine standard  background checks and new and emerging biometric technology so that a  worker can be positively matched to his or her credential. According to  TSA, the agency spent $15 million for the program in fiscal year 2003. In  April 2003, TSA awarded a contract for $3.8 million to an independent  contractor to assist TSA in the technology evaluation phase of the TWIC  program and to test and evaluate different types of technologies at  multiple facilities across different modes of transportation at pilot sites.  Congress directed $50 million for the TWIC program for fiscal year 2004.  This program is scheduled for completion in 2008.

For example, they said the TWIC card would have to be  compatible with the many types of card readers used at airports around  the country, or new card readers would have to be installed. At large  airports, this could entail replacing hundreds of card readers, and airport  representatives have expressed concerns about how this effort would be  funded. According to TSA, however, the TWIC card is intended to be  compatible with all airports\u2019 card readers.  Nonetheless, TSA has not yet  conducted an analysis of the cost and operational impacts of  implementing the program at airports nationwide.

However, this was an FAA plan and did not fully meet the  requirement. More importantly, because the amount of money coming  from the AIP for security-related projects will be significantly reduced, and  thereby TSA\u2019s continuing in involvement with FAA in administering the  program, the AIP cannot continue to serve as TSA\u2019s plan for providing  technical assistance to small- and medium-sized airports.

Officials at these airports said they are waiting for TSA to provide  guidance before proceeding with security upgrades. These airport  operators also said that security technology is very costly, and they cannot  afford to pay for testing technology prior to purchasing and installing such  technology at their airports. They said that information or guidance from  TSA about what technologies are available or most effective to safeguard  airport perimeters would be beneficial. Conversely, officials at other  airports also said they were assessing what is needed to improve their  perimeter security and access controls by independently testing and  installing security technologies. Several of these officials said that the trial- and-error approach to improving security would not be necessary if TSA  would act as a clearinghouse for information on the most effective  security technologies and how they can be applied.  They said that their  independent efforts did not always ensure that increasingly limited  resources for enhancing security were used in the most effective way.", "In addition to contacting the 21 largest and busiest airports, we identified  13 other airports as examples of airports that have tested or implemented  technologies for improving airport perimeter and access control security.

The airport completed a 5-month pilot  program in the fall of 2002 and subsequently purchased two workstations  to implement the technology at the airport at a cost of $130,000. Another  airport operator conducted an independent pilot program in 2002 to test a  biometric recognition system in order to identify airport workers. The  system compared 15 airport workers against a database of 250 airport  workers, but operated at a high failure rate. Although compiling  information on this pilot test and other airports\u2019 efforts would augment  TSA\u2019s own efforts to assess technology, TSA has not considered the costs  and benefits of compiling and assessing the information being collected  through these independent efforts. TSA agreed that compiling such data  could be beneficial, but the agency had not yet focused its attention on  gathering data to generate useful information on such independent testing  efforts.

For  example, those workers who have been granted unescorted access to  secured areas are authorized access to these areas without undergoing  physical screening for prohibited items (which passengers undergo prior  to boarding a flight). To meet TSA requirements, airport operators  transmit applicants\u2019 fingerprints to a TSA contractor, who in turn forwards  the fingerprints to TSA, who submits them to the FBI to be checked for  criminal histories that could disqualify an applicant for airport  employment.

In late 2002, TSA required airport  operators to conduct fingerprint-based checks and watch list verifications  for an additional approximately 100,000 airport workers who perform  duties in sterile areas. As of April 2004, TSA said that airport operators had  completed all of these checks. To verify that required criminal checks  were conducted, we randomly sampled airport employee files at 9 airports  we visited during our review and examined all airport employee files at a  10th airport. Based on our samples, we estimate that criminal history  record checks at 7 of the airports were conducted for 100 percent of the  airport employees. In the other 2 airports in which samples were  conducted, we estimate that criminal history checks were conducted for  98 percent and 96 percent of the airport workers. At the 10th airport, we  examined all airport employee files. We found that criminal history checks  were conducted for 93 percent of the airport employees there. Although  airport operators could not provide documentation that the checks were  conducted in a small number of cases, airport security officials said that  no individuals were granted access to secured or sterile areas without the  completion of such a check. TSA said that verification of airport  compliance with background check requirements was a standard part of  airport compliance inspections.

Although TSA does not require that airport  operators conduct these checks, TSA drafted a proposed rule in 2002 to  require checks on individuals escorted in secured areas. The draft rule  also set forth minimum standards for providing escorts for these  individuals. In a February 2003 report on TSA\u2019s efforts to enhance airport  security, the Department of Transportation Inspector General  recommended that TSA revise its proposed rule to enhance the security  benefits that the new rule could provide by including (1) additional  background check requirements, (2) a more specific description of escort  procedures, and (3) a clarification on who would be exempt from such  requirements.

For example, fingerprint-based checks only  identify individuals with fingerprints and a criminal record on file with the  FBI\u2019s national fingerprint database. Limitations of these checks were  highlighted by recent multifederal agency investigations, which found that  thousands of airport workers falsified immigration, Social Security, or  criminal history information to gain unescorted access to secured and  sterile airport areas. In some of these cases, airport workers who had  provided false information to obtain unescorted access underwent a  fingerprint-based check and passed. TSA noted that the federal  government had not yet developed a system that would allow interagency  database searches to provide access to social security and immigration  information.", "Another limitation with TSA\u2019s process for conducting background checks  on airport workers is that fingerprint checks do not include a review of,  among other things, all available local (county and municipal) criminal  record files. As a result, an individual could pass the fingerprint check  although he or she had a local criminal record. TSA officials did not  consider the lack of a local criminal records check to be a limiting factor  because local criminal records are not likely to include any of the 28  criminal convictions that would disqualify an individual from obtaining  unescorted access to secured airport areas. According to TSA, local  criminal files do not include the more serious crimes such as murder,  treason, arson, kidnapping, and espionage that are listed in state and  federal criminal databases. Further, several airport operator officials we  spoke with expressed concern about cases in which individuals had  committed disqualifying criminal offenses and were ultimately granted  access to secured areas because federal law (and TSA\u2019s implementing  regulation) disqualifies an individual only if he or she has been convicted  of an offense within 10 years of applying for employment at the airport.  Others said that a few disqualifying criminal offenses, such as air piracy,  warranted a lifetime rather than a 10-year ban on employment in secured  airport areas. Also, current regulation requires that airport workers must  report if they are convicted of a crime after the initial criminal check is  conducted and surrender their security identification badges within 24  hours of their conviction. In addressing the issue of background checks  in May 2003, the Department of Transportation\u2019s Inspector General issued  a statement supporting random recurrent background checks.", "TSA recognizes the potential limitations of current fingerprint check  requirements and has taken steps to improve the process.

TSA said it expanded the background check process for these  workers because it believed that the cost was more feasible for airport  operators to bear, given these workers represent a significantly smaller  population than workers who have unescorted access to secured areas.", "TSA used the NCIC database, a computerized index of documented  criminal justice information, to conduct a criminal history record check  that compares an individual\u2019s name against 19 nationwide criminal history  lists.

According to TSA, the agency relies on its fingerprint-based  criminal history records check as a means of meeting the ATSA  requirement that all individuals entering secured areas at airports be  screened and that the screening of airport workers provides at least the  same level of protection that results from physical screening of passengers  and their baggage.  However, as previously noted, there are limitations  with the scope and effectiveness of the background check process. TSA  acknowledged that physically screening airport workers for access to  secured areas could increase security, but it cited challenges such as the  need (and associated costs) for more screening staff and increased  passenger delays. Although TSA said fingerprint checks are a more  economically feasible alternative, the agency had not conducted analyses  to determine the actual costs, assessed the potential operational delays  that could occur, or the reduction of the risk posed by airport workers that  physical screening would provide. However, in October 2002, TSA  conducted an analysis of threats posed by airport workers with access to  secured areas, and one recommendation in the resulting report was to  require airport operators to conduct random physical screening of  workers entering secured areas. TSA elected not to adopt this  recommendation because of what it characterized as the cost and  operational difficulties in physically screening workers. However, TSA did  not gather or analyze data from airports to substantiate its claim.", "Some airport operator officials we contacted agreed with TSA that  physically screening workers prior to entering secured areas would be  costly and difficult. For example, some airport operator officials said  physical screening of these airport workers would result in increased  staffing costs and longer wait times for passengers at passenger-screening  checkpoints, or could require screening airport workers at a location  separate from passengers to avoid passenger delays. In addition to the  operational difficulty of physically screening each worker, TSA and airport  operators noted that some airport workers must use prohibited items  (such as box cutters and knives) to perform their job functions, and  monitoring which workers are allowed to carry such items could be  difficult. Also, these prohibited items would still be available to workers  who wished to use them to cause harm even after they had been physically  screened. At one airport we visited, airport workers who have access to  secured areas are required to undergo physical screening when they arrive  at work through centralized employee-screening checkpoints but are not  screened when they subsequently enter secured areas through other  access points.", "TSA has not estimated the cost associated with requiring physical  screening of secured area airport workers, although airport operators and  industry associations believe the cost would be significant. While TSA is  weighing the security benefits of requiring physical screening of workers  who have access to secured airport areas against the associated costs, the  agency has yet to determine whether such requirements will be  established. According to TSA, screening in the form of enhanced  background checks on all airport workers\u2014checks that would investigate  Social Security information, immigration status, and links to terrorism\u2014 would, if instituted, further ensure that airport workers were trustworthy  and reduce risk, if not the need to physically screen workers.

Nonetheless, officials at  some airports we visited said that the added cost is warranted and have  independently required security training for their airport employees that  work in sterile areas to increase awareness of their security  responsibilities. Among other things, security training teaches airport  workers their responsibility to challenge suspicious persons who are not  authorized to be in secured areas (an area included in TSA airport covert  testing programs).

We randomly selected probability samples from the  study populations of airport workers who underwent a fingerprint-based  criminal history record check in the period between January 1, 2003, and  the date in which we selected our sample or December 31, 2003,  whichever was earlier. With these probability samples, each member of  the study populations had a nonzero probability of being included, and  that probability could be computed for any member. Each sample element  selected was subsequently weighted in the analysis to account statistically  for all the members of the population at each airport. Because we followed  a probability procedure based on random selections at each airport, our  samples are only one of a large number of samples that we might have  drawn. Since each sample could have provided different estimates, we  express our confidence in the precision of our particular samples\u2019 results  as 95 percent confidence intervals (e.g., plus or minus 7 percentage  points). These are the intervals that would contain the actual population  value for 95 percent of the samples we could have drawn. As a result, we  are 95 percent confident that each of the confidence intervals in this  report will include the true values in the respective study populations.", "Further, we interviewed TSA headquarters officials in Arlington, Virginia,  and from the Office of Internal Affairs and Program Review, Office of  Aviation Operations, Office of Chief Counsel, Credentialing Program  Office, Office of Aviation Security Measures, and officials from the Office  of Technology in Atlantic City, New Jersey, to discuss the agency\u2019s efforts  to address perimeter and access control security. We also spoke with  officials from two aviation industry associations\u2014the American  Association of Airport Executives and Airports Council International\u2014to  obtain their views on the challenges associated with improving perimeter  and access control security. We also interviewed airport vendors to  determine the need and feasibility of requiring all vendors to develop their  own security programs.", "We conducted our work between June 2003 and March 2004 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: GAO\u2019s Risk Assessment Model and TSA\u2019s Tools to Implement a Risk Management Approach", "paragraphs": ["Risk management is a systematic and analytical process to consider the  likelihood that a threat will endanger an asset, an individual, or a function  and to identify actions to reduce the risk and mitigate the consequences of  an attack. Risk management principles acknowledge that while risk  cannot be eliminated, enhancing protection from existing or potential  threats can help reduce it. Accordingly, a risk management approach is a  systematic process to analyze threats, vulnerabilities, and the criticality  (or relative importance) of assets to better support key decisions. The  purpose of this approach is to link resources with efforts that are of the  highest priority. Figure 4 describes the elements of a risk management  approach.", "Figure 5 illustrates how the risk management approach can guide decision  making and shows that the highest risks and priorities emerge where the  three elements of risk management overlap.", "For example, an airport that is determined to be a critical asset, vulnerable  to attack, and a likely target would be at most risk and, therefore, would  be a higher priority for funding compared with an airport that is only  vulnerable to attack. In this vein, aviation security measures shown to  reduce the risk to the most critical assets would provide the greatest  protection for the cost.", "According to TSA, once established, risk management principles will drive  all decisions\u2014from standard setting to funding priorities and to staffing.  TSA has not yet fully implemented its risk management approach, but it  has taken steps in this direction. Specifically, TSA\u2019s Office of Threat  Assessment and Risk Management is in various stages of developing four  assessment tools that will help assess threats, criticality, and  vulnerabilities. TSA plans to fully implement and automate its risk  management approach by September 2004. Figure 6 shows TSA\u2019s threat  assessment and risk management approach.", "The first tool, which will assess criticality, will determine a criticality  score for a facility or transportation asset by incorporating factors such as  the number of fatalities that could occur during an attack and the  economic and sociopolitical importance of the facility or asset. This score  will enable TSA, in conjunction with transportation stakeholders, to rank  facilities and assets within each mode and thus focus resources on those  that are deemed most important. TSA is working with another Department  of Homeland Security (DHS) office\u2014the Information and Analysis  Protection Directorate\u2014to ensure that the criticality tool will be  consistent with DHS\u2019s overall approach for managing critical  infrastructure.", "A second tool\u2014the Transportation Risk Assessment and Vulnerability  Tool (TRAVEL)\u2014assesses threats and analyzes vulnerabilities at those  transportation assets TSA determines to be nationally critical. The tool is  used in a TSA-led and -facilitated assessment that will be conducted on the  site of the transportation asset. The facilitated assessments typically take  several days to complete and are conducted by TSA subject matter  experts, along with airport representatives such as operations  management, regulatory personnel, security personnel, and law  enforcement agents. Specifically, the tool assesses an asset\u2019s baseline  security system and that system\u2019s effectiveness in detecting, deterring, and  preventing various threat scenarios, and it produces a relative risk score  for potential attacks against a transportation asset or facility. Established  threat scenarios contained in the TRAVEL tool outlines a potential threat  situation including the target, threatening act, aggressor type,  tactic/dedication, contraband, contraband host, and aggressor path. In  addition, TRAVEL will include a cost-benefit component that compares  the cost of implementing a given countermeasure with the reduction in  relative risk to that countermeasure. TSA is working with economists to  develop the cost-benefit component of this model and with the TSA  Intelligence Service to develop relevant threat scenarios for transportation  assets and facilities. According to TSA officials, a standard threat and  vulnerability assessment tool is needed so that TSA can identify and  compare threats and vulnerabilities across transportation modes. If  different methodologies are used in assessing the threats and  vulnerabilities, comparisons could be problematic. However, a standard  assessment tool would ensure consistent methodology.", "A third tool\u2014the Transportation Self-Assessment Risk Module   (TSARM)\u2014will be used to assess and analyze vulnerabilities for assets  that the criticality assessment determines to be less critical. The self- assessment tool included in TSARM will guide a user through a series of  security-related questions in order to develop a comprehensive security  baseline of a transportation entity and will provide mitigating strategies for  use when the threat level increases. For example, as the threat level  increases from yellow to orange, as determined by DHS, the assessment  tool might advise an entity to take increased security measures, such as  erecting barriers and closing selected entrances. TSA had deployed one  self-assessment module in support of targeted maritime vessel and facility  categories.", "The fourth risk management tool that TSA is currently developing is the  TSA Vulnerability Assessment Management System (TVAMS). TVAMS is  TSA\u2019s intended repository of criticality, threat, and vulnerability  assessment data. TVAMS will maintain the results of all vulnerability  assessments across all modes of transportation. This repository will  provide TSA with data analysis and reporting capabilities. TVAMS is  currently in the conceptual stage and requirements are still being gathered."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to those named above, Leo Barbour, Amy Bernstein,  Christopher Currie, Dave Hooper, Thomas Lombardi,   Sara Ann Moessbauer, Jan Montgomery, Steve Morris, Octavia Parks,   Dan Rodriguez, and Sidney Schwartz were key contributors to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
