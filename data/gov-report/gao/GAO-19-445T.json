For example, to meet the capacity criterion, an agency needs to demonstrate that it has the capacity (i.e., people and other resources) to resolve its management weaknesses. While Indian Affairs, BIE, BIA, and IHS each made progress identifying capacity and resources to partially meet this criterion, BIE and IHS continue to face significant workforce challenges. Specifically, although BIE has conducted hiring in recent years as part of an effort to reorganize the bureau, about 50 percent of all BIE positions have not been filled according to recent BIE documentation.

We added this area to our High-Risk List in February 2017  because of our concern about the ability of agencies within these  departments to manage (1) education and health care programs that  serve tribes and their members and (2) Indian energy resources. In  particular, our prior work found numerous weaknesses in how Interior\u2019s  Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) and Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA)\u2014 under the office of the Assistant Secretary- Indian Affairs (Indian  Affairs)\u2014managed education and energy resources and how HHS\u2019s  Indian Health Service (IHS) managed health care services. We reported  that these management weaknesses jeopardized the health and safety of  American Indians served by these programs and limited opportunities for  tribes and their members to use energy resources to create economic  benefits and improve the well-being of their communities. We expressed  continued concerns about challenges faced by these agencies in our  2019 High-Risk Report.", "In 2016, Congress found in the Indian Trust Asset Reform Act that  \u201cthrough treaties, statutes, and historical relations with Indian tribes, the  United States has undertaken a unique trust responsibility to protect and  support Indian tribes and Indians.\u201d As further stated in that act, the  fiduciary responsibilities of the United States to Indians arise in part from  commitments made in treaties and agreements, in exchange for which  Indians surrendered claims to vast tracts of land. The act notes that this  history of federal-tribal relations and understandings has benefitted the  people of the United States and established \u201cenduring and enforceable  ederal obligations to which the national honor has been committed.\u201d  Agencies can improve the efficiency of federal programs under which  services are provided to tribes and their members by making  improvements to their management and oversight of such programs.", "Such improvements would be consistent with the expressed view of  Congress as to the federal government\u2019s trust responsibilities and would  strengthen confidence in the performance and accountability of the  federal government.", "The focus of this high-risk area is on management weaknesses within  federal agencies that administer programs that serve tribes and their  members. However, not all federal programs are administered by federal  agencies. In accordance with federal Indian policy that recognizes the  right of Indian tribes to self-government and that supports tribal self- determination, a number of tribes have elected to take over the  administration of certain federal programs and services from BIA, BIE,  and IHS. Our recommendations identified in the high-risk area are neither  reflective of the performance of programs administered by tribes nor  directed at any tribally operated programs and activities.", "When we added the federal management of programs that serve tribes  and their members to our High-Risk List in February 2017, we cited 39  open recommendations related to this high-risk area.

Since 1990, a total of 62 different areas have appeared on  the High-Risk List. Of these, 26 areas have been removed, and 2 areas  have been consolidated. On average, the high-risk areas that were  removed from the list had been on it for 9 years after they were initially  added.", "Our experience with the High-Risk List over the past 29 years has shown  that the key elements needed to make progress in high-risk areas are  top-level attention by the administration and agency leaders grounded in  the five criteria for removing high-risk designations, which we reported on  in November 2000. When legislative and agency actions, including those  in response to our recommendations, result in our finding significant  progress toward resolving a high-risk problem, we will remove the high- risk designation. However, implementing our recommendations alone will  not result in the removal of the designation, because the condition that led  to the recommendations is symptomatic of systemic management  weaknesses. In cases in which we remove the high-risk designation, we continue to closely monitor the areas. If significant problems again arise,  we will consider reapplying the high-risk designation. The five criteria for  removing high-risk designations are as follows:", "Leadership commitment. Demonstrated strong commitment and top  leadership support to address the risks.", "Capacity. Agency has the capacity (i.e., people and other resources)  to resolve the risk(s).", "Action plan. A corrective action plan that defines the root causes,  identifies solutions, and provides for substantially completing  corrective measures in the near term, including steps necessary to  implement solutions we recommended.", "Monitoring. A program has been instituted to monitor and  independently validate the effectiveness and sustainability of  corrective measures.", "Demonstrated progress. Ability to demonstrate progress in  implementing corrective measures and in resolving the high-risk area.", "These five criteria form a road map for efforts to improve and ultimately  address high-risk issues.

Indian Affairs\u2019 leaders have demonstrated commitment to  addressing key weaknesses in the management of BIE schools in  several ways. For example, the BIE Director formed an internal  working group, convened meetings with other senior leaders within  Indian Affairs, and publicly stated that his agency is committed to  ensuring implementation of our recommendations on Indian  education. In addition, the BIE Director and other Indian Affairs  leaders and senior managers have met with us frequently to discuss  outstanding recommendations, actions they have taken to address  these recommendations, and additional actions they could take. We  also met with the new Assistant Secretary-Indian Affairs, who  expressed her commitment to supporting the agency\u2019s efforts to  address weaknesses in the management of BIE schools. However, it  is important that Indian Affairs leaders be able to sustain this level of  commitment to solving problems in Indian education. Since 2012,  there have been seven Assistant-Secretaries of Indian Affairs and five  BIE Directors. There has also been leadership turnover in other key  offices responsible for implementing our recommendations on Indian  education. We have previously reported that leadership turnover  hampered Indian Affairs\u2019 efforts to make improvements to Indian  education. We believe that ensuring stable leadership and a  sustained focus on needed changes is vital to the successful  management of BIE schools.", "Energy. BIA officials demonstrated leadership commitment by,  among other things, meeting with us to discuss the agency\u2019s progress  in addressing our recommendations. In June 2018, a permanent  Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs was confirmed. This action  provided an opportunity to improve Indian Affair\u2019s oversight of federal  actions associated with energy development. According to the BIA  Acting Director and the Acting Director for Trust Services, BIA held a  number of meetings with the Assistant Secretary to discuss agency  action plans for our recommendations. However, BIA does not have a  permanent Director, and BIA\u2019s Office of Trust Service\u2014which has  significant responsibility over Indian energy activities\u2014does not have  a permanent Director or Deputy Director. We have seen turnover in  these leadership positions as officials have been brought in to  temporarily fill these roles. As officials are brought in temporarily,  previously identified plans and time frames for completing some  activities have changed, and BIA has found itself starting over on the  process to identify or implement corrective actions.", "Health Care.

This  official has played a key role in coordinating the agency\u2019s  implementation efforts and has provided us with regular updates on  the status of these efforts. BIE has also conducted hiring in various  offices in recent years as part of a 2014 Secretarial Order to  reorganize the bureau. For example, it has hired school safety  officers and personnel in offices supporting the oversight of school  spending.

Moreover, the agency reported that it has not filled the position of  Chief Academic Officer, a top-level BIE manager responsible for  providing leadership and direction to BIE\u2019s academic programs.  Furthermore, BIE has not completed a strategic workforce plan to  address staffing and training gaps with key staff, which we previously  recommended. Such a plan is important to allow BIE and other Indian  Affairs offices to better understand workforce needs and leverage  resources to meet them. In February 2019, BIE drafted a strategic  workforce plan and reported it is currently gathering feedback on the  plan from internal stakeholders.

Overall, Indian  Affairs\u2019 efforts since we issued our High-Risk List update in February  2017 represent a significant increase in activity implementing our  recommendations. Substantial work, however, remains to address  our outstanding recommendations in several key areas, such as in  accountability for BIE school safety and school construction projects.  For example, Indian Affairs has not provided documentation that the  inspection information its personnel collect on the safety of BIE  schools is complete and accurate. As of late February 2019, 12  recommendations related to this high-risk area remain open and  Indian Affairs concurred with all 12 recommendations. For a full  description of the status of these open recommendations, see in table  1 in appendix I.", "Energy. BIA has shown significant progress developing data  collection instruments and processes needed to track and review  response times for a number of different actions associated with  energy development. For example, in our June 2015 report, we  recommended that BIA take steps to improve its geographic  information system (GIS) capabilities to ensure it can verify ownership  in a timely manner. We closed this recommendation as BIA has  made significant progress in enhancing its GIS capabilities by  integrating map-viewing technology and capabilities into its land  management data system. In addition, we recommended that BIA  take steps to identify cadastral survey needs. BIA\u2019s enhanced map- viewing technology allows the bureau to identify land boundary  discrepancies, which can then be researched and corrected. To  address the recommendation, BIA identified unmet survey needs that  were contained within the defunct cadastral request system. BIA  developed a new mechanism for its regions and agency offices to  make survey requests and a new database to maintain survey  requests. In fall 2018, BIA completed enhancements to TAAMS that  will allow the agency to track time frames and status of oil and gas  revenue-sharing agreements-called communitization agreements  (CA) through the review process. BIA held training on the  enhancements in November 2018 and requested staff input  information on any newly submitted CAs in the system. In a meeting  on February 25, 2019, the Acting Director of BIA said that BIA had  also completed efforts to modify TAAMS, incorporating the key  identifiers and data fields needed to track and monitor review and  response times for oil and gas leases and agreements. We believe  these actions show significant progress in addressing management  weaknesses associated with outdated technology and data limitations  for tracking and monitoring the review and approval of energy related  documents.
