Charter schools are generally designed to operate with more autonomy from state and local rules and regulations than are other public schools. In exchange for this autonomy, charter schools are held accountable for meeting the terms of their charters, which may include achieving stipulated academic outcomes. Schools that do not meet the terms of their charters face revocation of their charters.", "Although state and local revenues primarily finance public schools, the federal government provides several billion dollars annually to help public schools educate our children.

In addition, under the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), the federal government will provide about $4.2 billion to help schools pay for providing a free appropriate public education to children with disabilities.", "Although the title I and IDEA programs are designed to help public schools, concerns were raised during 1997 congressional hearings about whether public charter schools receive the share of these funds for which they are eligible.

In school year 1996-97, over 100,000 students were enrolled in nearly 500 charter schools in 16 states and the District of Columbia. Most charter schools are newly created; about 33 percent were converted from existing public schools, and about 11 percent were converted from existing private schools, according to the Department of Education.Figure 1 shows the states with charter school laws as of September 1997 and the number of charter schools operating in the 1996-97 school year by state.", "Both the Congress and the administration have supported charter schools. For example, in amending ESEA in 1994, the Congress established a grant program to support the design and implementation of charter schools. In addition, under the Goals 2000: Educate America Act, states may use federal funds to promote charter schools. The administration proposed doubling the roughly $50 million made available under the new ESEA charter school grant program in fiscal year 1997 to $100 million for fiscal year 1998; the Congress ultimately increased funding for the program to $80 million. Finally, in his 1997 State of the Union Address, the President called for the establishment of 3,000 charter schools nationwide by the next century.", "To explore the effects of education reform efforts, in January 1997, the Congress began holding hearings in Washington, D.C., and around the country. The Congress has focused on developing charter schools, among other reform efforts. Charter school operators and others at the hearings raised concerns about charter schools\u2019 receiving the share of federal title I and IDEA grant funds for which they are eligible. Recent research conducted by the Department of Education and the Hudson Institute raised similar concerns. Although dozens of financial aid programs exist for public elementary and secondary schools, two programs, title I and IDEA, are by far the largest federal programs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Title I Program", "paragraphs": ["Title I is the largest federal elementary and secondary education aid program. The Department of Education administers title I, which received about $7.4 billion in federal funding in fiscal year 1998.

Nationwide, the Department makes about $800 available on average to LEAs for each child counted in the title I allocation formula.", "Under title I, the federal government awards grants to LEAs through state educational agencies (SEA), which administer the grants and distribute the funds to LEAs. About 90 percent of the funds the Congress appropriates are distributed as basic grants; about 10 percent are distributed as concentration grants, awarded to LEAs serving relatively higher numbers or percentages of children from low-income families.", "To receive title I funds, SEAs must submit title I plans to the Department of Education. SEAs may submit these plans to Education separately or as part of a consolidated plan incorporating several federal education programs.", "Title I plans must explain how a SEA will operate its title I programs and demonstrate that a state has established or is developing state content and student performance standards as well as describe assessment systems used to measure schools\u2019 progress in meeting state standards. Moreover, state plans must describe how the SEA will help each LEA and school affected by the title I plan develop the capacity to comply with state standards. Once the plan is approved, the SEA is eligible to receive title I funds, and the plan remains in effect as long as a state participates in the program. SEAs must periodically update plans, however, to reflect substantive changes or as required by the Department of Education.", "To be eligible for title I funds received by the state, federal statutory and regulatory guidelines require LEAs to meet minimum poverty thresholds. To be eligible for basic grants, an LEA generally must have enrolled at least 10 children from low-income families, and low-income children must constitute more than 2 percent of its school-aged population. To be eligible for concentration grants, LEAs generally must have enrolled more than 6,500 children from low-income families, or more than 15 percent of their students must be from low-income families.", "LEAs that receive title I funds and have more than one school in their district have some discretion in allocating these funds to individual schools. LEAs must rank their schools according to the percentage of children from low-income families enrolled in each school. LEAs must use the same poverty measure in ranking all their schools, but the title I statute provides four measures from which LEAs may choose. LEAs must serve, in order of poverty, their schools that have more than 75 percent of their students from low-income families. After serving these schools, LEAs may then serve additional title I-eligible schools, in order of poverty, with remaining funds. LEAs do not have to allocate the same per poverty student amount to each school in the district. LEAs must allocate, however, a higher or equal per poverty student amount to schools with higher poverty rates than they allocate to schools with lower poverty rates.

The act requires, among other things, that states make such education available to all eligible children with disabilities in the least restrictive environment. The Congress appropriated approximately $4.2 billion for the program for fiscal year 1998. According to Department of Education officials, these funds are expected to provide, on average, about $639 per student for services provided to the nearly 5,951,000 eligible students aged 3 through 21, plus an additional $650 per student to provide services for approximately 575,800 eligible preschool children aged 3 through 5.", "Under the current formula, the Department of Education annually allocates funds to SEAs on the basis of their reported numbers of eligible children receiving special education and related services for the preceding fiscal year, the national average per pupil expenditure, and the amount the Congress appropriates for the program. The most funding that a state may receive for any fiscal year is capped at 40 percent of the national average per pupil expenditure multiplied by the number of eligible children with disabilities in the state who receive special education and related services. The IDEA Amendments of 1997 provide that each state will receive its prior fiscal year allocation when the Congress appropriates more than $4,924,672,200 for IDEA part B; 85 percent of the remaining funds will be allocated to states on the basis of each state\u2019s relative population of children aged 3 through 21 who are the same age as children with disabilities for whom the state ensures the availability of a free appropriate public education; the remaining 15 percent of these funds will be allocated on the basis of each state\u2019s relative population of these children living in poverty.", "To receive funds, a state must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Secretary of Education that it has in effect policies and procedures to ensure that it meets certain specified conditions. The conditions that states must meet include, among others, the availability of a free appropriate public education to all children with disabilities living in the state. In reauthorizing IDEA, the Congress added additional provisions specifically for charter schools. In particular, LEAs must now demonstrate to their SEAs that they serve children with disabilities attending charter schools in the same way they serve children with disabilities in their other schools and that they provide IDEA part B funds to charter schools in the same way they do to their other schools.", "Under the current formula, states must distribute at least 75 percent of the IDEA funds they receive from the Department to LEAs and may reserve the rest for state-level activities. In general, SEAs allocate IDEA funds to eligible LEAs on the basis of their relative share of their state\u2019s total number of eligible children receiving special education and related services.

These other agencies include, for example, regional educational service agencies authorized by state law to develop, manage, and provide services or programs to LEAs. Some states allocate IDEA funds to regional educational service agencies for providing special education and related services to children with disabilities enrolled in the schools of one or more LEAs, including charter schools.

The second approach involves states allocating title I and IDEA funds to charter schools through existing parent LEAs; California and Colorado use this approach. Charter schools, along with other public schools in the district, then receive their share of funds or services from their parent LEAs. The third approach for allocating funds to charter schools involves a mixture of the first and second approaches. In general, a charter school in a state using this approach receives federal funds directly from the SEA\u2014and thus is treated as an LEA\u2014if the school was chartered by a state agency or through a parent LEA\u2014if the school was chartered by a district or substate agency. States using this model include Arizona, Michigan, and Texas.(App. III provides more details on the seven states\u2019 federal funding allocation procedures.)", "Under these three approaches, individual charter schools are generally allocated funds on the basis of their treatment as either (1) an independent LEA or school district (called the independent model) or as (2) a dependent of an LEA\u2014that is, as a public school part of an existing school district (called the dependent model).

The federal statute and regulations specify complex criteria and conditions that LEAs use in deciding how to allocate funds to their schools, which results in shifting title I funds received by LEAs to individual schools with relatively higher percentages of students from low-income families. An individual school that is part of an LEA in a high-poverty area therefore might have to have enrolled a higher percentage of low-income children to receive title I funds than it would need if the school were treated as an independent LEA. In this case, a charter school that would have received title I funds as an independent LEA may not receive title I funds under the dependent model because other schools in the LEA might serve higher percentages of low-income children.", "The benefits that individual schools may receive from IDEA funds vary by state.

Charter schools in that state negotiate individually with their parent LEAs the terms under which the school will receive IDEA funds or special education and related services for children with disabilities enrolled in the school.

Title I funding for these schools ranged from $96 to $941 per poverty student; the average school value was $466 per poverty student, and the median value was $413.

A variety of factors caused these barriers, including (1) a lack of prior year\u2019s enrollment data, (2) problems collecting student eligibility data, and (3) the timing involved for a school\u2019s charter being issued and deadlines for submitting student eligibility and enrollment data. These barriers particularly troubled newly created charter schools. Charter schools converted from traditional public schools generally did not have these problems when current enrollment was at or near full capacity and title I eligibility had already been established.", "In its July 1997 report, the Hudson Institute noted that states typically allotted title I funds to schools on the basis of the previous year\u2019s enrollment of title I-eligible students, which resulted in \u201cleaving start-up charters completely stranded for their first year.\u201d In our survey of charter school officials, three officials told us that because they had no prior year\u2019s enrollment or student eligibility data, state guidelines made their schools ineligible for federal funds. Two of the three respondents that had this problem were officials of newly created schools; the third respondent represented a charter school that had been converted from a private institution. Department of Education officials told us that they believe most of the problems \u201cstart-up\u201d charter schools had in accessing federal program funds were due to not having such enrollment data to submit to state officials.", "Other such start-up eligibility problems also presented some barriers to schools. For example, some officials noted that their schools are incrementally increasing the number of grades served as the original student body progresses. One school official told us that, while the school now serves grades 9 and 10, it will eventually serve grades 9 through 12. In addition, officials we surveyed at other schools were implementing a similar growth strategy. In these cases, a 1-year lag in reported enrollment data\u2014reflecting past rather than current enrollment\u2014may significantly affect the amount of federal funding for which a school may be eligible. For example, one charter school official we spoke with told us that next year she will receive title I funds on the basis of this year\u2019s enrollment of about 100 students. She anticipates, however, that enrollment will increase almost 50 percent next year and that the school will be eligible for additional title I funding for about 40 newly enrolled students. But because of the time lag in reporting data, the school will have to wait until the following year for the additional funds. Over time, as enrollment stabilizes, these problems will lessen for schools.", "In addition, charter school officials reported difficulty in collecting student eligibility data required to receive title I funds. In some states, school officials must collect data on students\u2019 family incomes to establish eligibility for federal funds. Some officials told us that because of privacy concerns, some families hesitate to return surveys sent home with students that ask for household income levels. One official told us that he believed parents may not understand that such data are used to establish the school\u2019s eligibility for federal grant funds.", "In another case, a charter school official told us that verifying student eligibility data was a barrier in accessing funds because the process was time consuming. In this case, charter school officials had to manually match their student enrollment records with state and local Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) records to verify student eligibility. The business administrator for the school told us that it took him and another staff person approximately 2 full days to manually match the records for the approximately 1,000 students enrolled in his charter school.", "Another charter school official told us that timing issues prevented her from accessing federal funds: She said that her school\u2019s charter was approved after the deadline had passed for the state allocation of title I funds to LEAs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Charter School Operator Workload Demands", "paragraphs": ["Even though researchers at the Hudson Institute and the Department of Education found that financing issues were a significant concern for charter schools, several charter school officials told us that the time and cost involved in accessing federal funds and complying with program requirements exceeded the benefits that could be obtained; therefore, they did not pursue these funds.

Another said that if she receives anything in the mail with the words \u201ctitle I\u201d on it, she throws it away because she has so little time to attend to such matters.", "Although a majority of the charter school operators who expressed an opinion in our survey believed that the title I and IDEA application processes were only somewhat or not at all difficult, some operators told us that, nonetheless, it was not worth their while to pursue these funds.

In addition, according to the Hudson Institute, charter school operators were often unaccustomed to the business and administrative aspects of running a charter school and with filling out forms for state and federal categorical programs. Moreover, because charter schools represent new and additional responsibilities for districts and state agencies that oversee and administer federal programs, according to state and district officials, it has taken some time to develop new policies and procedures to accommodate charter schools; therefore, these policies and procedures may not have been available when charter schools were authorized.", "In our interviews with charter school operators, some cited their lack of experience with the title I and IDEA programs as a barrier to accessing these funds. One operator told us that she did not know that IDEA funds may be available to her school to help pay for the costs of educating the school\u2019s students with disabilities. According to another operator, although the state had mailed her information and application materials for the title I program, the amount of information was overwhelming and appeared designed for large, traditional school districts and thus discouraged her from reviewing the materials and applying for funds. She told us that, eventually, her school accessed these funds because a friend who operated his own charter school convinced her that she was forgoing a significant amount of funding. According to other operators we spoke with, they found title I and IDEA application procedures difficult but that having completed the process once, they expected to encounter fewer difficulties when they applied for such funding again.", "One of our site visits revealed that a lack of established allocation policies and procedures created barriers for charter schools. For example, the business administrator at a charter school we visited told us that accessing funds required many visits and phone calls to district officials to understand the allocation processes and procedures as well as to negotiate a fair share of federal funding for his school. According to district officials we spoke with, because their school district had approved and issued several charters to individual schools with varying degrees of fiscal autonomy, working out allocation issues has taken some time. These officials noted that they have limited time and resources for developing new policies and procedures for charter schools, especially because the number of charter schools and their student populations constitute a small portion of their overall operations.", "In addition, some state officials said that charter schools presented them with new administrative responsibilities and that they had to reexamine title I laws and regulations to determine the extent of their administrative flexibility under the program. According to one state official, for example, she was uncertain whether a state could reserve title I funds from her state\u2019s allotment specifically to provide funding for charter schools during their first year of operation. An education official in Arizona told us that because most charter schools in that state are considered independent districts, the state\u2019s education department\u2019s workload has significantly increased.

Arizona abandoned the use of projections to fund first year schools because of objections resulting from reallocating funds using actual information. The state now reserves 1 percent of its federal title I allocation and uses these funds as well as any funds available for reallocation to serve new school districts (including charter school LEAs). The amount of title I funding granted per eligible student varies by the student\u2019s county of residence. Schools chartered by a local district are considered member schools of that district and, until recently, had to receive title I funds through this district. On the basis of a recent ruling by the state\u2019s Attorney General, Arizona has decided to allow schools chartered by local school districts to apply for title I funds directly to the state and will receive funds from the state if eligible.", "The state uses a similar approach for allocating IDEA funds. Schools chartered by one of the state boards are considered LEAs; schools chartered by a local school district are considered a member of that district. LEA charter schools determine the number of eligible students on the basis of students with an individualized education program (IEP). Schools may either apply to the state directly or apply jointly with other LEAs. Eligible expenses are billed to the state and reimbursed up to a school\u2019s allocation.
