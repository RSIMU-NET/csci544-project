When establishing BPAs under schedule contracts, agencies must follow procedures regarding the number of vendors considered, request discounts, and conduct annual reviews in accordance with requirements. This report assesses selected agencies' use of schedule BPAs and evaluates whether they considered more than one vendor when establishing BPAs and placing orders under them, took opportunities for savings, and conducted annual reviews. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed a sample of 336 schedule BPAs and 352 fiscal year 2007 orders and met with officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2008, civilian agencies obligated $3.2 billion under schedule BPAs--up 383 percent from fiscal year 2004. GAO estimates that DOD's obligations ranged from $0.5 to $4.7 billion, placing total obligations in 2008 between $3.7 and $7.9 billion. GAO was unable to determine more fully DOD's obligations because DOD does not utilize fields in the federal procurement data system to distinguish schedule BPAs from other BPAs. DOD has begun to take actions to address this issue. Civilian agencies' use of BPAs for services grew significantly faster--475 percent--than their overall services contracting between 2004 and 2008. Contracting officers use BPAs for flexibility and speed, noting, for example, advantages in disaster response preparation and when funding for a fiscal year is unknown. Of the BPAs GAO reviewed, 64 percent had been competed--meaning, for purposes of this report, that more than one vendor was considered--when established. For 12 percent of BPAs that had not been competed, contracting officers provided a variety of justifications, some of which appear inconsistent with sound procurement policy. The FAR is not clear about justification requirements for BPAs awarded with limited competition, including to one vendor. Also, the majority of BPAs had been awarded to a single vendor, which resulted in a lack of competition when placing orders because the FAR does not currently require competition of orders under single award BPAs. Multiple award BPAs--awarded to more than one vendor for the same requirement--provide an opportunity to benefit from further competition when placing orders, but many contracting officers placed orders directly with one vendor without further competition. Congress recently enhanced competition requirements for multiple award contracts, but the application of this requirement to schedule BPAs has not yet been established. Some of the BPAs GAO reviewed had lengthy durations, exceeding 5 years. GAO found no evidence that agencies sought discounts when 47 percent of the BPAs reviewed were established. In the other cases, some contracting officers explicitly requested, or even demanded, discounts, while others merely encouraged them. Agencies frequently received discounts when they requested them. For instance, the Justice Department was able to save $20 million under a BPA where the contracting officer requested and received discounts. However, at times, such opportunities were missed when discounts were not requested, even when the estimated amount of the BPA was in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Contracting officials rarely conducted the required annual reviews. The reviews for only 19 of the 320 BPAs that required them addressed all of the FAR elements. By not conducting annual reviews, agencies miss opportunities for savings and can run the risk of violating competition requirements. One contracting officer was unaware that the underlying GSA schedule contract had expired, and orders continued to be placed under the BPA--a potential violation of the Competition in Contracting Act."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Federal contracting officers can choose from a variety of contracting  mechanisms when buying goods and services.

The General  Services Administration\u2019s (GSA) Schedules program is an interagency  contracting mechanism used by many federal agencies. Under this  program, GSA awards contracts to multiple vendors for commercially  available goods and services and federal agencies place orders under the  contracts. Agencies may establish blanket purchase agreements (BPA)  under GSA\u2019s schedule contracts. BPAs are intended to be a simplified  method of fulfilling repetitive needs for supplies and services that also  provide an opportunity to seek reduced pricing from vendors\u2019 schedule  prices.

The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) was amended in  2004 to require agencies to follow certain procedures when establishing  and ordering from schedule BPAs and to document annual reviews to  determine: whether each BPA still represents the best value; whether the  GSA schedule contract under which the schedule BPA was established is  still in effect; and whether the agency has exceeded its initial estimated  purchase amount under the BPA, indicating a potential for discounts when  more orders are placed.", "You expressed interest in understanding more about federal agencies\u2019 use  of schedule BPAs. Accordingly, we assessed (1) the extent to which  agencies use schedule BPAs, what they buy with them, and why agencies  use them; (2) whether agencies are competing BPAs and the orders under  them; (3) whether agencies are taking advantage of opportunities for  savings by seeking discounts when using these BPAs; and (4) whether  agencies are conducting the required annual reviews.", "To conduct our work for each objective, we used an electronic data  collection instrument to review 336 schedule BPAs and the largest fiscal  year 2007 order under each, the most recent available data at the time we  began our work. Our scope included five civilian agencies and three  defense agency locations. We reviewed 263 BPAs from the following  agencies: the departments of Agriculture, Health and Human Services,  Homeland Security, and Justice and the Social Security Administration.  These agencies represented roughly 80 percent of the civilian dollars  obligated under schedule BPAs in fiscal year 2007, based on data provided  by GSA from the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation  (FPDS-NG), the government\u2019s primary database for information on  procurement actions. Because the Department of Homeland Security  (DHS) had obligated the largest dollar amount, we selected all 155 of the  department\u2019s BPAs under which orders were placed during fiscal year  2007. Therefore, our findings reflect the full universe of DHS schedule  BPAs used in fiscal year 2007. We selected a random sample of 30  schedule BPAs from each of the other four civilian agencies; our findings  for those agencies are projectable to those agencies. We were unable to  review 12 of the BPAs in our sample because some agencies could not  locate the files.", "Because the Department of Defense (DOD) does not use available codes in  FPDS-NG to identify its schedule BPAs, our methodology for selecting the  defense locations (discussed in app. I) was more complex. We reviewed a  random sample of 29 BPAs used by the Marine Corps Systems Command,  30 from the Naval Air Systems Command, Naval Air Warfare Center, and  all 14 of the schedule BPAs the Air Force District of Washington used  during fiscal year 2007. Our findings are projectable only to the DOD  locations selected.", "To assess the extent to which agencies are using schedule BPAs, we  analyzed data from FPDS-NG for fiscal years 2004 to 2008 for civilian  agencies. For DOD, given the data limitation discussed above, we  constructed an estimate of its fiscal year 2008 usage based on our analysis  of 100 randomly-selected procurements that we identified as BPAs using  DOD\u2019s contract naming system. We identified, via DOD\u2019s online contract  retrieval system, those in our sample that were in fact schedule BPAs and  applied this percentage to DOD\u2019s total spending under BPAs in general.", "For each objective, we supplemented our file reviews with follow-up  questions when documentation in the file was insufficient. When agency  officials did not respond to our questions or did not provide  documentation that supported their response, we report these responses  as providing no evidence. We also spoke with over 60 contracting officials  across the agencies in our review about their use of schedule BPAs.  Moreover, we spoke with officials from GSA to discuss the agency\u2019s role  with respect to schedule BPAs and FAR requirements for competition,  discounts, and annual reviews.

Subpart 8.4 of the FAR provides procedures for using GSA schedule  contracts, including establishing and ordering from BPAs. Prior to the  issuance of the FAR in 1984 as the governmentwide procurement  regulation, \u201cblanket purchase arrangements,\u201d a vehicle similar to BPAs,  were permitted to be established with schedule contractors, if not  inconsistent with the terms of the schedule contract, as early as the 1950s.", "Schedule BPAs use the pre-established terms and conditions of the GSA  contract (such as prices and delivery terms) as a starting point, but  ordering agencies may add terms and conditions, such as discounted  pricing, as long as they do not conflict with those of the GSA contract.  Each schedule BPA must address the frequency with which orders will be  placed; invoicing procedures; discounts; delivery locations; time and  requirements, such as the amount or quantity the agency expects to  purchase under the BPA and the work the vendor will perform. The  potential volume of orders under a BPA, as indicated by the estimated  amount or quantity, provides an opportunity to seek discounts from the  GSA schedule contract prices.", "From the first issuance of the FAR until 1994, agencies establishing  schedule BPAs were required to follow the simplified acquisition  procedures of Part 13, which emphasized \u201cadequate\u201d or \u201cmaximum  practicable competition\u201d at the time orders were placed. From 1994 until  1997, the FAR and subsequent GAO bid protest decisions indicated that  the policies and procedures of Part 13 did not apply to schedule BPAs and  that agencies were to follow the procedures of Subpart 8.4 for placing  orders on schedule BPAs, but not for their establishment. Beginning in  1997, the FAR applied the ordering procedures in Subpart 8.4 to the  establishment of schedule BPAs, including such steps as considering  information about the supply or service offered under schedule contracts  or reviewing the catalogs of schedule contractors. It also encouraged  agencies to seek discounts when establishing schedule BPAs. A 2004  amendment to the FAR clarified the BPA ordering procedures under  Subpart 8.4 and explicitly required agencies to seek discounts.", "The FAR currently requires federal agencies to seek price reductions from  vendors\u2019 schedule prices and to follow certain procedures when  establishing schedule BPAs. Which procedures are to be followed depends  on whether the BPA will be used to purchase a product or service  performed for a fixed price or for a service performed at an hourly rate,  and thus requiring a statement of work. Procedures for establishing  schedule BPAs and seeking discounts are depicted in figure 1.", "Agencies may award a schedule BPA to a single vendor or to multiple  vendors to fulfill the same requirement. The decision is to be based on a  strategy that is expected to maximize the effectiveness of the BPA(s). The  FAR states that, in determining how many BPAs to establish, contracting  officers are to consider:  the scope and complexity of the requirement(s);  the need to periodically compare multiple technical approaches or prices;  the administrative costs of BPAs; and  the technical qualifications of the schedule contractors.", "After the BPA is established, requirements vary for considering more than  one vendor when placing orders, as shown in table 1.", "DOD is required to adhere to more stringent competition requirements  than are at present applicable to civilian agencies. Section 803 of the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 directed DOD to  amend its regulations to require that any purchase of services exceeding  $100,000 under a multiple award contract be made on a competitive basis,  subject to limited exceptions. DOD\u2019s implementation of this provision  extended the competition requirement to orders under multiple award  BPAs. Hence, for such orders exceeding $100,000, DOD contracting  officers are required to either (1) notify as many schedule contractors as  practicable of the purchase to reasonably ensure that offers would be  received from at least three contractors and receive three offers (or  determine in writing that no additional contractors could be identified that  can fulfill the requirement) or (2) notify all contractors offering the  required services under the applicable schedule and afford all responding  contractors a fair opportunity to submit an offer and have that offer fairly  considered.

Civilian agencies reported spending almost $3.2 billion under  schedule BPAs, with the five civilian agencies in our review obligating  almost $2.3 billion of this amount, or almost 72 percent of total civilian  agency obligations. Although orders under schedule BPAs (for goods and  services) comprised only about 2.3 percent of civilian agencies\u2019 reported  obligations during fiscal year 2008, usage of schedule BPAs by civilian  agencies has grown substantially over time, by 382 percent from fiscal year  2004 to 2008 ($659 million to $3.2 billion).", "We were unable to develop similar trend information for DOD due to the  data\u2019s being unavailable, but for fiscal year 2008, we estimate that DOD  obligated between $0.5 billion and $4.7 billion under schedule BPAs.  Unlike civilian agencies, DOD does not use the available fields in FPDS-NG  to distinguish its schedule BPAs from its traditional BPAs and indefinite  delivery contracts. Therefore we could not readily determine DOD\u2019s  overall usage of schedule BPAs or what DOD is buying under these BPAs.  We attempted to use data from DOD\u2019s own procurement database (the  DD350 database) and information from defense agency officials to identify  schedule BPAs, but found additional inaccuracies. For example, we  identified possible schedule BPAs for several Army organizations with  obligations totaling roughly $319.8 million in fiscal year 2007. However,  after further review and consultation with Army officials, we found that  only about 16 percent of this amount had actually been obligated under  schedule BPAs.

Other examples of goods purchased through schedule BPAs in  our sample include:    special purpose boats purchased by the Coast Guard for various law    body armor purchased by the Air Force;  laboratory equipment and supplies purchased by the Department of Health  and Human Services; and  fire engines purchased by the Forest Service."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies Used BPAs for Flexibility, Speed, and to Meet Small Business Goals", "paragraphs": ["In addition to saying they use schedule BPAs to fulfill recurring needs,  many of the contracting officials we spoke with cited BPAs\u2019 flexibility and  the speed with which they can be used as reasons they chose to use them  as opposed to other contract vehicles, such as indefinite delivery  contracts. Several contracting officials noted that schedule BPAs do not  require the government to commit to any minimum dollar obligation or  amount, as would an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract. For  example, a contract specialist at DHS\u2019s Immigration and Customs  Enforcement explained that his office does not receive funding, and  therefore cannot obligate funds, until the budget is passed; in recent years,  this has occurred during the second quarter of the fiscal year. Using a  schedule BPA allows his office to be ready whenever it receives funds.  Also, a contracting officer at FEMA said that she can establish a schedule  BPA and have it ready for use when the agency has to respond to natural  disasters and to conduct recovery operations without having to guarantee  a minimum amount. However, some contracting officials noted that the  lack of a binding contract can be a potential negative, since a vendor can  decline to accept an order. One contracting official at the Marine Corps  said that he prefers to have multiple BPA holders to ensure that vendors  are available to meet the demand for goods and services.", "Contracting officers also indicated that the speed with which they can  both establish BPAs and place orders under them is an advantage. For  example, a contracting officer at the Marine Corps noted that schedule  BPAs do not take a long time to negotiate because the solicitation process  is streamlined and contracting officers are not required to advertise the  solicitation on FedBizOpps, the Web site where government business  opportunities greater than $25,000 are posted. As a result, he said it usually  takes him a month or less to establish a schedule BPA, whereas it  frequently takes him 3 to 4 months to award an indefinite delivery  contract. Some contracting officers also told us that the ability to place  BPA orders without competition is an advantage in terms of time saved.  For example, a contracting officer at the Centers for Disease Control  noted that a schedule BPA that has a broad scope of work makes it  unnecessary to conduct a time-consuming competition each time he wants  to place an order. A contracting officer at the Food Safety and Inspection  Service stated that she can place orders under a single award BPA without  further competition in less time than would be needed to meet the  competition requirements for ordering directly from a GSA schedule  contract.", "Some agencies also use schedule BPAs to help meet their small business  goals. A contracting officer at the Social Security Administration told us  that he uses schedule BPAs in part because there are many companies on  the GSA schedule that meet the requirements of the Small Business  Administration\u2019s 8(a) business development program.

The FAR  specifically lists some examples of circumstances in which limited  competition may be justified, including instances when (1) the work is  unique or specialized in nature and only one source is capable of  responding; (2) the new work is a logical follow-on to a previous  requirement; or (3) an urgent and compelling need exists. In assessing  agencies\u2019 rationale for awarding BPAs directly to vendors without  competition, we found justifications for doing so that were based on each  of these circumstances. For example:    Agencies purchased software from vendors who were the sole authorized  vendors holding a GSA schedule contract.", "The Social Security Administration awarded a BPA for program  management, technical management, and administrative support because  it was a logical follow-on to previous work.", "The Coast Guard awarded a BPA to bridge the gap between the expiration  of one contract and the competitive award of the next contract.", "In addition, we found four instances in which schedule BPAs were issued  directly to one vendor because the vendor was designated as a small  business or as an Alaska Native Corporation-owned business.", "However, we also found examples of justifications for awarding BPAs  directly to one vendor that are not specifically mentioned in the FAR,  some of which may not conform with sound procurement policy. A Navy  contracting officer stated that it was not necessary to compete a BPA for  engineering and technical services because GSA had already determined  the vendor\u2019s schedule pricing to be fair and reasonable. In two instances  at the Justice Department, the contracting officer in one case stated that  the vendor had performed well on a previous BPA, and in the other, that  the vendor provided a deep discount.", "We discussed the lack of clarity regarding the applicability of FAR  provisions regarding limiting competition when establishing BPAs with  officials from the Office of Federal Procurement Policy.

Contracting officers competed 49 percent of the orders above the  micropurchase threshold with more than one vendor under the multiple  award BPAs we reviewed. For 32 percent of the orders, contracting  officers placed the order directly with one vendor and did not compete it  with other vendors, the appropriate number effectively being one.

In  another instance, two BPAs awarded to the same vendor highlight the  importance of requesting discounts. A contracting officer requested a  discount when establishing a Navy BPA for analytical support services,  and the vendor provided a 5 percent discount from its GSA schedule  prices. In contrast, when establishing a different BPA for similar services  from the same vendor, the contracting officer did not seek or receive a  discount. If he had done so and received the same 5 percent discount  applied to orders placed during the life of the BPA, the Navy would have  saved almost $87,000.

In some cases, their rationale for not  seeking discounts was based upon the statement in the FAR that GSA has  already determined prices in the underlying schedule contract to be \u201cfair  and reasonable.\u201d However, this FAR statement addresses the fact that  ordering activities are not required to conduct additional price analyses  when ordering supplies and services not requiring a statement of work  under the GSA schedule contracts. It does not negate the requirement to  seek discounts when establishing schedule BPAs, which is clearly stated in  FAR Subpart 8.4. One contracting officer said that using competition when  establishing the BPA is the more significant determining factor for pricing,  and thus he did not focus specifically on requesting discounts.", "Contracting officers who did request a discount usually included such  language in the solicitation when establishing the BPA. In some cases, the  contracting officer even made the offer of a discount a condition for  awarding the BPAs\u2014in effect, demanding a discount. For example, the  request for quotation for two Navy BPAs stated, \u201cQuoted prices, inclusive  of fees must be discounted below GSA schedule prices.\u201d The Department  of Agriculture included the following statement in the request for  quotation for one BPA: \u201cProvide a proposed discount off your normal GSA  schedule rates for the entire BPA period of performance.\u201d The Air Force  stated the following: \u201cthe contractor is expected to offer their (sic) best  prices at or below the schedule price list.\u201d In other cases, the request for a  discount was more tentative. For example, the solicitation for a FEMA  BPA stated, \u201cthe Government requests that you consider offering a  discount percentage beyond the GSA Schedule pricing\u2026\u201d In a few  instances, the contracting officer requested discounts via email or during  negotiations. For example, a DHS contracting officer requested discounts  during negotiations to establish a schedule BPA to provide technical  support services to the Office of Immigration Statistics.", "The discounts agencies received when establishing BPAs varied widely.  Vendors sometimes offered a single, flat rate discount for all items offered  under the BPA, but we found it was more common for vendors to offer a  range of discounts, with some goods or services more heavily discounted  than others. Vendors\u2019 flat rate discounts usually fell between 1 and 10  percent. For instance, the Air Force obtained a 10 percent discount when  establishing an estimated $99 million BPA to obtain advisory and  assistance services. Some discounts were larger. DHS, for example,  received a 76 percent flat rate discount on a $22 million BPA established to  purchase software and services. When vendors provided ranges of  discounts, the minimum discount was most often between zero and  10 percent, while maximum discounts were more dispersed, with a  majority ranging up to 30 percent. Some BPAs included discounts that  varied by volume, while others included discounts that varied according to  the product or service offered. For example, under a Department of  Agriculture schedule BPA for software and associated maintenance, the  vendor provided discounts ranging from 5 percent on a single order up to  $250,000 to 20 percent on a single order over $1 million. The Social  Security Administration received discounts ranging from 15 percent off  labor rates to 91 percent off software under one of its schedule BPAs used  to purchase software, maintenance, consulting services, and training.  Figure 4 demonstrates the wide range of discounts received by each of the  agencies in our sample."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Discounts Rarely Sought and Received for Orders", "paragraphs": ["In addition to requesting a discount at the time the schedule BPA is  established, agencies can request additional discounts when they issue  orders, although the FAR does not require them to do so. The agencies in  our review infrequently requested discounts when placing orders. Of the  352 orders we reviewed, agencies clearly requested discounts for 51 of  them. Contracting officers indicated that their rationale for not seeking  additional discounts when placing orders was the fact that pricing was  already established at the time the BPAs were awarded. As with discounts  at the time a BPA is established, we found that agencies were more likely  to receive discounts when they specifically requested them than when they  did not. In some cases, agencies had negotiated discounts when  establishing the schedule BPAs and were also able to obtain further  discounts for orders. In the Department of Justice example noted above, in  which the vendor provided an 18 percent discount for the BPA, the  contracting officer received an additional 10 percent discount for a $6.3  million order, saving $630,000. A vendor also provided an additional  45 percent discount for a $2.6 million order under a BPA for which the  Social Security Administration had already received discounts when the  BPA was established, resulting in a dollar savings of over $1 million. As an  illustrative example of the potential for savings, had the contracting officer  in another case we reviewed negotiated even a 2 percent discount for a  BPA with an estimated amount of $205 million, it would have saved nearly  $4 million based on obligations under this BPA from its establishment in  2005."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agencies Generally Did Not Comply wit the Annual Review Requirement and Missed Oppo for Savings", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Few Contracting Officers Conducted Complete Annual Reviews", "paragraphs": ["Contracting officers conducted annual reviews that addressed all of the  required FAR elements for only 19 of the 320 BPAs in our sample that  required an annual review.

For example, when we asked if an annual  review had been conducted, one contracting official at FEMA asked to  which FAR requirements we were referring.", "In 63 additional instances, agencies did not complete all of the required  elements of the annual review. In some cases, these reviews occurred  while the contracting officers were conducting other activities associated  with the BPAs. One contracting officer at the Department of Agriculture  conducted a best value assessment when exercising an option year and  verified that the GSA schedule contract was still in effect but did not  document whether the original estimated BPA amount had been  exceeded. In a case from the Department of Justice, a contracting officer  verified that the GSA schedule contract was still in effect when issuing  modifications to the BPA, but did not address any of the other required  elements of the annual review. In other cases, contracting officers cited  parts of the FAR outside of Section 8.4 when conducting their annual  reviews and in doing so often did not complete required elements. When  conducting annual reviews following sections of the FAR other than Part  8, contracting officers often did not verify that the underlying schedule  contract was still in effect or check to see if obligations under the BPA had  exceeded the estimated amount. Some also failed to conduct a best value  assessment that would inform decisions about whether the BPA should be  continued. In seven cases, contracting officers at the Department of  Agriculture and the Coast Guard documented annual reviews using FAR  Section 13.303, which covers traditional BPAs, but did not make sure that  the GSA schedule contract was still valid and did not determine whether  the estimated amounts of the BPAs had been exceeded. In four other  cases, contracting officers cited FAR Part 17 when conducting an annual  review, which includes requirements for the exercise of options. In  another case, a contracting officer cited FAR Section 16.702, which covers  basic agreements.", "We found only two contracting activities that regularly conducted some  sort of annual review. Contracting officers at DHS\u2019s Citizenship and  Immigration Services conducted annual reviews for 10 of the agency\u2019s  schedule BPAs we reviewed, although not all contained each of the  required elements. The head of the contracting office attributed the  consistency to an extremely low staff turnover rate as well as a mandatory  back-up system that ensures that staff members\u2019 workloads are always  covered. In addition, all but one of the BPA files we reviewed at NIH  contained some form of annual review, although, again, not all elements  were always covered.

In some of the instances in which contracting officers conducted annual  reviews, they determined that the schedule BPAs still represented the best  value to the government in a variety of ways. For example, an annual  review for a Health and Human Service BPA noted that the BPA still filled  an existing need and provided continuity of service. A contracting officer  managing a Marine Corps BPA checked that prices were still reasonable,  while other annual reviews assessed whether market conditions had  changed since the BPA was established. A contracting officer at the Social  Security Administration used an annual review to obtain discounts. While  conducting the review, he determined that the original estimated amount  had been exceeded and successfully obtained discounts from the vendor.  Contracting officers also informed us of instances in which conducting  annual reviews helped them to better manage schedule BPAs. One  contracting officer stated that when conducting annual reviews, she has  occasionally found that prices for the schedule BPA have escalated, which  led her to cease using those BPAs.", "By not doing the annual reviews, contracting officers missed opportunities  for additional savings. For some of the BPAs in our sample, the BPA  amount originally estimated had been exceeded, but because annual  reviews were not conducted, agencies missed opportunities to obtain  discounts. For instance, orders under a BPA established by the Marine  Corps exceeded the BPA\u2019s estimated amount within the third year of a 10- year period of performance.

BPAs established under the schedule  contract using the procedures of Subpart 8.4 are considered to be issued  using full and open competition. Thus, orders properly placed under a  valid schedule contract, whether directly or via a BPA, meet the  requirements for competition under the Competition in Contracting Act  (CICA) of 1984. In the absence of a valid schedule contract, any order  placed using a schedule BPA does not meet those competition  requirements, unless the procedures used to obtain the order  independently satisfy the CICA requirements. Accordingly, if the  underlying schedule contract has expired, subsequent orders using the  schedule BPA may not be valid. We found one instance in which CICA was  potentially violated among the BPAs and orders we reviewed.  The  underlying schedule contract for a Defense Logistics Agency BPA, under  which the Navy placed an order in our sample, had expired. Although the  Navy considered more than one schedule vendor when placing the order,  this situation still involves a potential CICA violation because the  underlying schedule contract had expired by the time the order was placed  and it is not clear that statutory requirements for full and open  competition were otherwise met."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Schedule BPAs can provide federal agencies with a flexible and  streamlined contracting mechanism for meeting repetitive procurement  needs. However, especially in light of the significant increase in  obligations under schedule BPAs, these potential benefits must be  balanced with ensuring that this mechanism is used appropriately and  serves the best interests of the government and the taxpayer. Based on the  failure of contracting officers across the agencies in our review to leverage  competition, seek better pricing through discounts, and monitor the use of  schedule BPAs by conducting annual reviews, it is apparent that those  interests are not being met in many cases. This is particularly true for  procedural requirements when establishing and ordering under schedule  BPAs that require the consideration of multiple vendors. The high use of  single award BPAs, under which no further competition is required when  placing orders of any amount, reduces the potential to harness the benefits  of competition, including additional savings for the taxpayer. And the  FAR\u2019s lack of clarity about the circumstances under which agencies can  limit the number of vendors considered when establishing schedule BPAs,  including establishing them with only one vendor, can lead to situations,  such as we found, where justifications appear inconsistent with sound  procurement policy. Further, the fact that so many contracting officers are  either unaware of the requirement for annual reviews or simply are not  conducting them means that opportunities are being missed to ensure that  competition requirements are met and to seek better pricing from vendors.

We next looked  at the Army\u2019s Tank-Automotive and Armaments Command (TACOM) in  Warren, Michigan. Because many of the BPAs used by TACOM were not  available in EDA, we asked TACOM officials to identify which of the BPAs  were schedule BPAs. They identified only 7 out of 63 BPAs as schedule  BPAs. We next looked to the Army Contracting Command in Kuwait; an  Army contracting official told us that all 76 of their BPAs were not  schedule BPAs. Finally, we contacted the Army\u2019s Contracting Center of  Excellence in Washington, D.C. to ask officials there to identify the  schedule BPAs from a list of 50 candidates.

To do so, we converted the data into fiscal year 2008 constant dollars  using the Bureau of Economic Analysis price index for services in the  federal consumption expenditures category. To determine why agency  officials chose to establish and use schedule BPAs rather than other  contracting vehicles, we interviewed contracting officials across the  agencies included in our review about their use of schedule BPAs.

From that  universe, we selected a random sample of BPAs. We used the EDA, DOD\u2019s  online contract retrieval system, to review the BPAs. In the event that a  BPA was not available in EDA, we replaced it with the next BPA on our  list until we had 100 BPAs. In the three instances in which the  documentation in EDA was insufficient to make a determination as to  whether the BPA was a schedule BPA, we contacted the agency for  clarification. In two of these instances, the contacting officer did not  respond, and we replaced the BPAs with the next on our list. Next, we  obtained data from FPDS-NG on the amount obligated using orders under  these BPAs during fiscal year 2008.

We reviewed BPA files to  determine whether the requirement was competed when the BPA was  established and when an order was placed by determining whether more  than one vendor had been contacted. We also identified the ordering  procedures in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the Defense  Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) and the level of  competition required under them. We discussed with contracting officials  what factors were considered when deciding to establish single vs.  multiple award BPAs.

If there was no GSA schedule data in the BPA file  or the file suggested that the schedule contract had expired, we searched  the GSA website (GSA e-Library) to determine whether the GSA schedule  contracts were still in effect. For those schedule contracts that were no  longer listed on GSA e-Library, we contacted GSA to obtain  documentation of either the date the schedule contract expired or the  current expiration date.
