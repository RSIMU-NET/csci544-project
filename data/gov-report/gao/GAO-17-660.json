According to stakeholders, some states are using ESSA's flexibilities to significantly change their accountability systems while others are making more limited changes. Changes stakeholders discussed pertained mostly to four key components (see figure). GAO visited California and Ohio and these two states reported using ESSA's flexibilities to distinguish between levels of school performance, among other things. For example, Ohio plans to assign letter grades to schools on each of six performance indicators. Under Ohio's proposal, schools will also receive overall letter grades beginning in 2018. California plans to distinguish performance with grades for performance on each of six state indicators. Their proposed system will not provide overall scores for schools.

We also visited state  educational agencies, school districts, and a total of four state  stakeholder groups in California and Ohio. (See appendix I for a list of the  national and state stakeholder groups with whom we met.) We selected  California and Ohio because they were among the states that national  stakeholder groups cited as being illustrative of different state approaches  to developing their proposed accountability systems. In each state, we  visited three school districts that had schools in each grade span\u2014 elementary, middle, and high schools\u2014and varied in size and geographic  location. These states provide illustrative examples of how two states are  revising their accountability systems in response to ESSA, and are not  generalizable to the 50 states.

One stakeholder said, for example, that ESSA \u201cthreads  the needle very well\u201d between giving states flexibility in designing their  accountability systems and placing requirements on states to help ensure  that all children have an opportunity to get a good education. Most  stakeholders also mentioned ESSA provisions related to developing  performance indicators as an example of flexibility. One stakeholder, for  example, saw, these provisions as flexible because they allow states to  define the exact indicators they will use, including indicators that measure  student growth in addition to student proficiency when assessing  academic performance.", "Representatives of four national stakeholder groups that have worked  directly with states to help them develop and revise their accountability  systems told us that the extent to which states are revising their  accountability systems varies because some states are satisfied with their  current systems and others are using the flexibilities in the law to make  significant overhauls. According to representatives of one stakeholder  group, for example, many states already began revising their  accountability systems as a result of waivers Education granted under the  previous reauthorization, the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLBA).  They further said that ESSA is generally flexible enough for states to  continue down the path they started in implementing their NCLBA  waivers. In addition, representatives of several stakeholder groups  mentioned that for states that see their current accountability systems as  lacking in some way, or because consultation with state stakeholders has  pointed to the need for significant change, ESSA provides room for them  to consider innovative revisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ohio\u2019s and California\u2019s Approaches to Incorporating ESSA Provisions into Their Accountability Systems", "paragraphs": ["Ohio and California, the two states we visited, illustrate how different  states are using the flexibilities in ESSA to develop accountability  systems that are tailored to meet state needs as well as ESSA  requirements for each of the four key components of state accountability  systems: determine long-term goals, develop performance indicators,  differentiate schools, and identify and assist low performers. (See  sidebars for summaries of ESSA requirements for these components.)", "Highlights of Selected ESSA  Requirements: Long-Term Goals  ESSA requires states to design and establish  ambitious long-term goals, including  measurements of interim progress toward  meeting them. For example, states are to set  goals for all students, and separately for each  subgroup of students, for improved academic  achievement and high school graduation  rates, among other things.  Student subgroups include economically  disadvantaged students, students from major  racial and ethnic groups, children with  disabilities, and English learners.", "Ohio officials told us that they chose a 10-year timeline for meeting their  long-term goals to help address stakeholder concerns about providing  schools and districts sufficient time to meet the new goals. For example,  one of Ohio\u2019s proposed goals is that at least 80 percent of students score  proficient or higher on Ohio\u2019s statewide assessments in English  Language Arts and math within 10 years. Meeting this goal may be easier  for some schools and groups of students than others, as some are further  away from the goal than others. To close this \u201cachievement gap,\u201d the  state plans to set its proficiency goals for each student subgroup such  that those groups furthest behind will be expected to make greater annual  gains in an effort to catch up over the 10-year period. Further, in an  effort to make the 10-year long-term goals achievable for lower- performing groups, the state\u2019s draft plan proposes to set the 10-year  proficiency goals for them lower than the 10-year goals for higher- performing subgroups. Ohio state officials and stakeholders told us that  some stakeholders were concerned about having different goals for  different subgroups: Some find the annual or long-term goals for low  performing subgroups too ambitious and others find it problematic that  certain students would be held to different standards than others. State  officials said to meet the ESSA requirement of having ambitious long-term  goals, they designed their approach to significantly close the achievement  gap over 10 years. At the time of our work, Ohio was still working on its  final approach to address this issue.", "According to California\u2019s draft plan, California plans to achieve its goals  within 5 to 7 years\u2014a timeframe that coincides with regularly scheduled  reviews of the performance indicators used in its accountability system.  Unlike Ohio, California is proposing that schools and districts propose  their own interim goals to close achievement gaps and that the same  timeline for long-term goals (5 to 7 years) apply to all student subgroups.  State officials mentioned that district interim goals must take into account  the current performance of student subgroups and how far this  performance is from the state\u2019s long-term goals.", "Highlights of Selected ESSA  Requirements:  Indicators  States are required to annually measure, for  all students and for student subgroups, four  \u201cacademic\u201d indicators. These indicators  include academic achievement for all public  schools, as measured by proficiency on the  annual state assessments, and the four-year  adjusted cohort graduation rate for public high  schools, among other things.  In addition, states are also required to have,  for all public schools, at least one statewide  indicator of school quality or student success  that meets certain criteria. This indicator may  include measures of student and educator  engagement, student access to and  completion of advanced coursework,  postsecondary readiness, school climate and  safety, or any other indicator the state  chooses that meets the requirements in the  law.", "Ohio officials told us that they plan to use their current indicators as the  foundation for meeting ESSA\u2019s requirements for academic indicators, and  make some revisions or refinements as needed. With regard to ESSA\u2019s  required indicator of school quality or student success, state officials said  they plan to include chronic absenteeism because studies show that  school attendance is strongly correlated with successful student  performance. Because the state already collects attendance data, the  indicator also reduces the need for additional data collection. Ohio  officials and stakeholders said that ESSA has prompted many substantive  conversations about what to use for the school quality or student success  indicator. For example, Ohio stakeholders and a school district official told  us that they have concerns about using chronic absenteeism as a  measure because schools and districts cannot control whether students  come to school and that other indicators might be beneficial measures.  State officials mentioned that in response to these concerns, Ohio\u2019s draft  plan now includes a commitment to pilot a school climate survey for  potential inclusion as an indicator of school quality or student success in  future years.", "Although California\u2019s draft plan proposes using its existing indicators to  meet ESSA\u2019s requirements for academic indicators, the state also plans  to develop some new ones. For example, as an additional academic  indicator, the state proposes to use chronic absenteeism. According to its  draft plan, there is a strong correlation between strong academic  performance and school attendance. For the school quality or student  success indicator, California chose suspensions, with high rates  indicating poor quality and failure, and low rates indicating success. State  officials said that ESSA flexibilities allowed them to differentiate what was  considered high and low rates of suspension by grade level (i.e.,  elementary, middle, and high school). They explained that this is  important because it allows them to tailor the indicator for each level.", "Differentiate Schools (distinguishing between levels of performance) accountability system, including the four  academic indicators, for all students and  for each subgroup of students; and  include differentiation of any school in  which any subgroup of students is  determined by the state to be consistently  under-performing.", "Ohio officials told us that they propose to continue to use the state\u2019s  current system of six indicators, with modifications, to assess school and  student performance. Under the proposal, schools would receive a letter  grade on each indicator. Some of the indicators, such as academic  achievement, would measure current performance while other indicators,  such as academic progress, would measure growth. Ohio state officials  told us that they also intend to roll up indicator scores into an overall letter  grade for schools in 2018. They said that reporting a letter grade on each  indicator provides detailed information, while an overall letter grade  provides an easily understandable overview of performance. Ohio  stakeholders and school district officials expressed concerns about both  the use of letter grades and rolling up grades on each indicator into an  overall score. They explained that words, such as meets or exceeds  expectations, could more accurately communicate performance than  letter grades.", "California officials said they plan to distinguish performance of schools  and student subgroups by using a dashboard in which school and student  subgroup performance would be color-coded based on each of six state  indicators. These officials said that each indicator measures current  student performance as well as changes in performance over time. Unlike  Ohio, California does not plan to aggregate the indicators into overall  scores for schools and student subgroups. California officials told us that  they chose their approach for two reasons. First, aggregating scores on  indicators into an overall score can mask individual areas where a school  may be struggling. In contrast, reporting individual indicators allows key  distinctions to be maintained in performance across a variety of factors.  Second, officials said that measuring performance in both the current  year and over time on each indicator provides a more complete picture of  performance.", "Ohio state officials told us that their processes for identifying low  performing schools (known in Ohio as priority schools) and schools with  underperforming subgroups (known in Ohio as focus schools) will be  similar to the process they used under their NCLBA waiver and will  include new indicators, such as chronic absenteeism as one indicator of  school quality or student success. Furthermore, Ohio officials in one  district discussed a requirement in ESSA that they believe will improve  Ohio\u2019s system of intervening in low-performing schools and subgroups\u2014 that states establish criteria for how schools can exit certain ESSA  improvement categories. As part of meeting this requirement, these  officials said that Ohio is developing benchmarks for graduation rates and  student growth indicators, which they said should make it clear to districts  when they can release schools from improvement categories. addition, states are to notify each school  district about schools in which any  subgroup of students is consistently  underperforming, and ensure the district  provides notification to these schools.", "For each school identified, the school or  district is to develop and implement, in  partnership with stakeholders, either a  comprehensive support and improvement  plan or a targeted support and improvement  plan, as applicable, to improve student  outcomes. These plans must be informed by  all state indicators and include evidence- based interventions.  States are to, among other things, establish  statewide exit criteria for schools identified for  comprehensive support and improvement and  additional targeted support.", "California\u2019s draft state plan proposes to identify low-performing schools  and student subgroups based on where they fall on its dashboard of  color-coded performance indicators, and lists three options for how the  state may do this. Regarding assisting low-performing schools and  student subgroups, California state officials said they plan to give districts  the authority to develop interventions. California officials in one district  said that ESSA provides flexibility to reconsider how they provide school  interventions. They said, for example, that they can now provide an  intervention such as tutoring when they feel it will be most effective\u2014 before, during, or after the school day\u2014and that this was partly because  of ESSA."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Developing and Implementing State Monitoring Plans Is a Key Next Step for Education in ESSA Implementation", "paragraphs": ["Given current timelines, Education officials said that the department is  currently focused on the review and approval process for state plans and  providing assistance to states in developing their plans.

Education officials told us  that the peer reviewers will consider the technical, educational, and  overall quality of specific portions of state plans when making their  recommendations to the Secretary. According to guidance Education  provided to peer reviewers, another goal is for reviewers to provide states  with objective feedback on the technical, educational, and overall quality  of their plans.", "Education officials told us that they are developing monitoring protocols  that they will pilot with eight or nine states in early 2018.

The officials noted that they are piloting the protocols to  ensure that they have an appropriate monitoring tool to obtain information  on how states are implementing ESSA requirements. Officials told us that  Education used similar in-depth state reviews when developing past  monitoring protocols, reviewing a select number of states each year with  the goal of reviewing all states within a 3- to 4-year cycle. Given that  some states have submitted their state plans earlier than others for  approval, officials also noted that they will pilot the monitoring protocol in  states that progressed enough to warrant monitoring.

Education has provided assistance to states in a number  of ways. For example, the department hosted webinars on the state plan  template that states may choose to use, and on the peer review process.  Education has also implemented a technical assistance initiative called  the State Support Network to support state and district school  improvement efforts under ESSA. This network aims to connect states  and districts with technical assistance providers and subject matter  experts to develop strategies for supporting schools. According to the  network\u2019s website, it aims to help states and districts learn from prior  school improvement efforts, assess needs and assets to inform  strategies, and build sustainable systems to support continuous  improvement. During our review, representatives of most national  stakeholder groups with whom we spoke told us that states could use  guidance on a number of issues. One example of guidance that they told  us states might consider useful is identification of appropriate evidence- based interventions. As part of its ongoing assistance to states,  Education has addressed this topic in a number of ways, including non- regulatory guidance, resources via the State Support Network, and case  studies.", "ESSA requires states and Education to report annually on specific  aspects of ESSA implementation and states to submit significant changes  to their plans to Education for review (see sidebar for a summary of these  requirements). states to submit annual reports to the  Secretary of Education.
