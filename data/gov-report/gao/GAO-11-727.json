To report on TCB funding, the U.S. government conducts an annual survey of agencies and publicly reports the data in a TCB database administered by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). GAO examined (1) how agencies' TCB activities are aligned with the agencies' goals, (2) the extent to which the TCB database provides sufficient information on key trends and funding, and (3) the extent to which USAID monitors and evaluates the effectiveness of its TCB activities. GAO focused on the agencies that reported the most funding for TCB activities since 2005--the Departments of the Army and State, the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), and USAID--and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR). GAO analyzed U.S. government data; reviewed agencies' strategic, budget, and program documents; and met with U.S. and foreign government officials in select countries."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["USAID and State conduct TCB activities that are aligned with their primary goals, but TCB is secondary to the goals of other agencies. USAID and State have developed strategic plans that include TCB-focused goals. Aligned with these goals, USAID and State assist countries in negotiating and implementing trade agreements. In addition, USAID assists countries in taking advantage of economic growth opportunities stemming from trade, often in conjunction with other agency goals. TCB is not a primary focus of MCC and the Army, however, they conduct activities to meet their broader agency goals that have trade-related effects. MCC identifies trade-related assistance it considers TCB as part of its programs' poverty reduction goals. The Army implements TCB-related physical infrastructure projects as part of its disaster response objectives and in support of its reconstruction and economic development efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. The U.S. government TCB database has reported that annual TCB funding has increased from $1.35 billion in 2005 to $1.69 billion in 2010, but the database does not adequately describe certain factors underlying this growth and other significant changes in the composition of TCB funding. From 2005 to 2010, two agencies--MCC and the Army--began reporting significant TCB funding, primarily for physical infrastructure projects. Their funding comprised 54 percent of total TCB, and physical infrastructure projects comprised 45 percent of total TCB. However, the TCB database does not adequately explain significant factors driving changes in the composition of TCB funding. In particular, the annual TCB survey methodology attempts to identify and quantify just the trade-related components of projects, but this can be difficult in practice, particularly for physical infrastructure projects. Although GAO found the survey data to be generally reliable, these factors can lead to limitations in the data that are not described for its users. Clear reporting and transparent methodology and data collection are essential to understanding levels of funding and changes in the nature of TCB over time. USAID has improved its assessment of TCB activities, including developing performance indicators and taking the positive step of commissioning a multicountry evaluation of the effects of TCB, but it has yet to develop plans to make use of the evaluation's valuable insights. USAID uses trade and investment indicators to assess the immediate results of its TCB activities. However, officials explained that it is difficult to attribute trade-related trends revealed by the indicators to the effects of TCB assistance and collect valid and reliable data to measure progress. To assess longer-term results, USAID has commissioned evaluations of TCB programs in specific countries, but these are limited in number. It recently commissioned a multicountry evaluation of the long-term effectiveness of its TCB activities agencywide. While USAID is beginning to incorporate the evaluation's results in its training, it has yet to develop plans for disseminating best practices to missions and offices on the methods they may use to better manage and assess their activities. Furthermore, it has not made plans for conducting evaluations on an ongoing basis."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Administrator of USAID publicly report identified limitations and key distinctions in the categories of TCB assistance in the database.

Congress and the  executive branch have identified TCB assistance as an important tool for  U.S. trade and development policy based on evidence of the  effectiveness of trade in reducing poverty and generating economic  development and growth. According to the Office of the U.S. Trade  Representative (USTR), poverty rates for countries engaged in  international trade have fallen sharply over the last 20 years. In the  context of the ongoing Doha Development Agenda multilateral trade  negotiations of the World Trade Organization (WTO), WTO member  countries have recognized the impact of trade on development, including  the role that trade can play in reducing poverty, achieving economic  growth, and raising income levels. WTO members have also recognized  the importance of trade-related assistance for addressing the constraints  that limit the ability of developing countries and, in particular the least- developed countries, to fully benefit from trade and the rules-based  multilateral trading system. To respond to these concerns, in 2001 and  2005, the WTO affirmed the importance of TCB assistance and the  United States and other donors pledged continued support, respectively.  The U.S. government provides TCB assistance to help developing  countries worldwide build the physical, human, and institutional capacity  to participate in global trade. Multiple U.S. agencies have developed a  variety of programs that provide such assistance and support more than  100 countries. When we examined U.S. government TCB efforts in 2005,  we noted the importance of the linkages between trade and development  and recommended that more evaluation be performed to help ensure that  TCB activities are effective in helping countries benefit from trade. We  also cited the importance of evaluation in demonstrating that the capacity  building goals envisioned by the United States are being achieved.", "In response to your interest in U.S. TCB programs, this report examines  (1) how agencies\u2019 TCB activities are aligned with the agencies\u2019 goals, (2)  the extent to which the U.S. government TCB database provides  sufficient information on key trends and funding, and (3) the extent to  which the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) monitors  and evaluates the effectiveness of its TCB activities.", "To address these objectives, we analyzed available data from the U.S.  government TCB database, which is maintained by USAID and reports  annual TCB data using a governmentwide survey. We have assessed  these data as part of our previous and ongoing work and have  determined that they are sufficiently reliable to identify TCB funding by  agency, country, and category; although we found limitations to the use of  the data, as discussed in this report. We focused our review on TCB  activities provided by the Departments of the Army (Army) and State  (State), the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), and USAID, which  together have funded more than 90 percent of total U.S. TCB assistance  from fiscal years 2005 to 2010. In addition, we included USTR in our  focus due to its unique trade policy role. In conducting our work, we  analyzed strategic, budget, and programmatic documents describing  these agencies\u2019 TCB funding and activities. We reviewed data and  information these agencies use to measure the performance of their  activities and, where available, evaluations of programs or projects. We  conducted fieldwork in Colombia, Morocco, and Mozambique. We  selected these countries because they were among the 10 countries  receiving the most TCB funding from fiscal years 2005 to 2009. In  addition, we sought a mix of U.S. agencies providing assistance in- country and the categories of assistance provided, as well as geographic  diversity. In each country we reviewed agencies\u2019 strategy documents, and  performance plans and reports. We also interviewed agency officials, host  government officials, and contracted implementing partners and visited  TCB projects.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2010 through July 2011 in  accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate  evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives.

The United  States and other countries increasingly view TCB assistance as an  important tool in promoting economic growth and reducing poverty.  Expanding trade with and among developing countries can be a critical  driver of economic growth and poverty reduction because it encourages  entrepreneurship, human resource development, technology transfer,  technological innovation, and good governance.", "Developing countries have increasingly integrated into the global trading  system, and some of those countries have become important U.S. trading  partners. According to the World Bank, exports from developing countries  have grown twice as fast as those of high-income countries since 2000.  Moreover, imports in developing countries grew at almost twice the rate of  high-income countries. As a result, developing countries account for a  growing share of world imports. Furthermore, since 2000, many  developing countries have acceded to the WTO. Currently, about two- thirds of WTO members are developing countries or least-developed  countries. In addition, many developing countries have entered into free  trade agreements (FTA) with the United States. FTAs phase out barriers  to trade in goods with particular countries or groups of countries and  contain rules designed to improve access in services, investment, and  intellectual property rights.", "However, many developing countries\u2014in particular the least developed\u2014 face constraints that severely limit their ability to implement trade  agreements and benefit from trade. Many developing countries lack the  physical, institutional, or human capacity to participate effectively in global  trade. Additionally, developing countries sometimes lack the financial and  human resources to fulfill their trade commitments. USTR has indicated  that TCB assistance is important to enable developing countries to  negotiate and implement market-opening and reform-oriented trade  agreements. In addition, some view TCB assistance as important to  securing broad-based reforms across countries so that all countries  benefit from the trade rules negotiated in the WTO and in other trade  agreements. In 2001, the WTO Doha Ministerial Declaration advised that  technical assistance should be designed to assist developing, least- developed, and low-income countries to meet their WTO obligations, and  draw on the benefits of an open, rules-based multilateral trading system.  The WTO created the Doha Development Agenda Global Trust Fund to  help developing countries build capacity and establish a reliable basis for  funding WTO-related technical assistance. The 2005 Hong Kong WTO  Ministerial Declaration called for the expansion and improvement of this  type of assistance and set in motion a process to achieve this known as  the Aid-for-Trade Initiative. Partnering with the WTO on this initiative, the  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) jointly  created a database to provide comprehensive information on bilateral  donor and multilateral/regional agency support for TCB. The OECD has  issued a number of reports on aid-for-trade issues and attempts to share  good practices so that developing countries can capitalize on the  opportunities of international trade.", "To identify and quantify the U.S. government\u2019s TCB activities in  developing and transitional economies, USAID conducts an annual  survey on behalf of USTR. The data gathered from this survey are used  to inform and respond to inquiries from Congress, the executive branch,  the general public, and multilateral organizations such as the WTO.  USTR officials use the database regularly and, according to these  officials, it is a useful tool for identifying U.S. agencies\u2019 TCB activities and  funding in a particular country or region, as well as the full extent of  assistance the U.S. government provides in that area. USAID oversees a  contractor that collects and maintains the survey results in a publicly  available online database. The survey defines TCB and asks agencies to  place their assistance into a range of categories and estimate funding  obligated for each category (table 1 provides further information on these  categories). In addition to administering this survey, USAID is also tasked  with reviewing completed survey forms, and checking for accuracy and  consistency in the reporting of funding and allocation into TCB categories.  A variety of U.S. agencies have a role in providing TCB assistance,  including the Departments of State, the Army, Labor, the Treasury, and  Commerce; MCC; and USAID.", "In our 2005 report on U.S. TCB efforts, focusing on the period from 2001  to 2004, we found that U.S. TCB assistance was primarily a collection of  a variety of trade and development activities. We noted that 18 agencies  had self-reported that they obligated almost $2.9 billion for TCB activities  in more than 100 countries and that USAID provided 71 percent of overall  U.S. TCB assistance. We also found that the six agencies we reviewed  were neither systematically monitoring nor measuring program  performance in terms of TCB and recommended USAID and USTR  develop a strategy to systematically monitor and measure results and  evaluate effectiveness. In response, USAID, in consultation with USTR,  took steps to develop a multicountry evaluation to measure the  effectiveness of U.S. TCB assistance, which was issued in November  2010."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USAID and State Conduct TCB Activities Aligned with Their Primary Goals; TCB Is Secondary to Goals of Other Agencies", "paragraphs": ["Of the four agencies we reviewed that fund and implement TCB activities,  only USAID and State have strategic plans that include TCB-focused  goals.

(For  further information on USAID\u2019s planning of its TCB activities, see app. II.)  In 2003, USAID issued a formal strategic plan on TCB, to focus its TCB  efforts and guide the selection of new activities. The plan calls for  USAID\u2019s TCB projects to support the three primary objectives of helping  countries participate in trade negotiations, implement trade agreements,  and take advantage of trade opportunities. In addition, State supports  USAID\u2019s TCB efforts outlined in its strategy. The USAID and State joint  strategic plan for fiscal years 2007 to 2012 calls for supporting USAID\u2019s  strategic goal of providing assistance to help countries participate in and  benefit from trade agreement negotiations. We found that USAID and  State planned and provided assistance that supported TCB strategic  objectives. USAID also provided assistance that aligns with its April 2008  strategy for economic growth that includes the goals of (1) developing  well functioning markets in developing countries, primarily through  supporting policy and regulatory reforms and (2) strengthening the  international framework of policies and institutions that support countries\u2019  economic growth and opportunities by promoting international standards.", "USAID and State, in collaboration with other U.S. government agencies,  have provided TCB assistance as part of USTR-created TCB working  groups in developing countries where the United States is negotiating a  FTA. (For further information on interagency efforts to coordinate TCB  assistance, see app. III.) These working groups meet during the  negotiations to identify and select TCB activities that assist developing  country negotiating partners through regional and bilateral TCB programs.  In particular, TCB working groups were a feature of the bilateral  negotiations in support of the ratified Central America-Dominican  Republic Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) and Peru FTA, and the  signed FTAs with Colombia and Panama. For example:  \uf0b7  During the CAFTA-DR negotiations, USAID, State, and other U.S.  agencies helped to provide technical assistance to the Central  American countries to address a variety of trade capacity issues,  including the strengthening of plant and animal health and food safety  regulatory systems, and the strengthening of customs procedures.", "In conjunction with the U.S.-Colombian free trade negotiations a  USAID program assisted the government of Colombia in adopting and  implementing policy and regulatory reforms to facilitate the conclusion  and implementation of the FTA. The program included 18 components  of trade-related policy reforms that led to Colombia\u2019s development of  new regulations and procedures consistent with the FTA\u2019s  requirements. For example, the program supported the establishment  of a national food safety policy that ensured consistency with U.S.  sanitary and phytosanitary standards.", "In addition, USAID provided TCB assistance to support countries\u2019 efforts  to accede to the WTO. In fiscal year 2009, USAID provided TCB  assistance supporting the accession and membership of nine countries to  the WTO. USAID\u2019s activities supported foreign governments\u2019  implementation of regulatory reforms and the adoption of domestic  policies, laws, and regulations that align with international standards. For  example, under a 5-year joint-funded program with State, USAID  provided the government of Laos with legal and economic analysis of  needed reforms, particularly in the areas of services, and intellectual  property rights and standards.", "USAID and State have provided TCB assistance to support the  implementation of U.S. FTAs with developing country partners. The final  texts of FTAs, including CAFTA-DR, and the Peru FTA, have provisions  that created committees on TCB to assist partner countries in  implementing the trade agreements and adjusting to more liberalized  trade. USAID, State, and other U.S. agencies have provided TCB  assistance in support of the work of these committees. For example,  USAID\u2019s Regional Trade Program for CAFTA-DR provided training  relevant to compliance with the provisions of the CAFTA-DR agreement,  including training to some partner countries\u2019 foreign government officials,  judicial officials, and private sector representatives in the area of  intellectual property rights protections and investment regulations. The  program also strengthened CAFTA-DR partner countries\u2019 customs  operations and administration to meet international standards as well as  the FTA\u2019s provisions.", "USAID also conducts TCB activities with the objective of building the  capacity of firms to capitalize on the benefits of FTAs. For instance, in  2005, USAID created a program to provide technical assistance to  Moroccan firms in various sectors, including apparel, textiles, leather  footwear, and processed foods, with the goal of developing business  opportunities between the United States and Morocco under the U.S.- Morocco FTA. Under the program, Moroccan firms and trade associations  received technical assistance, including seminars and workshops on a  variety of trade-related topics such as sales planning, transport logistics,  and production standards and certification.", "USAID also assists countries in adopting requirements related to WTO  agreements, and supports countries seeking to benefit from regional  trade agreements. USAID funds and implements projects to help recipient  countries comply with WTO agreements in areas such as government  procurement, agriculture, the application of sanitary and phytosanitary  measures, and the agreement on intellectual property rights. In addition,  USAID provided technical assistance to address developing countries\u2019  capacities for meeting standards under regional trade agreements. For  example, a primary objective of USAID\u2019s Southern Africa Trade Hub is to  increase international competitiveness and intraregional trade in the  Southern African Development Community region.", "In addition, USAID provides TCB assistance in support of opportunities  provided under trade preference programs, most prominently the African  Growth and Opportunity Act of 2000 (AGOA). To help countries take full  advantage of increased trading opportunities under AGOA, USAID  provides TCB assistance primarily through trade hubs in East, West, and  Southern Africa and bilateral missions in sub-Saharan Africa. The trade  hubs assisted firms in taking advantage of opportunities under AGOA by  helping them develop market linkages, adapt products to the U.S. market,  and facilitate business deals. One trade hub also developed national  export strategies identifying countries\u2019 constraints and opportunities for  exporting under AGOA, and another trade hub conducted workshops to  help African firms and foreign government officials increase their  understanding of AGOA.", "In conjunction with objectives other than TCB, USAID conducts TCB- related activities that indirectly support TCB by helping countries take  advantage of trade-related economic opportunities. These activities aim  to address a wide range of development needs in the public and private  sectors. In conducting our fieldwork and research, we identified USAID  projects that missions conducted for various objectives in addition to TCB,  but that mission officials identified as achieving outcomes related to  international trade:  \uf0b7  The mission in Mozambique conducted a TCB-related agriculture  development program with the primary objective of increasing the  sustainability and profitability of the country\u2019s private sector to  strengthen rural income growth. While TCB was not an explicit  objective, as part of the program, USAID funded a commercial food  laboratory that provides screening services to reduce illnesses from  contaminated local food supplies, which also helped producers meet  quality standards for the export of commercial food products. \uf0b7  USAID implemented TCB-related programs in Colombia with the  primary objective of generating economic alternatives to illicit crop  production. However, the program also helped agricultural producers  expand sales, including exports, and assisted the government of  Colombia in implementing economic policies and institutional reforms  to enhance the competitiveness of the Colombian economy in  general, including those related to international trade.", "In Morocco, the mission conducted TCB-related activities aimed at  improving the general business environment and promoting broad- based economic growth, in part through a reduction in trade and  investment barriers. One TCB-related program provided technical  assistance in support of regulatory and legal reforms to promote  investment and enhance the general ease of doing business, for  instance. In addition, USAID implemented a program to improve the  productivity and competitiveness of certain agricultural products,  including those for export."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TCB Is Secondary to the Goals of MCC and the Army", "paragraphs": ["Other agencies we reviewed do not have TCB-focused strategic goals,  but conduct activities that have trade-related effects and that are  considered TCB to fulfill their broader mission goals. While 23 other U.S.  agencies, in addition to USAID, reported funding for TCB-related activities  from fiscal years 2005 to 2010, MCC, in particular, reported obligating  almost half of total U.S. government TCB funding over this period. In  addition, over the same period, the Army reported obligating the fourth  largest amount of funding for TCB among U.S. agencies, following MCC,  USAID, and State. However, MCC and the Army do not have strategic  plans and goals that specifically relate to TCB, but sometimes conduct  TCB-related activities to fulfill their strategic and agency mission goals.  MCC generally identifies TCB-related activities as part of its poverty  reduction goals in its 5-year country compacts and threshold programs,  although TCB is not an explicit objective. The Army conducts trade- related physical infrastructure projects, such as roads and  telecommunications projects, that it reports as TCB to respond to its  emergency and disaster response objectives in Afghanistan and in  support of its reconstruction efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan.", "Although from 2005 to 2010 MCC reported obligating the largest amount  of TCB-related assistance funding of any U.S. government agency\u2014 approximately $4.7 billion, or 65 percent, of its total assistance\u2014MCC  does not fund TCB-related activities for the specific objective of TCB,  according to officials. It funds TCB activities as part of its larger mission to  reduce poverty and stimulate economic growth through its compact  agreements, and to help countries address policy weaknesses through its  threshold programs. MCC provides monetary assistance through  multiyear compact agreements with developing countries that create and  maintain sound policy environments. Its threshold programs fund a limited  amount of assistance to certain developing countries to help them  become eligible for compact funding. TCB is not an explicit objective of  the agreements and programs, according to officials, and MCC funds are  not earmarked for specific TCB projects. Compact countries define their  own development priorities and project proposals, which may include  projects considered as TCB. MCC first reported obligating funding for  TCB assistance when it signed its initial compacts with recipient countries  in fiscal year 2005. MCC has continued to report high levels of funding for  TCB assistance as countries sign compacts, but the levels of funding and  types of TCB-related activities depend on whether countries include TCB  as a component in their proposals.", "MCC operates differently than USAID and other U.S. agencies in that it  only provides assistance to developing countries based on criteria  involving governance and economic reform measures. For a country to be  selected as eligible for MCC\u2019s compact assistance program, it must have  demonstrated a commitment to ruling justly, encouraging economic  freedom, and investing in people by performing well on 17 indicators that  MCC uses to assess policy performance. Each compact is unique, and  MCC works in partnership with eligible countries that identify the greatest  constraints to their own development and establish priorities. In  consultation with the private sector and nongovernmental organizations, a  country government submits a proposal that may include TCB-related  projects. The proposal forms the basis for the compact. To help focus the  proposal on the root causes of constraints to private investments and  identify the appropriate activities, MCC and country partners use a written  analysis of a country\u2019s constraints. The analyses facilitate the consultative  process for developing compacts that address country priorities. For  example, according to MCC officials in Mozambique, MCC funded  prefeasibility analyses of four potential TCB-related projects. Three of the  projects were included in the compact. However, following consultations,  a free trade zone project was determined not to be viable.", "As of fiscal year 2010, MCC reported TCB-related activities in 20 compact  countries and 9 threshold program countries. TCB-related activities in  compact countries primarily consisted of physical infrastructure  development activities, while activities in threshold program countries  focused on customs operation and administration, such as strengthening  border inspections to improve import and export monitoring. For example,  in Benin, Honduras, Mali, Mozambique, and Tanzania, MCC has funded a  variety of physical infrastructure projects, including port and airport  improvement projects, as well as road construction and rehabilitation. The  Moldova, Sao Tome and Principe, and Zambia threshold programs  included a variety of activities related to customs operations and  administration, including the upgrading and modernization of customs  systems and enhancements to custom operations and inspection  procedures.", "The Army does not have TCB-focused strategic objectives, according to  Army officials. However, the Army funds trade-related physical  infrastructure projects considered TCB as part of the Commander\u2019s  Emergency Response Program in Afghanistan and in support of its  infrastructure development efforts in both Iraq and Afghanistan. Since  fiscal year 2009, the Army has reported $615 million in total obligated  funding for TCB-related activities that support the Army\u2019s broader goal to  achieve U.S. security objectives, provide basic humanitarian aid and  services, and support economic stability and development as a means of  responding to security concerns. For example, as part of its funding for  humanitarian assistance, the Army constructed and restored a variety of  physical infrastructure in Afghanistan that it reported contributed to trade,  including telecommunications and electrical systems projects. Although  the objectives of these projects are not directly focused on TCB,  according to officials of one Army command, these projects further  increase economic integration and trade by providing communication and  electrical power linkages between Afghanistan and neighboring countries.  The Army also undertook food production and distribution processes in  Afghanistan that also helped meet sanitary and phytosanitary standards.  In addition, as part of its mission, the Army supports economic stability  and sustainable development to promote security, in part, through the  development of infrastructure, such as roads, that facilitate trade. For  example, the Army funded the restoration and construction of roads in 20  regions in Afghanistan, which it reported contributed to the development  of physical infrastructure needed to promote trade. In addition, the Army  reported funding to repair, improve, and create new infrastructure in Iraq  and Afghanistan, including roads and bridges, necessary for trade routes  and market access improvements. According to officials of one Army  command, the road projects facilitated regional and international trade  flows by linking Afghanistan with neighboring countries.

This increase is largely the result of the inclusion of funding from MCC  beginning in 2005, and the Army beginning in 2009. Correspondingly,  there has been a steep decline in the share of total funding reported by  USAID and other agencies. MCC and the Army reported TCB funding  primarily in the category of physical infrastructure, which has contributed  to a steep rise in overall funding in that category. In addition, agencies  that are newly identified for inclusion in the database, such as the Army,  are sometimes unable to provide data for previous years, which may  imply a certain amount of under reporting. Although the annual TCB  survey attempts to identify and quantify just the trade-related components  of projects, this can be difficult for officials to fully achieve in practice. It  may also be challenging for survey administrators to fully clarify the  distinction between direct and indirect TCB funding.

Since 2005, the number of agencies reporting TCB obligations  has grown from 18 to 24. However, the significant increase in total TCB  funding is attributable to two agencies in particular\u2014MCC, which was  established in 2004 and began reporting TCB funding in 2005, and the  Army, which began reporting TCB funding in 2009 (see fig. 1).", "Over 2005\u20132010, MCC reported obligating $4.7 billion, or 48 percent of  total TCB funding.

While the amount of TCB funding provided  by USAID declined over that period, this does not account for such a  large decline in relative share.

Over 2005\u20132010, physical infrastructure was the largest category of total  TCB funding, at 45 percent of the total, or $4.5 billion out of $9.9 billion. In  contrast, over 2001\u20132004, physical infrastructure comprised only 8  percent of total funding, or $226 million out of $2.9 billion. The share of  funding for all other TCB categories has declined between those two  periods. For example, there has been a decline in the overall share of  funding of trade facilitation, which was the largest category over 2001\u2013 2004, from 27 percent to 16 percent, and a decline from 17 to 6 percent in  human resources and labor standards, which was previously the second  largest category. Figure 2 illustrates the large increase in the category of  physical infrastructure and the proportional decline in the other categories  of TCB, from 2001\u20132004 to 2005\u20132010.", "The increase in the category of physical infrastructure since 2005 has  been driven by the TCB funding reported by MCC and the Army. Physical  infrastructure and trade-related agriculture constitute the primary  categories of TCB assistance obligated by MCC. Over 2005\u20132010, MCC  reported obligating $3.3 billion in the category of physical infrastructure  development and $667 million in trade-related agriculture. MCC\u2019s funding  made up a majority share of overall TCB funding for both categories.  MCC accounts for 74 percent of total funding in physical infrastructure  and for more than half of total funding in trade-related agriculture.  Similarly, the $497 million in TCB funding reported by the Army in 2009  was exclusively for physical infrastructure development. This amount  accounts for 13 percent of total funding in physical infrastructure, the  majority of which\u2014$396 million\u2014the Army reported as funding for road  and bridge projects in Afghanistan. Figure 3 shows the amount of funding  for each category of TCB by agency over 2005\u20132010.", "MCC and the Army have also impacted the regional distribution of TCB  as reported by the database. Since 2005, U.S. agencies have provided  TCB funding to 143 recipient countries in 6 geographic regions, including  Southern Asia, Europe and Eurasia, East Asia/Oceania, Latin America  and the Caribbean, the Middle East and North Africa, and sub-Saharan  Africa. The sub-Saharan African region received the most funding, driven  primarily by projects funded by MCC (see fig. 4). Funding for Southern  Asia was largely made up of the Army\u2019s reported 2009 funding of physical  infrastructure projects in Afghanistan. In contrast, USAID funding is  spread more evenly worldwide. (For a more detailed table of country  funding, including TCB assistance to least developed countries, see   app. IV).", "The methodology of the TCB survey, the multiyear nature of MCC  compacts, and the relatively large size of those compacts are factors that  drive the impact of MCC funding on the TCB funding landscape. The TCB  survey collects and reports funding for each fiscal year on an obligation  basis, as opposed to reporting funding in the year in which it was  distributed. MCC obligates full funding for its 5-year compact agreements  in the year the compacts enter into force. The TCB survey methodology  captures the amount obligated in that year, resulting in large spikes in  MCC annual figures. This is unique in that other U.S. agencies generally  fund their multiyear projects through ongoing annual obligations. As a  result, any comparisons between MCC funding and other agencies in any  given year may be distorted. USAID officials noted that it may not be  feasible to alter the data collection process in such a way as to address  this issue.", "As we have previously reported, MCC\u2019s actual disbursements have  substantially lagged behind planned disbursements for countries with  compacts in force. This is because initial compact disbursement plans  underestimated the time required for compact countries to establish the  structures, agreements, and capabilities to begin implementing compact  projects. For example, MCC signed a compact with Mozambique in fiscal  year 2008 for $507 million and reported $222 million of that total as TCB- related funding in that fiscal year. However, as of December 31, 2010,  MCC reports having expended only $39 million, or just less than 8  percent of the total compact amount. Furthermore, due to the multiyear  nature of MCC compacts, MCC funding usually constitutes a significant  amount of total annual TCB funding, so the MCC obligations that appear  in the TCB database are large relative to other agencies and have an  increased impact on overall TCB statistics (see fig. 1).", "USAID management officials acknowledge the potential for the database  to distort the portrayal of TCB funding by comparing what is, in effect, 5- year funding for MCC with 1-year funding for other agencies, but they  maintain that it is not possible to reconfigure the data in any meaningful  way due to the survey\u2019s methodology. They also note that they  sometimes remove MCC from the dataset when conducting their own  analyses. In response to the concerns we noted, USAID updated the TCB  Web site in July 2011 to include a prominent notice on the Web site\u2019s  home page of the unique nature of MCC obligations. Given the relative  size and impact of MCC funding, such explanation is necessary to fully  understand the data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The TCB Database Does Not Adequately Explain Significant Factors Driving Changes in the Composition of TCB Funding", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Database Does Not Fully Explain Limitations That May Cause Prior Years\u2019 Reporting to be Understated", "paragraphs": ["Difficulties reporting previous years\u2019 data for newly identified sources of  TCB funding may mean that funding levels for those years are  understated in certain cases. The TCB survey team under contract with  USAID annually reviews various sources, such as the President\u2019s budget  request, to identify any TCB-related funding that is not currently being  reported to the survey. In this way, the survey team identified the Army as  a provider of TCB funding and requested that Army officials began  submitting data beginning in 2009. The Army provided this funding for  physical infrastructure development projects in Afghanistan and Iraq. The  Army had provided funding for similar activities for a number of years  prior; however, survey officials told us it was not practical to attempt to  capture previous years\u2019 data. Although the TCB Web site notes that 2009  was the first year USAID received a submission from any of the U.S.  Armed Services, it does not provide any further information. Specifically, it  does not make users aware of the possibility that prior years\u2019 reporting is  highly likely to be understated due to the challenges in reporting on the  Army\u2019s previous funding. Furthermore, the TCB Web site does not note  the process or describe the limitations of identifying new TCB funding  sources in its methodology. The Army\u2019s funding made up 27 percent of  the total TCB for 2009. Given the relative size and impact of Army  funding, such an explanation is necessary to fully understand the data  and the future impact of newly-identified agencies.", "Reporting and measuring TCB-related funding and activities, particularly  for physical infrastructure projects, can be difficult, largely because of the  need to distinguish between assistance focused on improving trade  capacity, in particular, and support to promote economic growth or some  other goal in general. While agencies such as USAID fund activities that  have clear and direct links to TCB, other agencies, including MCC and  the Army, fund activities that are sometimes more indirectly related to  international trade. For example, technical assistance USAID provides to  aid in a country\u2019s accession to the WTO has a clear and direct relation to  trade, but activities such as constructing roads or electrical grids may not.  In addition, certain types of projects might be related to trade in one  context but not in another. For instance, an energy project might relate to  trade if it is servicing a tourism complex but not if it is providing electricity  to local neighborhoods.", "The TCB survey was developed to capture any and all U.S. government  TCB-related funding at the activity level of all participating agencies.  USAID and USTR officials have noted that the design of the TCB survey  enables them to determine on a case-by-case basis the extent to which a  project or program may relate to TCB because reporting officials  understand the specific trade-related components of the project for which  they are reporting data. USAID officials explained that the TCB survey is  designed to solicit such a determination because it surveys those officials  responsible for managing the projects \u201con the ground.\u201d", "Although the TCB survey attempts to identify and quantify just the trade- related components of a physical infrastructure project, we found  examples where the application of this distinction was challenging.  Officials with whom we spoke during our fieldwork agreed that the  definition of TCB used in the survey was quite broad, which could  sometimes make it difficult to identify the activities to report in their survey  responses. They relied on the categorical definitions provided by the TCB  survey and survey guidance. However, we found instances in which  officials experienced challenges in clearly discriminating between  components of projects that were TCB or non-TCB related, particularly in  large TCB-related infrastructure projects. For example:  \uf0b7  The Army reported $396 million in TCB funding for infrastructure  projects in Afghanistan that consisted of activities intended to repair,  restore, or build roads to respond to urgent humanitarian relief and  reconstruction requirements and that also had trade-related effects.  Army officials cited concerns about reporting the entire road project as  related to TCB because it may only be minimally used for international  trade. However, survey administrators advised Army officials  responsible for reporting the Army\u2019s TCB data that the entire funding  for the road project should be counted as TCB-related assistance \u201cso  long as the project is not designed to exclusively support a military  installation and so long as the power/utility project is not designed to  exclusively support residential use.\u201d As one official put it, \u201ca road will  support the ability of farmers to transport their products to a local  market as well as to an export facility.\u201d \u201cFishing is one of the most important industries in Morocco. Morocco is unable to  satisfy current domestic demand for quality fish. Demand is expected to increase,  driven by an expanding tourist sector and expected growth in domestic fish  consumption. The Small Scale Fisheries Project seeks to modernize the means of  catching, storing, and marketing fish, thereby improving the quality of the catch,  maintaining the value chain, and increasing fishers\u2019 access to both local and export  markets.\u201d", "According to MCC and foreign officials in Morocco, external trade was  not in the forefront of their thinking on this particular project when the  compact was being developed. When we originally discussed this  project with one MCC official in Morocco, we were told that 100  percent of the catch was intended for domestic consumption.  However, we later learned from a host country project manager that  an estimated 20 to 30 percent of the catch would go to outlets that  might be considered exports. There was no readily available  quantitative data to verify this. Differing from both those estimates,  MCC had previously reported to the survey that all $116 million of  funding for the project was TCB-related.", "Other entities that report TCB-related funding face similar challenges. For  example, the 2005 WTO Hong Kong Ministerial Conference established  the Aid-for-Trade Initiative that prompted a joint effort by the OECD and  the WTO to track TCB activities by all global donors in a manner similar to  the approach of the TCB database. The U.S. TCB survey is used to  generate the TCB activities and funding the U.S. government reports to  that joint database. While the OECD and WTO effort collects and tracks  aid-for-trade data using definitional categories similar to those used in the  U.S. TCB survey, they more explicitly acknowledge the challenges  associated with physical infrastructure projects. One OECD report notes  that it is almost impossible to provide sound criteria that differentiate  between trade-related infrastructure and general economic infrastructure.  In addition, they report that few international donors can identify the trade- related share in individual projects and programs. As stated earlier in this  report, USTR maintains that the U.S. TCB survey has the ability to  determine on a case-by-case basis the extent to which projects may have  trade-related components. USTR has explained that this ability to dissect  programs into their component parts is an important difference between  the U.S. TCB definition and OECD\u2019s aid-for-trade definition. However, we  have noted examples when agency officials submitting TCB estimates  have found it difficult to make this distinction.", "USAID does not provide any information on the difficulties involved in  making these determinations on the TCB database Web site. In contrast,  the 2007 report on global aid-for-trade issued jointly by the OECD and the  WTO dedicates an appendix to discussing the difficulties in collecting  data on infrastructure (as well as other categories of TCB) and the  possibility that a significant over-estimation of the actual TCB-related  volume is possible. The U.S. TCB survey attempts to make this  differentiation but does not provide a clear explanation of how such a  differentiation operates or the degree to which some of these  determinations are subjective. Although the database states that the  physical infrastructure category only includes assistance to establish  telecoms, transport, ports, airports, power, water, and industrial zones  that have a direct link to trade, it does not include a discussion of whether  those projects are primarily for a non-TCB goal and how that might affect  the project\u2019s value to TCB efforts.", "Furthermore, the TCB database Web site does not distinguish or explain  \u201cdirect\u201d and \u201cindirect\u201d linkages between projects and TCB. USAID  recognizes in its annual Congressional Budget Justification that there is a  distinction between direct and indirect TCB. It cites examples of \u201cdirect  TCB\u201d that include support for countries\u2019 efforts to streamline customs and  examples of \u201cindirect TCB\u201d that include modernizing transport. In neither  of the examples above, where we noted instances in which officials  experienced challenges in clearly discriminating between components of  projects that were TCB or non-TCB related, was TCB explicitly the  primary goal of the project.

Activities in the trade and  investment program area relate to TCB, and USAID uses 20 trade and  investment standard indicators to measure the immediate results of its  TCB activities. Missions and offices report on a subset of the standard  indicators that relate to the trade and investment program elements they  are funding. Examples of USAID trade and investment standard  indicators include:  \uf0b7  Number of customs harmonization procedures implemented in  accordance with internationally accepted standards as a result of U.S.  assistance. \uf0b7  Number of investment measures made consistent with international  investment agreements as a result of U.S. assistance. \uf0b7  Reduction in the number of procedures required to trade goods  across borders as a result of U.S. assistance. \uf0b7  Number of firms receiving capacity building assistance to export.  \uf0b7  Number of participants in U.S. government-supported trade and  investment capacity building trainings. \uf0b7  Number of trade and investment capacity building diagnostics  conducted. \uf0b7  Number of U.S. government supported training events on topics  related to investment capacity building and improving trade.", "The standard indicators are complemented by custom indicators that  USAID missions and offices select to further measure and monitor  particular programs. USAID uses the indicators in performance plans and  reports summarizing project results.", "Some USAID officials noted that the standard indicators largely measure  program outputs rather than results or outcomes of TCB assistance.", "Standard indicators generally gauge activities undertaken or services  provided by USAID; for example, missions we visited used such output- oriented standard indicators as the number of U.S. government supported  training events on topics related to investment capacity building and  improving trade. However, they do not measure whether such activities  contributed to a beneficiary country\u2019s capacity to trade. Our review of  documentation of countries where USAID has conducted TCB activities  revealed that these standard indicators serve certain USAID management  purposes, but USAID mission officials told us it was difficult to use to such  indicators to inform decisions about how TCB assistance could improve a  country\u2019s capacity to trade. On the other hand, some USAID officials in  recipient countries explained that in addition to the agencywide standard  indicators, missions can develop project-specific custom indicators that  tend to be more outcome-focused. For example, the mission in Morocco  used the custom indicators, \u201ctotal value of sales in target sectors  (disaggregated by domestic sales and exports)\u201d and \u201cvalue of private  investment (disaggregated by domestic and foreign direct investment).\u201d  Some program officers said that outcome-oriented custom indicators  were more useful than the standard indicators for evaluating activities\u2019  effects on trade. Thus, based on data collected from a custom indicator  that measured the volume of agricultural exports, program officials in  Mozambique said that the mission modified the focus of an agriculture  TCB-related program to target assistance to new crops with better export  potential.", "While the agency uses project-specific custom indicators for virtually  every project, USAID management and mission officials cited challenges  in developing meaningful outcome custom indicators. Some USAID  officials explained that it is difficult to identify indicators that measure the  effects of TCB directly attributable to U.S. government assistance. For  example, one USAID official noted that many missions supporting TCB  activities may track export growth as an outcome indicator, but according  to mission officials, a variety of factors may impact a country\u2019s exports,  including fluctuations in market prices and currencies, and it is difficult to  isolate these factors from the effects of TCB assistance. Similarly,  mission officials cited challenges to collecting and using valid and reliable  data to gauge an indicator. For instance, in Mozambique, mission officials  explained that local government trade data are not reliable, so they may  have to rely solely on private sector data from firms targeted by the  mission\u2019s TCB-related programs to measure exports. They said that this  makes it difficult to compare the export performance of targeted  beneficiary firms in the same sector. In addition, many USAID TCB- related activities are implemented as part of broader programs that have  primary development objectives other than TCB.

Some of these factors were associated with the focus of TCB  assistance provided. For example, assistance that was directed at one  type of beneficiary generally enjoyed better results than projects that  included various categories of recipients. In addition, TCB projects that  concentrated on a single sector generally performed better than projects  that focused on multiple sectors. Thus, TCB projects that concentrated on  the agricultural sector were more likely to successfully achieve their  objectives than projects that attempted to cover diverse sectors, such as  manufacturing and services, as well as agriculture. Conversely, projects  that combined different types of assistance, such as performing a trade  diagnostic study as well as providing training, were more likely to achieve  their performance targets and objectives than projects that relied on a  single approach. In some cases a combination of technical assistance,  training and use of communications technologies helped change private  sector practices, resulting in trade-related gains, such as new products for  export and more timely delivery of goods.", "The evaluation also describes certain factors related to beneficiaries\u2019  participation that were found to contribute to successful project results.  For example, encouraging participation of beneficiaries in project design  and promoting private sector involvement were also found to be  associated with assistance efforts that met performance targets or  objectives. Projects characterized by adversarial relations among  participants were, however, less likely to succeed. Other factors that the  evaluation cited as hindering project success included excessive host  government regulation and unexpected shifts in the recipient  government\u2019s priorities.

The evaluation  found that USAID\u2019s practices for monitoring the performance of its TCB  projects does not correspond, in many instances, to the agency\u2019s  performance guidelines, and its evaluations of TCB projects are limited in  number and suffer from methodological weaknesses.

While USAID management officials stated that  replicating the evaluation\u2019s methodology is likely to be too resource- intensive for future evaluations, any subsequent evaluations would  similarly aim to assess a variety of TCB projects implemented across  countries to identify those that are most successful in achieving their  objectives and the factors that contribute to these successes. We have  reported that it is important that agencies use timely performance  information to assess the results of their activities to understand how they  contribute to their agency missions and broader results. Conducting  evaluations on an ongoing basis increases accountability and would help  ensure that assistance is effectively delivered and implemented to  maximize development. It also would provide opportunities to learn from  project implementation by identifying which activities work, under what  circumstances, and why. For example, USAID officials could use future  evaluations to identify approaches to providing TCB assistance that have  worked well and consider alternative approaches where improvements  could be made.

The definition of TCB  includes a wide array of activities implemented by multiple agencies to  fulfill a variety of objectives. Some relate more directly to trade than  others. While some agencies, such as USAID and State, conduct  activities that are easily identified as intended to help a country build its  capacity to trade, agencies such as MCC and the Army conduct activities  that have trade-related effects but do not directly support TCB. This  distinction has become increasingly important because of the significant  funding reported by these two agencies, particularly for physical  infrastructure, in USAID\u2019s TCB database. As a primary source of  information on TCB funding for Congress and the public, it is important  that its information create a clear picture of funding trends. But without  explanations of the database\u2019s limitations, it may distort users\u2019  understanding and create misperceptions.", "While USAID has taken positive steps to track the progress of individual  TCB activities, like other development organizations it continues to  struggle to link this assistance to important trade and development  benefits. USAID\u2019s recent agencywide evaluation of the effectiveness of its  TCB activities in multiple countries is an important step, but USAID  officials have not yet signaled how they plan to address the evaluation\u2019s  valuable findings. Without planning actions to utilize the results of its  evaluation, the agency may miss opportunities to take advantage of the  insights from that analysis to improve the effectiveness of its TCB  assistance. Moreover, by evaluating its TCB activities across countries on  an ongoing basis, USAID could gain a better understanding of the linkage  between TCB and development.

To address these objectives we built upon information  collected for our 2005 report on the same topic. We conducted fieldwork  in Colombia, Morocco, and Mozambique. We selected these countries  because they (1) were among the 10 countries receiving the most TCB  funding from fiscal years 2005 to 2009, (2) had a mix of U.S. agencies  providing assistance and categories of TCB assistance provided in- country, and (3) had a diversity of geographic regions and country income  levels.

In conjunction with our work at the missions, we held meetings with other  key U.S. government officials, USAID contractors, host government  ministry officials, and various TCB recipients. To assess how U.S.  agencies coordinate the allocation of TCB assistance, we reviewed  published reports on TCB activities, agency strategies, and program  documents.

We analyzed data from the database to identify  the major funding categories, agencies, and recipients of TCB assistance.  As part of our previous and ongoing work, we have assessed this data  and determined that they are sufficiently reliable to identify TCB funding  by agency, country, and category; although we found limitations to the  use of the data, as discussed in this report. We examined the guidance,  protocols, and definitions specified in the TCB survey. We also reviewed  documents from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and  Development and the World Trade Organization (WTO) to understand  definitions and data collection methodologies used globally for trade- related funding. In addition, we interviewed the USAID contractor that  manages the data collection and analyzed the steps the contractor took to  ensure data reliability. For example, we asked the contractor how the  survey data were collected, what quality checks were performed, and  what other internal controls were in place.

According to USAID officials, mission officials  understand country-specific factors such as the activities of other TCB  donors and the composition of trade. The USAID officials informed us that  missions identify their TCB projects as part of their mission strategic  plans, which USAID\u2019s headquarters bureaus review in conjunction with  the agency\u2019s budget planning process. They further explained that  USAID\u2019s headquarters bureaus provide missions guidance and training,  and help missions develop and design specific programs when  necessary; however missions primarily identify the country-specific trade- related constraints and TCB assistance needs in consultation with  governments and associations in recipient countries.

For example, specific activities of the USAID TCB  programs related to the U.S.-Colombia free trade agreement (FTA)  negotiations responded to priorities defined in collaboration between  USAID and the government of Colombia as the negotiations were carried  out. Specifically, USAID officials stated that they collaborated with the  government of Colombia to identify 52 TCB initiatives. Following the  completion of the FTA negotiations in 2006, USAID continued to provide  technical assistance to support the initiatives, and by 2010 the mission  had addressed all but two of these initiatives. According to mission  officials, the mission in Mozambique identified TCB activities, in part,  based on the country\u2019s trade association\u2019s evaluation of trade-related  constraints. Mission officials cited the importance of involving the  business association and various government ministries to identify  feasible policy reforms and foster the collaboration. For example, the  mission has worked with the business association and the Ministry of  Commerce to reduce import and export barriers, and reform licensing and  shipment processes. In addition, these officials explained that they have  daily interactions with officials of various ministries and these discussions  will often identify potential areas for TCB assistance.", "USAID missions also use trade diagnostic studies sponsored by USAID  and developed by multilateral agencies to identify trade-related  constraints and TCB needs. According to mission officials in Colombia  and Mozambique, these diagnostic studies are important to encourage  recipient governments to undertake needed reforms. For example, USAID  commissioned three diagnostic studies to identify and plan TCB  assistance in support of the U.S.-Colombia FTA negotiations. Based on  study results, USAID developed seminars to increase awareness of both  the Colombian congress and civil society about the importance of the FTA  and how regions and productive sectors would benefit from it. In  Mozambique, multilateral and bilateral stakeholders developed a  diagnostic study that mission officials said contributed to the mission\u2019s  decisions regarding sectors and areas of the country where it provided  technical assistance under its TCB-related agribusiness and tourism  programs. For example, according to mission officials, the study  contributed to the agribusiness program\u2019s focus on commodities such as  cashews and coconuts from the country\u2019s northern region that have the  greatest export potential. Furthermore, according to one government of  Mozambique official, the mission utilized the study results to encourage  the government to develop a national strategy to address trade-related  constraints to economic growth.", "We also found that USAID missions generally select TCB-related  activities that align with broader country development strategies. In  countries we visited, mission officials cited the importance of consulting  with recipient governments\u2019 national development strategies and with  foreign officials of recipient countries to identify potential TCB-related  activities that have the support of the recipient governments. For  example, the mission in Mozambique identified TCB-related activities  under its agribusiness and policy reform programs that directly supported  the implementation of priorities identified in national strategies of various  ministries. In Morocco, the mission supported the government of  Morocco\u2019s strategy of providing jobs, economic opportunities, and political  stability through free trade. The mission identified the potential economic  challenges posed by the FTA, particularly in the area of agriculture, and  outlined activities to help the government of Morocco respond to the  challenges and opportunities posed by the FTA.

According to USTR officials, the interagency groups tied to the FTAs offer  USTR the opportunity to work with other agencies to try to identify the  types of assistance they may be able to provide in a particular area.  USAID and other U.S. agencies participate in these working groups and  committees so that identified TCB needs are incorporated into ongoing  assistance programs. For example, according to USTR officials, during a  2008 meeting of the Central America-Dominican Republic FTA TCB  Committee, agencies identified sanitary and phytosanitary assistance as  a priority, and with USDA assistance, each partner country\u2019s sanitary and  phytosanitary system was assessed and gaps or deficiencies in those  systems were identified. In response, State, USAID, USDA, and USTR  reached agreement to provide further sanitary and phytosanitary  assistance.

According to officials, the subcommittee has focused on WTO  developments in the area, including USTR\u2019s sharing of information  regarding the WTO and other multilateral initiatives related to TCB, such  as the Enhanced Integrated Framework, and seeking other agencies\u2019  input. As these initiatives had near- and long-term implications for the  WTO, a permanent subcommittee of the TPSC was deemed the  appropriate mechanism for interagency coordination, according to USTR  officials. All members of the TPSC are invited to participate in meetings of  the TPSC Subcommittee on TCB. In addition, other agencies that have a  particular interest or expertise in TCB assistance are also invited,  including MCC. USTR utilizes other TPSC subcommittees to coordinate  U.S. agencies\u2019 TCB efforts in various contexts.

During compact development, project appraisals  and development procedures include defining the objectives and  benchmarks that will be used to measure progress over the duration of  the compact.
