Some states rank relatively high on the per capita distribution of different types of federal dollars. Government reports indicate that in 1996, Maryland, Virginia, and Alaska were the only three states to rank among the top five in each of the following categories: (1) total federal expenditures, (2) total federal procurement expenditures, and (3) total salary and wage expenditures for federal workers. The only other state that ranked among the top 10 states in all these categories was New Mexico.", "Interest in the economic magnitude of defense and other federal expenditures in states has been amplified by concerns over anticipated outcomes of the post-Cold War drawdown. In hearings before the Joint Economic Committee of the 101st Congress, 12 state governors submitted to the leadership of the Senate and House a plan for responding to expected adverse economic impacts in states that were believed to be particularly vulnerable to reductions in defense spending. In 1992, President Bush issued Executive Order 12788, requiring the Secretary of Defense to identify the problems of states, regions, and other areas that result from base closures and Department of Defense (DOD) contract-related adjustments. The Office of Economic Adjustment is DOD\u2019s primary office responsible for providing assistance to communities, regions, and states \u201cadversely impacted by significant Defense program changes.\u201d", "The federal government tracks defense-related and other federal spending and associated employment through various sources. Centralized reporting of this information is done by the Census Bureau in its Consolidated Federal Funds Report (CFFR) series. The CFFR includes the Federal Expenditures by State (FES) report and a separate two-report volume that presents information at the county and subcounty level. The FES report presents the most comprehensive information on federal expenditures at the state level that can actually be attributed to specific federal agencies or programs. Agencies involved in collecting and reporting various types of employment information include the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the Bureau of Labor Statistics.", "Expenditure information reported in the CFFR also appears in agency-specific publications or data sources. DOD reports information on its total procurement expenditures and the salaries and wages paid to DOD personnel, by state, in the Atlas/Data Abstract for the United States and Selected Areas. In compiling information for the CFFR, DOD\u2019s procurement data are first sent to the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) and then sent to Census. Therefore, Census, DOD, and the FPDS can and do report DOD procurement expenditures.", "Federal expenditure and employment data are available to users in and outside the government and are regularly used in policy formulation and evaluation. DOD contractors, including the Logistics Management Institute, have used federal government data in support of their work for DOD on the economic impacts of base realignment and closure actions. The Office of Economic Conversion Information, a collaborative effort between the Economic Development Administration of the Department of Commerce and DOD, uses existing federal data to provide information to communities, businesses, and individuals adjusting to the effects of defense downsizing and other changing economic conditions. The Congressional Budget Office and the Congressional Research Service have also used DOD procurement expenditure data in examining the expected effects of planned reductions in the national defense budget. DOD uses its prime contract award expenditure data to track the status and progress of goals associated with contracts made to small businesses. Researchers at think tanks, universities, and state government offices also use government data in a wide array of research projects and publications."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Dollars Contribute to New Mexico Economy, but Economy Is Diversifying", "paragraphs": ["DOE and DOD military activities have contributed substantially to the economy of New Mexico for about 50 years. Government data show that between 1988 and 1996, New Mexico was ranked second, third, or fourth, among U.S. states in per capita distribution of federal dollars. In terms of per capita federal procurement expenditures only, New Mexico was ranked first among U.S. states during 1988-94 and second in 1995-96. In 1996, New Mexico was ranked first among states in return on federal tax dollars, receiving $1.93 in federal outlays for every $1.00 in federal taxes paid. The state was also ranked first in return on federal tax dollars in 1995. In 1996, 5 of the 6 major federal facilities were among the top  10 employers in the state.", "This federal revenue comes largely from the six major federal facilities in New Mexico, including two DOE national laboratories, Los Alamos National Laboratory and Sandia National Laboratory; Cannon, Holloman, and Kirtland Air Force Bases; and White Sands Missile Range, a test range that supports missile development and test programs for all the services, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA); and other government agencies and private industry. New Mexico\u2019s geography and climate, including relative isolation from major population centers, year-round good weather, and open airspace, have made the state attractive for some military activities. In May 1996, the Secretary of Defense and the German Defense Minister activated the German Air Force Tactical Training Center at Holloman Air Force Base in Alamogordo. The training opportunities provided by the vast airspace in and around Holloman and its proximity to Fort Bliss, Texas\u2014the headquarters location for German air force operations in North America\u2014were factors in Germany\u2019s decision to invest in a tactical training center at the base. State officials estimate that the training center will result in a population increase to the Alamogordo area of about 7 percent and investment by Germany of $155 million by 1999.", "Services and trade are distinct components of New Mexico\u2019s economy. In 1993, the largest employment sectors in New Mexico were services, government, and trade: these were reported as accounting for approximately 76 percent of the total average annual state employment.Businesses involved in trade and/or services accounted for 67 percent of all businesses in New Mexico in 1993. Revenue from the gross receipts tax is the highest source of tax revenue in New Mexico, and in 1996, gross receipt taxes from services and trade accounted for more than half of all gross receipts tax revenue. DOE reports show that between 1990 and 1995, it made more expenditures in the services and trade sectors of the New Mexico economy. New Mexico Department of Labor projections indicate that by 2005, the services sector will alone account for about 41 percent of total employment while employment in the trade sector is projected to remain stable and government employment is expected to decline. The projections indicate that jobs in services and trade will account for 70 percent of the new jobs between 1993 and 2005.", "New Mexico state officials have been focusing on \u201cachieving economic diversification to protect against dramatic negative changes in the state\u2019s economy,\u201d believed to be linked to changes in federal spending in the state. Efforts in 1996 to recruit select industries to the state have initially resulted in at least 7 businesses locating to New Mexico, creating 230 new jobs. In terms of other efforts, New Mexico was 8th among U.S. states in high-technology employment growth between 1990 and 1995. The single leading high-technology industry in the state is semiconductor manufacturing, which accounts for 34 percent of total high-technology jobs. Intel Corporation has three advanced computer chip manufacturing sites that employ at least 6,500 people making it the state\u2019s second-largest private sector employer and contributing to the growth in New Mexico\u2019s high-technology employment. In 1995, Intel was also the leading manufacturing employer in the state. High-technology exports account for the largest percentage of New Mexico exports to other countries, with exports to Korea leading other nations. Currently, about 10 percent of all New Mexico manufacturers are exporting. The leading exporters in New Mexico are Intel, Motorola, and Honeywell Defense Avionics.", "A comparison of the percent change in New Mexico\u2019s per capita income and total defense-related spending (DOE and DOD) in the state during 1990-94 shows that real growth occurred in per capita income, while total defense expenditures declined (see fig.1). A comparison between percent real growth in New Mexico\u2019s gross state product and total defense-related federal expenditures reveals the same pattern, suggesting that efforts to diversify the state\u2019s economy may be having a positive effect (see fig. 2). Based on the average rate of growth in the gross state product during 1987-94, the Bureau of Economic Analysis identified New Mexico as the third-fastest-growing state."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOE Spends More on Procurement; DOD Spends More on Workforce and Retirement", "paragraphs": ["Available federal data provides a segmented and rough snapshot of federal money spent in states and the employment linked to those expenditures that is relevant to gauging some trends and patterns.

Direct expenditures for procurement, salaries and wages for federal workers, and grants accounted for  60 percent, or about $7.3 billion, of the total. Direct payments to individuals, the single largest category of federal expenditures, accounted for approximately 37 percent, or about $4.4 billion, of total 1996 federal expenditures (see fig. 3).", "Appendix II includes additional descriptions of federal spending and employment in New Mexico."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Defense-Related Expenditures", "paragraphs": ["The top five agencies making procurement expenditures in New Mexico during 1993-96, were DOE, DOD, the Department of Interior, NASA, and the Postal Service.

Specifically, DOD accounted for 97 percent, or about 292,000 of these jobs, over the period 1988-96. Thus, DOD federal jobs were more of the total federal jobs and more of the defense-related federal jobs in New Mexico. Federal retirees of defense-related agencies also comprised more of the retired federal workers living in New Mexico: 68 percent of the total between 1990 and 1996. Specifically, DOD accounted for 99 percent of all retirees from the defense-related agencies. Figure 5 shows the percent of defense-related jobs and retirees in New Mexico accounted for by DOE and DOD.", "The existing data provides information on federal employees only. This is an important point because although the overall ratio of DOD federal workers to DOE federal workers was 44:1 between 1988 and 1996, our research also shows that more of the DOE employment is linked to private contractors that manage and operate the laboratories and other DOE facilities than to the number of DOE federal employees. Private contractors working on government contracts are not considered or counted as federal employees. However, even when we compared the total DOE employment, which included direct DOE prime contractor, subcontractor, and federal employees, to the total DOD federal employment DOD\u2019s direct federal employment was higher than DOE\u2019s in each year between 1990 and 1996.", "Of the DOD employment, more of the federal jobs were DOD military than DOD civilians. Between 1988-96 about 42 percent of the total DOD federal jobs in New Mexico were held by active duty military members, 33 percent were held by inactive duty military (national guard and reserves), and 25 percent were held by DOD civilians. Similarly, more of the federal wages were associated with active duty military. Active duty military members accounted for 55 percent, inactive members accounted for 5 percent, and DOD civilians accounted for 40 percent of the total salaries and wages between 1988-96.", "A comparison of the occupations represented by the defense-related federal jobs in New Mexico indicates that during 1988-96 the largest number of jobs were blue-collar and technical. This finding, however, largely represents the patterns for the DOD active duty employment in New Mexico, for which technical and blue-collar jobs comprise about 70 percent of the total jobs. Among DOD civilian employees, the two categories that accounted for the largest number of jobs over the period 1988-96 were professional (23 percent of the total jobs) and blue-collar (20 percent of the total jobs). The two occupational categories that account for more of the DOE direct federal employment in New Mexico are administrative (30 percent of total jobs) and professional (37 percent of total jobs)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Federal Expenditure and Employment Data Are Incomplete", "paragraphs": ["Official federal data sources are useful for gaining a preliminary understanding of the composition of federal expenditures in states. However, fundamental characteristics of the federal data make it difficult to determine the direct economic impact of federal activities on states. For example, our analysis of defense-related expenditures and employment did not include information on DOD contractor employment because there is no official DOD or other federal source of such information. Federal government data sources provide insufficient evidence for determining where federal dollars are actually spent, how much is actually spent, and the number or type of jobs that the federal dollars directly generate because of numerous limitations in scope and coverage and in reporting requirements or procedures. Our related findings that pertain to the data sources used and reviewed in our work are summarized in tables 1 and 2.", "To gain further insights into the reliability of the federal government\u2019s data we focused on characteristics of existing DOD data. Although DOD\u2019s procurement expenditure data (DD350) is used in broad policy contexts and used to evaluate the status of programs that are believed to be important to economic security, the form is not designed to provide information on all DOD expenditures in a single state or at the national level. Procurement contracts under $25,000 are not included, no information on DOD subcontracts of any value are included, and financial data related to classified programs may or may not be reported or be accurate.", "DOD acknowledges that the DD350 does not completely account for all procurement expenditures, and although this limitation is generally understood and acknowledged by informed users, the possible implications are not. We surveyed the top five DOD contractors in New Mexico to determine how much money they received in DOD prime contracts and subcontracts and compared their responses to DOD\u2019s records (the DD350 data) of their total contracts. The comparisons revealed that in no case were the DOD records of the dollar value of contracts awarded to these companies the same as the contractors\u2019 records. Differences between DOD and contractors\u2019 records ranged from $20 million for prime contracts to $80 million for total contracts. In some cases, the DOD records appeared to overstate the amount the contractors received, while in other cases the DOD records appeared to understate the amount.", "Our research suggests several possible reasons for the inconsistencies between contractor records and DOD records. For example, expenditures associated with procurement contracts can leak from a state\u2019s economy if a company subcontracts part of the work elsewhere. One study reported that of $5.2 billion in DOD prime contracts received by McDonnell Douglas in St. Louis, Missouri, less than 3 percent, or $156 million, stayed in Missouri due to out-of-state subcontracting. However, from our survey of contractors in New Mexico we determined that leakages were more prevalent for certain types of procurement contracts. While our survey showed overall that more than 80 percent of the total DOD prime contract dollars remained in the state, for every year between 1988 and 1996, it also showed that the businesses that predominantly received service contracts, rather than supply and equipment contracts (i.e., major hard goods/weapons), kept nearly all of the DOD contract money they received in the state. This is particularly relevant because other DOD data indicate that in every year between 1988 and 1996, DOD procurement contracts for services account for the largest dollar volume of contracts to New Mexico.", "Also, service contracts may more likely be under DOD\u2019s $25,000 reporting threshold and therefore excluded from total expenditures as officially reported by DOD. Furthermore, injections of dollars from subcontracts with out-of-state firms or with other in-state firms are not tracked by DOD, yet would have been included in the contractors\u2019 records.", "Finally, the DOD Inspector General reported in 1989 that the DD350 data had reliability problems due to instances of unreported contract obligations and other errors in reported data. The Inspector General made no recommendations and has not assessed the reliability and validity of the DD350 contract tracking system since then.", "The existing data that track defense-related employment are limited in their scope, coverage, and reliability. Among the most notable limitation in the data is the lack of a central or official source of data on private-sector employment associated with DOD contracts. Information on the number of jobs associated with particular defense contracts or weapon programs are repeatedly discussed in the media and in Congress. Further, DOD has stated that defense procurement dollars promote the creation of jobs. However, DOD officials have also indicated that they do not collect information on the job impacts of particular DOD budget decisions.", "To obtain information on the employment associated with defense contracts or the employment linked to particular defense programs, it is necessary to contact individual defense contractors and/or DOD system program offices directly. The contractor employment data we obtained from our survey of defense contractors in New Mexico is summarized in appendix III, along with other survey findings. The responses from the top four contractors who provided us data indicated that the total number of direct jobs associated with DOD contracts was approximately 19,200 during 1988-96. The total DOD federal employment (active duty, inactive, and civilians) in the state for the same period (1989 data included) was approximately 328,000. A comparison of employment data from three top DOE prime contractors to the data from the top four DOD prime contractors indicates that, over the period 1994-96, DOE had about eight prime contractor employees to every one DOD prime contractor employee in New Mexico.

Trying to reconcile differences among data sources and account for gaps or questionable data is very resource-intensive and does not necessarily yield benefits in precision or accuracy. On the other hand, the existing data are not without value, nor should the government necessarily strive for increased data collection that could actually entail more costs than benefits.
