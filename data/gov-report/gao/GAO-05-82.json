However, if the ACS is to be an adequate replacement for the Decennial Census long form as the major source of data on small geographic areas and if it is to provide similar annual data for larger areas, the Census Bureau will need to incorporate in a timely manner the resolution of issues it has already identified in the ACS testing and 2000 Decennial Census evaluation programs, such as the residence concept, group quarters, and questions on disability; complete the ACS testing plan as originally planned, such as the comparison and evaluation of long form-ACS supplementary survey data at the state level, to identify other unresolved issues and to provide information for users of 2000 Decennial Census long-form data that will be necessary for the transition to the full ACS; evaluate and consult with stakeholders and users on the resolution of issues identified in this report, such as the methodology for deriving population and housing controls, guidance for users on the impact of the characteristics of multiyear averages for small geographic areas, and the presentation of dollar-denominated values; coordinate the results of the testing program for the 2010 Decennial Census short form with the ACS implementation schedule; and resolve all issues so that the ACS estimates beginning with 2008 are consistent with the ACS estimates for 2009-12 and with the 2010 Census short form. Although the Census Bureau has solicited advice from external stakeholders and users and has supported research by its own staff on most of the issues identified in this report, there is no indication that the Census Bureau has yet followed this advice or implemented plans for consultation on resolving these issues. In addition, it has been more than a year since the Census Bureau announced that it was looking into establishing an ACS partnership program that would involve advisory groups and expert panels to improve the program, but no such program has been established. Another issue related to the proposed ACS is how the Census Bureau might provide more timely and reliable small geographic area data. This goal could be accomplished, but it would require additional funding. The most direct approach would be to increase the sample size for 2009-11. This increase would enable the Bureau to provide small geographic area data that would be the replacement for the 2010 Census long form 1 year earlier."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Census Bureau has designed the 2010 Decennial Census around three  new operations.

According to the Census Bureau,  although each concept requires that a person have only one residence at  any point in time, current residence recognizes that the place of residence  does not have to be the same throughout a year, allowing ACS data to  more closely reflect the actual characteristics of each area. The Census  Bureau plans to use current residence because the ACS is conducted every  month and produces annual averages rather than point-in-time estimates,  unlike the Decennial Census. Current residence is uniquely suited to the  ACS, because it continuously collects information from independent  monthly samples throughout all months of all years.

Consequently, if these issues are not resolved in a timely manner, the  Census Bureau\u2019s plan to replace the 2010 Decennial Census long form with  the 2008\u201312 ACS averages for detailed geographic areas will be  jeopardized."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "A Methodology for Independent Controls for Population and Housing Characteristics Is Lacking", "paragraphs": ["It is standard practice to use independent controls for population and  housing characteristics to correct the results of sample surveys for the  effects of nonresponse and undercoverage.

For the annual ACS supplementary  surveys, characteristics from ICPE were used as the independent  controls.", "Independent controls for the full ACS will require a new methodology.  Short-form data are available only once every 10 years, and the annual  ICPE estimates do not provide data for the detailed geographic areas  needed to prepare long-form detail and do not use the ACS residence  concept or reference period. The new methodology is critical to the  reliability of the ACS estimates of small geographic areas that ICPE does  not provide and of areas that have large numbers of seasonal residents.", "Census Bureau staff have long recognized the need for the new  methodology. For example, a 1995 paper by Love, Dalzell, and Alexander  expressed concern about population controls and residence rules as well  as the need for consultation with users on these topics. They reported that  the Census Bureau was planning to conduct research using data from the  1996 test sites to produce controls at the census tract and block group  levels. They also noted that the Census Bureau would need to conduct  research on the residence rule. A 2000 paper by Alexander and Wetrogan  also discussed the issue of population controls. They reviewed possible  methods for using ICPE to develop controls for the ACS and noted the  need to consult with users on how to present information on the  differences in ACS controls and ICPE in ACS publications.", "Key stakeholders, including experts on the ACS we interviewed in August  2003 (listed in appendix I), expressed similar concerns about the  methodology.", "It appears that no progress had been made on a new methodology until the  Census Bureau reported in October 2003 to its advisory committees on the  status of a new methodology to derive controls. It announced that when  full ACS collection starts in November 2004, (1) interim procedures would  be used and (2) a final methodology would not be determined until after  the necessary research was completed. The Census Bureau did not  provide a date when the methodology would be incorporated.", "In our review of Census Bureau presentations about the new methodology  (described in detail in appendix V), we found that it had no plans to  maintain time-series consistency of the population and housing controls  by routinely incorporating the regular revisions to ICPE estimates into the  ACS. Without such revisions, there could be a significant lack of  comparability in the ACS data being averaged, and the reliability of  multiyear estimates would be reduced. For example, without such  revisions, the 2008\u201312 averages that are to replace the 2010 Decennial  Census long form would be based on controls extrapolated from the   2000 Census for 2008\u201309 and controls from the 2010 Census for   2010\u201312. In addition, time-series consistency in the annual ACS data would  be reduced, especially in the data for 2010 and previous years. Census  Bureau officials told us that they were not planning any such revisions,  unless the inconsistencies between 2010 ICPE and 2010 Census  characteristics were significant, even though there were significant  inconsistencies between the 2000 ICPE estimates and the 2000 Census  data, especially for small geographic areas.", "We found that regularly incorporating all revisions to ICPE into the ACS  would improve ACS reliability and that planning would give users advance  notice on the Census Bureau\u2019s revision practice. The need for such  planning is critical, as evidenced by the failure that occurred in January  2004, when a revised set of ICPE data was incorporated into the  calculation of monthly CPS data on employment. Initially, the revised  employment estimates were released without a revision of the   pre-2004 data, resulting in a significant discontinuity between December  2003 and January 2004. As a result of users\u2019 dissatisfaction about the  discontinuity, a consistent set of employment estimates was released.", "Finally, failure to adequately involve stakeholders in the decision process  may contribute to significant misunderstanding about the use of the ACS  estimates and corresponding estimates from the Decennial Census. In past  decennial censuses, except for the very smallest geographic areas, the  population and housing characteristics data published as part of the long- form detail were the same as the official data based on data collected on  the short form.

These issues (described in detail in appendix  V) include problems with questionnaire design, nonresponse followup, and  data capture, as well as coverage of persons living in group quarters.", "For example, the Census Bureau conducted a study to evaluate the design  of the ACS questions that are needed to implement the residence concept  and reference period for the ACS. The study suggested that additional  testing was needed for the questions about multiple residences and noted  \u201cthat asking these questions on a person basis may produce different and  probably better data than asking them on a household basis.\u201d Similarly,  the authors found potential problems with the identification of seasonal  residents. We were not able to identify in the Census Bureau\u2019s plans  whether these issues would be addressed before implementation of the  full ACS.", "We also found, for the implementation of the full ACS for 2005, that the  Census Bureau had addressed only the inclusion of group quarters and  that it may not resolve the issue of questionnaire design until 2010. In  addition, even for group quarters, it is planning for improvements that may  not be included until 2010. Furthermore, not all problems have been  identified because of the delays in the Census Bureau\u2019s completing the  evaluation studies of comparisons of long-form and ACS data items.  Moreover, the Census Bureau\u2019s plans do not provide for external  consultations on key decisions about resolving issues.", "Although the Census Bureau has acknowledged the importance of the  timing of incorporating changes to resolve the various issues, any delay in  implementing solutions to 2010 would not meet the needs of the ACS  collection and production schedule. For example, in its March 2003 ACS  operations plan, the Census Bureau recognized the need for maintaining  questionnaire continuity to calculate consistent multiyear averages. It also  has reported that it needs to incorporate changes in the ACS questionnaire  no later than 2008 because changes introduced after 2008 and before   2013 would create inconsistencies in calculating the 5-year averages that  are to replace the 2010 Decennial Census long form.

In a 2003 report prepared for BLS,  their consultant had made a number of recommendations about the  questions on employment.", "We found that the Census Bureau needs to develop a time schedule so that  changes can be introduced to minimize inconsistencies between the   2005 and subsequent ACS data and to ensure that all necessary changes  are made so that the ACS data for 2008\u201312 that will replace the 2010  Decennial Census long form will be collected consistently.

It makes a  similar inflation adjustment for the annual income data collected in the  CPS, but it releases the unadjusted estimates.

It is particularly critical for federal agencies that will be using  the ACS instead of the long form for many government programs to  determine the allocation of funds or program eligibility. It is also critical to  users of dollar-denominated items for small geographic areas because the  inflation adjustments under the current procedure are based on a national  average index.", "In our review of the development and implementation of the ACS, we  identified questions on the appropriateness of the methodology for the  adjustment and the suppression of the unadjusted annual values. A report  prepared for HUD found problems with the calculation of the adjustment  and the use of the adjustment for income measures used for HUD  programs. The report also noted that the lack of the unadjusted annual  data would severely limit HUD\u2019s use of calculations appropriate to its  program needs.

We found that the Census Bureau could estimate calendar  year values using a combination of past trends in related series,  information from other ACS respondents, or known information such as  changes in cost-of-living adjustments for various transfer payment  programs and changes in wage rates. We also found that converting ACS  data from monthly to calendar year data is similar to conversion issues  faced by other agencies that collect annual statistics compiled on a fiscal- year basis and that the procedures these agencies use could be adapted for  the ACS. With regard to the use of a national cost-of-living adjustment,  we have previously reported that for purposes such as allocating federal  funds to states using income and poverty data, the CPI, a national measure  of inflation, does not reflect variations in geographic areas. Census  Bureau staff have reported similar findings.", "The HUD and Census Bureau findings and our review raise serious  questions about the inflation adjustments.

We  found that stakeholders have urged the Census Bureau for many years to  provide guidance on the strengths and weaknesses of these averages. The  most recent request for guidance on using multiyear averages came in the  July 2003 report by the NAS Panel on Research on Future Census  Methods: \u201cThe Census Bureau should issue a user\u2019s guide that details the  statistical implications of the difference between point-in-time and moving  average estimates for various uses.\u201d In the report\u2019s executive summary,  the panel also stated that \u201cThe Census Bureau must do significant work in  informing data users and stakeholders of the features and the problems of  working with moving average-based estimates.\u201d It also expressed  particular concern about the use of the multiyear (or moving) averages in  fund allocation formulas.", "Stakeholders have requested guidance on topics such as (1) the reliability  of multiyear averages for areas with rapidly changing populations, (2) the  reliability of trends calculated from annual changes in multiyear averages,  and (3) the selection of ACS data for geographic areas with populations  larger than 20,000 for which there will be multiple estimates.

The  larger sample would have provided 3-year averages for all small  geographic areas for 2000 and would have provided data for the smallest  geographic areas of the same quality as the traditional long form.

Furthermore, the ACS implementation plan and the 2010 Decennial  Census test programs are not synchronized, and there is no  comprehensive program for external consultation on the resolution of  these issues.

(The Secretary\u2019s comments  are reprinted in appendix VI.) He disagreed with our recommendation that  the ACS evaluation and testing plan needed to be revised to focus on  issues we have identified in this report, stating that the current ACS testing  and evaluation plan already included these issues. In following up on the  Secretary's response, we learned that there is not yet a written plan, but  only a rough outline of the types of work planned. Therefore, we believe  our recommendation remains valid. The Secretary did not accept our  recommendation to provide key stakeholders more direct and timely input  into decisions on these issues because he believes that the present  consultation process is adequate. We disagree, because as noted in  Appendix II of our report, the Census Bureau has not been responsive to  recommendations from several National Academy of Sciences reports  relating to the ACS. The Secretary agreed with the recommendation that  the Census Bureau provide public documentation for key decisions on  issues we have identified in this report. The Secretary did not respond  directly to our recommendation that he direct the Census Bureau to  prepare a schedule for the 2010 Census that ensures that all necessary  changes are made in time for the 2008 ACS so the 5-year ACS averages for  2008-2012 will be an adequate replacement for the 2010 long form for small  geographic areas.", "The Secretary provided comments on the five major outstanding issues  that, in our view, jeopardize the ACS as a replacement of the long form:  lack of methodology for independent controls, operational issues not  addressed, questionable plans for dollar-denominated items, incomplete  evaluations and lack of information on ACS time-series consistency, and  lack of information about multiyear averages.", "The Secretary disagreed with our findings about the lack of a methodology  for independent population and housing controls.  He stated that a  methodology for the ACS was already in place. On the issue that changes  to that methodology are needed to account for the difference in the ACS  residence concept, the Secretary agreed that a change was needed but  stated that it could be delayed for several more years. On the issue of  independent controls for subcounty areas, he stated that the Census  Bureau had no plans to develop such controls, which we found were used  for the 2000 Census long form, but that it might develop such controls  using data from the ACS or administrative records. However, he did not  respond to our findings about the use of existing subcounty area data from  the ICPE or from the 2010 Census short form. The Secretary stated that  the Census Bureau also had no plans to revise the ICPE. On the issue of  the ACS reference period, the Secretary reported that the Census Bureau  had recently decided to assume that July 1 would be used as the reference  period. The Secretary did not comment on GAO\u2019s findings about the lack  of plans to incorporate into the ACS 2010 Census data and related  revisions to the ICPE estimates for previous years.", "We disagree with the Secretary\u2019s comments about the independent  subcounty population and housing controls and believe that their use in  the ACS is needed for the ACS to be an adequate replacement for the 2010  Census long form for small geographical areas. We found that independent  controls from the 2000 Census short form were used for detailed  geographic areas for the 2000 Census long form and that differences in  counts of population and housing (occupied and vacant) between the long  form and the short form were limited to the smallest geographic areas.   The similar use of 2010 Census short-form counts in the ACS also would  minimize differences in these counts from the ACS and the 2010 Census.  Consequently, we disagree with the Bureau\u2019s plan not to commit to the  development of subcounty controls and its plans not to base these  controls on ICPE total population and housing estimates, which are  prepared annually for all general government units, and the more detailed  and reliable data from the 2010 Census short form.", "We also disagree with the Secretary that the implementation of a new  methodology for independent controls with subcounty controls and the  new residence concept can wait until 2008. As we noted in our report, we  found that controls for subcounty areas with population of more than  65,000 will be needed before the 2005 ACS estimates are released for these  areas in 2006 and that controls for subcounty areas with populations of  more than 20,000 will be needed before the first multiyear averages are  released in 2008.  (For the 2000 Census long form, controls for most areas  of this size were from the 2000 Census short form.) With regard to the new  residence concept, a decision to delay introducing a new methodology  until 2008 would create time-series inconsistencies between 2000\u20132007  and 2008 and subsequent years. These inconsistencies could be very  significant for geographic areas with a large population of seasonal  residents.", "The Secretary did not comment on our findings about the need for a  methodology to revisions relating to the ICPE into the ACS. We found that  this methodology, which is important to both the time-series consistency  of the annual ACS estimates and to the multiyear averages, is not covered  by the current ACS methodology, but that it will be needed when the 2010  Decennial Census short form data become available. We found that it has  been the Census Bureau\u2019s practice for the ICPE, whose estimates are used  as the independent controls for the ACS, to be benchmarked to the  decennial census short-form data and that it uses similar practices for  many other Census Bureau programs. For the ICPE, the Bureau will  replace the 2010 ICPE estimates with the 2010 Census data, and use the  differences in these estimates to revise the ICPE estimates back to the  previous benchmark year, which for 2010 will be 2001. (Table 4 of our  report shows the impact of benchmarking on county population data for  2000.) It should be noted that we found that this practice is not followed in  all Census Bureau programs. For example, for the Annual Economic and  Social Supplement to the CPS, the Census Bureau introduced the  benchmark information from the 2000 Decennial Census into the 2001  estimates and presented the data on both the old and the revised basis.   This approach, to present estimates on an old and new basis for a single  year, may be appropriate for an annual survey. However, GAO found that  because of the use of multiyear averages in the ACS, it is imperative that  the ACS estimates for all years beginning with 2001 be revised. Without  such a revision program, ACS estimates for 2010, which we assume will  not be released until the 2010 Census short-form data have been  incorporated, will be inconsistent with the 2009 estimates. In addition, the  ACS estimates for 2008 and 2009 used to calculate the 5-year averages that  will replace the 2010 Census long form will be based on controls that are  inconsistent with those for 2010\u201312. Based on the revisions for 2000 shown  in our report, there could be many significant inconsistencies, especially  for small geographic areas.", "Although the Secretary did not comment on the issue of revision, in its  technical comments on our draft report, the Census Bureau reported  (comment 22) that with regard to incorporating 2010 Census data, it has  decided \u201cto make appropriate changes to the  population controls  when necessary, including the possibility of reweighting the data around  the 2010 time period and for all multiyear estimates.\u201d We disagree with the  Census Bureau\u2019s approach primarily because it is not consistent with the  practices used by the Census Bureau to incorporate census data into  surveys and programs such as the ICPE and monthly retail sales that are  controlled or benchmarked to a census or similar data set.  For these  surveys, it revises all previously published data on a predetermined  schedule using a transparent statistical procedure. Most important, these  procedures do not depend on the size of revisions, which can only be  determined after a benchmark is completed. Regardless of the  benchmarking procedures adopted for the ACS, we believe that the  Census Bureau needs to have extensive consultation with external  stakeholders to make its decision. In addition, because of the complexity  of most benchmarking procedures, the Census Bureau needs to begin this  consultation as soon as possible.", "With regard to the recent Census Bureau decision about the reference  period for the ACS, we are pleased that a decision has been made because  any delay in this decision would have resulted in additional time-series  inconsistencies in the ACS. We have changed our report to reflect this  decision. Unfortunately, we have no documentation on the research  underlying the decision and, as has been the case in other key decisions,  we do not believe that there was any public discussion of this decision.", "The second issue identified in our report related to the operational aspects  of the ACS, including questionnaire design and the collection of data for  persons living in group quarters. On these issues, the Secretary limited his  comments to the questionnaires and addressed our findings that  improvements identified as part of the 2000 Census cognitive testing  research and research based on comparisons of ACS and 2000 Census  long-form data would not be completed until 2008. The Secretary noted  that the Census Bureau has resolved the issue of finalizing the ACS  questions, including the questions to be asked on the 2010 Census short  form before 2008. Although this recent decision appears to have resolved  the scheduling issue, we believe that uncertainties remain as to whether  this schedule can be met. For example, the ACS milestones in the latest  available schedule call for final approval of the questions by the Congress  and by OMB in 2008 and 2009, respectively, so that any changes made as a  result of these steps would not be incorporated into the 2008 questions.", "As the Census Bureau has recognized, failure to maintain consistency in  the questions for the 2008-2012 ACS will result in inconsistencies in the 5- year averages centered on 2010, which are the averages designed to  provide the small geographic area data that would have been collected on  the 2010 Census long form. In addition, the recently released ACS  evaluation reports identify issues on which new research is necessary,  including the issues with the questions on disability identified in our  report, but the Census Bureau has not indicated its plan to complete this  additional research or to consult with stakeholders about decisions related  to the research. Although the Secretary did not comment on our findings  with regard to group quarters, we remain concerned that the work on  group quarters being conducted as part of the 2004, 2006, and 2008 tests  for the 2010 Census will not be reflected in the ACS beginning with 2008.", "Our report also identified as unresolved issues the two inflation  adjustments that the Census Bureau is applying on all dollar-denominated  ACS items. The first adjustment is used to convert annual data collected  each month in the ACS to a calendar year basis. This adjustment  recognizes that the annual data collected in the ACS are for different  periods because the data are collected monthly and cover the previous 12  months. The second adjustment is used to present dollar-denominated  items in dollars of the most recent calendar year. This adjustment  eliminates the impact of inflation when comparing data across years. The  index used for both adjustments is the national-level CPI.  The Secretary  correctly observed that the CPI is a generally accepted measure of  inflation and that most federal programs that allocate funds do not use  regional measures of inflation. However, these observations did not  directly address GAO\u2019s findings about the adjustments or the concerns  raised by HUD in its report on future use of the ACS, which are discussed  in appendix V of our report. For example, the Secretary did not address  our finding about a lack of a rationale for adjusting items other than  incomes for changes in overall inflation rather than adjusting with indexes,  such as wage rates or rent, that are directly related to the item being  adjusted. He did indicate that the Census Bureau would reconsider its  present policy of showing only the inflation-adjusted annual estimates and  multiyear averages. We believe our findings about the need for the Census  Bureau to provide a comprehensive rationale for the two adjustments still  apply.", "The Secretary disagreed with the issue we identified on completeness of  the Census Bureau\u2019s comparison and evaluation reports. He noted that  after our draft report was completed, the Census Bureau released seven  additional comparison reports and that it planned to prepare additional  reports to evaluate issues we identified on the time-series consistency of  the annual ACS estimates. However, despite earlier statements by the  Census Bureau to compare and evaluate differences between state-level  estimates from the Census 2000 Supplementary Survey (C2SS) and the  2000 Census long form, these reports did not include any reference to the  preparation of such comparisons, and the Secretary did not indicate they  would be prepared. Because the focus of the long form and the ACS is on  data from small geographic areas, we believe that reports on states and on  other areas with population of 250,000 or more should be prepared.", "The last issue we identified was the need to provide users with guidance  on the interpretation of key properties of multiyear averages. The  Secretary agreed about the need but noted that guidance is not needed in  2005. He reported on a newly created NAS panel that will be studying  many of the key issues identified in our report. However, we believe that  the Census Bureau should begin to release guidance on the averages  before the first multiyear averages are released in 2008. One area in which  such guidance will be needed is the interpretation and use of the multiple  ACS estimates. When the 2005\u201307 averages are released in 2008, users will  have annual estimates for some of these areas for 2006 as well as the 3- year averages, which will be centered on 2006. In 2010, when the first 5- year averages are released (2005\u201309), users will have three sets of ACS  estimates for places with populations larger than 20,000. For example, for  each state, there will be an annual estimate for 2007 as well as 3-year and  5-year averages centered on 2007.", "The comments from the Secretary also include a list of detailed technical  comments from the Census Bureau. We reviewed each of these comments  and revised the report where appropriate.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you release the report\u2019s contents  earlier, we plan no further distribution of it until 30 days from its issue  date.

(The ACS estimates are weighted to a population  benchmark, either the most recent Decennial Census results or the most  recent ICPE estimates.) The Census Bureau reported that because the  accuracy of the intercensal estimates is important to overall ACS  accuracy, it is important to use ACS data wherever appropriate to improve  the intercensal estimates. The plan for the program on integrated  estimates will use information from the 2000 Census, more current ACS  distributions of population characteristics, and administrative records to  produce improved population and housing unit estimates for all areas,  including small areas. The plan also discussed improving housing  characteristics by incorporating ACS distributions of local area vacancy  rates and household characteristics into statistical models to better  estimate subcounty populations. No time schedule for completing the  research was provided.", "Finally, the March 2003 American Community Survey Operations Plan,  Release 1 discussed a plan in the ACS to cover group quarters. Persons  living in group quarters live in places that the Census Bureau does not  classify as housing units\u2014for example, nursing homes, prisons, college  dormitories, military barracks, institutions for juveniles, and emergency  and transitional shelters for the homeless. Such residences accounted for  roughly 2.8 percent of the population in 2000. Although data on group  quarters were collected at the test sites beginning with 1999, data were not  collected in C2SS or subsequent supplementary surveys. The operations  plan discussed the use of an updated Census 2000 Special Places file for  the sampling frame for the full ACS. In this case, the plan noted, training  field representatives on collecting data from this population is to begin in  October 2004, so that full data collection production can begin in January  2005.", "Census Bureau staff made a presentation on comparison and evaluation  reports at the April 2003 meetings of the Census Advisory Committee. The  paper\u2019s author reported that work was under way on the comparison  reports noted in the March 2003 operations plan, and she described the  methodology to be used to evaluate differences between the 2000 long  form and C2SS. She also reported that the results of the comparisons  would be used to identify how the ACS should be improved but that  additional research would be needed to address consistency over time  between the 2000 Census and the full ACS. She stressed the importance of  evaluating consistency \u201cin educating users on the transition from the  decennial census sample estimates to the ACS estimates.\u201d", "With regard to the comparison report of selected demographic, housing,  social, and economic characteristics of 3-year estimates from the ACS test  sites to the 2000 Census, the Census Bureau let four contracts with local  experts to conduct comparisons of 3-year averages of ACS data for   1999\u20132001 for selected test sites with selected 2000 Census long-form data  as well as 2000 Census population and housing unit characteristics. The  comparisons, prepared at the county and census tract levels, would be  made for measures of data quality (self-response rates, sample unit  nonresponse rates, item nonresponse rates, and sample completeness  ratios), as well as for data levels (counts, percentages, means, and  medians) for demographic, social, economic, and housing characteristics.", "In summer 2003, Census Bureau staff presented a number of research  papers on the ACS at the annual Joint Statistical Meetings. Papers  evaluated differences between long-form and C2SS data items, such as  persons with disabilities, educational attainments, and income. Most of the  papers that provided comparisons with long-form data indicated whether  differences were statistically significant for every comparison.  Comparisons were presented at a variety of geographic levels (national,  state, and test site levels). Some papers cited operational differences as  possible explanatory factors, but information was not presented using a  standard set of factors.", "The Census Bureau published ACS-2010 Census Consistency Review  Plan, an internal document, at the beginning of October 2003. Its purpose  was to identify methods for major operations used in the ACS and for the  2010 Census that were likely to lead to inconsistent results and to  recommend ways to address these inconsistencies. Papers prepared on  these operations were to discuss how an issue might result in  inconsistencies between the ACS and 2010 Census results and to set forth  options for dealing with consistency issues, including a research process.  The plan identified residence rules and group quarters as two topics. It did  not discuss completing the work in time to incorporate it into the full ACS  in the next several years.", "Also in October 2003, the Census Bureau made two public announcements  related to the ACS development plan at the Census Advisory Committee  meetings. Two papers related directly to projects described in American  Community Survey Operations Plan, Release 1. In \u201cEnhancing the  Intercensal Population Estimates Program with ACS Data: Summary of  Research Projects,\u201d Weidman and Wetrogan reported on research to  improve the intercensal estimates by using ACS data for two \u201chigh  priority\u201d areas\u2014international migration and internal migration. This work  was being conducted within the Program of Integrated Estimates. The  second paper described options for determining population control  weights for ACS implementation in fall 2004 but did not indicate that  research was under way to determine the effect of the options.", "Another source of information related to ACS development was the  various reports prepared as part of the Census 2000 Testing,  Experimentation, and Evaluation Program. Schneider\u2019s January   2004 report compared employment, income, and poverty estimates from  the 2000 Census long form and the CPS. From this comparison, the  author concluded that this work should be continued in an effort to use  the results of the comparisons to improve consistency between data  collected in the CPS and data in the ACS; the ACS uses the same questions  as the 2000 long form. The author also identified for additional research  long-form questions that performed badly, based on a reinterview survey.", "From May to July 2004, the Census Bureau released seven ACS evaluation  reports. Four reports compared data from the 2000 Census long form and  the C2SS at the national level. Two reports compared these long-form data  with 1999-2001 data from the ACS test sites for selected counties and one  of these compared these data at the tract level. The other report reviewed  operational data from the 2001 and 2002 supplementary surveys. In most  of the reports comparing long-form and ACS data, the Census Bureau  identified additional work that was needed to improve the quality of the  ACS estimates or to help explain differences between the two sets of data  for 2000.

Controls will be needed at the same level of geographic area detail as  those that were used for the 2000 Census long form and will need to reflect  the new concepts of residence and reference period underlying the ACS.", "For the annual ACS supplementary surveys, these characteristics were  used from ICPE as the independent controls. ICPE uses Decennial Census  short-form data as benchmarks and administrative record data to  interpolate between and extrapolate from the census benchmarks. The  program provides \u201cofficial\u201d annual estimates of population and housing  characteristics at the county level, and for some subcounty levels, as of  July 1 of each year, using the usual residence concept for seasonal  residents. The program also provides annual estimates of total population  and housing units for all areas of general-purpose government, such as  cities, villages, towns, and townships. Table 3 shows information on the  calculation of the independent controls used for the 2000 Census long  form, the ACS supplementary series, and the fully implemented ACS  through 2012.", "Using ICPE for the ACS supplementary surveys, the Census Bureau  prepared controls for counties, or combinations of counties. As shown in  table 3, for the residence concept, controls from the 2000 Census and  ICPE, which were based on the usual residence concept, were used. The  reference period for the ACS test program for all years except 2000 was  for July 1; for 2000, it was for April 1. (Controls for the 2000 Census long  form also were for April 1.)", "For the full ACS, the Census Bureau will use controls based on the current  residence concept. According to the Census Bureau, the current residence  concept recognizes that the place of residence does not have to be the  same throughout a year, so that the current residence concept allows the  ACS data to more closely reflect the actual characteristics of each area.  The Census Bureau will use the current residence concept because the  ACS is conducted every month and produces annual averages rather than  point-in-time estimates, as the Decennial Census does. Also, because the  ACS data are collected monthly, it will be necessary to use independent  controls that define the reference period as the average for the year using  a July 1 reference period.", "To produce ACS estimates for the full sample, the Census Bureau will  need new methodologies for calculating independent controls. For the  first annual estimates, for 2005, a methodology will be needed to provide  ACS-defined controls for all places with population of 65,000 or more,  including those for which intercensal population estimates are not  available. For the 2005\u201307 estimates, which will be used to calculate the  first multiyear averages, a methodology for controls for geographic areas  with populations between 20,000 and 65,000 will be needed. For the   2008\u201312 estimates, a methodology for controls down to the geographic  levels used for the 2000 Census long form will be needed. Finally, when  the population and housing characteristics data from the 2010 Census  short form become available and are incorporated into the ICPE estimates,  another new methodology will be needed to revise the ACS controls for  2010.", "The Census Bureau also has reported that it is not planning to revise  earlier years\u2019 ACS data for consistency with revised 2010 estimates unless  the inconsistencies between the 2010 ICPE and 2010 Census  characteristics were significant. Table 4 shows the differences between  population estimates at the county level for 2000 using ICPE based on the  1990 Census and the corresponding data from the 2000 Census. In   2000, the population estimates for almost 20 percent of the counties  differed by more than 5 percent. For counties whose population was  smaller than 20,000, almost 25 percent had similar differences.", "Census Bureau staff had long recognized the need for new methodologies  to develop independent controls for the ACS. For example, a 1995 paper  by Love, Dalzell, and Alexander, discussing issues related to evaluating the  1996 test site results, expressed concern about independent controls and  residence rules, as well as the need for consultation with users. In   1998, the Census Bureau sponsored a conference on the quality of ACS  data for rural data users. In the final report on this conference, the Westat  authors concluded that the Census Bureau needed to continue and expand  its contacts with stakeholders and to conduct additional research on  several issues, including independent controls. Alexander and Wetrogan  also discussed this issue at the 2000 Joint Statistical Meetings when they  reviewed possible methods for using ICPE estimates. They also noted the  need to consult with users on how to present information on the  differences in ACS controls and ICPE in ACS publications.", "Census Bureau staff also recognized that the new ACS would create  differences between (1) ACS population and housing characteristics data  and the corresponding \u201cofficial\u201d data from the Decennial Census and   (2) ACS population and housing characteristics data and the \u201cofficial\u201d  ICPE population estimates, which are benchmarked to Decennial Census  data. They also recognized that the creation of new controls for the ACS  would result in inconsistencies between ACS data and data from federal  household surveys, such as the CPS, whose population and housing  characteristics are also based on the Decennial Census and ICPE  estimates. Such differences might hinder the use of ACS data to expand  and improve small geographic area estimates based on the other surveys.  (CPS provides official national estimates of labor force information, such  as the unemployment rate and income estimates used to calculate the  number of persons in poverty.)", "In March 2003, the Census Bureau announced that it did not have a final  methodology and that such methodologies would not be established for  several years. In March 2003 in American Community Survey Operations  Plan, Release 1, the Census Bureau identified research projects to be  completed in preparation for full implementation of the ACS. One of these  projects, \u201cweighting and estimation,\u201d covered the methodology for  calculating the independent controls for the ACS; a second, \u201cprogram of  integrated estimates,\u201d covers the calculation of these controls from the  ICPE. This plan also reported that the results of these research projects  would not be available in 2004 to begin implementing them with the start  of the full ACS. Instead, the Census Bureau said it would use interim  procedures and that it would take \u201cextensive long-term investigation and  experimentation\u201d to develop final procedures.", "For the weighting and estimation project, the Census Bureau reported that  it would be using an interim adjustment to adjust the intercensal  population and housing characteristics estimates to the ACS residence and  reference period concepts. This project would include research to  examine the need to achieve agreement between the estimates of occupied  housing units, households, and householders at all geographic levels. The  Census Bureau reported that work on the project to revise and simplify  the weighting methodology began in early 2003, that preliminary papers  documenting the revisions might be available by summer 2004, and that  research would continue for several years.", "For the program of integrated estimates project, the operations plan  discussed the need for more research to introduce improvements to the  ICPE estimates using information from the 2000 Census, more current  ACS distributions of population characteristics, and administrative  records to produce improved population and housing unit estimates for all  areas, including small geographic areas. The plan also discussed improving  the housing characteristics. ACS distributions of local area vacancy rates  and household characteristics can be incorporated into statistical models  that use distributions of housing unit characteristics to better estimate  subcounty populations. No time schedule was provided for completing the  research.", "In October 2003, Census Bureau staff presented a paper at the Census  Advisory Committee meetings that described the options being considered  to convert the ICPE estimate to the current residence concept.

This  work was being conducted as part of the Program of Integrated  Estimates. \u201cGiven the newly benchmarked intercensal estimates, the following question arises  regarding the use of the 2010 Census data in the ACS: Should ACS estimates continue to be  controlled to 2010 Census data at the county or county group level and differences between  the ACS and census population counts and characteristics allocated proportionately to the  tract or block group levels? Or should ACS estimates be controlled to 2010 Census data at  the tract and block group level, as would have been the case with a long form?\u201d", "All the experts agreed that the ACS should be controlled to the decennial  census, but several noted that they had not thought about the issue and  had not heard anything from the Census Bureau on the issue.

These issues include  problems with questionnaire design, nonresponse followup, and data  capture, as well as coverage of persons living in group quarters.", "In January 2004, the Census Bureau released the results of a key  evaluation study of 2000 Decennial Census long-form data, using a  reinterview survey. The study identified problems with long-form  questions, which are the same as those used for the ACS, and proposed  several research efforts based on a statistical evaluation of the quality of  the responses to each question. For questions identified as having  significant quality problems, the study recommended research on the  design of the form and placement of the questions and suggested using  cognitive experts in testing revised questions. The study also  recommended that the Census Bureau and BLS work on the ACS  employment and unemployment questions to ensure that they would  complement the BLS local area unemployment statistics program.", "The Census Bureau also conducted a study to evaluate the design of the  ACS questions that are needed to implement the residence concept and  reference period for the ACS. The study suggested that additional testing  was needed for the questions about multiple residences (currently, the last  set of questions in the housing section). It noted \u201cthat asking these  questions on a person basis may produce different and probably better  data than asking them on a household basis.\u201d The study was limited in  scope and did not assess how accurately ACS respondents assign persons  associated with the household to a current residence.", "In the ACS, the Bureau uses \u201cIn the past 12 months . . .\u201d whereas the  Census Bureau used \u201cIn 1999 . . .\u201d for the long form. Because the reference  date is not fixed, it is important for a respondent to supply the date that  the ACS questionnaire filled out. Otherwise, it cannot be determined  whether there is an inconsistency in an ACS questionnaire received in late  April 2004 that lists a resident aged 10 with a birthdate of April 15, 1993.", "Census Bureau staff also discussed operational issues in research papers,  based on evaluations of comparisons between 2000 Decennial Census  long-form and ACS 2000 supplementary survey data for selected items  presented at the 2003 Joint Statistical Meetings. A paper on income data  identified the new question on the reference period as a potential source  of problems, even though an additional instruction had been added to the  ACS questionnaire in 1999. The authors expressed concern that some  ACS respondents may misinterpret the question on \u201cincome in the past   12 months\u201d as a request for monthly income instead of income during the  previous year. The paper also included recommendations for additional  research on the effect of the data capture methods. For the 2000 long  form, all data items were entered with an automated optical character  recognition procedure; data from the ACS will be manually keyed.", "Another paper, presented at the same 2003 meetings, that evaluated  differences in the data on disabled persons found large and significant  differences at the national level and also recommended that new questions  be tested. Additional areas were identified for further research, based on  evaluations of questions such as educational enrollment, ancestry, and  grandparents caring for grandchildren. These areas included specific  facets of the mailout-mailback system and nonresponse followup. For  example, nonresponse follow-up for the 2000 long form was conducted for  all nonrespondents, but for the ACS test program and for the full ACS,  nonresponse follow-up will be conducted for a sample of one-third on all  nonrespondents.", "The Census Bureau also has discussed issues with the expansion of ACS  coverage to include persons living in group quarters\u2014for example, nursing  homes, prisons, college dormitories, military barracks, institutions for  juveniles, homeless shelters. In October 2002, it informed its advisory  committee members of the formation of a special planning team to  address issues on the definition of group quarters and duplication in the  address file. From the minutes of this meeting, it appears that this team  will focus on group quarters in the context of the 2010 Census short form.  In the ACS March 2003 operations plan, the Census Bureau reported on a  new project to cover group quarters in the full ACS. The Census Bureau  reported that the special project was needed because of the special  challenges of developing an updated address list; in the past, such a list  had been updated only once a decade. According to the Census Bureau,  tests on the new list were to be completed in time for use in the full ACS in  January 2005. In addition, an internal planning document issued in  October 2003 identified group quarters (and residence rules) as special  problems and instructed staff to provide recommendations on the  collection of data on them in January 2004.

For example, ACS data for  2001 and 2002 released in September 2003 for median household income  are expressed in 2002 dollars. This practice means that when each added  year of ACS data is released, all dollar-denominated items for prior years  will be revised. The Census Bureau makes a similar adjustment for the  annual income data collected in the CPS. Unlike the ACS, the Census  Bureau releases annual CPS data without the adjustment. In addition, the  annual values collected in the ACS were adjusted to the calendar year. It  will be using the CPI for the annual and monthly adjustments for all  geographic areas.", "A report prepared for HUD found problems with the adjustment, including  (1) the lack of a \u201ctrending\u201d adjustment in the calculation of annual  averages, (2) the use of the adjustment for multiyear averages, (3) the  adjustment for cost of living for data items other than income, and (4) the  lack of the unadjusted annual data that would enable HUD to use  alternative methodologies. In addition, research by Census Bureau staff  questioned the adjustment for incomes when they found that it was a  probable source of difference between income data from the  supplementary survey and corresponding data from the CPS and the   2000 Census long form. \u201cMaking an inflation adjustment is not the same as trending. The cost of living adjustment  assumes that the purchasing power measured at any point in the data collection period  remains constant throughout the period. For example, assume that the cost of living rises  by 3 percent a year. If a household reports an annual income of $50,000 in January, a cost  of living adjustment to the end of the year would increase this income to $51,500, the  amount needed in December to equal the purchasing power of $50,000 in January. A  trending adjustment makes no assumption about purchasing power. It attempts to track  movements in dollar income. Assume that dollar income is growing at 5 percent a year.", "Then a trending adjustment to the end of the year would increase the $50,000 reported in  January to $52,500 in December.\u201d \u201cThe Census Bureau plans to report income in constant dollars. Income information  collected in the various months will be adjusted for inflation so that all collected income  will be expressed in dollars with the same purchasing power, presumably the purchasing  power of dollars in December of the survey year. For moving average tabulations, all  income information will be adjusted for changes in purchasing power over the period used  to calculate the moving average. In other words, income reported by a respondent in the  first month of a five-year moving average will be adjusted for almost five years of  inflation.\u201d \u201cThe standard Census Bureau tables for areas over 65,000 will tabulate the rents reported  by respondents over the twelve months during which data were collected. A unit reporting  a contract rent of $800 in January might actually be paying $850 in December. The standard  table would record this unit as having a rent of $800. The standard Census Bureau tables  for areas under 20,000 will tabulate rents reported by respondents over a sixty-month  period. A unit reporting a contract rent of $800 in the January of the first year might  actually be paying $1,070 in December of the fifth year. The standard table would record  this unit as having a rent of $800.\u201d", "Such changes would not be captured with an adjustment based on the all- items CPI. \u201cThe ACS will generate income distributions comparable to those from the decennial  census, but the distributions will have a feature that will complicate the use of income data  from the ACS in APP  measures. Whereas the decennial  long form measures money income, the ACS reports average purchasing power.\u201d", "The report thus recommended that HUD use the unadjusted data\u2014data  that the Census Bureau had not planned to publish\u2014in order to make the  changes needed for HUD. \u201cIf no CPI adjustment had been made to the dollars reported on either Census 2000 or  C2SS/ACS, the difference between medians at the U.S. level would have been smaller than  the 4.6 percent shown in Table 3 . Instead, the difference would have been 2.5  percent. Since adjustment clearly played a role in determining the size of the difference  between Census 2000 and C2SS/ACS estimates, it would be worthwhile to examine the  costs and benefits of adjusting C2SS/ACS incomes as well as the choice of factors used to  adjust them.\u201d", "The authors summarized their findings by concluding that \u201cit is clear that  we are just at the beginning stages of understanding why Census 2000 and  C2SS income figures differ.\u201d They noted that the income comparisons are  most critical because these Census Bureau data are used in the calculation  of the number of people in poverty.", "In a December 2003 research paper, Census Bureau staff examined  concerns about the absence from the official poverty measures of  adjustment for geographic differences in cost of living. Like the ACS, for  which the Census Bureau is assuming that the cost of living is the same  throughout all geographic areas, the poverty measures are based on the  same assumption.

This data  collection will allow for comparison of estimates from Census 2000 with estimates from the  ACS for all states, large cities, and population subgroups, and will help data users and the  Census Bureau understand the differences between estimates from the ACS and the  Census 2000 long form.\u201d \u201cThese data will also contribute to a comparison with data from Census 2000 that is  necessary because there are differences in methods and definitions between the census  and the ACS. Moreover, decision makers will want to compare an area\u2019s data to those from  Census 2000.

The  Census Bureau repeated this schedule in March 2003 when it released  another official report on ACS plans. In September, we were told by one  of the ACS experts that consultants had been hired to conduct evaluations  for 4 of the 31 test sites. The reports on comparisons with long-form items  and for the test sites were published in May, June, and July 2004.", "The results of these comparisons are similar to comparisons and  evaluations of long-form data items previously prepared by Census Bureau  staff, BLS, and GAO. \u201cThese comparisons showed large national differences for key items that did not appear to  be accounted for by coverage differences between the two surveys. For example, at the  national level, the largest differences were for these items: (1) for the number of housing  units lacking complete plumbing facilities, with the long-form estimate 27 percent higher  than the estimate from the supplementary survey, and (2) for the number of unpaid family  workers, with the long-form estimate 59 percent lower. . . . We also found a great degree of  variation in the state differences between the long form and the supplementary survey.\u201d \u201cWe found that at the national and state levels, there were small differences for the  unemployment rate and for the poverty rate for all individuals. In contrast, comparisons of  these rates for the CPS with these two surveys showed larger differences. The national  unemployment rate, according to the CPS, was 4.0 percent, compared with 5.8 percent for  the long form and 5.4 percent for the supplementary survey. The national rate for  individuals in poverty for the CPS was 11.3 percent, compared with 12.4 percent for the  long form and 12.5 percent for the supplementary survey.\u201d", "Given these results, we recommended that the Census Bureau expand the  scope of evaluation studies to develop supplementary survey estimates for  states and large places consistent with the 2000 long form and that it  include in its evaluations comparisons of year-to-year changes for   2001 and 2002, using data from the supplementary surveys and the CPS at  the national and state levels for key economic and housing items. \u201cRelative to the CPS, the ACS consistently generates lower estimates of the labor force and  employment but higher estimates of unemployment. These patterns are present in each of  the years 2000, 2001, and 2002. They are repeated in nearly all state-level data as well.\u201d", "He made a series of recommendations for additional research, some  requiring additional information from the Census Bureau. \u201cprovided a summary of the major differences between the two income data sources, in  terms of data collection, capture, and processing, and provided very preliminary  assessments of the possible role these differences may have played.\u201d", "The authors reported that additional work was needed to understand the  differences and offered recommendations for further research.", "Another paper presented at the same meetings examined differences  between the national estimates for people aged 5 or older with a  disability\u201448.9 million was the 2000 Census long-form estimate,   39.7 million the C2SS estimate.

In addition, the author reported that  more work, such as additional analysis of currently available data and  testing of new questions, was needed to clearly identify the reasons for the  difference. The differences in disability data were also the subject of a  National Council on Disability position paper, which recommended  changes to the questions on disability. \u201cThe Census Bureau should carry out more research to understand the differences between  and relative quality of ACS estimates and long-form estimates, with particular attention to  measurement error and error from nonresponse and imputation. The Census Bureau must  work on ways to effectively communicate and articulate those findings to interested  stakeholders, particularly potential end users of the data.\u201d \u201cThe Census Bureau should make ACS data available (protecting confidentiality) to  analysts in the 31 ACS test sites to facilitate the comparison of ACS and census long-form  estimates as a means of assessing the quality of ACS data as a replacement for census long- form data. Again, with appropriate safeguards, the Census Bureau should release ACS data  to the broader research community for evaluation purposes.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Information on Key Properties of Multiyear Averages", "paragraphs": ["One of the major differences between the ACS and the long form it will  replace is that the ACS will provide data for geographic areas with  populations smaller than 65,000 in terms of multiyear averages. Because of  the statistical properties of these averages and users\u2019 unfamiliarity with  them, we and many other stakeholders have identified these averages as a  major challenge for users, including federal agencies. The Census Bureau  has recognized the need for such guidance on the averages but has not  made public plans for the topics to be discussed or when the guidance will  be published. \u201cIn discussing this issue, a number of the participants thought that averages were  particularly problematic for those areas in which change is irregular. For example, the  question was raised as to the meaning of \u2018average poverty\u2019 over a 5-year period in which  poverty rose and fell from one year to the next and, thus, the average would have no  obvious meaning.\u201d", "The report made similar comments with regard to such characteristics as  unemployment and income. Although the conference participants had  generally agreed with these concerns, the report pointed out that annually  updating the 5-year averages \u201cwill provide some insight into trends,  although turning points will be difficult to discern precisely, as will short- term trends.\u201d \u201cAlthough a 5-year moving average will generally provide reasonably reliable cross-section  statistics for all areas, including very small communities, some care will have to be  exercised in choosing time periods for which changes in population or their characteristics  are measured. With 5-year averages, four-fifths of the data in a pair of neighboring years  will be identical. The change being measured will then be one-fifth of the difference  between the most recent year and the first year of the earlier time period. The sampling  errors of the differences will thus be based on annual sample sizes, not 5-year averages,  and will generally be too large to make useful inferences for small areas. The two 5-year  averages that are being compared should generally be discrete and non-overlapping  periods, e.g., 2003\u20132007 and 2008\u20132012. These comparisons will have about the same  reliability as changes between two censuses using data collected in the Census long  form.\u201d \u201cencourage analysts to use the same length of cumulation when comparing areas of  different sizes . . . . For example, we would use one year for comparing states, but would  recommend 5 years for all the counties in a table comparing large and small counties.\u201d", "Alexander noted that this approach differed from that of Kish, the  developer of the concept of a \u201crolling sample,\u201d who would \u201clet us use  tables of counties with one-year estimates for large counties, 3-year  averages for medium-sized ones, and 5-year averages for small ones.\u201d He  concluded this section of the paper by saying, \u201cIt will be interesting to see  what practices data users will adopt in this regard.\u201d \u201cIf there is little change in the population over the time covered by the average, the  interpretation is about the same as that of a point-in-time estimate with the advantage that  the ACS estimate is more current than the historical decennial census long-form  estimate.\u201d", "The paper provided examples with \u201cnaive\u201d assumptions about how users  extrapolate between censuses to show that multiyear averages \u201cwork.\u201d By  implication, under other conditions, users will need guidance on when  multiyear averages can be used. The paper also did not discuss the  interpretation of changes in the multiyear averages, as in the 1999 Westat  conference report or multiple estimates, which Alexander had discussed  in his paper for the 2001 Statistics Canada conference.", "In September 2002, two reports focused on issues related to the statistical  properties of multiyear averages. We published a report on several aspects  of the ACS, including the selection of questions and the feasibility of  conducting the ACS as a voluntary survey, and HUD released a report  prepared for its staff on the use of the ACS for HUD programs. \u201cAnalyze and report on differences between year-to-year changes for 2001 and 2002, using  the data\u2014from ACS special supplements and the CPS at the national and state levels\u2014for  key economic and housing characteristics, such as the unemployment and poverty rates, to  determine the stability of the annual ACS data.\u201d", "We also discussed the need for additional information on the  characteristics of the multiyear averages to help federal agencies make the  transition to the ACS. We specifically noted the need for information on  the selection of ACS data for geographic areas with populations larger  than 20,000 for which there will be multiple estimates. On this issue, we  stated that, \u201cIn addition, we found that the ACS development program did  not cover information about different ways to integrate the annual data for  states and large counties and the 3- and 5-year averages for smaller  counties.\u201d", "For example, federal agencies that need state data can choose to use the  annual data, multiyear averages of the annual data, or 3-year or 5-year ACS  averages. Federal agencies that also need county data can choose to use  the most recent annual data for large counties and adjust the averages of  the smaller counties to agree with annual data. Alternatively, they can  choose to use various combinations of multiyear averages. As many  federal agencies, as well as state and local governments, will be using the  ACS data for allocating funds, Census Bureau guidance would reduce the  inconsistent use of the multiple estimates.", "HUD is a major user of Decennial Census long-form data for various  program applications. Its contract with ORC Macro to review how the ACS  will affect HUD programs that previously relied on the Decennial Census  long form for geographic area data resulted in a report that made two  points about the multiyear averages, in addition to raising the previously  discussed issues on the inflation adjustment to income. One of these  issues related to interpretations of changes in the multiyear averages and  their stability; the other related to the availability of multiple estimates for  the same area.", "The ORC Macro report noted that year-to-year stability is important and  needs to be addressed. It warned that the \u201cdifferences in the precision of  estimates or year-to-year changes in estimates can create problems for  HUD applications.\u201d The report used eligibility and level of benefits as an  example of what could vary because of the effect of sampling variability  on these changes. ORC Macro also stated: \u201cThe ACS will report data using  different reporting periods for different sized areas. Inconsistent or  multiple reporting periods can create problems for HUD applications.\u201d  ACS data for many geographic areas will be available in terms of annual  estimates and 3- and 5-year averages, and the annual and 3-year averages  (for larger areas) will be available before estimates for smaller areas. As a  result, HUD will have to choose from multiple measures for some  geographic areas. The study noted that HUD might decide to (1) continue  to use 2000 long-form data until 2008, when the first 5-year average data  will be available for all levels of geography, or (2) use the most recently  available data in all cases.", "ORC Macro\u2019s report also expressed concern about the amount of annual  ACS data that the Census Bureau will release for areas with populations  smaller than 65,000, whose accuracy the Census Bureau has found does  not meet publication standards. According to the study, the Census  Bureau informed HUD that beginning in 2008, it would provide researchers  and planners a \u201cresearch file\u201d containing annual ACS data for areas of all  sizes, including census tracts. ORC Macro recommended that if the Census  Bureau does release these data, HUD consider using these \u201cunofficial\u201d  research file results in some of its applications. The study noted, however,  that if HUD decided to use these unofficial data but other agencies decided  not to use them, there would be no standardization across government  programs in funding allocation where the same ACS items were used. \u201cis a smoothed estimate; by averaging a particular time period\u2019s data observation with  those within a particular time window, the resulting estimate is meant to follow the general  trend of the series but not be as extreme as any of the individual points. The ramifications  of this basic concept emerge when moving average estimates are entered into sensitive  allocation formulas or compared against strict eligibility cutoffs. A smoothed estimate may  mask or smooth over an individual year drop in level of need, thus keeping the locality  eligible for benefits; conversely, it may also mask individual-year spikes in activity and thus  disqualify an area from benefits. It is clear that the use of smoothed estimates is neither  uniformly advantageous nor disadvantageous to a locality; what is not clear is how often  major discrepancies may occur in practice.\u201d \u201cIt is incorrect to use annual estimates based on moving averages over several years when  assessing change since some of the data are from overlapping time periods and hence  identical. At the least, the results will yield incorrect estimates of the variance of the  estimates of change. Therefore, users should be cautioned about this aspect of the use of  moving averages.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "External Consultation", "paragraphs": ["During the past decade\u2019s development of the ACS, the Census Bureau has  had many opportunities to consult with and take account of input from  stakeholders and users in making key decision on the programs. It has   (1) sponsored NAS panels, (2) held user conferences, (3) hired consultants  to organize two conferences, (4) met regularly with its advisory  committees and other user groups, and (5) encouraged its staff to present  reports at ASA meetings and meetings of similar professional  organizations. In the past several years, we and other federal agencies  have reported on the ACS and provided recommendations to the Census  Bureau. It established the ACS Federal Agency Information Program in  2003, responding to a recommendation we had made. It also announced  last year that it was looking into establishing a partnership with the  Congress and its oversight entities. \u201cEight years later, faced with the task of offering advice on making the vision of continuous  measurement a reality in the 2010 census, the similarity between the arguments then and  now is uncanny. Similar, too, are the points of concern; the current panel is hard-pressed to  improve upon the basic summary of concerns outlined by our predecessors. We are,  however, much more sanguine that a compelling case can be made for the ACS and that it  is a viable long-form replacement in the 2010 census.\u201d", "The Census Bureau has neither responded to the panel\u2019s first interim  report in 2000 nor indicated that the recommendations were being  adopted. The Census Bureau also has not responded to recommendations  and issues raised by HUD and BLS. For example, it has not responded to  HUD\u2019s recommendations on the ACS adjustments to dollar-denominated  items or to BLS\u2019s recommendations on the ACS labor force questions. (On  the issue of dollar-denominated items, we found no indication that the  Census Bureau had ever consulted outside experts about either the  methodology or the implementation.)", "Census Bureau summaries of discussion about the ACS at its Advisory  Committee meetings from October 2000 to April 2003 also indicate a lack  of responsiveness. During this period, committee members raised  concerns about the ACS. In particular, they made recommendations about  many of the issues we have discussed in this report, including the  evaluations of ACS and long-form comparisons, the new residence rules,  independent controls, ICPE, group quarters, and Spanish-language  questionnaires. At the April 2003 meeting, ASA committee members also  requested a change in the structure of the Advisory Committee meetings,  asking the Census Bureau to spend less time on update sessions and more  time on sessions devoted to gathering more detailed input, commentary,  and recommendations on topics the Census Bureau needs and wants  advice on.
