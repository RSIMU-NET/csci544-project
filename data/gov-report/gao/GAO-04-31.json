Although university scientists customarily seek to publish their research results in peer-reviewed journals, agencies cannot require such publication as a condition for funding because it is impossible to ensure in advance that the results will be accepted for publication. Agencies do, however, explicitly encourage funding recipients to make results public. The Departments of Agriculture, Defense, and Energy; the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) also disseminate the results of their funded research by posting them on their Web sites. Officials from these agencies said that posting the results is an effective way to share information among scientists, as well as with the public. In contrast, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) do not post research results on their Web sites. According to NIH officials, the risk associated with posting researchers' final reports before they have been validated by peer review is too great in the biomedical field. The Department of Education is considering how best to widely disseminate the results of research it funds. NIH and NSF are the only federal agencies that require universities to implement policies for identifying and managing possible financial conflicts of interest for the research they fund. The other six agencies do not have financial conflict of interest standards for university research grants. Of the 171 universities that responded to the GAO survey, 148 (87 percent) reported that all of their federally funded research is covered by financial conflict of interest policies that are consistent with either NIH's or NSF's standards. However, 17 universities reported that they do not extend either agency's requirements to cover research grants from other federal agencies. Unless federal agencies uniformly require that universities implement conflict of interest policies, the government cannot properly safeguard against financial conflicts of interest that might bias federally funded research."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["University research is a vital part of the nation\u2019s research and development  efforts. Because there is broad consensus that university research is a long- term, national investment in the future, the federal government has been  the primary source of funding for this research. In fiscal year 2001, federal  agencies provided $19 billion, or about 60 percent of all funding for  university research. Eight agencies\u2014the Departments of Agriculture,  Defense, Education, and Energy; the Environmental Protection Agency  (EPA); the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA); the  National Institutes of Health (NIH), within the Department of Health and  Human Services; and the National Science Foundation (NSF)\u2014obligated  97 percent of the university research funding, with NIH and NSF alone  accounting for $14.2 billion. The Office of Science and Technology Policy  (OSTP) coordinates the development of standard practices among federal  agencies through the National Science and Technology Council. For  example, the Council is undertaking a review of policies, procedures, and  plans relating to the business relationship between federal agencies and  research performers with the goal of improving the performance and  management of federally funded research.", "Historically, the primary return on the federal government\u2019s investment in  university research was the advancement of scientific knowledge. Science  progresses through open communication among scientists and the sharing  of research results. Publication of research results in peer-reviewed  scientific journals is an academic tradition that both validates and  disseminates these results.", "More recently, the federal investment in university research not only has  advanced scientific knowledge but also has yielded thousands of  inventions each year that have fostered the development of new  technologies, stimulated the creation of new jobs, and improved the quality  of life. For some universities, it has also yielded new streams of income  that helped to support their research and education missions. The Bayh- Dole Act of 1980 has facilitated commercialization of university technology  by giving universities, among others, the right to own their federally funded  inventions and license them to businesses. As the importance of university  research to technological innovation has increased, partnerships between  universities and businesses have also grown, giving rise to concerns that  financial conflicts of interest might restrict the dissemination of research  results or bias the conduct or results of federally funded research.", "Industry groups and others have also expressed concerns about the need,  in certain instances, for access to the scientific data that underlie the  published results of federally funded research. In response, in November  1999, the Congress enacted a provision, commonly called the Shelby  Amendment, requiring the Director of the Office of Management and  Budget (OMB) to amend Circular A-110 for universities, hospitals, and  other nonprofit organizations. Under this amendment, federal agencies are  directed to provide scientific data in response to a Freedom of Information  Act (FOIA) request if the published results of federally funded research are  used in developing a federal agency action that has the force and effect of  law.", "You requested that we examine federal agencies\u2019 actions to ensure that (1)  the results of the university research grants they fund are made available to  the public and (2) universities receiving such grants implement policies for  identifying and managing possible financial conflicts of interest. In  addition, as agreed with your office, appendix I provides information on  agencies\u2019 actions in implementing the Shelby Amendment. Our review  focused on the Departments of Agriculture, Defense, Education, and  Energy; EPA; NASA; NIH; and NSF. As part of our review, we conducted a  Web-based survey of the 200 universities that received the most federal  funding for research and development in fiscal year 2000. We received  responses from 171 universities, an 86 percent response rate. The  universities\u2019 aggregated responses are available at  http://www.gao.gov/special.pubs/gao-04-223sp."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 (Pub. L. No. 96-517, Dec. 12, 1980) has fostered  linkages between universities and businesses by giving universities, other  nonprofit organizations, and small businesses the option to retain title to  the inventions they make in the course of federally funded research. Before  1980, federal agencies generally retained title rights to any inventions made  in the course of the research they funded. Funding recipients seeking to  commercialize such inventions often faced long delays and uncertainty  when they asked the funding agencies to waive their rights. Since 1980,  universities have upgraded and expanded their technology licensing  efforts, particularly in such fields as biomedicine and computer technology.  Federal agencies and industry also substantially increased their funding of  university research\u2014federal funding grew from $8 billion (in 2001 dollars)  in fiscal year 1980 to $19.2 billion in fiscal year 2001, and industry funding  grew from $461 million (in 2001 dollars) to $2.2 billion during this period.  For the Association of University Technology Managers\u2019 survey for fiscal  year 2001, U.S. university respondents reported that they (1) executed  3,282 technology licenses and options, (2) received $852 million in gross  license income, and (3) held equity in 348, or 70 percent, of the 494 start-up  companies that were formed around university-licensed technology. (See  app. II for information from our survey about universities\u2019 licensing  activities with start-up companies.)", "OMB Circular A-110 establishes uniform requirements for the  administration of federal grants and cooperative agreements with  institutions of higher education, hospitals, and other nonprofit  organizations. For example, the circular requires that funding recipients  submit performance reports to the funding agency at least annually, with a  final technical report normally due within 90 days after the grant\u2019s  termination or expiration. However, the circular provides flexibility by  allowing the agencies to specify the content of these reports or to waive the  final technical report. The National Science and Technology Council,  established by Executive Order 12881 in November 1993, coordinates the  development of governmentwide science and technology policies. For  example, the Council\u2019s Subcommittee on Research Business Models is  examining the effects of the changing nature of scientific research on  business models for conducting federally funded research. In addition, 7  federal agencies, 84 research universities, and 6 other research institutions  participate in the Federal Demonstration Partnership (FDP), which seeks  to streamline the administrative processes for implementing OMB Circular  A-110.", "In July 1995, the Department of Health and Human Services, which  includes NIH, promulgated regulations on Objectivity in Research and NSF  revised its Investigator Financial Disclosure Policy to establish consistent  requirements for universities and most other grantees to identify and  manage financial conflicts of interest. Specifically, the NIH and NSF  standards require that funding recipients implement policies for  (1) scientists to disclose any \u201csignificant financial interests\u201d to an official  designated by the institution and (2) institutions to determine whether a  real or apparent conflict exists and, if so, take appropriate actions to  manage, mitigate, or eliminate the identified conflict. Under these  regulations, a conflict of interest exists when the institution\u2019s designated  official determines that a significant financial interest could directly and  significantly affect the research design, conduct, or reporting. The financial  benefit may result, for example, from an investigator owning stock in a  company providing the research funding, or from an investigator having  ownership interest in a company that may profit from a university  invention. Conflicting interests are not necessarily unacceptable, and many  can be managed through disclosure and oversight. The NIH regulation  exceeds the scope of NSF\u2019s policy in some areas. For example, it requires  that universities and other funding recipients report every identified  possible conflict of interest, while NSF requires that institutions report  only those conflicts that have not been resolved. (See app. III for a more  detailed comparison of the NIH and NSF requirements.)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Agencies Rely on University Scientists and Agency Web Sites to Disseminate Research Results", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies rely primarily on the university scientists who receive  research grants to make their research results available to the public.

Similarly, FDP\u2019s model terms and conditions for  research grants state, \u201cThe recipient is expected to publish or otherwise  make publicly available the results of the work conducted under the  award.\u201d Publishing federally funded research results also is vital to  university scientists because research publications are key to obtaining  future grant awards, gaining professional recognition, and achieving  tenure.", "Agencies also indirectly encourage the dissemination of research results  through their grant award practices. Officials at each agency said that peer  review panels consider the publication record of the applicant (usually the  principal investigator) in assessing the grant proposal. NSF, for example,  requires that principal investigators requesting grant renewals include a list  of publications generated with NSF\u2019s prior support. Agriculture officials  told us that they are less likely to recommend renewal applications for  continued funding if the funded project\u2019s results have not been published.  Publications indicate to the agencies that the principal investigator has  made progress in his/her research and that the results are available to other  scientists in the field. However, a research project may not generate  publishable results because leading scientific journals require that  manuscripts be reviewed by other experts in the field to validate the  research findings prior to publication. The scientific journal may reject a  manuscript because, for example, the reviewers conclude that the work  adds little value to the field of study, the results are inadequately supported,  or the research failed.", "All but five of the university respondents reported that they have a policy or  standard operating procedure that addresses whether sponsors are allowed  to delay the publication of research results under certain circumstances,  such as reviewing a manuscript for possible proprietary information or for  intellectual property. Three universities\u2014the California Institute of  Technology, Howard University, and Iowa State University\u2014reported that  they do not permit any publication delays, while 160 universities allow a  sponsor to review a manuscript prior to publication\u2014typically from 30 to  90 days. However, 10 universities allow a longer period of up to either 120  days or 180 days, and 1 university allows up to 365 days for the sponsor to  review a manuscript for proprietary information.", "Generally, research sponsors appear to adhere to the universities\u2019 time  frames for reviewing manuscripts. Administrators reported the following:  Fourteen universities were aware of one or more cases during the past 3  years of a sponsor delaying the publication of unclassified and  nonsensitive research beyond the university\u2019s time limits.", "Three universities were aware of one or more cases during the past 3  years of a federal sponsor delaying the publication of research involving  sensitive, but not classified, information beyond the university\u2019s time  limits.", "Thirteen universities were aware of one or more cases during the past 3  years of a federal sponsor blocking, or attempting to block, publication  of research involving sensitive, but not classified, information.", "However, several university administrators noted during the pretest of our  survey instrument that publication delays can occur without the  university\u2019s knowledge if the sponsor and the research team reach an  accommodation without notifying university administrators."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Five Agencies Disseminate Research Results on Their Web Sites", "paragraphs": ["As shown in table 2, Agriculture, Defense, Energy, EPA, and NASA use their  Web sites to post research results, in some form, for grants that they issue.  For example, EPA posts summaries of annual and final technical reports on  its National Center for Environmental Research Web site. These summaries  include research accomplishments or findings, the reporting date, EPA  agreement number, title, investigators, institution, research category,  project period, objective of research, progress summary, conclusions (if  applicable), publications/presentations, future activities, supplemental  keywords, and other relevant Web sites. EPA\u2019s Web site also allows users to  search for publications associated with a particular grant. NASA primarily  posts abstracts of final technical reports on its Web site, although NASA  plans to post mainly full technical reports in 2004.", "While Education, NIH, and NSF do not post research results on their Web  sites, they post a project abstract written at the time of award stating how  the research will be conducted and what researchers hope to accomplish.  In November 2002, the Education Sciences Reform Act of 2002 (Pub. L. No.  107-279) established the Institute of Education Sciences and directed it to  widely disseminate the findings and results of scientifically valid research  in education. An Education official told us that after the members of the  Institute\u2019s National Board of Educational Sciences have been appointed  and confirmed, Education will consider how best to fulfill this requirement,  particularly for the results of Institute-funded research that have not been  peer reviewed. The official noted that the Institute\u2019s National Center for  Education Evaluation currently disseminates the results of research  performed under contract either through research publications or through  its Web site after the results have been peer reviewed.", "In addition to using their own Web sites, several agencies participate in  collaborative Web-based efforts to share information, including research  results. For example, Energy\u2019s Office of Scientific and Technical  Information maintains Federal R&D Project Summaries, a Web-based  portal to summary and award information for Energy, NIH, and NSF  research grants. The office also maintains GrayLIT Network, a portal to  full-text reports located on the Energy, Defense, EPA, and NASA  information systems. In addition, an interagency working group from 11  major science agencies recently initiated the science.gov Web site, which  provides a gateway to federal research and development results and other  scientific information.", "Officials at the eight agencies identified both advantages and disadvantages  to posting all funded research results on agencies\u2019 Web sites. Most of the  agency officials told us that posting technical reports on agencies\u2019 Web  sites is an effective way to share information among scientists in the field  of research, as well as with the public. In explaining why they have chosen  not to post all results on their Web site, NIH and NSF officials cited  concerns that grant results posted prior to peer review and publication may  be incomplete or incorrect and could mislead other researchers or the  public. According to NIH officials, the risk associated with posting results  that have not been scrutinized and validated by peer review is simply too  great in the biomedical field. In addition, NSF officials were concerned that  a scientific journal would reject a manuscript because it views reports  posted on the Web as publications. Some agency officials also expressed  concern that a final technical report might be posted before the university  files a patent application for an invention, thereby preventing it from  obtaining a patent.", "Among the 171 university respondents to our survey, 91 universities (53  percent) supported posting the grantee\u2019s final technical reports on the  agency\u2019s Web site, and 31 universities (18 percent) opposed posting the  final technical report, while 49 universities (29 percent) either were  uncertain or did not respond. Primary advantages that universities cited for  posting final technical reports on an agency\u2019s Web site include facilitating  the access of other scientists to research results, facilitating collaboration  among scientists, providing prompt dissemination of research results, and  providing a public record if the results of a research project are not  published. Primary disadvantages that universities cited for posting final  technical reports are the potential for (1) an invention to be prematurely  disclosed, (2) a scientific journal to reject a manuscript because it views  posted reports as publications, (3) proprietary information to be disclosed,  (4) research results to be prematurely disclosed, (5) incomplete or  misleading report results to be prematurely disseminated, (6) an  investigator to be to harassed by opponents to the research, and (7)  universities to incur added administrative costs in complying with agency  requirements."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Only NIH and NSF Require Financial Conflict of Interest Standards for Grant Recipients", "paragraphs": ["NIH and NSF, the two largest federal supporters of university research, are  the only federal agencies we examined that have adopted standards  intended to protect against financial conflicts of interest among university  grantees.

L. No. 105-277) required the Director of the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) to amend Circular A-110 by incorporating  a provision known as the Shelby Amendment. Among other things, the  Shelby Amendment requires that (1) federal awarding agencies ensure that  all data produced under an award will be made available to the public  through the procedures established under the Freedom of Information Act  (FOIA) and (2) if the agency obtaining the data does so solely at the request  of a private party, the agency may charge a reasonable user fee equaling the  incremental cost of obtaining the data. The Shelby Amendment grew out of  a controversy that arose over the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s  (EPA) proposal to tighten Clean Air Act standards for small airborne  particulates in 1997. EPA\u2019s proposed rule cited the published results of a 30- year epidemiological study funded by the National Institutes of Health  (NIH) and conducted by Harvard University. Various industry groups that  opposed EPA\u2019s proposed regulation asked to review original data of the  study. However, Harvard denied the requests, citing both confidentiality  agreements with human subjects and the volume of data accumulated.", "On November 6, 1999, OMB published revisions to Circular A-110 in the  Federal Register in response to the Shelby Amendment. Under the revision,  a subject institution must provide the research data to the funding agency  in response to a FOIA request if a federal agency has used the published  research findings in developing an agency action that has the force and  effect of law. In March 2000, 15 federal agencies published an interim final  rule in the Federal Register that codified the OMB Circular A-110 revision.  These agencies included Agriculture, Defense, Energy, Education, EPA, the  National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and NIH. National  Science Foundation (NSF) officials told us that NSF incorporated the  revision by reference to OMB Circular A-110 in its grant agreements.", "Only NIH and EPA have received FOIA requests citing the Shelby  Amendment. In reviewing the requests, both agencies determined that the  requests did not meet the OMB Circular A-110 criteria. (See table 3.) Of the  40 requests received by NIH, 20 requested copies of either funded grant  applications or contract records, not research data; 9 requested data  generated from grants funded prior to the effective date of the NIH  regulation implementing the Shelby Amendment; and 4 were withdrawn.  NIH officials told us that NIH determined that the remaining seven requests  were not applicable to the Shelby Amendment; however, information on  the basis for this decision was unavailable because NIH had destroyed the  FOIA files 2 years after its final response, in accordance with the National  Archives and Records Administration\u2019s (NARA) records retention  schedule. EPA denied both requests it received because the requested data  were generated by projects funded prior to the effective date of its  regulation implementing the revision to OMB Circular A-110.", "More recently, OMB published a proposed bulletin and guidelines to ensure  that agencies conduct peer reviews of the most important scientific and  technical information relevant to regulatory policies that they disseminate  to the public, and that the peer reviews are reliable, independent, and  transparent.
