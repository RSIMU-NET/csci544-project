This estimate excludes any additional needed cleanup of emerging contaminants--generally, those not yet governed by a health standard. DOD delegated FUDS cleanup responsibility to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps). In addition to FUDS, DOD is responsible for cleaning up about 21,500 sites on active bases and 5,400 sites on realigned or closed bases. The House Armed Services Committee directed GAO to examine (1) the extent to which the Corps reevaluates sites to identify emerging contaminants; (2) how DOD allocates cleanup funds; (3) how the Corps prioritizes FUDS for cleanup; and (4) FUDS program overhead costs. GAO analyzed nationwide FUDS property and project data; policies, guidance and budget documents; and interviewed DOD and Corps officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Corps has not often re-examined sites after they have been cleaned up to determine whether emerging contaminants are present or need to be addressed. Generally, the Corps reevaluates sites only when requested by states or others, or when reviewing the completed remedy to ensure its continuing protectiveness. Such reviews are required every 5 years for sites where the chosen remedy does not allow for unlimited use and unrestricted exposure. Corps officials said that they had not received many requests to re-examine sites and few FUDS had required 5-year reviews. Reports on the 15 5-year reviews completed as of May 2009 within four Corps divisions indicated that the Corps has not consistently (1) conducted required 5-year reviews on time, (2) conducted reviews when they are not required but may be appropriate, as EPA recommends, and (3) submitted reports on these reviews for technical evaluation, as required by Corps policy. Also, DOD and the Corps lack accurate, complete information on the status of these reviews. Without timely, accurate, and complete reviews, the Corps cannot ensure that remedies continue to protect human health and the environment. DOD proposes funding to clean up defense sites based on the department's environmental restoration goals and obligations are generally proportional to the number of sites in each site category. Funding is directed toward reducing risks to human health and the environment, among other goals. The Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Defense Logistics Agency each determine the funding requirements to clean up sites based on these goals. The Corps prioritizes individual FUDS for cleanup on the basis of risk and other factors. The Corps assigns each site a risk level, considering such factors as the presence of hazards, the potential for human contact, and the concentrations of contaminants and their potential for migrating, among others. According to DOD officials, sites' risk levels are the single most important criterion in determining cleanup priorities. However, the Corps also takes into account specific FUDS program goals, and other factors--such as regulators' and the public's concerns--that can influence the Corps' decisions about which sites to address first. Consequently, high risk sites are not always addressed before low risk sites. Direct program management and support costs for the FUDS program have decreased slightly in recent years, mostly due to structural changes in the program. The Corps' obligations for FUDS direct program management and support costs have declined from 11.0 percent of total program obligations in fiscal year 2004 to 9.0 percent in fiscal year 2008. In addition, to further reduce certain components of these costs to make more funds available for FUDS cleanup, the Corps reduced the number of employees managing the program and the number of districts responsible for FUDS from 22 to 14. Furthermore, Corps officials told GAO that they have implemented a number of controls--such as assigning tracking codes--to ensure that program management and support funds are spent only on approved items."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) has invested about $4.4 billion  since fiscal year (FY) 1984 to address contamination and hazards at  formerly used defense sites (FUDS). These sites are located on properties  that were under the jurisdiction of the Department of Defense (DOD) and  owned by, leased to, or otherwise possessed by the United States prior to  October 17, 1986, but have since been transferred to states, local  governments, federal entities, and private parties. They can range in size  from less than an acre to many thousands of acres and are used as parks,  airports, industrial and commercial facilities, schools, and homes, among  other uses. FUDS can include hazards such as unsafe buildings, toxic and  radioactive wastes, hazardous wastes in storage containers, ordnance, and  explosive compounds. Under the Defense Environmental Restoration  Program (DERP), DOD is authorized to identify, investigate, and clean up  certain environmental contamination and address other hazards at both  FUDS and active installations. In the case of some FUDS, they have been  outside DOD jurisdiction for more than 100 years. DOD delegated its  authority for administering the cleanup of FUDS to the Department of the  Army, which, in turn, delegated its execution to the Corps. As of  September 30, 2008, the Corps had identified over 4,700 sites that are  eligible for cleanup under the program.", "The Corps estimates that, at current funding levels, cleaning up known  DOD contamination and hazards at FUDS will take more than 50 years and  cost about an additional $18 billion. However, this timeline and cost  estimate may expand if further cleanup at FUDS is required due to  changes in regulations, or if 5-year reviews of site cleanup reveal the need  for additional actions, such as to address emerging contaminants. DOD  defines an emerging contaminant as a contaminant that (1) has a  reasonably possible pathway to enter the environment; (2) presents a  potential unacceptable human health or environmental risk; and (3) either  does not have regulatory standards based on peer-reviewed science or has  regulatory standards that are evolving due to new science, detection  capabilities, or exposure pathways.", "The House Armed Services Committee report accompanying the National  Defense Authorization Act for FY 2009 directed us to conduct a study of  DOD\u2019s efforts to clean up FUDS. As discussed with the committee staff,  we examined (1) how the Corps addresses emerging contaminants at  FUDS, and the extent to which the Corps reevaluates sites during 5-year  reviews or other circumstances to determine the need to address emerging  contaminants; (2) DOD\u2019s process for proposing funding for cleanup at  FUDS and other sites in the defense cleanup program; (3) the Corps\u2019  criteria for prioritizing FUDS for cleanup and how closely the Corps  follows these criteria; and (4) the components and total amounts of  management and support costs for the FUDS program, how these costs  have changed over time, and the Corps\u2019 accountability measures for these  costs. In addition, at the request of the committee, this report provides  information on the status of the Corps\u2019 cleanup efforts at the former  Almaden Air Force Station, a FUDS located near San Jose, California   (see app. I).", "In conducting our work, we reviewed program information obtained from  officials with DOD\u2019s DERP; the Department of the Army; the Corps\u2019  headquarters; the Corps\u2019 Environmental and Munitions Center of  Expertise; 4 of the 7 Corps military divisions; and 4 of the 14 districts  responsible for FUDS program execution. We selected the 4 divisions  based on geographic dispersion, the number of FUDS within a division,  and planned obligations for FY 2009. Within these divisions, we selected  four districts with FUDS program management responsibilities. To  evaluate the Corps\u2019 process for addressing emerging contaminants and  prioritizing sites for cleanup, we reviewed and analyzed the nationwide  property and project data in the Corps\u2019 FUDS Management Information  System (FUDSMIS) through September 30, 2008. We assessed the  reliability of relevant fields in this database. When we found  inconsistencies, we worked with DOD and Corps officials to correct the  discrepancies before conducting our analyses. We determined that the  data needed for our analyses were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  our report. We reviewed relevant sections of key laws, regulations,  policies, guidance, DOD budget justification documents, and DOD\u2019s  Defense Environmental Programs Annual Report to Congress. We also  obtained information on the Corps\u2019 completed and planned 5-year reviews.  In addition, we interviewed officials of the Environmental Protection  Agency (EPA) and two state organizations\u2014the National Governors  Association and the Association of State and Territorial Solid Waste  Management Officials\u2014to obtain their perspectives on FUDS cleanup.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2008 through  October 2009, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

The  goals of the program include the identification, investigation, research and  development, and cleanup of contamination from hazardous substances,  pollutants, and contaminants; the correction of other environmental  damage (such as detection and disposal of unexploded ordnance) which  creates an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health or  welfare or the environment; and demolition and removal of unsafe  buildings and structures. To that end, DOD has established performance  measures and goals and identified over 31,600 sites that are eligible for  cleanup, including about 4,700 FUDS, 21,500 sites on active installations,  and 5,400 sites on installations that have been closed or are designated to  be closed or realigned under the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC)  process. The DERP was established by section 211 of the Superfund  Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 which amended the  Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act  (CERCLA) of 1980. In implementing the DERP, DOD is required to carry  out its activities addressing hazardous substances, pollutants, or  contaminants in a manner consistent with section 120 of CERCLA.  Funding for DERP cleanup activities comes from the Environmental  Restoration and BRAC accounts. The Environmental Restoration accounts  fund cleanup activities at FUDS and active sites and the BRAC accounts  fund cleanup activities at certain closing or realigning installations.", "To carry out the DERP at FUDS, DOD has established three major  program categories: the Installation Restoration Program, the Military  Munitions Response Program, and the Building Demolition/Debris  Removal Program. Specifically:  Installation Restoration Program (IRP). DOD established the IRP in 1985  to address the release of hazardous substances, pollutants, or  contaminants resulting from past practices that pose environmental health  and safety risks on both active sites and FUDS. For FUDS, the IRP  includes (1) hazardous, toxic, and radioactive waste (HTRW) sites and (2)  containerized hazardous, toxic, and radioactive waste (CON/HTRW) sites,  such as sites with transformers and aboveground or underground storage  tanks. In FY 2008, 2,621 FUDS were included in the IRP. DOD has  developed performance measures to assess progress toward the agency\u2019s  IRP goals. These goals are based on the achievement of certain CERCLA  cleanup phases and include progress toward achieving DOD milestones of  \u201cremedy in place\u201d and/or \u201cresponse complete\u201d at installations, and  progress in reducing overall risks. Specific IRP targets are included in  DOD\u2019s annual report to the Congress.", "Military Munitions Response Program (MMRP). DOD established the  MMRP in September 2001 as a separate program to focus on addressing  potential explosive and environmental hazards associated with munitions  sites on both active installations and FUDS, due to the unique issues  associated with munitions sites. The MMRP includes sites with munitions  and explosives of concern, munitions constituents, and chemical warfare  materiel. In FY 2008, 1,661 FUDS were included in the MMRP. The  objectives of the program include compiling a comprehensive inventory of  military munitions sites, establishing a prioritization protocol for cleanup  work at these sites, and establishing program goals and performance  measures to evaluate progress. In December 2001, shortly after DOD  established the program, the Congress passed the National Defense  Authorization Act for FY 2002, which, among other things, required DOD  to develop, by May 31, 2003, an initial inventory of defense sites, other  than military ranges still in operation, that are known or suspected to  contain military munitions and to provide annual updates thereafter,  among other requirements. DOD provides these updates as part of its  Defense Environmental Programs Annual Report to Congress.", "Building Demolition/Debris Removal Program (BD/DR). To address the  demolition and removal of unsafe buildings or structures, DOD established  the BD/DR Program. In FY 2008, the Corps had 423 FUDS in the BD/DR  program. Because of the small number of FUDS in the BD/DR Program,  DOD measures and reports cleanup progress at BD/DR sites with the IRP  program.", "Figure 1 shows these three program categories and the types of cleanup  projects within each category at FUDS. A FUDS property may have  multiple types of cleanup projects, which we refer to as \u201csites.\u201d For  example, a single FUDS property could have a munitions site; a building  demolition/debris removal site; and a hazardous, toxic, and radioactive  waste site.", "DOD is responsible for cleaning up its releases of hazardous substances  under DERP, in accordance with CERCLA. The remedy chosen for such a  release must meet certain standards for contaminants set under state or  federal laws or regulations. If there is no standard for a given  contaminant, DOD must still achieve a degree of cleanup, which at a  minimum, assures protection of human health and the environment. Thus,  the absence of a federal or state standard for the cleanup of a particular  hazardous substance does not negate DOD\u2019s responsibility to clean up  releases of that substance.", "Currently, all seven of the Corps\u2019 geographic military divisions and 14 of  its 45 districts within these divisions have responsibilities for identifying,  investigating, and cleaning up hazards at FUDS. The Corps\u2019 Environmental  and Munitions Center of Expertise provides specialized technical  assistance to help the Corps\u2019 divisions and districts execute their  responsibilities. The Corps\u2019 FUDS program policy follows DERP  management guidance, provides specific policy and guidance for managing  and executing the FUDS program, and applies to all Corps elements  engaged in FUDS program activities. Depending on the types of hazards  involved and their severity, either a state environmental regulatory agency  or EPA is the lead regulator at a FUDS. The lead regulator is responsible  for providing regulatory oversight of the Corp\u2019s actions to clean up FUDS.  In general, EPA is the lead regulator for all sites, including FUDS  properties, on EPA\u2019s list of some of the most contaminated sites in the  country\u2014the National Priorities List. Most FUDS are not on the National  Priorities List, and states are typically the lead regulators for these FUDS  properties.", "To be eligible for FUDS cleanup under the DERP and FUDS program  policy, a property must have been under the jurisdiction of DOD and  owned by, leased to, or otherwise possessed by the United States at the  time of actions leading to contamination by hazardous substances or other  hazards prior to October 17, 1986. In deciding which actions, if any, need  to be taken at FUDS, the Corps uses the process outlined in the National  Oil and Hazardous Substance Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP) for  identifying, investigating, and cleaning up releases of hazardous  substances under CERCLA. The Corps describes its usual process in the  following, generally sequential, phases:    Preliminary assessment\u2014The Corps uses available information, including  a search of historical records, to determine whether the property was ever  under the jurisdiction of DOD and owned or controlled by the United  States, and if hazards caused by DOD\u2019s use may be present. If the Corps  determines that the property was under the jurisdiction of DOD and  owned or controlled by the United States, but does not find evidence of  any hazards caused by DOD, it designates the property as \u201cno DOD action  indicated.\u201d If, however, the Corps determines that hazards caused by DOD  prior to October 17, 1986, may be present, the Corps begins further study.", "Site inspection\u2014The Corps inspects the site to confirm the presence and  possible sources of hazards; to confirm that a release has occurred; or  eliminate from further consideration those sites that pose no significant  threat to public health or the environment. The site inspection builds upon  the preliminary assessment and involves sampling to determine the nature  of contamination, potential pathways of exposure, and recommendations  for further action.", "Remedial investigation\u2014The Corps conducts more rigorous sampling and  analysis to determine the nature and extent of the release, evaluates the  baseline risk to human health and the environment posed by the release,  and determines if further response action is required to respond to an  unacceptable risk.", "Feasibility study\u2014The Corps analyses the feasibility of alternative  remedies to respond to the release using the CERCLA remedy selection  criteria and establishes the cleanup criteria for the remedial action.", "Proposed plan\u2014The Corps proposes to the public and the lead regulator  its recommendation for a remedial action to respond to the release and  explains how it will satisfy the remedy selection criteria of CERCLA and  the NCP.", "Remedy selection\u2014The Corps issues a record of decision or decision  document signed by an authorized agency official to formally select the  remedial action to be taken to respond to the release and explains the  elements of the remedy and the basis for its selection using the remedy  selection criteria of CERCLA and the NCP.", "Remedial design\u2014The Corps designs the remedy selected by the  feasibility study.", "Remedial action construction\u2014The Corps constructs the selected remedy.", "At the end of construction, the DOD\u2019s milestone \u201cremedy-in-place\u201d is met  when testing of the remedy shows that it will function as designed.", "Remedial action operation\u2014The Corps operates the selected remedy until  the cleanup objective is achieved.

Examples of long-term management activities are  monitoring of a groundwater treatment system, maintenance of a landfill  cap, and enforcement of land use controls. In addition, the NCP requires  that the Corps, as the agency responsible for FUDS cleanup, conduct \u201c5- year reviews\u201d of sites not less than every 5 years after the start of remedial  action, when the chosen remedy does not allow for unlimited use and  unrestricted exposure.

Corps officials told us that in their initial evaluations  of FUDS under CERCLA, the agency tested for most known emerging  contaminants at those sites where there was a reason to suspect these  contaminants were present and caused by DOD. They also told us that the  Corps would sample a site for a contaminant, if appropriate, regardless of  whether there is a federal or state standard for it. Appendix III provides  information on the occurrence of emerging contaminants in groundwater,  surface water, soil, and sediment at HTRW FUDS, based on the samples  taken as of September 30, 2008.", "To make informed decisions on which contaminants to sample for at a  site, the Corps\u2019 districts review records of DOD\u2019s past use of the site. In  2002, we reported that the Corps lacked comprehensive guidance on the  typical hazards that may be present at DOD properties as a result of  certain types of DOD activities. However, the Corps subsequently  developed guidance, and between 2003 and 2008, issued a series of reports  identifying potential chemicals that past military activities may have  released. District officials told us that they use this guidance, called  \u201cCommon Operations Reports,\u201d in conjunction with historical information  about a site to determine which contaminants may have been released  there. After sampling for contaminants at a site, the Corps uses the  sampling results and other site-specific information to assign relative risk  levels to sites. These relative risk levels are not based on a comprehensive  risk assessment, but are a tool used to prioritize the site for cleanup based  on information collected early in the cleanup process.", "After further defining the nature and extent of contamination at a site, the  Corps then uses scientific information on contaminants, sampling results,  and other site-specific data\u2014such as information on exposure pathways,  potential receptors, and site use\u2014to conduct more comprehensive site- specific risk assessments that are to be used in making cleanup decisions  for the site. This requires the Corps to identify and select appropriate  contaminant toxicity values to use in assessing risks to human health and  the environment. The identification of toxicity values is a crucial step  that presents special challenges for emerging contaminants, for which  information on human health effects may be insufficient, limited, or  evolving. DOD\u2019s and EPA\u2019s preferred source for the fundamental toxicity  information needed to develop human health risk assessments is EPA\u2019s  Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS), a database that contains EPA\u2019s  scientific position on the potential human health effects of exposure to  more than 540 chemicals. However, IRIS does not contain final  assessments for some emerging contaminants. For example:    naphthalene, a component of jet fuel that has contaminated many military  trichloroethylene (TCE), a solvent widely used in industrial and  manufacturing settings;    cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine, which is also known as Royal Demolition  Explosive, a highly powerful explosive used by the U.S. military in  thousands of munitions;    dioxin, a chemical that is often the byproduct of combustion and other  tetrachloroethylene, which is also known as perchloroethylene, a  manufactured chemical widely used for dry cleaning fabrics, metal  degreasing, and production of some consumer products and other  chemicals.", "DOD worked with EPA and the Environmental Council of States (ECOS)  to develop a white paper in 2007 on the process to use for identifying and  selecting toxicity values when there are no values available from IRIS.  ECOS endorsed the white paper by a formal resolution of the member  states. DOD formalized the process outlined in this paper with a June 2009  policy on emerging contaminants.", "Using the site-specific risk assessments, the Corps develops site-specific,  risk-based cleanup levels for contaminants at FUDS. Under CERCLA, the  Corps must choose a cleanup alternative that, at a minimum, assures  protection of human health and the environment. In developing a  protective remedy, the Corps considers generally acceptable risk ranges  and must choose a remedy which will comply with the applicable or  relevant and appropriate requirements (ARAR) that have been identified  for the site. The Corps and most FUDS state regulators identify ARARs  based on site-specific factors such as the contaminants present, site  location and physical features, and response actions being considered.  Federal or state standards are not automatically applied to a site\u2014they  must first be identified as ARARs for the site. ARARs, which are used as a  starting point to assess the protectiveness of a remedy, consist of the  following two sets of requirements:    Applicable requirements are cleanup standards; standards of control; and  other substantive requirements, criteria, or limitations promulgated under  federal environmental or state environmental or facility siting laws that  specifically address a hazardous substance, pollutant, contaminant,  remedial action, location, or other circumstance found at a CERCLA site.  Only those state standards that are identified by a state in a timely manner  and that are more stringent than federal requirements may be applicable.", "Relevant and appropriate requirements are requirements that do not  meet this definition of \u201capplicable,\u201d but address situations sufficiently  similar to those encountered at a CERCLA site that their use is well suited  to the particular site. State standards must be identified in a timely manner  and be more stringent than federal requirements to be considered relevant  and appropriate.", "If there are no ARARs for contaminants at a site, cleanup levels for the  contaminants are established based on the Corps\u2019 site-specific risk  assessments. In addition, as part of the ARAR identification process, the  Corps also identifies other information that may be considered under  CERCLA in establishing cleanup levels. This information is not legally  binding and can include nonpromulgated guidelines, advisories, or  guidance issued by states or the federal government\u2014for example,  drinking water health advisories issued by EPA.", "After the Corps selects a remedy under CERCLA, if the remedy results in  any hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants remaining at the  site, the Corps must review the remedy no less often than each 5 years  after the remedial action was initiated to assure that the remedy is  protecting human health and the environment. EPA, the primary  regulatory agency for CERCLA, interprets the 5-year review requirement  to apply when the remedy for a site will not clean up the site to a level that  allows for unlimited use and unrestricted exposure. In addition, EPA  guidance notes that 5-year reviews are appropriate, even if not required,  for sites where the cleanup will eventually allow unlimited use and  unrestricted exposure, but will require more than 5 years to complete.", "EPA and Corps guidance recommend that 5-year review reports include,  among other things, a history of the site, a description of the response  actions, a summary of the review process, and certain analysis. This  analysis should identify whether (1) the response action\u2014for example, a  groundwater treatment system to reduce contaminant concentrations, or  land use controls to prevent access to a site\u2014is functioning as intended;  (2) assumptions\u2014such as exposure assumptions, toxicity of  contaminants, and cleanup levels\u2014used at the time of selecting the  response action are still valid; and (3) any new information\u2014such as on  changes in the use and accessibility of the site\u2014that indicates the  response action may no longer be protective of human health, safety, and  the environment. In addition, although CERCLA does not require the  collection of new samples to determine the presence of additional  contaminants during the 5-year review, the review provides a mechanism  to consider available evidence of new contamination that is brought to the  attention of the districts. In this regard, EPA guidance instructs those  conducting 5-year reviews to consider whether new contaminants have  been identified when evaluating the continuing validity of the assumptions  used at the time of remedy selection. Finally, EPA and Corps guidance  recommend that the 5-year review reports include recommendations for  follow-up actions, if necessary, to address identified deficiencies. The  Corps may need to modify the cleanup actions at a site if the 5-year review  identifies significant changes in contaminant or site information that call  into question the protectiveness of the remedy, as determined by a  comparison of site-specific risks with the generally acceptable risk  ranges.", "In addition to using the CERCLA process, the Corps also uses EPA, DOD,  and Army policies or guidance specific to certain contaminants or issues,  including perchlorate and TCE, emerging contaminants that are of  particular concern to DOD because they have significant potential to affect  people or DOD\u2019s mission.

These reviews provide a mechanism  for identifying and responding to changes that may occur, such as new  scientific knowledge, regulation of emerging contaminants, or the  discovery of additional munitions at a site. Corps officials told us that, to  date, few FUDS have required 5-year reviews, due to a variety of factors.  For example:    The Corps strives to clean up FUDS to a level that allows unlimited use  and unrestricted exposure, which does not require a 5-year review\u2014 preventing exposure to contaminants left in place can be more difficult at  FUDS properties than active DOD installations because DOD no longer  owns or controls FUDS properties and does not have the same ability to  restrict land use.", "The Corps has completed cleanup at a higher percentage of building  demolition/debris removal sites and containerized waste sites than  hazardous, toxic, and radioactive sites. This is because, while cleanup is  under way at hazardous, toxic, and radioactive sites, these sites are  typically much more complex than building demolition/debris removal  sites and containerized waste sites, and significantly more time and  investment is required to complete cleanup. Building demolition/debris  removal sites do not generally require 5-year reviews because these types  of sites involve unsafe buildings, or structures and generally not the  hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants to which CERCLA  applies. Containerized waste sites can require 5-year reviews, but Corps  officials in 2 divisions told us that most of these sites were cleaned up to a  level that did not require 5-year reviews. In addition, one division told us  that most of the containerized waste site cleanups completed by the Corps  to date were for petroleum storage tanks. Petroleum is not a hazardous  substance, pollutant, or contaminant under CERCLA, so 5-year reviews  are not required for actions to address petroleum contamination at  FUDS.", "In some divisions and for certain types of sites, the Corps has not yet  reached the point at which 5-year reviews become required. For example,  one division official told us that they have only recently begun completing  cleanup of HTRW sites, and another division official said that most of the  sites that might need a 5-year review have not yet been cleaned up.  Further, many munitions sites have not yet reached the trigger date for 5- year reviews\u2014the initiation of remedial actions\u2014because they are still in  the investigation phase. Corps\u2019 guidance states that all FUDS where an  ordnance and explosives response action is implemented require 5-year  reviews.", "Corps officials told us that the districts will be conducting more 5-year  reviews in the future. For example, officials in the 4 districts we contacted  told us that they will be responsible for completing a total of 30 5-year  reviews from FY 2009 through 2014. As of May 2009, these districts had  completed a total of 15 5-year reviews\u20145 for IRP sites and 10 for MMRP  sites. However, our examination of information on these 15 reviews  indicated that these districts have not consistently implemented the 5-year  review process in accordance with CERCLA or Corps and EPA guidance.  We found that:    5-year reviews were not always completed on time. For example, all of  the five 5-year reviews conducted for IRP sites and at least five of the  reviews for MMRP sites were completed late, with the reports being late  by 3 months to 9 years. In addition, for three of the five IRP sites for  which 5-year reviews had been completed, we determined that the Corps  incorrectly identified the trigger dates for initial 5-year reviews as the  completion, rather than initiation, of the remedial action. We also found  that one additional review for an IRP site is already overdue by more than  3 years, and at least 3 additional reviews for MMRP sites are overdue by 1  to 5 years. Corps officials cited a variety of reasons for these delays,  including turnover of program and project managers; lack of internal  staffing resources for conducting the reviews; and multiple report  iterations resulting from lengthy internal and external reviews involving  Corps staff, EPA headquarters and regional offices, and state regulators.  Officials also cited program budget and resource constraints, with one  district highlighting a higher programmatic emphasis on meeting DOD\u2019s  goal of completing site inspections for MMRP sites by September 30,  2010. In addition, the delay for the 5-year review for an IRP site at the  Former Weldon Spring Ordnance Works in Missouri resulted from the  discovery of additional contamination during the Corps\u2019 activities to close  the site.", "DOD and the Corps do not have accurate, complete information on how  many 5-year reviews are required, completed, or planned for the FUDS  program. DOD and the Corps rely on data from FUDSMIS for program- wide information on the status of 5-year reviews at FUDS. To manage and  implement the FUDS program, DOD, the Army, and the Corps use  FUDSMIS to support planning, programming, budgeting, annual workplan  development, execution, and reporting requirements for the FUDS  program. This system includes data fields to indicate whether a 5-year  review is required at a site, record the actual date the 5-year review was  completed, and record the scheduled date of subsequent 5-year reviews,  among other things. Moreover, DOD uses these data from FUDSMIS to  provide information on the status of 5-year reviews at each FUDS property  in its Defense Environmental Programs Annual Report to Congress. Corps  policy requires the districts to enter this information in the available data  fields in FUDSMIS, and the divisions also have responsibility for ensuring  that the data are accurate and complete. In addition, the accuracy and  completeness of FUDSMIS data on 5-year review planning is part of one of  the FUDS Program Management Indicators established by the Corps to  evaluate divisions\u2019 and districts\u2019 performance and to measure and  demonstrate progress toward cleaning up contamination at FUDS.  However, we found that the three divisions we spoke with did not  consistently track 5-year reviews in FUDSMIS. Of these three divisions,  officials at one division were not aware of the data fields in FUDSMIS  related to 5-year reviews. Officials at the remaining two divisions told us  that neither they nor their districts enter the required information on 5- year reviews because there is no way for them to later retrieve that  information in a way that would be useful to them in managing their work,  such as a report listing sites that require such reviews. In addition, they  noted that improvements to the system are needed\u2014particularly to (1)  alert them to upcoming reviews they need to conduct, (2) better track the  dates that trigger the reviews, and (3) enable the generation of reports on  5-year reviews.", "Divisions are inconsistent in their approaches to conducting 5-year  reviews for sites where they are recommended but not required. Officials  in only one division told us that their districts would conduct 5-year  reviews for sites where the cleanup will eventually allow unlimited use  and unrestricted exposure, but where the cleanup will require more than 5  years to complete\u2014sites for which 5-year reviews are recommended by  EPA but not required. Conducting reviews under these circumstances may  be important for sites where cleanup may require many years, during  which information on emerging contaminants may evolve. For example,  the Corps estimates that cleanup of TCE in groundwater at the former  Nebraska Ordnance Plant will take more than 100 years. According to  division officials, the district managing cleanup of this FUDS is in the  process of finalizing the site\u2019s first IRP 5-year review, which will indicate  that the remedy remains protective of human health and the environment.  The 5-year review will recommend an evaluation of a newly identified  exposure pathway\u2014intrusion of TCE vapors from the subsurface into  buildings\u2014at a limited portion of the site that is currently residential. In  addition, the review discusses changes in toxicity data for carcinogenic  and noncarcinogenic effects of TCE. The 5-year review also evaluates the  potential long-term impacts of a newly identified exposure pathway at the  site\u2014intrusion of TCE vapors from the subsurface into buildings\u2014on the  protectiveness of the remedy. Conducting 5-year reviews at this site in the  future, although not required under CERCLA and the NCP, will allow the  Corps the opportunity to periodically identify whether information on TCE  has changed to a degree that may affect the protectiveness of the remedy.    5-year review reports did not always receive the required technical  review by Corps\u2019 experts. Since 1999 and 2004, Corps policy has required  districts to provide their 5-year review reports for MMRP sites and IRP  sites, respectively, to the Corps\u2019 Center of Expertise for comment.  According to Corps officials, the Center of Expertise\u2019s staff has up-to-date  technical expertise that enables them to help the districts identify and  respond to potentially important changes that may occur with respect to  emerging contaminants\u2014for example, changes in contaminant standards,  toxicity information, and exposure pathways, such as vapor intrusion.  When conducting their technical review of the districts\u2019 5-year review  reports, specialists at the Center of Expertise are to assess whether the  reports are well-documented, follow relevant guidance, such as EPA\u2019s  2001 guidance on conducting 5-year reviews, and include the necessary  statement on the protectiveness of the response actions. They also are to  evaluate how the reports address whether the assumptions used at the  time of selecting the response action are still valid\u2014such as exposure  assumptions, toxicity of contaminants, and cleanup levels. Nine of the ten  5-year reviews completed for MMRP sites were completed after the Corps\u2019  1999 policy requiring submission of review reports was issued; however,  we found that the districts in one division did not submit three of their five  reports to the Center of Expertise for technical review and comment. In  addition, four of the five 5-year reviews completed for IRP sites were  completed after the Corps\u2019 2004 policy was issued, but we found that one  of these four reports was not submitted for technical review and comment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Corps Infrequently Re- examines FUDS Outside of the 5-Year Review Process", "paragraphs": ["The Corps has reevaluated some sites outside the 5-year review process,  but these reevaluations have been infrequent, and officials told us that  they have generally not been for the purpose of addressing emerging  contaminants. Outside the 5-year review process, Corps districts generally  only reevaluate sites at the request of state regulators or other  stakeholders. For eligible FUDS properties that were previously  determined to have no FUDS eligible projects or no further action  required, Corps policy allows districts to re-examine up to five FUDS  properties per state per year upon request by states, tribes, EPA, or other  stakeholders. In responding to such requests, the Corps may review the  records or other original information for the property, as well as any  additional information provided by EPA, the state, or tribe concerning  potential DOD contamination. However, Corps officials told us that they  have not received many requests for re-examination, and the requests  received by the divisions and districts we visited were generally not for the  purpose of addressing emerging contaminants. For example, officials in  one district told us that their re-examination of sites has mostly been in  response to concerns about petroleum contamination and munitions  issues.", "In addition, in some instances, the Corps reports that it has re-examined  certain FUDS on its own initiative. For example, in 2004, the Corps re- examined certain munitions sites to assess the potential for contamination  from munitions constituents, particularly lead\u2014an emerging contaminant  on DOD\u2019s watch list\u2014and other heavy metals. Corps officials note that  this effort was in response to an Army policy change requiring that  munitions constituents be addressed as part of MMRP cleanup projects.  The Corps re-examined 196 FUDS munitions sites\u2014many of which were  former small arms ranges with no issues relating to munitions or  explosives of concern\u2014that had previously been determined to have  negligible risk and no need for DOD action. We also found that one of the  districts we contacted is in the process of re-examining 513 sites,  beginning with records research in 2002.", "While the Corps has not often re-examined FUDS outside the 5-year  review process to date, DOD and Corps officials told us that they would  reevaluate the need for additional response actions at sites if there were  changes in information on a contaminant. If a hazardous substance release  is discovered at a FUDS that was never previously addressed at the site  but occurred when the site was under DOD\u2019s jurisdiction, DOD is  responsible for addressing that release in accordance with the DERP and  CERCLA, regardless of whether the Corps has already completed cleanup  of other releases at the site. In addition, DOD may need to initiate further  response actions at a site where it has already addressed some releases  and no 5-year review is required, but new information becomes available  for a contaminant, to fulfill its responsibility in accordance with the DERP  and CERCLA. For example, new standards may be established for such  contaminants, or previously existing standards or toxicity values may be  revised. In addition, new exposure pathways may be identified. Until fairly  recently, vapor intrusion\u2014the migration of volatile chemicals such as TCE  from subsurface media into the indoor air of overlying buildings\u2014was  rarely evaluated as part of human health risk assessments and was not  well understood. However, given the current inventory of FUDS still  requiring cleanup, there may be practical limitations to re-opening sites for  further cleanup. In addition, the need for DOD to re-open FUDS to  respond to changes in information or standards for contaminants may also  depend on agreements reached with EPA or state regulatory agencies."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD Proposes Funding for Cleanup at FUDS, Active Sites, and BRAC Sites Based on DERP Goals, and Funding Is Proportional to Site Inventories", "paragraphs": ["DOD uses the same method to propose funding for cleanup at FUDS,  active sites, and BRAC sites; cleanup funding is based on DERP goals and  is generally proportional to the number of sites in each of these categories.

DOD\u2019s DERP goals include:  reducing risk to human health and the environment;    preparing BRAC properties to be environmentally suitable for transfer;    having final remedies in place and completing response actions; and  fulfilling other established milestones to demonstrate progress toward  meeting program performance goals.", "DERP goals are target dates representing when the current inventory of  active and BRAC sites and FUDS are expected to complete the preliminary  assessment phase, site inspection phase, or achieve the remedy in place or  response complete (RIP/RC) milestone.

A summary of these goals for the IRP and MMRP is shown  in table 2.", "DOD components plan cleanup actions that are required to meet these  goals at the installation or site level. DOD requires components to rank  their inventory of sites by relative risk to help make informed decisions  about which sites to clean up first. Using these risk rankings, as well as  other factors, components set more specific restoration targets each fiscal  year to demonstrate progress and prepare a budget to achieve those goals  and targets. The Department of the Army has established more specific  performance goals for FUDS in its Environmental Cleanup Strategic Plan.  For example, the Corps\u2019 goals for the FUDS IRP are to achieve RIP/RC at    46 percent of all 357 high-risk sites containing HTRW by the end of FY  2008,    48 percent of all 147 medium-risk HTRW sites by the end of FY 2011, and    all low-risk HTRW sites by the end of FY 2020.", "For the FUDS MMRP, the Corps\u2019 goals are to complete    40 percent of the baseline site inspections by the end of FY 2008,    55 percent of the baseline site inspections by the end of FY 2009,    100 percent of the baseline site inspections by the end of FY 2012, and    all site inspections by the end of FY 2014.", "Another factor that can influence the proposed budgets and obligations  among site categories is the need to fund long-term management activities.  While DOD uses the number of sites achieving RIP/RC status as a primary  performance metric, sites that have reached this goal may still require  long-term management and, therefore, additional funding for a number of  years.

Divisions send their  annual work plans to the Corps\u2019 headquarters, which sends the FUDS  annual work plan to the Department of the Army for approval. While the  risk levels of sites are a significant factor in determining cleanup priorities,  high risk sites are not always addressed before low risk sites. FUDS  program data indicate that, as of the end of FY 2008, 35 percent of high- risk MMRP and HTRW sites (218 of 622 sites) had achieved response  complete status, compared to 28 percent of medium risk sites (86 of 303  sites) and 21 percent of low-risk sites (110 of 530 sites).", "Based on site-specific information, the Corps uses several methods to  assign risk-based priority levels to sites to categorize them for cleanup.

Consequently, the Corps may use multiple methods at a  single FUDS property that contains multiple types of sites\u2014for example, a  munitions site and a hazardous waste site. According to DOD guidance,  the components also use the same methods to prioritize HTRW and MMRP  sites at active and BRAC installations for cleanup. Appendix VII provides  information on the number of high-risk sites at FUDS and active and  BRAC installations, for FY 2004 through 2008.", "At HTRW sites, the Corps uses the Relative Risk Site Evaluation (RRSE) to  assign a relative risk level of high, medium, or low, based on an evaluation  of three factors for four environmental media: sediment, surface soil,  surface water, and groundwater. These factors include the:    contaminant hazard factor, which compares the maximum  concentrations of contaminants detected to benchmark comparison  values;    migration pathway factor, which summarizes the likelihood that  contamination will migrate; and  receptor factor, which summarizes human or ecological receptors that  could be exposed to contamination.", "At MMRP sites, the Corps uses the Munitions Response Site Prioritization  Protocol (MRSPP), which DOD began implementing in FY 2007 to assign  sites a relative priority level of 1 (highest hazard) to 8 (lowest hazard)  using three modules.", "Explosive hazard evaluation and chemical warfare materiel hazard  evaluation modules, which evaluate the presence and accessibility of  these hazards and the receptors that may be affected, and    A health hazard evaluation module, which evaluates chronic health and  environmental hazards associated with munitions constituents\u2014as well as  incidental nonmunitions-related contaminants\u2014and builds on the  framework established in the RRSE.", "According to DOD and Corps officials, the Corps is in the process of  applying the MRSPP to FUDS, but as of the end of FY 2008, no FUDS had  been assigned a final MRSPP score. FUDS program data available on the  relative risk levels of MMRP sites are based on the method used prior to  implementation of the MRSPP\u2014the Risk Assessment Code, which the  Corps used to assign munitions sites a risk-based score of 1 (highest  priority) to 5 (no DOD action necessary). This method evaluated potential  safety hazards associated with explosives based on the severity and  probability of the hazard. According to DOD and Corps officials, Risk  Assessment Code scores are no longer used and are being replaced by the  relative priority assigned by the MRSPP.", "The Corps assigns a risk-based priority level to containerized waste sites,  based on the condition and location of the storage tanks. For example, a  site with known leaks or spills would have a priority of 1, while sites with  tanks that are not leaking and located in urban and rural areas would have  priority levels of 2 and 3, respectively. The Corps assigns a risk-based  priority level to building demolition and debris removal sites, based on the  location of the site and ease of access to the site. For example, a site in an  urban or densely populated area and with unrestricted access would have  a priority of 1, while a site in a rural area or remote island with a guarded  entrance would have a priority of 9.", "In addition, DOD and Corps officials told us that a small number of high- priority FUDS receive separate funding from the Corps\u2019 headquarters\u2014in  addition to the funds they receive from the relevant district\u2014to guarantee  that cleanup at these sites is funded. These are high-risk, high-visibility sites  with cleanup costs high enough to consume a district\u2019s entire budget.  According to DOD and Corps officials, the list of such sites may change  from year to year. Table 5 identifies the FUDS that received such funding in  FY 2008 and the Corps\u2019 estimated costs to complete cleanup at these sites.", "DOD and Corps officials told us that in addition to considering a site\u2019s risk  level, the Corps sets cleanup priorities based on program goals, which  have evolved over time. In the past, according to these officials, the Corps  initially focused on addressing building demolition and debris removal  sites and containerized waste sites\u2014FUDS program data indicate that 81  percent of building demolition and debris removal sites and 82 percent of  containerized waste sites have reached response complete status,  compared to 54 percent of HTRW sites and 33 percent of MMRP sites  without chemical warfare materiel. DOD officials also said that the Corps  has made significant progress in completing cleanup at building  demolition and debris removal sites and containerized waste sites because  they can be completed quickly and at less cost. In contrast, they told us  that hazardous, toxic, and radioactive sites and MMRP sites are generally  larger and more complex than building demolition/debris removal sites  and containerized waste sites, and require more time and investment to  clean up. Table 6 shows the percentage of sites that have achieved  response complete status by project category, as of the end of FY 2008.", "According to DOD and Corps officials, containerized waste and building  demolition/debris removal sites are now a low priority for the Corps  because it is trying to focus on meeting DOD\u2019s goals for the FUDS program  and these goals do not measure cleanup of containerized waste and  building demolition sites. Specifically:  IRP: DOD\u2019s goal is to reduce risk, have a remedy in place, or achieve  response complete status at high, medium, and low risk sites by the end of  FY 2007, 2011, and 2020, respectively. According to DOD\u2019s FY 2008  Defense Environmental Programs Annual Report to Congress, DOD did  not meet its goal for high relative risk FUDS by the end of FY 2007, but is  working aggressively to complete required cleanup actions at these sites,  while mitigating potential threats to human health and the environment.", "MMRP: The John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2007  specified the following two goals for adoption by DOD: complete  preliminary assessments by the end of FY 2007 and complete site  inspections by the end of FY 2010 and complete remedy in place or  response complete by a date set by the Secretary of Defense. However,  because the Corps centrally funds MMRP site inspections with a budget  established by the Corps\u2019 headquarters and Center of Expertise, other sites  do not compete with MMRP site inspections in cleanup prioritization. By  the end of FY 2008, DOD had completed preliminary assessments for 99  percent of the FUDS MMRP sites, according to DOD\u2019s FY 2008 Defense  Environmental Programs Annual Report to Congress, and will reevaluate  current goals at the end of FY 2010. DOD has not yet established a date for  achieving remedy in place or response complete status for FUDS MMRP  sites.", "The Corps\u2019 headquarters sets annual performance measures for its  divisions and districts\u2014such as achieving remedy in place or response  complete status at a certain number of sites each year\u2014that can also play  a role in how districts prioritize sites. For example, officials at two  districts we visited told us that in order to meet the remedy in place or  response complete measure, they try to focus on sites where work is  already in progress and cleanup can be completed. Officials at one of these  districts told us that it is not appropriate to use risk rankings exclusively in  deciding which sites to clean up and that they cannot stop work on sites  where actions are already under way because they face pressure to meet  the cleanup performance measures. Although containerized waste sites  are currently a low priority for the FUDS program, officials at this district  also told us they are working on many such sites that are not high-risk, but  are low-cost and can be completed in a matter of months. Similarly,  officials at another district told us that once a site enters a phase of the  CERCLA cleanup process, they try to complete that phase before starting  work on another site. However, cleanup costs for sites can also influence  the order in which districts address sites. Officials at one district told us  that a high-cost site could consume the district\u2019s entire annual budget.  While certain high-risk sites with high costs may receive additional  funding from the Corps\u2019 headquarters, another district also told us that  they may delay a cleanup action until they can allocate enough funds to  complete that action.", "The Corps also recognizes in its FUDS program policy and FUDS program  management plan for FY 2009 that the concerns of regulators, the  Congress, and the public can influence the Corps\u2019 decisions about which  sites to address first and can potentially result in decisions to fund  projects that are not high-risk. For example, the Corps\u2019 FUDS program  policy states that regulator involvement through Statewide Management  Action Plans (SMAP) is essential to the successful implementation of the  relative risk concept. The SMAP program at FUDS began in 2001, and the  primary purpose of a SMAP is to involve regulators in the development of  life-cycle plans for the investigation and cleanup of all FUDS properties  within a state. EPA, states, and the Corps may participate in jointly  developing the SMAP, which is a living document that had, among its  goals, determining a statewide cleanup priority for each property and  project. Of the 57 states and territories, over 30 had SMAPs or equivalent  agreements, as of December 2008, according to the Association of State  and Territorial Solid Waste Management Officials. In the spring of 2008,  the association surveyed the states about the effectiveness of SMAPs.  Based on responses from 41 states, it reported that the overall  effectiveness of SMAPs varied with regard to prioritizing and funding sites  for cleanup, among other things.", "In addition, the Defense and State Memorandum of Agreement (DSMOA),  which provides a mechanism for state or territory involvement in  environmental restoration activities at DOD installations\u2014including  FUDS\u2014and state laws and regulations play a role in how the Corps  prioritizes and funds sites for cleanup. The districts record certain factors  that may drive prioritization and funding of sites in the \u201clegal drivers\u201d data  fields in FUDSMIS. Our analysis of FUDS program data for one of these  legal drivers indicated that 72 percent of sites with memorandum of  agreement commitments\u2014such as DSMOAs between the Corps and state  regulatory agencies\u2014had reached response complete status, compared to  56 percent of sites without such agreements. Similarly, we found that 74  percent of sites subject to state laws and regulations requiring a response  within a specified period had reached response complete status, compared  to the 56 percent of sites not subject to such requirements.", "Community or public concerns, as well as owner or congressional interest,  also shape the Corps\u2019 decisions on which sites to address first. In  particular, officials at all four of the districts we contacted noted that  congressional interest can influence decisions on the order in which sites  are addressed. Officials at one district told us that this would not lead a  medium or low-risk site to be prioritized and funded for cleanup above a  high-risk site, but officials at another district and the FUDS program  management plan for FY 2009 note that congressional interest could  potentially result in a decision to fund a site not considered high risk.  However, our analysis of FUDS program data for the congressional or  owner interest legal driver showed that 59 percent of sites with this driver  had reached response complete status, compared to 57 percent of sites  without this legal driver. In addition, officials at one division told us that  the Corps\u2019 past focus on addressing containerized waste and building  demolition and debris removal projects was because these were the types  of hazards that politicians wanted addressed.

Overall  management and support costs and direct management and support costs,  as a proportion of the total FUDS budget, have decreased slightly between  FY 2004 and 2008, largely due to a restructuring of FUDS responsibilities  among the Corps\u2019 field districts and specific DOD direction to the Corps to  lower certain costs.

In order to achieve these goals,  the Corps restructured the way the FUDS program was administered by  reducing the number of districts with FUDS responsibilities from 22  districts to 14 districts. These 14 districts operate within 7 regional  divisions, with 2 Corps districts with FUDS program or project  management responsibilities in each Corps division. However, Corps  officials told us they cannot determine the overall savings they have  achieved to reduce program management and support costs. For example,  they said the Corps cannot measure the reduction in full-time employees  assigned to FUDS program as a reduction in program management and  support costs because a variety of employees, such as those who provide  legal and real estate expertise at the district level, must continue to charge  their time to the FUDS program. In addition, Corps officials in the  divisions and districts we visited told us that they now charge time to the  FUDS program for activities that they would have charged to program  management and support prior to the FUDS transformation.", "Several factors help to ensure that overall program management and  support funds are spent only on items the Corps has approved. In this  regard, only resource managers at the Corps\u2019 headquarters are able to add  money to the Corps of Engineers Financial Management System which is  how money, including all program management and support funds, is  distributed for the FUDS program. The program management and support  funding is also assigned a specific code, which can be used to track its  expenditures in the financial system. Additionally, each division receives  only a relatively small amount of program management and support  funding in relation to their overall budget for the FUDS program. Corps\u2019  officials in the divisions and districts we visited told us that these funds  are critical to their operations, because they pay for manager\u2019s salaries,  travel for training, and respond to administrative requests from  headquarters and state regulators. Due to the limited amount of these  funds, division and district FUDS managers keep close watch on them,  according to Corps officials, and vigorously question any expenditure of  these funds, which helps to ensure that program management and support  resources are spent only on the approved items."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Although the issues we identified regarding the Corps\u2019 5-year review  process have implications for all FUDS where 5-year reviews are required  or may be appropriate, they are particularly relevant to sites with emerging  contaminants. As more FUDS begin to reach the cleanup phase and  knowledge on emerging contaminants continues to evolve, 5-year reviews  may play a more important role in identifying and responding to changes  in information used in FUDS cleanup decisions, such as toxicity values  and standards. The issues we identified raise concerns about the extent to  which the districts and divisions (1) will record and review data on 5-year  reviews in the Corps\u2019 information management systems, (2) will conduct  all required 5-year reviews on time, and (3) will consistently conduct  reviews when appropriate. In addition, the lack of technical review of  some of these reports by the Corps\u2019 Center of Expertise raises concerns  about the Corps\u2019 ability to fully identify and appropriately respond to  changes, such as evolving knowledge and standards for emerging  contaminants. Without timely, accurate, and complete 5-year reviews for  sites and reliable information on the status of such reviews, the Corps  cannot be certain that remedies at FUDS remain protective of human  health and the environment and cannot adequately inform stakeholders\u2014 including the Congress, the public, and regulators\u2014regarding actual site  conditions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["To help ensure that the remedies at FUDS continue to protect human  health, safety, and the environment, we are making three  recommendations.

DOD said  that it will ensure that the Corps conducts 5-years reviews where required  by CERCLA, but did not agree to conduct the additional precautionary  reviews that are recommended by EPA.

Between 1994  and 1996, the Corps removed transformers, above, and below-ground fuel  storage tanks and associated piping, and drums filled with chemicals. After  these removal actions, the Corps turned its attention to other FUDS in the  Corps District for a number of years. In 2006, the Corps returned to  remove more waste from buildings, pipes, generators, and sumps. In 2007,  the Corps initiated a site inspection to determine if it had overlooked any  contamination, particularly polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) from  electrical transformers and petroleum from underground storage tanks  and to determine if any further remediation action is needed. Corps  officials anticipated completing the investigation in 2009. From 1991  through 2008, the Corps spent $3.5 million investigating, removing  materials, and taking remedial actions at the site.", "In addition to cleaning up any remaining contamination, MROSD also  wanted the Corps to demolish and remove all remaining structures\u2014many  of which contain deteriorating lead-based paint and asbestos\u2014so that it  may open the site to the public for recreational use. Department of  Defense (DOD) and Corps officials told us that no building  demolition/debris removal can be conducted at this property because the  buildings and structures were not unsafe at the time of transfer out of  DOD jurisdiction. They said that MROSD is responsible for maintaining all  buildings and structures on the property, beginning on the date they took  title.

Perchlorate can also occur naturally and is  found in certain fertilizers. Exposure to perchlorate can affect the thyroid  gland by blocking the uptake of iodide and may cause developmental  impairments in fetuses of pregnant women. Perchlorate has been found in  drinking water sources nationwide, although the extent of perchlorate  contamination was not revealed until 1997, when new analytical methods  enabled measurement of perchlorate at low concentrations. According to  the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in testing of 3,865 public  water supplies between 2001 and 2005, approximately 160 systems (4.1  percent)\u2014located in 26 states and 2 territories\u2014had at least one detection  of perchlorate at levels greater than or equal to 4 micrograms per liter  (\u00b5g/l, or parts per billion (ppb)).

At the conclusion of its study in 2005, the Council  recommended a reference dose of 0.7 \u00b5g per kilogram of body weight per  day, which translates to a drinking water equivalent level of 24.5 ppb. EPA  adopted this recommended level and, in January 2006, directed its regional  offices to use this concentration as a preliminary remediation goal when  cleaning up sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,  Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) and the National Oil and  Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan, the regulation that  implements CERCLA. In response to the Council\u2019s study and EPA\u2019s new  guidance, DOD updated its perchlorate policy in January 2006. With  regard to FUDS, the policy directed DOD to (1) test for perchlorate, (2)  conduct a site-specific risk assessment if perchlorate levels in water  exceed 24 ppb, and (3) prioritize the site for risk management if the risk  assessment indicates that the perchlorate contamination could potentially  result in adverse health effects.

However, concerns about this contaminant  have increased in recent years. For example, in 2006, NRC reported that  the evidence on carcinogenic risk and other health hazards from exposure  to TCE has strengthened since 2001. New information may lead to changes  in the toxicity values used to assess risks of TCE exposure. In making  cleanup decisions for FUDS, the Corps uses toxicity values for  contaminants in conducting assessments of a site\u2019s risks to human health  and the environment. EPA\u2019s Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS), a  database that contains EPA\u2019s scientific position on the potential human  health effects of exposure to more than 540 chemicals, is DOD\u2019s and EPA\u2019s  preferred source for the fundamental toxicity information needed to  develop human health risk assessments. However, EPA has not finalized  its IRIS assessment of the risks TCE may pose. Given EPA\u2019s ongoing  assessment and different preferences among regulatory agencies, DOD has  used a variety of different toxicity values in assessing risks of TCE  exposure at FUDS. In January 2009, EPA issued interim guidance  recommending toxicity values to use in assessing potential cancer and  noncancer risks from inhalation of or oral exposure to TCE. However,  EPA withdrew this guidance in April 2009, stating that the agency would  further evaluate the recommendations regarding the noncancer TCE  toxicity value to use in assessing the risk of inhalation exposures. DOD  plans to use the interim values in the withdrawn EPA guidance, but DOD  officials noted that an EPA regional office or state regulatory agency may  press DOD to use a value preferred by an individual risk assessor at that  agency. According to DOD, in these cases, DOD works with EPA and state  officials to develop an agreed-upon value.", "In addition, intrusion of TCE vapors from soil or groundwater into  buildings is a relatively newly-identified exposure pathway. A federal  standard exists for TCE in indoor air at places of work, but not in  residences or other buildings. EPA, the Army, and DOD have issued  guidance on vapor intrusion, and officials told us that the Corps evaluates  the vapor intrusion pathway, when appropriate, through the site-specific  risk assessment. In 2002, EPA issued its Office of Solid Waste and  Emergency Response (OSWER) Draft Guidance for Evaluating the Vapor  Intrusion to Indoor Air Pathway from Groundwater and Soils  (Subsurface Vapor Intrusion Guidance), which has not been finalized  and, according to DOD, is not followed by all state health agencies. In  2006, the Army released its Interim Vapor Intrusion Policy for  Environmental Response Actions, which established environmental  response actions related to vapor intrusion modeling and investigation for  existing and future buildings. It also noted that potential vapor intrusion  risks in existing or future buildings will be evaluated as part of the  CERCLA Five-Year Review, consistent with the guidelines in the policy, if  these risks were not evaluated in the Record of Decision or Decision  Document for the site. In January 2009, DOD published its Tri-Services  Handbook for the Assessment of the Vapor Intrusion Pathway, a  technical guidance manual that discusses various approaches for  evaluating the vapor intrusion pathway, including information on  developing and interpreting vapor intrusion investigations.", "As of July 2009, DOD was revising its 2001 Defense Environmental  Restoration Program Management Guidance, which will outline the  conditions under which the DOD components are instructed to evaluate  whether contamination in soil or groundwater poses a potential for  unacceptable risk from vapor intrusion into overlying or nearby existing  structures. The revisions call for appropriate response actions for a vapor  intrusion pathway in existing structures when the potential for vapor  intrusion exists and \u201ca site-specific risk assessment indicates an  unacceptable risk to human health due to a release to the environment  that is the responsibility of DOD and not the responsibility of any other  party.\u201d In addition, the revisions note that the DOD components are to  notify non-DOD property owners in writing of potential vapor intrusion  risks and, as appropriate, include this information in decision documents  and/or transfer documents. Further, the revisions state that a transferee  will address the potential for vapor intrusion in future structures at its  own expense by adding appropriate mitigating measures during  construction, and that these obligations are to be included in decisions  documents and/or transfer documents for the site."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Completion Status of Department of Defense Sites by Program Category and Military Component", "paragraphs": ["Tables 16 through 18 show the completion status of Department of  Defense (DOD) sites and those that require long-term management under  the Installation Restoration Program (IRP), the Military Munitions  Response Program (MMRP) and the Building Demolition/Debris Removal  (BD/DR) Program by military component, for fiscal year (FY) 2004 through  2008."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: Department of Defense Obligations and Estimated Costs to Complete Environmental Restoration by Military Component and Program Category", "paragraphs": ["Table 19 shows the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) obligations for  cleanup at active sites for the Installation Restoration Program (IRP), the  Military Munitions Response Program (MMRP), the Building  Demolition/Debris Removal (BD/DR) Program, and program management  and support for fiscal year (FY) 2004 through 2008.", "Table 20 shows DOD\u2019s obligations for cleanup at installations that have  been closed or are designated to be closed or realigned under the Base  Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process under the IRP, MMRP, and for  program management and support for FY 2004 through 2008.", "Table 21 shows DOD\u2019s obligations to clean up formerly used defense sites  (FUDS) under the IRP, MMRP, and BD/DR Program, and program  management and support for FY 2004 through 2008.", "Table 22 shows the DOD\u2019s estimated cost to complete environmental clean  up for sites located at active installations, BRAC installations, and FUDS  under the IRP, MMRP, and BD/DR Program for FY 2004 through 2008."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VII: Department of Defense\u2019s Inventory of Sites and Number of High Risk Sites by Military Component and Program Category", "paragraphs": ["Table 23 shows the total inventory of Department of Defense (DOD) sites  and number ranked high risk in the Installation Restoration Program (IRP)  and the Military Munitions Response Program (MMRP) by military  component, for fiscal year (FY) 2004 through 2008.", "Table 24 shows the total inventory of Base Realignment and Closure  (BRAC) sites and number ranked high risk in the IRP and the MMRP by  military component, for FY 2004 through 2008.", "Table 25 shows the total inventory of formerly used defense sites (FUDS)  and number ranked high risk in the IRP and MMRP for FY 2004 through  2008."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VIII: Formerly Used Defense Sites Program Costs Details", "paragraphs": ["Table 26 shows all of the line item costs for the formerly used defense  sites (FUDS) program for fiscal year (FY) 2004 through 2008.
