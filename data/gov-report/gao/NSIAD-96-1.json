Worldwide, embassies manage about $600 million worth of personal property, procure about $500 million in goods and services annually, and share management responsibilities for about $12 billion in housing and other real properties. Embassies also have responsibility for over $2 million annually in accounts receivable, such as medical expenses.", "For decades, long-standing management deficiencies have weakened administrative operations at the embassies, and millions of dollars remained unnecessarily vulnerable to fraud, waste, and abuse. We have previously criticized State\u2019s deficient controls over embassies\u2019 personal and real property, cashiering operations, contract administration, and training. In July 1993, we testified that management deficiencies continued to plague embassies\u2019 operations. We suggested that each embassy establish a formal management improvement program to ensure sound management practices by documenting problems and monitoring corrective actions.", "For years, Congress has been concerned about State\u2019s reluctance to address management and internal control problems that have historically reduced the effectiveness of its operations. In its November 1993 report, the House Committee on Government Operations stated that State should implement our recommendation that each embassy adopt a formal management improvement plan. On the basis of prior reviews by us and State\u2019s Office of the Inspector General (OIG), the Committee also recommended that State (1) strengthen controls over personal property, (2) ensure that appropriate training is available for U.S. and foreign service national personnel, (3) implement contracting and procurement improvements, (4) eliminate control problems in cashiering functions, and (5) develop systems to track and collect medical insurance reimbursements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State Has Not Fully Implemented Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["State has not implemented our suggestion that all posts establish formal management improvement programs to identify and correct deficiencies.

(See app. I.)", "State has responded to recommendations contained in the House Committee on Government Operations\u2019 report by initiating some specific actions designed to improve its management over embassy operations. These actions, although steps in the right direction, do not go far enough to ensure that each embassy is improving its operations. We and the State\u2019s OIG continue to find deficiencies in (1) controlling personal property; (2) training for U.S. and foreign service national personnel; (3) contracting and procurement practices; (4) poor controls over cashiering functions; (5) medical insurance reimbursements; and (6) senior-level oversight of operations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Controls Over Personal Property", "paragraphs": ["In November 1993, the House Committee on Government Operations recommended that the State Department take the following actions to strengthen controls over personal property: establish more stringent procedures and guidance for receiving and issuing personal property overseas; improve the nonexpendable property application software to enhance reconciliation capability; provide increased and specialized training for Foreign Service officers and revise volume 6 of the Foreign Affairs Manual to require property officers to retain inventory records and other pertinent documentation in post files for 3 years; and adopt a zero-tolerance policy with respect to personal property losses.", "In July 1993, before the Committee\u2019s report, State updated volume 6 of the Foreign Affairs Manual to include revised personal property regulations for all diplomatic and consular posts. This updated guidance incorporated changes in assigned responsibilities and federal regulations. The revised regulations also clarified accountability criteria for ensuring internal controls. On the basis of the new regulations, State\u2019s Property Management Branch, which is responsible for central oversight for domestic and overseas personal property management, issued an instruction handbook that was intended to be an easy reference for posts to ensure compliance with management of personal property overseas. However, branch officials acknowledged that a number of posts were still not in compliance. During fiscal year 1994, branch staff visited 20 of the 260 posts to verify their annual inventory certification. Branch officials said that 14 posts failed to provide documentation that physical inventories were conducted. Although posts that do not provide inventory certifications can be subject to a withholding of funds for personal property acquisitions, and individuals that either refused to certify or falsely certified inventories can be subject to punitive actions, we found no instances in which money was withheld or individuals were sanctioned for not following property management procedures.", "According to State, it has a zero tolerance policy on personal property loses for fraudulent behavior, but it does not believe it to be in the taxpayers\u2019 interest to pursue small shortages; therefore, in November 1993, it adopted a 1-percent tolerance. State adopted this policy because the 1-percent level is commensurate with that of private industry and State officials believed that the cost to pursue shortages of less than 1-percent would outweigh any benefits. State officials said they required posts to submit to headquarters the amount of losses incurred in fiscal year 1994. Of the 160 posts that submitted such information, only 15 exceeded the 1-percent level.", "In 1989, to improve property management and accountability, State integrated an inventory reconciliation software package with its non-expendable property application (NEPA) software at about 210 of the overseas posts. State is testing a new application of NEPA, but it has not yet determined how NEPA and other subsidiary systems will function with the planned Integrated Financial Management System.

State acknowledged that, in some cases, Foreign Service officers report to posts without such training. And, according to the Director of the Office of Foreign Service National Personnel, training Foreign Service nationals is not a priority because of the high costs involved in bringing Foreign Service nationals to Washington, D.C.", "Although State says it has focused on increasing its regional training of Foreign Service nationals, those we interviewed said that training was still limited, often not timely, and generally not offered in their native language. Of the seven posts we visited, only Paris had formal training programs that identified or provided opportunities for the training requirements of Foreign Service nationals or officers.", "State is exploring ways to increase the role of Foreign Service nationals in administrative operations overseas. However, the Foreign Service Institute does not have a formal plan in place to ensure that Foreign Service nationals receive adequate training.

However, only 150 of the 700 officers overseas have received required training for standard contracting authority up to $250,000. The rest of State\u2019s overseas contracting officers have provisional contracting authority up to $100,000.Procurement officials estimate that it will take many years before all of these officers complete their training. In addition, some Foreign Service nationals responsible for maintaining contracting files indicated that they were not adequately trained. For example, one Foreign Service national told us she had been involved in procurement actions for 6 years before receiving formal training.", "State developed a worldwide procurement database to meet the minimum legal and regulatory overseas procurement reporting requirements. This database is currently in use at 193 (or 73 percent) of the 265 overseas posts. This database, however, only reports the number and types of contract actions. It is not used to manage, monitor, or ensure control over embassy procurement operations.", "Most of the posts we visited had not established a competition advocacy program called for by the Committee. The lack of such a program contributed to the failure of some posts to fully compete or review their contract actions and prepare and maintain required documentation. None of the posts had a written policy to advertise solicitations or had evidence that solicitations were authorized. Also, most posts did not maintain a current vendor list, and therefore, could not be assured that all potential sources had been solicited.", "Several of the embassy officials we met with said they had not received or could not locate headquarters\u2019 guidance stipulating the need of advance acquisition planning.

Although reconciliations are required monthly at overseas post, only about one-third of embassies\u2019 cashiering operations are currently reviewed each year by external review teams from the State\u2019s Financial Service Centers. Headquarters officials said that losses have been minimal, but acknowledged that major problems could occur.", "To gain control over disbursing operations overseas, State has centralized 18 of 19 disbursing operations with its 3 regional administrative management centers and plans to relocate the 1 remaining operation (Brasilia). State\u2019s Deputy Chief Financial Officer and Deputy Assistant Secretary for Finance initiated this action to improve oversight and management controls over disbursing.", "State also created the Office of Overseas Financial Management and Oversight under the Chief Financial Officer. However, officials from this office said that fiscal irregularities were continuing due to (1) the lack of trained U.S. Foreign Service officers and nationals on cashiering practices, (2) negligence, and (3) malfeasance.", "To address the Committee\u2019s recommendation to train staff on financial controls, in June 1994, at the Regional Administrative Management Center in Mexico City, State trained about 40 budget and fiscal officers and 40 supervisory Foreign Service nationals from the posts in Mexico on safeguards and procedures to prevent theft or misuse of funds.

State\u2019s Office of Medical Services now assigns an obligation number for each medical claim and authorizes payment by the overseas posts. The embassy notifies the office of each payment, and an accounts receivable and corresponding billing documents are then established in the Central Financial Management System. These actions resulted in collections of over $1 million in fiscal year 1994, including funds owed since 1991. According to a Medical Services official, the collection system applies to State employees only. It does not cover employees of other agencies that may receive medical services overseas.", "Although State still does not require Foreign Service officers to have private medical insurance before they are assigned overseas, it has stopped paying claims for hospitalization of those without insurance with the exception of the hospital admission charge, which must be promptly reimbursed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Senior-Level Oversight of Operations", "paragraphs": ["In 1993, the Committee called for increased oversight of operations by senior officials both in Washington and at the embassies. State officials acknowledged that a greater emphasis should be placed on management controls, and that commitment and support should come from the top. To enhance senior managers\u2019 commitment at posts, State has introduced a number of actions intended to address the managers\u2019 systemic disregard for sound management practices and establish accountability for carrying out headquarter\u2019s requirements. For example, State now emphasizes the importance of management controls and responsibility for those controls to newly appointed ambassadors during preassignment briefings and in the Secretary\u2019s Chief of Mission Authority Letter. The Chiefs of Mission are required to develop a Mission Program Plan that will form the basis for the missions\u2019 major activities and resource allocations and have the plan approved by the Assistant Secretary of State. They are also required to reduce mission costs whenever possible, implement sound management controls to ensure that government resources are maximized and protected, and certify annually that management controls are adequate.", "Another action to increase senior-level attention to embassy management included the addition of a management control segment to the training course for new Deputy Chiefs of Mission. This segment defines management controls, emphasizes using the Mission Program Plan, and encourages the use of the risk assessment questionnaire. In addition, the risk assessment questionnaire was revised to include questions covering the minimum controls necessary for facilities maintenance, contracting, and medical reimbursements.", "These initiatives were inconsistently applied at the posts we visited.

For example, in Tunis and Ankara, setting performance targets for inventory control and accountability resulted in more efficient property utilization and reduced losses from theft. Cross-training programs for Foreign Service nationals within the budget and finance offices in Tunis and Ankara increased their supervisors\u2019 flexibility to fill staffing gaps and enhanced morale among their subordinates. In Tunis and Dhaka, the implementation of internal control checklists for contract administration ensured that their contracting and procurement operations were in compliance with regulations.
