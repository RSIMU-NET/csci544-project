GAO recommended that VA clarify these definitions. VA concurred and has taken a number of actions in response, including improved oversight through scheduling audits. However, VA's first internal audit in August 2018 was unable to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of its wait-time data due to the lack of business rules for calculating them, indicating that additional efforts are needed to address this issue.", "GAO also found in 2012 that not all facilities GAO visited used the electronic wait list to track new patients that needed medical appointments, as required by VA's scheduling policy.

VA concurred, and with the information VA provided in July 2019 GAO considers VA's actions, including updating its scheduling policy and completing scheduler training, sufficient to fully address the recommendation.", "While improvements to VA's scheduling policy and processes will help ensure veterans receive timely access to care, there are other factors that may also affect access that are not currently reflected in VA's wait-time data. For example, GAO found instances in which the time it took the agency to initially enroll veterans in VA health care benefits was more than 3 months.", "GAO has also made recommendations to improve appointment scheduling and ensure timely access to care from non-VA providers in VA's community care programs that remain unimplemented. GAO found in June 2018 that the data VA used to monitor the timeliness of the Veterans Choice Program's appointments captured only a portion of the total appointment scheduling process. Although VA had a wait-time goal of 30 days, VA's timeliness data did not capture certain processes, such as the time taken to prepare veterans' referrals and send them to a third-party administrator. GAO found that if these were accounted for, veterans could potentially wait up to 70 calendar days to see a community care provider. VA officials stated that most recommendations will be addressed with new program tools it plans to implement. For example, VA is implementing a system for referral management and appointment scheduling expected to be available in all VA medical facilities by fiscal year 2021.

However, VA\u2019s  scheduling policy and training documents for recording the desired date  were unclear and did not ensure consistency. We observed that not all  schedulers at VA medical centers that we visited recorded the desired  date correctly.

However, the definition of preferred date is substantively the same  as the definition of desired date in the previous scheduling policy, the  latter of which we found to be subject to interpretation and prone to  scheduler error in our 2012 report. We continue to believe that the  preferred date is also subject to interpretation and prone to scheduler  error, which poses concerns for the reliability of wait times measured  using the patient\u2019s preferred date.", "In its updated July 2016 scheduling policy, VA also changed the  terminology of the start date to the \u201cclinically indicated date\u201d for  established patients whose provider has documented a clinically  appropriate return-to-clinic date in the patient\u2019s electronic health record.  The clinically indicated date is substantively the same as the definition of  desired date for established patients in the previous scheduling directive.", "While VA has not clarified the definitions of start dates, VA has taken  actions intended to improve the accurate recording of the clinically  indicated date in three ways:  1.  VA requires clinical leadership (such as the Associate Chief of Staff)  at each VA medical facility to ensure that providers enter the clinically  indicated date in the electronic health record for future appointments;  2.  VA standardized the entry of the clinically indicated date in the  electronic health record to improve the accuracy of the date, which  was implemented across all VA medical facilities as of July 2018; and  3.  VA created a technology enhancement to enable the automatic  transfer of the clinically indicated date from the electronic health  record to the scheduling system. As a result, the scheduler no longer  has to retrieve the date from veterans\u2019 electronic health records and  manually enter it into the scheduling system. VA reported that this  enhancement was implemented at all but three VA medical facilities  as of January 2019.", "In July 2019, VA reported to us that the error rate for the patient indicated  date (either the clinically indicated date, or in the absence of that date, the  patient\u2019s preferred date) was 8 percent of about 667,000 appointments  audited in the most recent biannual audit cycle, ending March 31, 2019.

VA reported that 97 percent of all staff who scheduled an appointment  within 30 days completed the required scheduling training as of July 2,  2019.

VA\u2019s July 2016 scheduling policy required  biannual audits of the timeliness and appropriateness of schedulers\u2019  actions and accuracy of entry of the clinically indicated date and preferred  date, the start dates of wait-time measurement as identified by the  revised scheduling policy. In June 2017, VA deployed a standardized  scheduling audit process for staff at VA medical centers to use. As part of  our recommendation follow-up in July 2019, VA reported 100 percent  completion of the required biannual scheduling audits in fiscal year 2018.  As noted above, VA reported to us that the error rate for the patient  indicated date (either the clinically indicated date, or in the absence of  that date, the patient\u2019s preferred date) was 8 percent of about 667,000  appointments audited. While VA asserts that errors in the clinically  indicated date have decreased, an error rate of 8 percent still yields errors  in more than 53,000 appointments audited.

Though VA had a 30-day wait-time goal to provide  veterans with care under the Choice Program, VA\u2019s timeliness data did  not capture (1) the time VA medical centers took to prepare veterans\u2019  referrals and send them to the TPAs, and (2) the time spent by TPAs in  accepting the referrals and opting veterans into the Choice Program. For  example, we found that it took VA medical center staff an average of 24  calendar days after the veteran\u2019s need for care was identified to contact  the veteran, compile relevant clinical information, and send the veteran\u2019s  referral to the TPAs. For those same authorizations, it took the TPAs an  average of 14 calendar days to accept referrals and reach veterans to opt  them into the Choice Program.", "In 2016, VA also conducted its own manual review of appointment  scheduling times and found that wait times could be longer than the 30  days (see fig. 2). Specifically, out of a sample of about 5,000 Choice  Program authorizations, VA analyzed (1) the timeliness with which VA  medical centers sent referrals to the TPAs, and (2) veterans\u2019 overall wait  times for Choice Program care. VA\u2019s analysis identified average review  times when veterans were referred to the Choice Program to be greater- than-30-day wait time for an appointment at a VA medical facility. For  example, for overall wait times (i.e., the time veterans\u2019 need for care was  identified until they attended initial Choice Program appointments), wait  times ranged from 34 to 91 days across the 18 VA integrated service  networks. The national average was 51 days.", "In September 2017, VA began implementing an interim solution to  monitor overall wait times, but this solution relied on VA medical center  staff consistently and accurately entering data on referrals, a process that  is prone to error. In June 2018, we recommended that VA establish a  mechanism to monitor the overall wait times under the VCCP. VA agreed  with this recommendation, and stated that it is developing a monitoring  mechanism that will be incorporated into a new system that will be fully  implemented across all VA medical facilities by fiscal year 2021."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Inaccurate Data", "paragraphs": ["We also reported that the clinically indicated dates included on referrals  that VA medical centers sent to the TPAs, which are used to measure the  timeliness of care, may not have been accurate, further limiting VA\u2019s  monitoring of veterans\u2019 access to care. Our review of 196 Choice  Program authorizations found that clinically indicated dates were  sometimes changed by VA medical center staff before they were sent to  the TPAs, which could mask veterans\u2019 true wait times. We found that VA  medical center staff entered later clinically indicated dates on referrals for  about 23 percent of the 196 authorizations reviewed. We made two  recommendations to improve the accuracy of the Choice Program data.  For example, we recommended that VA establish a mechanism under the  VCCP that prevents clinically indicated dates from being modified. VA  agreed with our recommendation, and stated that a new system will  interface with VA\u2019s existing referral package to allow a VA clinician to  enter in a clinically indicated date while restricting schedulers from  making alterations to it."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "VA Has Not Addressed Other Factors That Could Adversely Affect Veterans\u2019 Access to Care under the VCCP", "paragraphs": ["In June 2018, we also reported that numerous factors adversely affected  veterans\u2019 timely access to care through the Choice Program and could  affect access under the VCCP. These factors included the following: (1)  administrative burden caused by complexities of VA\u2019s referral and  appointment scheduling processes; (2) poor communication between VA  and its medical facilities; and (3) inadequacies in the networks of  community providers established by the TPAs, including an insufficient  number, mix, or geographic distribution of community providers.", "VA has taken steps to help address these factors; however, none have  been fully addressed. For example, to help address administrative burden  and improve the process of coordinating veterans\u2019 Choice Program care,  VA established a secure e-mail system and a mechanism for TPAs and  community providers to remotely access veterans\u2019 VA electronic health  records. However, these mechanisms only facilitate a one-way transfer of  necessary information. They do not provide a means by which VA  medical facilities or veterans can view the TPAs\u2019 step-by-step progress in  scheduling appointments or electronically receive medical documentation  associated with Choice Program appointments. We made five  recommendations to VA to address the factors that adversely affected  veterans\u2019 access to Choice Program care.

Under the VCCP, VA began  determining veteran eligibility based on designated access standards,  such as wait-time goals of 20 days for primary and mental health care  and 28 days for specialty care and other criteria identified in the MISSION  Act. According to VA officials, the implementation of the VCCP also  included the use of the new Decision Support Tool\u2014a system that  combines eligibility and other information to help veterans, with  assistance from VA staff, decide whether to seek care in the community.  VA officials previously identified the Decision Support Tool along with  another new system\u2014known as the Health Share Referral Management  system\u2014as key efforts in addressing many of our recommendations  related to VA\u2019s community care wait-time data and monitoring issues. VA  expects the Health Share Referral Management system, which will  manage community care referrals and authorizations as well as facilitate  the exchange of health information between VA and community  providers, to be fully implemented across all VA medical facilities in fiscal  year 2021.

We have ongoing work  related to same-day services provided in VA primary care and mental  health clinics. In order to improve access, VA implemented the same-day  service initiative in 2016, and by 2018 offered same-day services in over  1000 facilities. As part of the initiative, VA medical facility staff are  directed to address veterans\u2019 primary care and mental health needs that  day through a variety of methods, including face-to-face visits, telehealth,  prescription refills, or by scheduling a follow-up appointment. Our ongoing  work indicates that the six VA medical facilities we visited were generally  providing same-day services prior to the initiative; however, according to  VA officials, ongoing staffing and space shortages created challenges  implementing the initiative. Our ongoing work also indicates that VA does  not have performance goals and measures to determine same-day  services\u2019 impact on veterans\u2019 access to care. We plan to issue our report  on VA\u2019s same-day services initiative in August 2019.", "In closing, we have identified various weaknesses in VA\u2019s wait-time  measurement and scheduling processes over the years. These  weaknesses have affected not only VA\u2019s internal delivery of outpatient  care, but also that provided through community providers. As we have  highlighted here, we have made a number of recommendations to  address these weaknesses. VA has taken actions to address our  recommendations, but additional work is needed for some. The  implementation of enhanced technology, such as a new scheduling  system, is crucial and will provide an important foundation for  improvements. However, this is not a panacea for addressing all of the  identified problems. Moving forward, VA must also continuously ensure  that it has clear and consistent policies and processes, adequate  oversight, and effective training.", "Chairman Takano, Ranking Member Roe, and Members of the  Committee, this completes my prepared statement.
