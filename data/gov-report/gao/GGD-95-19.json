One of the types of banks in the System is called a Farm Credit Bank (FCB). FCBs primarily provide loans to district associations, which in turn lend to their member-borrowers, primarily eligible farmers and ranchers. Congress required us in the Farm Credit Banks and Associations Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 (P.L. 102-552) to study how farmer and rancher member-borrowers of the Farm Credit System institutions might benefit if the 10 district Farm Credit Banks (and the Federal Intermediate Credit Bank of Jackson) merged into fewer regional Farm Credit Banks."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The System is a government-sponsored enterprise (GSE).

It issues regulations and examines System institutions for compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and safe and sound banking practices. In 1993, the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation (FCSIC) became fully operational with certain limited oversight responsibilities that are closely coordinated with FCA.

Rather than operating to generate the largest possible profits, the System generally operates for the benefit of its member-borrowers and has no pure profit motive.

The associations, in turn, provide services and funding to the member-borrowers. The impact of FCB mergers on farmer and rancher borrowers primarily depends on how their associations are affected. Because all of the FCB mergers have occurred since 1992 (most since 1993), our analysis is of short-term impacts and not potential long-term outcomes.", "Our work focused on the six factors we were asked to consider. To provide balanced views, we met with over 75 bank and association officials. We mailed survey questionnaires to the chief executive officer (CEO) or president of every association and faxed surveys to each FCB CEO or president to obtain their opinions on FCB mergers. Eighty-eight percent of the association officials and 100 percent of bank officials responded.Because we surveyed every association and FCB in the System for which we had a record, and because we did not project the results to any larger population, our results were not subject to any sampling error. Nevertheless, all survey data are subject to various types and amounts of nonsampling error, such as the error that could result (1) if nonrespondents differ from respondents on some attribute measured by the survey or (2) from omissions and erroneous answers made by respondents.

However, we reviewed AgriBank\u2019s 1993 FCA examination report to ensure that no material internal control and reporting problems were identified. We also reviewed estimated cost savings expected from the mergers provided in bank disclosure documents. We did not independently analyze the projections; however, FCA, the System\u2019s regulator, found them to be generally reasonable and achievable. To determine the potential impact of mergers on the level of services provided by associations, we gathered information from associations on the level of services offered as of September 1993. We also reviewed merger plans to determine expectations, if any, of disruptions in the level of services or types of loan products available to borrowers.", "To determine the impact of mergers on the cooperative nature of the System, we gathered the opinions of bank and association officials.

Under certain conditions, the realization of the anticipated bank-level savings may eventually result in slightly lower interest rates for farmers and ranchers.", "Although the projected savings per FCB may appear substantial, the amounts for each FCB represented only a small fraction of total district operating costs (see table 2.1.), because most district operating costs are incurred at the association level. In terms of overall district operating costs, slight increases in association costs could easily offset projected merger-related savings at the FCB level. The overall (districtwide) cost-reducing effect of mergers may also be limited, in that bank mergers do not directly reduce the costs of the local lending network (associations and their branches)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Operating Expense Rates Varied Among the Districts", "paragraphs": ["To provide a measure of the overall operating efficiency of the districts (banks and associations), we calculated operating rates\u2014operating expenses per $100 of gross loans\u2014between 1990 and 1993 and found that they varied somewhat throughout the System. (See table 2.2.) Although 1993 district rates ranged from $1.72 to $2.95, excluding the high and low rates, 8 of 10 were between $2.05 and $1.78. Some of this $.27 variation in operating expenses may have resulted from various organizational, structural, operational, and philosophical differences among the districts.", "We found that no one type of district structure or operating philosophy appeared to be consistently more efficient than another. For example, while Omaha and Louisville had the lowest operating cost rate in 1992 and 1993, they operated quite differently. The Omaha FCB provided its jointly managed districtwide FLBA/PCA with numerous support services and essentially operated as a single entity. On the other hand, the Louisville FCB operated as a strictly wholesale lender, providing few support services to its five ACAs (one had $2.5 billion in assets, the remaining four had combined assets of $.54 billion). Other wholesale FCBs, such as Springfield, Baltimore, and Columbia, had higher rates.", "If banks that belong to districts with different district operating rates merge, the rate for the merged district may be higher or lower depending on the characteristics of the districts. For example, premerger operating cost rates for the St. Paul and St. Louis districts were $1.91 and $1.96 respectively. AgriBank\u2019s restated 1991 rate was $1.93. Thus, the new rate was higher than St. Paul\u2019s but lower than St. Louis\u2019. Following the merger in May 1992, the AgriBank rate increased slightly, in part because of higher association operating costs. In 1993, the district\u2019s operating rate increased further to $2.05.

We did not independently verify the reasonableness of these projections; however, FCA found them to be generally reasonable and achievable. The merged banks expected to achieve most of their savings through staff reductions, office consolidation, more efficient use of technology, and a general reduction in other costs due to fewer employees. Projected savings net of any anticipated increases in association costs represented only 3 to 7 percent of total district premerger operating costs. However, it is often difficult to project and realize any merger-related cost savings because (1) projections are based on economic assumptions; (2) success depends on management\u2019s ability to actually lower costs; and (3) there are many uncontrollable factors, such as inflation.", "Fifty-nine percent of association and bank officials surveyed believed bank mergers would lead to economies of scale. Another 24 percent believed they would negatively affect economies of scale. If economies of scale were achieved, we calculated that projected bank-only operating cost savings for each of the four mergers could translate to a 6 to 32 basis point savings for associations in those districts. A 32 basis point decrease in an association\u2019s wholesale loan rate would be equivalent to a 6-percent rate being decreased to 5.68 percent. For borrowers, the impact of bank-level savings would depend on costs at the association level as well. For example, if a merged bank were able to lower its rates to associations by 32 basis points but association operating costs increased an equivalent of 19 basis points, the association could pass only 13 basis points of savings on to farmer and rancher borrowers provided all other operating goals remained constant. Under this scenario, a farmer or rancher borrower\u2019s loan rate would decline 13 basis points. On a $70,000 loan, he or she would save $91 in interest costs on the loan annually.

Likewise, salaries and benefits represented the largest operating expense category in each district. Depending on the district, these costs ranged from 52 to 65 percent of total operating expenses.", "Generally, the merged FCBs projected that a substantial portion of their operating savings would come from reductions in staff achieved by consolidating duplicative staff positions. For example, documents related to the 1992 St. Paul/St.Louis merger showed that 70 percent of the projected $10 million in cost savings would come from eliminating 142 employees. As of April 1993, AgriBank had reduced its staff by a total of 111. For a detailed discussion of bank-level staffing changes resulting from the St. Paul/St. Louis merger, see appendix IV. Other merged FCBs projected staff reductions of 50 to 90 employees, representing reductions in the range of 16 to 45 percent of the premerger staff.", "Although bank mergers are expected to result in lower staff levels, banks may delegate certain functions to their associations if the merged FCB chooses not to provide those functions. For this reason, associations in some merged districts expected to increase staff to perform services once provided by the FCB. For example, Farm Credit Services of the Midlands PCA/FLCA\u2014the jointly managed associations in the old Omaha district\u2014planned to hire additional staff following their FCB\u2019s merger to provide certain services and functions formerly provided by their FCB.

Some association officials believed that FCB mergers would result in more association mergers and larger associations able to function with less FCB support. Some mergers did result in associations having to provide certain services and functions previously provided by their FCB. However, we did not find a substantial increase in association mergers following the St. Paul/St.Louis merger.

However, because a majority (71 percent in 1992) of the district\u2019s costs are incurred at the association level, increases in association operating costs contributed to an overall increase in district operating costs. Since associations in other districts experienced similar increases, we believe the increase in association costs experienced in the AgriBank district is not necessarily attributable to the merger.
