These grants fall into one of two categories: single- purpose and multipurpose. Single-purpose grants were clearly or completely for crime technology assistance. For example, the purpose of the State Identification Systems Grant Program, which was authorized by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-132), is to enable states to develop computerized identification systems that are compatible and integrated with certain FBI databases.", "Multipurpose grants can be used by state and local law enforcement agencies for a number of purposes including, but not limited to, crime technology. For example, the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-570) established formula and discretionary grants to state and local law enforcement agencies for addressing crime related to illegal drugs and other purposes. The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (P.L. 100-690) expanded the grant programs and named them the Edward Byrne Memorial State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance Programs. Byrne programs are to be used to improve criminal justice systems, to enhance anti-drug programs, and for other purposes.", "More recently, the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (P.L. 103-322) authorized $30.2 billion for law enforcement and crime prevention measures. In addition to authorizing additional funding for Byrne programs through fiscal year 2000, the 1994 Act established what is known as the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services within Justice and authorized $8.8 billion in related funding. Also, the Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-134) provided funding for the Local Law Enforcement Block Grants Program, which provides funding to state and local governments to reduce crime and improve public safety.", "Nongrant federal assistance\u2014such as providing state and local law enforcement with access to support services and systems\u2014may be specifically authorized by legislation.
