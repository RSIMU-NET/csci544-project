These benefits include Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), food stamps, federally assisted housing, postsecondary education assistance, and some federal contracts and licenses. Given the sizable population of drug offenders in the United States, the number and the impacts of federal denial of benefit provisions may be particularly important if the operations of these provisions work at cross purposes with recent federal initiatives intended to ease prisoner reentry and foster prisoner reintegration into society. GAO analyzed (1) for selected years, the number and percentage of drug offenders that were estimated to be denied federal postsecondary education and federally assisted housing benefits and federal grants, contracts, and licenses and (2) the factors affecting whether drug offenders would have been eligible to receive TANF and food stamp benefits, but for their drug offense convictions, and for a recent year, the percentage of drug offenders released who would have been eligible to receive these benefits. Several agencies reviewed a draft of this report, and we incorporated the technical comments that some provided into the report where appropriate."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["For the years for which it obtained data, GAO estimates that relatively small percentages of applicants but thousands of persons were denied postsecondary education benefits, federally assisted housing, or selected licenses and contracts as a result of federal laws that provide for denying benefits to drug offenders. During academic year 2003-2004, about 41,000 applicants (or 0.3 percent of all applicants) were disqualified from receiving postsecondary education loans and grants because of drug convictions. For 2003, 13 of the largest public housing agencies in the nation reported that less than 6 percent of 9,249 lease terminations that occurred in these agencies were for reasons of drug-related criminal activities--such as illegal distribution or use of a controlled substance--and 15 large public housing agencies reported that about 5 percent of 29,459 applications for admission were denied admission for these reasons. From 1990 through the second quarter of 2004, judges in federal and state courts were reported to have imposed sanctions to deny benefits such as federal licenses, grants, and contracts to about 600 convicted drug offenders per year. Various factors affect which convicted drug felons are eligible to receive TANF or food stamps. This is because state of residence, income, and family situation all play a role in determining eligibility. Federal law mandates that convicted drug felons face a lifetime ban on receipt of TANF and food stamps unless states pass laws to exempt some or all convicted drug felons in their state from the ban. At the time of GAO's review, 32 states had laws exempting some or all convicted drug felons from the ban on TANF, and 35 states had laws modifying the federal ban on food stamps. Because of the eligibility requirements associated with receiving these benefits, only those convicted drug felons who, but for their conviction, would have been eligible to receive the benefits could be affected by the federal bans. For example, TANF eligibility criteria include requirements that an applicant have custodial care of a child and that income be below state-determined eligibility thresholds. Available data for 14 of 18 states that fully implemented the ban on TANF indicate that about 15 percent of drug offenders released from prison in 2001 met key eligibility requirements and constitute the pool of potentially affected drug felons. Proportionally more female drug felons than males may be affected by the ban, as about 27 percent of female and 15 percent of male drug offenders released from prison in 2001 could be affected."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["During recent years, several hundred thousand persons per year in the  United States were convicted in federal and state courts of drug offenses  such as felony drug trafficking and misdemeanor drug possession.  Provisions of federal law allow that these convictions may render these  individuals ineligible to receive selected federal benefits. The benefits  include Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), food stamps,  federally assisted housing, postsecondary education grants and loans, and  certain federal contracts and licenses. Depending upon the federal benefit,  drug offenders may be prohibited from receiving assistance for periods  that range from 1 year to life.", "You asked us to assess the impacts of these provisions. An important first  step in assessing the impacts is to determine how many people could be  affected by these provisions. The number and the impacts of federal denial  of benefit provisions may be particularly important if the operations of  these provisions work at cross purposes with recent federal initiatives  intended to ease prisoner reentry and foster prisoner reintegration into  society. This report analyzes two interrelated questions about the number  or percentage of drug offenders that could be affected by the provisions:  (1) In specific years, how many drug offenders were estimated to be  denied federal postsecondary education benefits, federally assisted  housing, and selected grants, contracts, and licenses? (2) What factors  affect whether drug offenders would have been eligible to receive TANF  and food stamp benefits, but for their drug offense convictions, and for a  recent year, what percentage would have been eligible to receive these  benefits?", "You also asked us to address the impact of federal benefit denial laws on  racial minorities and the long-run consequences of having benefits denied.  The final sections of appendices III, IV, and V in this report include  discussions of the data limitations related to estimating the impacts on  racial minorities. Where information was available, we also identify in the  appendices some of the possible long-run consequences of denial of  benefits.", "To estimate the extent to which drug offenders were denied federal  postsecondary education, federally assisted housing benefits, and selected  federal licenses, grants, and contracts, we obtained and analyzed data  from several agencies. We analyzed Department of Education data on  persons who applied for federal postsecondary education assistance such  as Pell Grants and who reported that they had convictions that prohibited  them from receiving federal postsecondary education benefits. We  analyzed Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) data on the educational  attainment of a nationally representative sample of drug offenders on  probation. From officials at 17 large public housing agencies (PHA) we  obtained information about their experiences in denying federally assisted  housing benefits to persons because of their drug-related criminal  activities. We analyzed data on evictions and denials of admission into  public housing that the Department of Housing and Urban Development  (HUD) obtains from PHAs that manage units in the Public Housing  Program. From the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) we obtained data  on persons reported to be denied selected federal licenses, grants, and  contracts by federal and state judges.", "To estimate the extent to which convicted drug felons would have been  eligible to receive TANF and food stamp benefits apart from their felony  drug offense conviction, we obtained and analyzed the most recently  available data compiled by BJS on the familial and economic  characteristics of drug offenders in prison. We analyzed these data to  estimate the number of drug offenders that met selected eligibility criteria  to receive these benefits, and we applied our estimates from the BJS  prisoner data to data on drug offenders released from prison in 14 of 18  states that fully implemented the federal bans on TANF and food stamps.  Because of the limited data on persons actually denied TANF and food  stamp benefits, we provide rough estimates of the proportions of drug  offenders that met selected eligibility criteria to receive these benefits  rather than of the number of such offenders actually denied these benefits.", "To identify the various factors that contributed to our estimates of those  potentially affected by federal provisions that provide for denial of  benefits, we interviewed officials from the federal agencies that administer  the federal benefits that may be denied, researchers who have studied the  denial of federal benefits and related issues, and officials of various  associations who represent PHAs, which are the agencies that manage  federally assisted benefits. We also reviewed published studies on the  denial of federal benefits.", "We assessed the reliability of the data that we used in preparing this report  by, as appropriate, interviewing agency officials about their data,  reviewing documentation about the data sets, and conducting electronic  tests. We used only the portions of the data that we found to be  sufficiently reliable for our purposes in this report. We provide a more  detailed discussion of our objectives, scope, and general methodology in  appendix I. In appendices II through V, we further discuss our  methodologies for each of the federal benefits that we reviewed.", "We conducted our work from March 2004 through July 2005 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Selected provisions of federal law explicitly prohibit specific categories of  drug offenders from receiving certain federal benefits for specified  periods. Table 1 identifies key provisions of federal law that provide for  denial of benefits specifically to drug offenders and the corresponding  benefits that may or must be denied to drug offenders.", "Except for federal licenses, procurement contracts, and grants under  Denial of Federal Benefits Program, the benefits that may or must be  denied are benefits that are generally provided to low-income individuals  and families. TANF, food stamps, federally assisted housing, and Pell  Grants are low-income programs. The Denial of Federal Benefits Program,  established under Section 5301 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, as  amended, provides that federal and state court judges may deny all or  some of certain specified federal benefits to individuals convicted of drug  trafficking or drug possession offenses involving controlled substances.  Additional details on each of the programs may be found in appendices II,  III, IV, and V.", "The provisions differ on key elements. For example, they establish  different classes of drug offenders that may or must be denied benefits,  and they provide for different periods that drug offenders are rendered  ineligible to receive a benefit and whether or not benefits can be restored.  Some of the provisions allow that drug offenders may become eligible for  benefits upon completing a recognized drug treatment program.", "Provisions established by the Personal Responsibility and Work  Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA), as amended, which  govern the TANF and food stamp programs, provide that benefits must be  denied to persons convicted of a state or federal felony drug offense that  involves the possession, use, or distribution of a controlled substance that  occurred after August 22, 1996, the effective date of these provisions.  Students become ineligible to receive federal postsecondary education  benefits upon a conviction of either a misdemeanor or a felony controlled  substances offense. Loss of federally assisted housing benefits can occur if  individuals, relatives in their household, or guests under a tenant\u2019s control  engage in drug-related criminal activity, regardless of whether the activity  resulted in a conviction. Local public housing authorities, which  administer federally assisted housing benefits, have discretion in  determining the behaviors that could lead to loss of certain federal  housing benefits. Under the Denial of Federal Benefits Program, judges in  federal and state courts may deny a range of federal licenses, contracts,  and grants to persons convicted of controlled substances drug trafficking  and drug possession offenses.", "The period of ineligibility to receive benefits varies. Under PRWORA, as  amended, unless states enact laws that exempt convicted drug offenders  in their state from the federal ban, TANF and food stamp benefits are  forfeited for life for those convicted of disqualifying drug offenses. State  laws may also result in a shorter period of denial of these benefits.  Students are disqualified from receiving federal postsecondary education  benefits for varying periods depending on the number and type of  disqualifying drug offense convictions. A first conviction for possession of  a controlled substance, for example, results in a 1-year period of  ineligibility, while a first conviction for sale of controlled substance results  in a 2-year period of ineligibility. Upon subsequent convictions, the period  of ineligibility can extend indefinitely.", "Federally assisted housing benefits may also be denied for varying periods  of time, depending upon the number and types of drug-related criminal  activities. The minimum loss of benefit is 3 years in certain circumstances,  and the maximum is a lifetime ban. For example, for persons convicted of  certain methamphetamine offenses, the ban is mandatory and for life.  Under the Denial of Federal Benefits Program, the denial of certain other  types of benefits by judges, such as federal grants and contracts, can range  from 1 year to life depending on the type of offense and number of  convictions.", "In some cases, the period of benefit ineligibility may be shortened if  offenders complete drug treatment. For example, students may have their  postsecondary education benefits restored if they satisfactorily complete a  drug treatment program that satisfies certain criteria and includes two  unannounced drug tests. Under the Denial of Federal Benefits Program,  the denial of benefits penalties may, for example, be waived if a person  successfully completes a drug treatment program. Other than offenders  who were convicted of methamphetamine offenses, drug offenders that  successfully complete drug treatment may receive federally assisted  housing benefits prior to the end of their period of ineligibility. In states  that have passed laws so specifying, drug offenders may shorten the  period of ineligibility for TANF and food stamp benefits by completing  drug treatment. (See table 2.)", "The legislative history of these provisions is silent as to whether they were  intended to do more than provide for denying federal benefits to drug  offenders, such as deterring drug offenders from committing future  criminal acts. For example, our 1992 report indicated that in the floor  debates over the Denial of Federal Benefits Program, some members of  Congress expressed the opinion that even casual drug use should result in  serious consequences, such as the loss of federal benefits. With respect to  prohibiting drug offenders from public housing, congressional findings  made in 1990 and amended in 1998 address the extent of drug-related  criminal activities in public housing and the federal government\u2019s duty to  provide public and other federally assisted low-income housing that is  decent, safe, and free from illegal drugs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "How Benefit Eligibility Requirements May Affect whether a Drug Offender Loses Benefits", "paragraphs": ["TANF, food stamps, federally assisted housing, and Pell Grants are means- tested benefits. To receive the benefits, individuals must meet certain  eligibility criteria. These criteria vary with the benefit. For instance, states  determine maximum earned income limits for TANF, but to receive food  stamps, the federal poverty guidelines are generally used in determining  eligibility. To receive federally assisted housing, local area median income  is used. Additionally, most adults eligible for TANF and some adults  eligible for food stamps must meet specified work requirements to  participate in the programs. Table 3 summarizes the general eligibility  requirements for the federal benefits discussed in this report and identifies  the federal, state, and local agencies responsible for administering the  programs.", "Not all persons who meet the general eligibility requirements to receive  federal benefits participate in the respective programs. Our recent study  on programs that aim to support needy families and individuals shows that  the portion of those eligible to receive the benefits that actually enrolled in  the programs varied among programs. Among families eligible to  participate in TANF in 2001, between 46 percent and 50 percent were  estimated to be participating in the program. For food stamps in 2001,  between 46 percent and 48 percent of eligible households were estimated  to participate in the program. For federally assisted housing, between 13  percent and 15 percent of eligible households in 1999 were estimated to be  covered by the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) Program and between 7  percent and 9 percent of eligible households in 1999 were estimated to be  covered by the Public Housing Program. Further, the Department of  Education reports that among all applicants for federal postsecondary  education assistance in academic year 2001-2002, about 77 percent of the  applicants that were eligible to receive Pell Grants applied for and  received them.", "Drug offenders would be directly affected by the federal provisions that  allow for denial of low-income federal benefits when, apart from their  disqualifying drug offense, they would have qualified to receive the  benefits. For example, if a drug offender is not in a financially needy  family and living with her dependent child, the drug offender would not be  eligible for TANF benefits aside from the drug offense conviction. To be  directly affected by the ban on food stamps, a drug offender would have  had to meet income tests and work requirements, unless the work  requirements are, under certain specified circumstances, identified as not  applicable by federal food stamp laws; otherwise, the offender\u2019s  ineligibility to receive the benefit would disqualify him, as opposed to his  drug offense. Because the ban on the receipt of TANF and food stamps is  for life, an offender who is not otherwise eligible to receive the benefits at  one point in time might become otherwise eligible to receive the benefits  at a later point in time and at that time be affected by the provisions of  PRWORA.", "To be otherwise eligible to receive federal postsecondary education  assistance, a person convicted of a disqualifying drug offense would, at a  minimum, have to be enrolled in or accepted at an institution of higher  education, as well as meet certain income tests.

Among selected large PHAs that  reported denying applicants admission into public housing during 2003,  less than 5 percent of applicants were denied admission because of drug- related criminal activities. PHAs have discretion in developing policies to  deny offenders for drug-related criminal activities.

These numbers do not take into account the persons who did not apply for  federal postsecondary education assistance because they thought that  their prior drug convictions would preclude them from receiving  assistance or any applicant who falsified information about drug  convictions. Using these data and Department of Education data on  applicants that received assistance for the academic years 2001-2002  through 2003-2004, we estimated that between 17,000 and 20,000  applicants per year would have been denied Pell Grants, and between  29,000 and 41,000 would have been denied student loans if the applicants  who self-certified to a disqualifying drug offense were eligible to receive  the benefits in the same proportion as the other applicants.

By comparison, according to a Bureau of Justice Statistics report, about 18  percent of adults in the general population had less than a high school  degree.

In  addition, our analysis of BJS data on drug offenders released from prisons  in 23 states during 2001 indicate that about 57 percent of these drug  offenders had not completed high school by the time they were admitted  into prison; about 36 percent had completed high school or obtained a  GED as their highest level of education completed; and the remainder had  completed some postsecondary education."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "In Selected PHAs Less Than 6 Percent of Residents and Applicants Were Denied Federally Assisted Housing during 2003 because of Drug- Related Criminal Activities", "paragraphs": ["We obtained data from 17 of the largest PHAs in the nation on the  decisions that they made to deny federally assisted housing benefits to  residents or applicants during 2003.

A  November 2000 HUD study on the administration of the HCV Program  described the variation in PHA policies on denying housing to persons  who engaged in drug-related criminal activities. HUD concluded that  because of the policy differences, some PHAs could deny applicants who  could be admitted by others. For example, some PHAs consider only  convictions in determining whether applicants qualify for housing benefits,  while others look at both arrests and convictions. Some look for a pattern  of drug-related criminal behavior, while others look for evidence that any  drug-related criminal activities occurred.

Noncitizens  with fewer than 5 years of residence in the United States are generally  ineligible to receive TANF. Several of the states for which we obtained  data on drug offenders released from prison have relatively large  noncitizen populations. Therefore, among those drug offenders that we  estimated could have been eligible to receive TANF benefits might be  some ineligible noncitizens. In addition, the data that we used to estimate  whether drug offenders met state income eligibility requirements included  individual income rather than total family income. It is possible that some  prisoners would join family units with incomes above state TANF  eligibility earned income limits and would thus be disqualified for benefits.", "Among the drug offenders released from prison during 2001, the  percentage that may be affected by the TANF ban at any time during their  lifetimes would be greater than our estimate of those initially affected.

Thus, the percentage ever  affected by the bans would grow over time.", "Because of data availability, our estimates focus on convicted drug felons  who were in prison. We do not have data to assess the effect of the TANF  ban on drug felons who received probation or who were sentenced to time  in local jails. According to BJS data, nationwide, about one-third of  convicted drug felons are sentenced to probation. Moreover, our estimates  apply to the states that fully implemented the ban on TANF. Because of  complexities associated with state exemptions to the federal ban and the  lack of sufficiently detailed data, we cannot provide an estimate of the  percentage of convicted drug offenders who could be affected by the ban  in the 23 states that modified the TANF ban. We note, however, that state  modifications to the ban may allow convicted drug felons to participate in  TANF if they abide by the conditions set in the state exemptions (such as  abide by conditions of parole or probation supervision or participate in  drug treatment). In these states, unlike in the states that fully implement  the federal ban, the post-conviction behavior of offenders would help to  determine whether they could receive the benefit. Other state  modifications allow drug offenders to receive TANF benefits at some point  in the future (such as after completing drug treatment or receiving a  sufficient number of negative drug test results). In states that require that  drug felons wait before becoming eligible to participate in TANF, the  federal ban is in effect until the waiting period ends. We would therefore  expect estimates of the percentage affected during the waiting period to  be similar to the estimates of the percentage affected in the states that  fully implemented the federal ban."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "In States That Fully Implement the Ban on Food Stamps, About One- Fourth of Drug Offenders Released from Prison in 2001 Were Parents Who Could Have Been Eligible for Food Stamps", "paragraphs": ["At the time of our review, 15 states fully implemented the federal ban on  food stamp benefits to convicted drug felons, and 35 states had passed  laws to exempt all or some convicted drug felons in their own states from  the federal ban on food stamps.

There are a number of reasons why the  percentages affected may be relatively small. First, large numbers of drug  offenders would not be eligible for these benefits regardless of their drug  offender status. For example, those who lack a high school diploma are  ineligible for postsecondary educational loans or grants, and many do not  meet eligibility requirement for TANF and food stamps. Also, in the case of  TANF and food stamps, the majority of states have used their discretion to  either partially or fully lift the ban on these benefits for certain drug  offenders.", "It is important to note that although the overall numbers of drug offenders  that could be affected by the TANF and food stamp bans are relatively  small in comparison with the numbers of drug offenders, our estimates  suggest that the effects of the bans disproportionately fall on female  offenders.

Among offenders who entered  prison for a violation of conditions of supervision, some may have  committed their offenses before the TANF ban went into effect, and they  would not be subject to the ban. However, some of the released prisoners  who had violated conditions of supervision may have been convicted after  the ban went into effect, but the available information reported only the  date of admission for the violation and not for the original sentence.

We computed  the number of prisoners who met these conditions, and from these counts,  we estimated the percentages of drug offenders that met these conditions.

In the BJS survey, income is reported  as the offender\u2019s total income in the month prior to the arrest leading to  the incarceration. Monthly income can be from any source and may  include illegal income. We omitted from our analysis those offenders who  reported income from illegal sources, and we included only offenders who  reported earned income or who were unemployed prior to their  imprisonment. Offenders who were unemployed prior to their  imprisonment received a value of zero for earned income. We estimated  the income distributions separately by gender and region to account for  differences in employment and earnings between male and female  offenders, and offenders in different states. We applied the regional  income distributions to all states within a region, as the BJS data did not  report the state in which the offender was incarcerated.", "From the income distributions, we estimated the gender-specific  percentages of drug offenders who had incomes at or below state- determined earned income limits. The BJS inmate survey data report  income in intervals, and in many cases, the intervals do not correspond  directly with the state earned income limits. Therefore, we selected  income intervals that were as near to the state earned income limits as  feasible. We generally selected two income intervals for each state: one  that contained the state earned income limit level but whose lower bound  was less than the state level, and one that contained the state earned  income limit but whose upper bound was above the state level.

Upon release, these attributes may change, and an offender might  become otherwise eligible for TANF and therefore potentially be affected  by the ban. For example, if a drug offender was reunited with his or her  children after release and met other eligibility requirements, this would  contribute to increasing the percentage of released prisoners that were  eligible to receive TANF.

However, we were unable  to determine which drug offenders constituted the potential pool of  ABAWDs. We further gave the potential ABAWDs recipients separate  consideration because, according to USDA reports, in 2003, they  constitute 2.5 percent of food stamp recipients nationwide even though  they form a large share of the general population of such persons. We also  did not attempt to develop an estimate of the impact of the ban for elderly  and disabled drug offenders.", "For 2003, USDA reported that adult households with children (containing  either one or two adults) constitute 73 percent of food stamp recipients. In  contrast, elderly individuals living alone constitute 6 percent of food stamp  recipients, and disabled nonelderly individuals living alone constitute 5  percent of food stamp recipients. Single-adult households\u2014which  according to USDA do not contain children, elderly individuals, or  disabled individuals\u2014constitute 6 percent of food stamp recipients.  Therefore, adult households with children receive food stamps at a rate  greater than 12 times the rate at which single-adult households receive  food stamps. The percentage of single adult households receiving food  stamps is higher than the percentage of ABAWDs receiving food stamps  because an individual is not considered an ABAWD if the person is  pregnant, exempt from work registration, or over 50 years of age.", "For 12 of 15 states that maintain the full ban on food stamps, we obtained  data on the drug felons released from prison during 2001 (given that they  entered prison during 1997 or thereafter).

This  was our operational definition for a custodial parent. For these, we  estimated the percentage who had gross incomes within the poverty  thresholds, based on estimates of family size. Food stamp eligibility is  based on gross and net income tests. Because data on the deductions that  are used in determining whether households meet the net income tests  were not available, our estimates are at best gross income tests. We are  unable to determine how our use of the gross income test alone affects our  estimates of the percentage of drug felons released from prison that would  have been eligible to receive food stamps.", "In general, ABAWDs may receive food stamp benefits for an extended  duration as long as they meet ABAWD-specific work requirements. This  means that a large percentage of drug felons could be eligible to receive,  and therefore potentially be denied, food stamps as long as they fell within  the income threshold to receive food stamps. However, among all food  stamp recipients, ABAWDs constitute only 2.5 percent of the total.

The U.S. Census Bureau reported that the average lifetime  earnings, based upon 1997-1999 work experience, for those who have not  completed high school is approximately $1 million, for high school  graduates it is $1.2 million, and for those completing a bachelor\u2019s degree it  is $2.1 million. Again, the average lifetime earnings rise higher yet for  those who obtain advanced degrees. Hence, college graduates can expect,  on average, to earn nearly twice as much over a lifetime as those persons  who have only a high school diploma and more than twice as much as  those who have not completed high school.", "Similarly, a study published by the congressional Joint Economic  Committee in January 2000 concluded that there is a strong consensus  among economists that formal education has a positive impact not only on  personal income but also on society. The study concluded that among the  positive societal economic returns from increases in formal education are  the creation of new knowledge (translating into the development of new  processes and technologies) and the diffusion and transmission of  knowledge (translating into the expansion of innovative techniques such  as those found in the high-technology sector). Positive societal  noneconomic improvements are also associated with increased amounts  of formal education, which help Americans become better mothers,  fathers, children, voters, and citizens. These positive noneconomic  improvements are sometimes called positive neighborhood effects. Some  of the positive neighborhood effects may be (1) more informed and  interested voters, (2) decreases in crime, (3) decreased dependence upon  certain types of public assistance, and (4) decreased incidence of  illegitimate pregnancies.", "Although the census study and the study conducted by the Joint Economic  Committee show positive economic and societal impacts of increased  levels of education, the total net impacts of these benefits are difficult to  quantify. Moreover, these studies do not comment on whether the loss of  federal education assistance (as occurs for drug offenders through the  provisions of the HEA) contributes to individuals\u2019 not completing  postsecondary education, or whether those individuals who are denied  federal education assistance generate the necessary funding to attend  institutions of higher education in other ways.", "Also at issue is whether the provisions of the HEA that deny  postsecondary education benefits to drug offenders contribute positively  to society by providing a deterrent to drug use. Research on the costs to  society from drug use, and drug-associated criminal involvement,  demonstrated that these costs to society are high. Therefore, if the denial  of federal higher education benefits deters people from engaging in drug  crimes, then the provisions might have positive economic and  noneconomic impacts on society. Some of the positive affects of  deterrence may include reductions in drug-related health care costs,  reductions in drug-related crime and associated criminal justice costs, and  increased national economic productivity. In addition, for many offenders  and in particular for first-time drug offenders, the denial of postsecondary  education benefits may delay entry into postsecondary education rather  than prevent it."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limited Data on Racial Minorities and the Denial of Federal Postsecondary Education Benefits", "paragraphs": ["With the available data, we were unable to determine whether the  provisions of the Higher Education Act that provide for denial of  postsecondary education benefits would affect relatively larger or smaller  numbers of minorities.

This provision also  specifically applies to drug-related criminal activity by any member of the  tenant\u2019s household or any guest or other person under the tenant\u2019s control.  Similarly, federal law requires PHAs and owners of federally assisted  housing to establish standards or lease provisions that allow for the  termination of the tenancy or assistance for any household with a member  who the PHA or owner determines is illegally using a controlled  substance. Federal law further specifies that tenants evicted from  federally assisted housing by reason of drug-related criminal activity are to  be ineligible for federally assisted housing for a 3-year period, although  evicted tenants that successfully complete an approved rehabilitation  program may regain their eligibility before the 3-year period ends.", "Under federal law and implementing regulations, PHAs have the discretion  to evict tenants for drug-related criminal activity but are not required to  evict such tenants.

The purpose of these agreements is to provide these agencies with access  to information about persons currently denied the federal benefits  administered by them. For example, as described in this report, students  who are convicted of offenses involving the sale or possession of a  controlled substance are ineligible to receive certain federal  postsecondary education benefits. In order to ensure that student financial  assistance is not awarded to individuals subject to denial of benefits under  court orders issued pursuant to section 5301, DOJ and the Department of  Education implemented a computer matching program. The Department  of Education attempts to identify persons who have applied for federal  higher education assistance by matching records from applicants against  the BJA database list of persons who have been denied benefits. Officials  at the Department of Education report that the department has matched  only a few records of applicants for federal higher education assistance to  the DOJ list of persons denied federal benefits. The individuals whose  names appear on the DOJ list may differ from those individuals who self- certify to a drug offense conviction on their applications for federal  postsecondary education assistance. (See app. III for more information on  this.)", "The Administrative Office of United States Courts is responsible for  administrative matters for the federal courts. Shortly after the passage of  the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, AOUSC added the Denial of Federal  Benefits sentence enhancement to the Pre-Sentence Report Monograph,  which provided information to probation officers about the availability of  the DFB as sanction along with its requirements. AOUSC also developed a  standard form for federal judges to use in reporting the imposition of the  Denial of Federal Benefits sanctions; the form is part of the Judgment and  Commitment Order that is completed by the court upon sentencing.", "The United States Sentencing Commission promulgates federal sentencing  guidelines and collects data on all persons sentenced pursuant to the  federal sentencing guidelines. After the passage of the Anti-Drug Abuse  Act of 1988, the USSC prepared a guideline for this sanction and included  it in the Sentencing Guidelines Manual. Annually, USSC distributes the  Sentencing Guidelines Manual to federal court officials."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Use of the Denial of Federal Benefits Program Provisions", "paragraphs": ["Bureau of Justice Assistance data show that between 1990 and the second  quarter of 2004, 8,298 offenders were reported as having been denied  federal benefits by judges who imposed sanctions under the Denial of  Federal Benefits Program. About 38 percent (or 3,128) of these offenders  were denied benefits in state courts, and about 62 percent (or 5,170) were  denied benefits in federal courts. About an average 635 persons per year  were denied benefits under the program over the 1992 through 2003  period, and the number denied in any given year ranged from about 428 to  833. The number denied a benefit under the program decreased to 428 in  2002 and increased to 595 in 2003.", "According to BJA data, judges in comparatively few courts used the denial  of federal benefits provisions. State court judges in 7 states and federal  judges in judicial districts in 26 states were reported to have imposed the  sanction. Among state courts, judges in Texas accounted for 39 percent of  the state court totals, while judges in Oregon and Rhode Island accounted  for 30 percent and 13 percent, respectively. Among the federal courts,  judges in judicial districts in Texas accounted for 21 percent of the federal  totals, while judges in North Carolina, Mississippi, Georgia, Florida,  Nevada, and Kansas accounted for between 8 percent and 15 percent of  the totals. Federal judges in each of the remaining 19 states accounted for  less than 3 percent of the federal totals.", "Not all of the 8,298 offenders recorded as having been denied federal  benefits between 1990 and 2004 under the program are currently denied  benefits. For about 75 percent of these offenders, the period of denial has  expired. Officials at BJA report that as of April 2004, they maintained  about 2,000 active records of persons currently under a period of denial.", "Relative to the total number of felony drug convictions, the provisions of  the Denial of Federal Benefits (DFB) Program are reportedly used in a  relatively small percentage of drug cases. For example, biannually  between 1992 and 2000, there were a minimum of 274,000 and a maximum  of 348,000 convictions for drug offenses in state courts, or about 307,000  per year. In federal courts over this same period, there were between  15,000 and 24,000 drug offenders convicted, or about 19,000 per year. As  the average annual number of drug defendants in state courts denied  benefits under the DFB was 223, the rate of use of the DFB in state courts  averaged about 0.07 percent. Among federal drug defendants, the annual  average number reported as having received a sanction under the program  was about 369, while the average annual number of drug defendants  sentenced federally was about 19,000; hence, the percentage of all federal  drug defendants receiving a sanction under the program was about 2  percent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Assessing the Impacts of the Denial of Federal Benefits Program", "paragraphs": ["Throughout the history of the program, questions have been raised about  its apparently limited impacts. In 1992, we reported on the difficulties in  denying federal benefits to convicted drug offenders and suggested that  there would not be widespread withholding of federal benefits from drug  offenders. Officials at BJA also reported that the sanction has not been  widely used by judges. In 2001, BJA program managers met with some U.S.  attorneys in an attempt to provide them with information about the  potential benefits of the program. According to BJA officials, the U.S.  attorneys responded that they typically used other statutes for sanctioning  and sentencing drug offenders, rather than the sanctions under the Denial  of Federal Benefits Program.", "The benefits that can be denied under the program\u2014federal contracts,  grants, loans, and professional or commercial licenses\u2014suggest some  reasons as to its relatively infrequent use. Persons engaged in federal  contracting, for example, are generally engaged in business activities, and  such persons compose small percentages of federal defendants sentenced  for drug offenses. Hence, relatively few defendants may qualify to use  these federal benefits, and therefore relatively few may be denied the  benefits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reliable Data by Race of Persons Receiving the DFB Are Not Available", "paragraphs": ["None of the data sources that we reviewed provided reliable data on the  race and ethnicity of persons denied federal benefits under the Denial of  Federal Benefits Program."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, William J.
