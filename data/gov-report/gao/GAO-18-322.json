Since 2010, two types of agreements have been used: Corporate Integrity Agreements (CIA) and Integrity Agreements (IA). The more commonly used CIAs apply to larger entities, compared to IAs, which apply to individual practitioners or small businesses. From July 2005 through July 2017, about half of all agreements were with 3 types of entities\u2014individual or small group practices, hospitals, and skilled nursing facilities.", "For new agreements since July 2005, the most common initial allegations that led to an entity entering into an agreement included billing for services not provided and providing medically unnecessary services. When negotiating agreements, HHS-OIG uses one of six templates that address the different types of entities or conduct involved. Across agreements the provisions are generally similar\u2014for example, requirements to provide training on specified topics or to hire a compliance officer.", "HHS-OIG uses multiple strategies to oversee agreements, such as requiring periodic reports from the entities that demonstrate compliance and assigning a monitor to review these reports and conduct site visits. HHS-OIG can also take certain actions to address noncompliance. For example, for new agreements from July 2005 through July 2017, HHS-OIG imposed monetary penalties 41 times, ranging from $1,000 to more than $3 million (median of $18,000), and excluded 4 entities from participation in federal health care programs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["For federal health care programs like Medicare and Medicaid to function  effectively, the many providers and other entities who participate must  comply with federal health care program requirements.

This permissive exclusion authority applies to certain acts,  such as those prohibited by the False Claims Act, Anti-Kickback statute,  and Stark law, among others.", "As an alternative to exercising its authority to exclude an entity, HHS-OIG  often negotiates and enters into corporate integrity agreements (CIAs)  and integrity agreements (IAs) with health care providers and other  entities, such as pharmaceutical manufacturers. CIAs apply to larger  corporations, and IAs apply to individual practitioners, small physician  groups, or businesses with a small number of employees, a single  location, or a limited corporate structure. These agreements typically last  either three or five years, depending on the type of agreement, and  include provisions that focus on the entity\u2019s implementation of compliance  measures or the development of a compliance program. For example, the  agreements generally require entities to implement training programs or  to hire outside reviewers to audit claims billed to Medicare and other  federal health care programs. Such measures are intended to help  promote adherence to applicable laws and program requirements and  protect the integrity of federal health care programs.", "The Office of Counsel to the Inspector General within HHS-OIG is  responsible for negotiating the agreements.

On this basis, we  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our  reporting objectives.", "To examine the circumstances that may lead HHS-OIG to seek an  agreement with an entity, we analyzed HHS-OIG\u2019s data for all  agreements entered into from July 2005 through July 2017 regarding the  initial allegations in the investigations associated with the HHS-OIG  agreements during that time. To describe the standard provisions of  agreements, we reviewed the different agreement templates that HHS- OIG officials use to guide development of the agreements. In addition, we  reviewed 32 agreements that HHS-OIG had entered into from January  2010 through July 2017\u2014a 10 percent sample of all agreements during  this time. We selected agreements from January 2010 through July 2017,  because the purpose of our review was to identify current agreement  provisions, and prior to 2010 other agreement types were used that have  been phased out and are not currently used. We used this review to  identify examples of standard provisions and to gain a broad  understanding of how actual agreements compare to HHS-OIG\u2019s  templates. Although our sample was not generalizable, we used  agreement type (e.g., CIA or IA) and type of entity (e.g., hospital or  individual practitioner) as selection criteria to ensure that we selected  agreements that were representative of the proportion that each  agreement type and entity type represented of total agreements. We  analyzed HHS-OIG\u2019s data to understand the number and type of reviews,  such as reviews of Medicare claims, which have been required in  agreements from July 2005 through July 2017. We also interviewed HHS- OIG officials about the agency\u2019s exclusion authority, the agency\u2019s  negotiation of agreements, and the standard provisions included in  agreements.

Federal health care programs will not pay for any items or  services furnished, ordered, or prescribed by excluded entities.  Exclusions are mandatory under certain circumstances and permissive in  others. In particular, mandatory exclusion applies to offenses that result  in convictions relating to patient abuse or neglect and other crimes related  to federal health care programs.

According to HHS-OIG officials, heightened  scrutiny is reserved for situations in which the agency determined that  an agreement was warranted but the entity was uncooperative. In  such situations, HHS-OIG considers what other unilateral monitoring  steps it can take to impose greater scrutiny. For example, according  to HHS-OIG guidance, the agency has audited, evaluated, or  investigated entities after fraud settlements when the entity would not  enter into an agreement with HHS-OIG and it has made referrals to  the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for claims reviews.", "Reserve exclusion authority. For certain entities, HHS-OIG may  reserve its exclusion authority and take \u201cno further action,\u201d meaning  that HHS-OIG will not exclude the entity at that time and will not  require the entity to enter into an agreement.", "Release of exclusion authority. In certain circumstances, HHS-OIG  will release its exclusion authority without imposing additional  requirements.

The agreements were almost exclusively  CIAs, which apply to larger corporations, and IAs, which apply to  individual practitioners and entities such as small physician groups. HHS- OIG has used CIAs and IAs exclusively since 2010. From 2010 to July  2017, 74 percent of agreements have been CIAs and 26 percent of  agreements have been IAs. See figure 1 for more information on the  number and types of agreements since July 2005.", "HHS-OIG officials said that the agency transitioned away from other  agreement types because of certain limitations that made them less  useful than CIAs and IAs. For example, one historical agreement type\u2014 Certification of Compliance Agreements\u2014did not provide sufficient  opportunities for oversight, yet it required significant resources to create,  officials said. Another discontinued agreement type\u2014Settlement  Agreement with Integrity Provisions\u2014was negotiated as part of the DOJ  settlement, such that HHS-OIG needed to work through DOJ if there was  a need to take action for noncompliance. Although HHS-OIG and DOJ  negotiate their agreements and settlements separately now, the majority  of CIAs and IAs, are still associated with a DOJ legal settlement. Of the  652 agreements from July 2005 through July 2017, 619 were paired with  a DOJ settlement, while 33 were the result of HHS-OIG independently  exercising its exclusion authority.", "The total number of agreements in effect each year for the period we  reviewed, which includes new agreements and ongoing agreements from  past years, has decreased. Between 2006 and 2016 (the earliest and  latest full years included in HHS-OIG\u2019s database), the number of  agreements in effect for any part of the calendar year decreased by 44  percent (see fig. 2). According to HHS-OIG officials, this is because, over  time, the agency has increasingly focused its resources on entities that  present the highest risk of potential fraud. Specifically, HHS-OIG officials  said that in 2006 they first imposed a monetary threshold for damages  caused to federal health care programs, above which the agency would  pursue an agreement. HHS-OIG officials told us that they initially set this  threshold at $100,000, but that in 2014 the agency increased it to  $500,000 for smaller entities (i.e., those eligible for IAs) and $1 million for  larger entities (i.e., those eligible for CIAs). HHS-OIG officials added that  the monetary threshold is one factor that triggers pursuit of an agreement,  and that risk of beneficiary harm may also cause the agency to seek an  agreement, even when damages are low. HHS-OIG, in using these  criteria, said that it is foregoing pursuing agreements with low-damage,  lower-risk entities, instead taking no further action but reserving its  exclusion authority.", "HHS-OIG entered into agreements with a wide range of entities, but most  were concentrated among a few types of entities. Specifically, HHS-OIG  entered into agreements with 30 different types of entities from July 2005  through July 2017, though slightly more than half of the agreements were  with 3 types\u2014individual/small group practices, hospitals, and skilled  nursing facilities. Another quarter of the agreements were with medical  group practices, pharmaceutical manufacturers, clinics, medical device  manufacturers, and ambulance companies. (See fig. 3.)", "HHS-OIG officials stated that it is rare for the agency to enter into multiple  agreements with the same entity, adding that the few entities that have  had multiple agreements were generally large corporations with multiple  divisions or sites, and that the agreements applied to different areas of  the firms\u2019 business. Our analysis of HHS-OIG data showed that 15  entities had more than one agreement from July 2005 through July 2017.  In other situations, HHS-OIG extended an ongoing agreement, rather  than entering a new agreement with the same entity, in light of new  allegations that arose during the time the agreement was in effect. From  July 2005 through July 2017, the time periods for five agreements were  extended beyond the standard five years to reflect new settlements with  DOJ.", "Almost all of the agreements we reviewed were negotiated by HHS-OIG  at the same time DOJ was negotiating a legal settlement with the entity to  resolve related allegations under the False Claims Act. Many of these  allegations resulted from cases filed by a whistleblower under the False  Claims Act\u2019s qui tam provisions\u2014commonly referred to as qui tam  cases. Slightly more than half of HHS-OIG agreements are with entities  who settled qui tam cases. From July 2005 through July 2017,  agreements imposed by HHS-OIG as a result of claims alleged by a  whistleblower in a qui tam case increased in prevalence compared to  agreements that were not associated with a qui tam case. (See fig. 4.)", "The DOJ-negotiated settlement amounts associated with qui tam cases,  among those entities that also entered into an agreement with HHS-OIG,  greatly exceeded the settlement amounts negotiated for non-qui tam  cases and make up most of the total settlement amounts. From July 2005  through July 2017, total settlement amounts, among those entities that  also entered into an agreement with HHS-OIG, were $16.1 billion for qui  tam cases and $3.1 billion for all others.

The next largest shares of settlement amounts DOJ negotiated  were with hospitals at $2.5 billion and medical device manufacturers at  almost $900 million.

According to HHS-OIG officials and agency  guidance, each situation is evaluated on a risk continuum and the course  of action chosen is based on the agency\u2019s assessment of the future risk  the entity poses to federal health care programs. HHS-OIG has four  broad categories of criteria that it applies in deciding where an entity falls  on the risk continuum and which action to take. These four categories are  (1) the nature and circumstances of the conduct; (2) conduct during the  government\u2019s investigation; 3) whether the entity has made efforts to  improve its conduct; and 4) the entity\u2019s history of compliance. According  to HHS-OIG officials, the agency will exclude the highest-risk entities, and  since fiscal year 2011, under its permissive exclusion authority, HHS-OIG  has excluded 65 entities that were the subject of a related DOJ legal  settlement. However, HHS-OIG guidance states that HHS-OIG often  concludes that exclusion is not necessary, so long as the entity will enter  into an agreement with the agency.", "For new agreements from July 2005 through July 2017, our review of  HHS-OIG data showed that there were four main types of initial  allegations that resulted in the entity entering into an agreement with  HHS-OIG. This included: billing for services not rendered - 194 agreements (about 30 percent); provision of medically unnecessary services - 136 agreements (about acts prohibited under the Anti-Kickback statute - 135 agreements  (about 21 percent); and misrepresentation of services and/or products \u2013 131 agreements  (about 20 percent).", "The majority of agreements (about 63 percent) were associated with one  initial allegation. However, some agreements were associated with more  than one initial allegation: about 23 percent of agreements from July 2005  through July 2017 were associated with two initial allegations and about  15 percent were associated with three or more initial allegations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agreements Included Standard Provisions with Some Variation to Address Risks Specific to the Entities", "paragraphs": ["We compared the provisions required in selected agreements to those  outlined in HHS-OIG\u2019s current agreement templates and found that the  provisions were generally similar. All of HHS-OIG\u2019s templates and the  agreements we reviewed were organized into the same broad sections.  For example, all of the templates and agreements contained sections  detailing the information entities were required to submit to HHS-OIG in  an initial implementation report and in annual reports, and all agreements  had a section that outlined the enforcement provisions for the agreement.  In addition, there generally was a standard term for agreements of either  three or five years depending on the type of agreement. All 23 of the CIAs  we reviewed had a term of five years, and of the nine IAs we reviewed,  five had a 5-year term and four had a 3-year term. The IAs with a longer  5-year term generally were older agreements from 2010 or 2011.  According to HHS-OIG officials, the current practice is to negotiate 3-year  terms for IAs and 5-year terms for CIAs.", "HHS-OIG has developed agreement templates that include standard  provisions to address the risks an entity\u2019s noncompliance could pose to  federal health care programs. Additionally, in some templates, provisions  are included to address the specific types of conduct that gave rise to the  agreement. HHS-OIG has four templates for use in negotiating CIAs and  two for negotiating IAs, and HHS-OIG officials said that they will use one  of the six templates as a starting point when drafting an agreement.  HHS-OIG officials told us that the terms included in agreements are  similar across CIAs and IAs because certain provisions are non- negotiable. For example, officials said that they always include provisions  requiring an entity to hire a compliance officer, submit annual reports, and  provide HHS-OIG with access to the entity when requested. Across the  various types of templates, there are similar standard provisions, and our  review of selected agreements found many of the same provisions. For  example, among the 32 agreements we reviewed:", "All 32 agreements required the entity to engage an independent  review organization to perform the agreement\u2019s required reviews,  including claims reviews. Entities have retained a variety of individuals  and businesses as their independent review organization, ranging  from small regional consulting firms to large national consulting or  accounting firms. For agreements HHS-OIG has entered into from  July 2005 through July 2017, our review of the agency\u2019s data found  that there were 173 unique associated independent review  organizations.", "All 32 agreements had training and education requirements, although  the specifics of the required training, such as the number of hours or  the specific topics, varied across agreements.", "28 of the 32 agreements reviewed required the entity to have a  compliance officer. The four agreements that did not require this were  two IAs for small group practices, one for a medical group practice,  and one for a clinic that named an individual practitioner as a party to  the agreement.", "Although agreements shared many standard provisions, some provisions  were unique to either CIAs or IAs. Many of the CIAs that we reviewed  included provisions detailing specific responsibilities for the entity\u2019s board  of directors (18 of 23 CIAs) and requirements for certain high-level  employees to annually certify that they were in compliance with federal  health care program requirements and the provisions of the agreement  (12 of 23 CIAs). None of the nine IA\u2019s we reviewed included these  provisions. On the other hand, all nine IAs we reviewed (and one CIA)  had provisions regarding third-party billing. If the provider subject to the  agreement contracted with a third-party billing company to submit claims  on the provider\u2019s behalf, these agreements required the provider to certify  that they did not have an ownership or controlling interest in the third- party billing company.", "In addition to agreement type, provisions also varied due to the nature of  the conduct that led to the agreement or the type of entity entering into  the agreement. For example, some agreements included provisions  intended to ensure compliance with the Anti-Kickback statute and Stark  law (8 of 32). HHS-OIG officials told us that specific provisions related to  the Anti-Kickback statute and Stark law would only be present in  agreements when the conduct that had led to the agreement involved  acts prohibited under those statutes, such as prohibited kickbacks or  improper referral arrangements. Other agreements include provisions  specific to monitoring quality of care issues. For example, one of the  agreements we reviewed was a quality of care CIA that required the entity  to retain an independent monitor to examine, among other things, the  entity\u2019s internal quality control systems and its response to quality of care  issues. In addition, 2 of the 32 agreements we reviewed were with  pharmaceutical manufacturers and contained provisions not in other  agreements because they would only be relevant to a pharmaceutical  manufacturer. For example, both agreements we reviewed had a  requirement that the manufacturers, within 30 days, provide HHS-OIG  with a copy of any written communication with the Food and Drug  Administration that materially discussed the actual or potential unlawful or  improper promotion of the manufacturer\u2019s product.", "According to HHS-OIG data, most of the 652 agreements entered into  from July 2005 through July 2017 (about 95 percent) required the entity to  perform at least one review as part of the agreement. The most common  types of required reviews captured in HHS-OIG\u2019s database during this  time were reviews of health care claims, unallowable costs, and  arrangements. Slightly more than half of the agreements (19 of 32) we  reviewed required the entity to perform a claims review. Fifteen of these  were annual claims reviews and four were quarterly claims reviews. In  addition, slightly more than a quarter of agreements we reviewed (9 of 32)  required an unallowable costs review. Finally, a quarter of the  agreements (8 of 32) required the entity to perform an arrangements  review. The eight agreements requiring an arrangements review were the  same agreements that included a section with provisions related to  compliance with the Anti-Kickback statute and Stark law. A few  agreements had required reviews that were not common across the  agreements we reviewed and usually related to the types of services that  the entity provided.

Officials said that two  HHS-OIG officials typically conduct the site visit\u2014the agreement\u2019s  monitor and one other official\u2014and the site visits typically last about one  day to a day-and-a-half. For agreements entered into from July 2005  through July 2017, we found that HHS-OIG officials conducted 211 site  visits that were associated with 155 agreements. Thirty of these  agreements were associated with more than one site visit ranging from 2  to 10 visits. The majority of the 211 site visits were for CIAs (about 87  percent).

According to HHS-OIG officials, other types of noncompliance range from  falsely certifying the accuracy of reported information to submitting  reports that do not include the required elements. According to officials  and as outlined in agreements, HHS-OIG addresses noncompliance  through a series of escalating steps, which, in rare instances, may result  in the HHS-OIG imposing penalties on an entity as laid out in the  agreement (stipulated penalties) or even exclusion of an entity from  federal health care programs.

The stipulated penalties in agreements range  from $1,000 to $50,000 per violation. For example, for each day an  entity fails to submit a complete annual report to HHS-OIG by the  submission deadline, the stipulated penalty is $2,500 for CIAs and  $1,500 for IAs. In addition, for all agreements, each false certification  submitted by or on behalf of the entity results in a stipulated penalty of  $50,000.", "For agreements entered into from July 2005 through July 2017, our  review of HHS-OIG data found that HHS-OIG issued 41 letters  demanding stipulated penalties (between 0 and 7 letters per year) for  actions such as the failure to submit annual reports and employing  individuals excluded from participation in federal health care  programs. In total, HHS-OIG collected about $5.4 million in  stipulated penalties during this time. Penalty amounts demanded in  each letter ranged from $1,000 to over $3 million, with a median of  $18,000. According to HHS-OIG, the stipulated penalty of over $3  million was a record penalty for failure to comply with an agreement.  This penalty, according to HHS-OIG, resulted from the entity\u2019s failure  to correct improper billing processes and poor claims submission  practices that had led to error rates and overpayments to the  company by Medicare for hospice services. These issues were  uncovered through the claims reviews required under the agreement  and HHS-OIG\u2019s site visits to the company\u2019s facilities.", "Determining that the entity is in material breach of the agreement. As  defined in agreements, this determination may result from repeated or  flagrant violations of agreement obligations; failure to notify HHS-OIG  of certain reportable events; failure to take corrective actions or make  appropriate refunds; failure to respond to a stipulated penalties  demand letter; or failure to engage an independent review  organization. From July 2005 through July 2017, HHS-OIG issued 10  material breach letters to entities informing them that HHS-OIG  intended to exclude them. However, the 10 material breach letters  were associated with only 6 agreements, and 5 of the 10 material  breach letters issued were to the same entity. These five letters were  issued to the entity between March 2012 and January 2014 for a  series of alleged material breaches of its agreement including, among  other things, a failure to report serious quality of care reportable  events or to perform training required under the terms of its  agreement.

The four entities that were excluded included a durable  medical equipment provider, a national chain of clinics, a practice  management company, and a medical group practice. An agreement  affords the entity the opportunity to respond to a material breach letter  prior to the issuance of a notice of exclusion. However, an HHS-OIG  official said that, given the multiple steps involved in the breach and  default process, it is unlikely that a breach would be addressed  satisfactorily by the entity at this stage in the process.
