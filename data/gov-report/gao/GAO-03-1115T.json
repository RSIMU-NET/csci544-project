These programs enable direct communication between users, allowing users to access each other's files and share digital music, images, and video. GAO was requested to determine the ease of access to child pornography on peer-to-peer networks; the risk of inadvertent exposure of juvenile users of peer-to-peer networks to pornography, including child pornography; and the extent of federal law enforcement resources available for combating child pornography on peer-to-peer networks. Today's testimony is based on GAO's report on the results of that work (GAO- 03-351), Because child pornography cannot be accessed legally other than by law enforcement agencies, GAO worked with the Customs Cyber-Smuggling Center in performing searches: Customs downloaded and analyzed image files, and GAO performed analyses based on keywords and file names only."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Child pornography is easily found and downloaded from peer-to-peer networks. In one search, using 12 keywords known to be associated with child pornography on the Internet, GAO identified 1,286 titles and file names, determining that 543 (about 42 percent) were associated with child pornography images. Of the remaining, 34 percent were classified as adult pornography and 24 percent as non-pornographic. In another search using three keywords, a Customs analyst downloaded 341 images, of which 149 (about 44 percent) contained child pornography. These results are in accord with increased reports of child pornography on peer-to-peer networks; since it began tracking these in 2001, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children has seen a fourfold increase--from 156 in 2001 to 757 in 2002. Although the numbers are as yet small by comparison to those for other sources (26,759 reports of child pornography on Web sites in 2002), the increase is significant. Juvenile users of peer-to-peer networks are at significant risk of inadvertent exposure to pornography, including child pornography. Searches on innocuous keywords likely to be used by juveniles (such as names of cartoon characters or celebrities) produced a high proportion of pornographic images: in our searches, the retrieved images included adult pornography (34 percent), cartoon pornography (14 percent), child erotica (7 percent), and child pornography (1 percent). While federal law enforcement agencies--including the FBI, Justice's Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section, and Customs--are devoting resources to combating child exploitation and child pornography in general, these agencies do not track the resources dedicated to specific technologies used to access and download child pornography on the Internet. Therefore, GAO was unable to quantify the resources devoted to investigating cases on peer-to-peer networks.

However, this capability also makes it easy to access,  disseminate, and trade pornographic images and videos, including child  pornography.

The Free Speech  Coalition, ruling that the expansion of the act to material that did not  involve and thus harm actual children in its creation is an unconstitutional  violation of free speech rights. According to government officials, this  ruling may increase the difficulty of prosecuting those who produce and  possess child pornography. Defendants may claim that pornographic  images are of \u201cvirtual\u201d children, thus requiring the government to establish  that the children shown in these digital images are real.

Under the traditional  Internet client/server model, access to information and services is  accomplished by interaction between clients\u2014users who request  services\u2014and servers\u2014providers of services, usually Web sites or portals.  Unlike this traditional model, the peer-to-peer model enables consenting  users\u2014or peers\u2014to directly interact and share information with each  other, without the intervention of a server. A common characteristic of  peer-to-peer programs is that they build virtual networks with their own  mechanisms for routing message traffic.", "The ability of peer-to-peer networks to provide services and connect users  directly has resulted in a large number of powerful applications built  around this model. These range from the SETI@home network (where  users share the computing power of their computers to search for  extraterrestrial life) to the popular KaZaA file-sharing program (used to  share music and other files).", "As shown in figure 4, there are two main models of peer-to-peer networks:  (1) the centralized model, in which a central server or broker directs traffic  between individual registered users, and (2) the decentralized model,  based on the Gnutella network, in which individuals find each other and  interact directly.", "As shown in figure 4, in the centralized model, a central server/broker  maintains directories of shared files stored on the computers of registered  users. When Bob submits a request for a particular file, the server/broker  creates a list of files matching the search request by checking it against its  database of files belonging to users currently connected to the network.  The broker then displays that list to Bob, who can then select the desired  file from the list and open a direct link with Alice\u2019s computer, which  currently has the file. The download of the actual file takes place directly  from Alice to Bob.", "This broker model was used by Napster, the original peer-to-peer network,  facilitating mass sharing of material by combining the file names held by  thousands of users into a searchable directory that enabled users to  connect with each other and download MP3 encoded music files. Because  much of this material was copyrighted, Napster as the broker of these  exchanges was vulnerable to legal challenges, which eventually led to its  demise in September 2002.", "In contrast to Napster, most current-generation peer-to-peer networks are  decentralized. Because they do not depend on the server/broker that was  the central feature of the Napster service, these networks are less  vulnerable to litigation from copyright owners, as pointed out by Gartner.", "In the decentralized model, no brokers keep track of users and their files.  To share files using the decentralized model, Ted starts with a networked  computer equipped with a Gnutella file-sharing program such KaZaA or  BearShare. Ted connects to Carol, Carol to Bob, Bob to Alice, and so on.  Once Ted\u2019s computer has announced that it is \u201calive\u201d to the various  members of the peer network, it can search the contents of the shared  directories of the peer network members. The search request is sent to all  members of the network, starting with Carol; members will in turn send the  request to the computers to which they are connected, and so forth. If one  of the computers in the peer network (say, for example, Alice\u2019s) has a file  that matches the request, it transmits the file information (name, size, type,  etc.) back through all the computers in the pathway towards Ted, where a  list of files matching the search request appears on Ted\u2019s computer through  the file-sharing program. Ted can then open a connection with Alice and  download the file directly from Alice\u2019s computer.", "The file-sharing networks that result from the use of peer-to-peer  technology are both extensive and complex. Figure 5 shows a map or  topology of a Gnutella network whose connections were mapped by a  network visualization tool. The map, created in December 2000, shows  1,026 nodes (computers connected to more than one computer) and 3,752  edges (computers on the edge of the network connected to a single  computer). This map is a snapshot showing a network in existence at a  given moment; these networks change constantly as users join and depart  them.", "One of the key features of many peer-to-peer technologies is their use of a  virtual name space (VNS). A VNS dynamically associates user-created  names with the Internet address of whatever Internet-connected computer  users happen to be using when they log on. The VNS facilitates point-to- point interaction between individuals, because it removes the need for  users and their computers to know the addresses and locations of other  users; the VNS can, to certain extent, preserve users\u2019 anonymity and  provide information on whether a user is or is not connected to the Internet  at a given moment. Peer-to-peer users thus may appear to be anonymous;  they are not, however. Law enforcement agents may identify users\u2019 Internet  addresses during the file-sharing process and obtain, under a court order,  their identities from their Internet service providers.", "This is a work of the U.S. government and is not subject to copyright protection in the  United States.
