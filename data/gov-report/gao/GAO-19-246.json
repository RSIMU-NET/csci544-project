According to Secret Service officials, vetting may include using physical screening (measures to detect physical threats to the president and secure the property) and background checks intended to identify individuals who have prior criminal activity or present other types of threats. Individuals at Mar-a-Lago who are not expected to meet with the President or enter spaces the President may visit pass through an outer layer of security consisting of physical screening checkpoints surrounding the property. The Secret Service physically screens all individuals who will access areas where the President will be present, such as a dining room. According to Secret Service officials, individuals who have a meeting with the President generally undergo both physical screening and enhanced background checks.", "The Department of Defense (DOD) and the Secret Service coordinate to establish and secure several areas that are suitable for handling classified information when the President travels to Mar-a-Lago. These areas include a conference center, spaces used by staff of the National Security Council and the Executive Office of the President, and presidential transportation vehicles.

Both organizations have processes to review these travel-related expenses when their personnel travel with the President and try to acquire lodging at the General Services Administration's per diem lodging rate. When the Secret Service is not able to acquire rooms at the per diem lodging rate, including when it needs rooms for operational purposes that exceed 300 percent of the per diem rate (a threshold set by the General Services Administration), employees must submit a waiver request. DOD personnel must also obtain approval when costs exceed the General Services Administration's lodging rate. Our review of DOD vouchers and Secret Service documentation confirmed that personnel did not exceed the 300 percent threshold for lodging during the Mar-a-Lago trips examined in this review. We assessed the costs of Presidential travel in a separate report."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The President has made numerous trips to the Mar-a-Lago property in  Palm Beach, Florida. The President has hosted a foreign head of state  and head of government and conducted other presidential  responsibilities, including addressing matters of national concern, while at  Mar-a-Lago, which may render the property a location of potential interest  to foreign actors. Because members of the public are able to mingle with  the President when he is at Mar-a-Lago, members of Congress and  others have raised questions about the protection of classified information  at the property. Questions have also been raised with regard to potential  conflicts of interest that could arise as a result of foreign government  patronage at The Trump Organization\u2019s properties.", "You asked us to review issues pertaining to the establishment of secure  areas where classified information can be handled by the President when  he travels to Mar-a-Lago. You also asked us to identify payments made to  the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) that result from foreign  government patronage at The Trump Organization properties. This  report provides information on (1) processes taken to vet individuals who  will be in close proximity to the President when he visits Mar-a-Lago; (2)  processes to provide the President with secure areas for handling  classified and other sensitive information while at Mar-a-Lago; (3)  regulations and processes governing agency expenditures on employee  per diem expenses for travel and operational space for personnel who  travel with the President; and (4) the Treasury\u2019s processes for receiving  payments from The Trump Organization or the President and payments  that the Treasury has received through these processes. This is a public  version of a sensitive GAO report that we issued in October 2018. DOD  and the Secret Service deemed some of the information in our October  report as sensitive, which must be protected from public disclosure.", "Therefore, this report omits sensitive information on vetting individuals  and providing secure areas for handling classified information. Although  the information provided in this report is more limited, the report  addresses the same objectives as the sensitive report and uses the same  methodology.", "To address our first objective, we analyzed guidance and documents  related to protective operations from the U.S. Secret Service (Secret  Service) and reviewed agreements between federal agencies to identify  the measures that agencies are expected to take to vet individuals during  the President\u2019s domestic trips. We interviewed officials from the Secret  Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to ascertain how they  partner to vet individuals during the President\u2019s trips. We reviewed final  survey reports that summarize security measures and actions taken by  the Secret Service during the President\u2019s four trips to Mar-a-Lago  between February 3, 2017 and March 5, 2017 and other documentation.  A GAO engagement assessing Presidential travel costs selected the first  four trips to Mar-a-Lago after the President\u2019s inauguration, because those  trips were completed shortly before the date of the Congressional request  letter. To stay consistent with concurrent work on Presidential travel  costs, the same time frame was selected. We interviewed officials from  the Secret Service who were tasked with protecting the President to  determine how agreements, policies, and procedures are used to vet  individuals when the President is at Mar-a-Lago.", "To address our second objective, we reviewed security-related guidance  from the Secret Service and the Department of Defense (DOD) to  determine the roles that these organizations have in establishing secure  areas that may be used to handle classified information when the  President travels. We also reviewed Office of the Director of National  Intelligence policies and procedures that are to be used when  establishing temporary secure areas, such as those used at Mar-a-Lago,  for handling classified information. We also reviewed the details of  specific security practices for the site with agency officials. We relied on  DOD and Secret Service documentation and descriptions of these  practices. We discussed with DOD officials after-action reports they  prepare to identify vulnerabilities related to information security and steps  that have been taken to address these vulnerabilities. We requested from  DOD the after-action reports examining areas that may have been used  by its personnel, the National Security Council, and the Executive Office  of the President during the President\u2019s trips. DOD officials provided us  with a March 2017 after-action report for the President\u2019s March 3-5, 2017  visit to Mar-a-Lago. We reviewed the report to understand the types of  information included and assessed by DOD. DOD officials stated that  similar reports were developed after each of the President\u2019s February  2017 trips to Mar-a-Lago. In addition, we discussed and reviewed with  Secret Service officials specific security practices at Mar-a-Lago related  to protection of the property, the presidential suite, the dining room, and  public areas, among others. We further reviewed the Secret Service\u2019s  after-action reports for each of the four trips to Mar-a-Lago within our  scope. Each report included specific information on what had occurred  during the trip and identified what security personnel did in securing each  segment of the site. Secret Service personnel made themselves available  to answer our questions regarding the report.", "To address our third objective, we reviewed laws, regulations, and  policies to identify the rules and processes governing agency  expenditures on operational spaces and per diem for employees who  accompany the President when he is traveling domestically. We reviewed  documentation about DOD\u2019s and the Secret Service\u2019s travel processes,  such as policies and agency guidance. In addition, we reviewed the  vouchers from the presidential trips to Mar-a-Lago that were completed  between February 3, 2017 and March 5, 2017. We also interviewed  knowledgeable officials from DOD and the Secret Service. We reviewed  relevant policies and spoke with agency officials regarding policies and  processes that are in place for when individuals on travel need to exceed  the General Services Administration per diem rate. We also reviewed  Secret Service documentation regarding waiver requests submitted when  individuals traveling with the President exceeded the General Service\u2019s  Administration per diem rate. In addition to this work, we assessed the  costs of Presidential travel, which we published in a second report in  January 2019.", "To address our fourth objective, we reviewed Treasury\u2019s website and  interviewed Treasury officials to identify processes for receiving gifts to  the federal government and gifts to reduce the public debt. To identify  payments received by Treasury from the President or The Trump  Organization that were made through the Treasury\u2019s donation processes,  we reviewed Treasury accounts and interviewed officials to determine if  any payments had been received from January 2017 through August  2018. We also reviewed The Trump Organization\u2019s written policy, which  provides its definition of foreign government patronage, explains how it  will calculate profits from foreign government patronage, and specifies  when The Trump Organization intends to make payments to the Treasury  under this policy. Finally, we interviewed attorneys representing The  Trump Organization.", "Additionally, we contacted the White House Counsel\u2019s Office in May 2017  and January 2018 to solicit the perspective of the Executive Office of the  President, including the National Security Council, on efforts to establish  secure areas and vet individuals at Mar-a-Lago and manage costs  associated with personnel traveling with the President, and on any  payments The Trump Organization has made to the U.S. Treasury of  profits realized from foreign government patronage of The Trump  Organization\u2019s properties.

According to Secret Service officials, individuals  who need access to secure areas but who are not expected to interact  directly with the President, such as wait staff and other workers, are to  undergo a background check in addition to physical screening.  Individuals who are expected to meet the President are to undergo a  background check and an enhanced background check. Officials from  the Secret Service said that they are responsible for collecting the  findings from these checks and making recommendations to the  Executive Office of the President on whether individuals with  derogatory findings should be allowed to access a space.

The Secret Service\u2019s guidance notes that submission of  the requested information to run a background check is based on  individuals voluntarily providing the needed information. In order to  conduct an enhanced background check, the Secret Service collaborates  with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other federal agency  partners.
