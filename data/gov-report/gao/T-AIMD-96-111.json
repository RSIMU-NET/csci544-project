In addition, the January 1996 report package that Interior provided to each tribe on the reconciliation results did not explain or describe the numerous changes in reconciliation scope and methodologies or the procedures that had been planned but were not performed. Therefore, the limitations of the reconciliation were not evident. Also, due to cost considerations and the potential for missing records, individual Indian trust fund accounts were not included in the reconciliation project.", "Tribes have expressed concerns about the scope and results of the reconciliation process. As stated in the Secretary\u2019s May 31, 1996, report to the House Committee on Resources on Indian trust fund reconciliation results, by April 30, 1996, only 2 tribes had accepted their account reconciliation results, 3 tribes had disputed their results, and the remaining 275 tribes had not decided whether to accept or dispute their account balances. If Interior is unable to resolve tribes\u2019 concerns, a legislated settlement process could be used to resolve disputes about tribal account balances. Our September 1995 report contained draft legislation outlining a settlement process, which we prepared in response to a request from the House Committee on Resources and the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs to initiate discussions on options for resolving disputed balances.", "While Interior has initiated several management improvement actions over the past 3 years to correct the long-standing problems that gave rise to the concerns over the accuracy of tribal trust fund accounts, the improvements will take several years to complete. Additionally, the current trust fund management and accounting systems and controls remain inadequate to ensure accurate trust fund accounting and asset management. Unless Interior corrects its long-standing trust fund management, accounting, and control weaknesses, it may be faced with additional costly reconciliations and settlements in the future.", "The appointment of the Special Trustee for American Indians was an important step in establishing high-level leadership at Interior for Indian trust fund management. The Office of the Special Trustee was implemented in February 1996. The Special Trustee has recently developed a concept paper which outlines needed trust fund management improvements. This concept paper will need to be expanded to include various options and alternatives and their associated costs and benefits and ultimately developed into a comprehensive strategic plan.", "Ultimately, solving Interior\u2019s trust fund management problems will require comprehensive planning, management commitment across all Indian trust program offices, and additional resources."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Several Interior agencies are responsible for carrying out the Secretary\u2019s Indian trust responsibilities.

Our April 1994 testimonyreiterated this recommendation and further recommended that BIA initiate efforts to develop complete and consistent written trust fund management policies and procedures and place a priority on their issuance. BIA has not yet developed a comprehensive set of policies and procedures for trust fund management. However, OTFM developed two volumes of trust fund IIM accounting procedures for use by BIA\u2019s Area and Agency Office trust fund accountants and provided them to BIA\u2019s Area and Agency Offices during 1995.", "Also, during 1995, OTFM developed two records management manuals, which address file improvements and records disposition. Missing records were the primary reason that many trust fund accounts could not be reconciled during BIA\u2019s recent reconciliation effort. In addition, OTFM is developing a records management implementation plan, including an automated records inventory system. In January 1992 and again in January 1994, we reported that BIA\u2019s trust fund loss policy did not address the need for systems and procedures to prevent and detect losses, nor did it instruct BIA staff on how to resolve losses if they occurred. The policy did not address what constitutes sufficient documentation to establish the existence of a loss, and its definition of loss did not include interest that was earned but not credited to the appropriate account. Our January 1994 report suggested a number of improvements, such as articulating steps to detect, prevent, and resolve losses. OTFM addressed our suggestions and issued a revised trust fund loss policy in 1995.", "However, while OTFM has made progress in developing policies and procedures, OTFM officials told us that BIA\u2019s Area and Agency Office trust accountants have not consistently implemented these policies and procedures.", "In addition to developing selected policies and procedures, OTFM officials told us that they began performing monthly reconciliations of the trust fund general ledger to Treasury records in fiscal year 1993 and that they work with BIA Area and Agency Offices to ensure that unreconciled amounts are properly resolved.

For example, OTFM obtained Office of the Comptroller of the Currency assistance to develop core general ledger and investment accounting system operating procedures; initiated direct deposit of collections to BIA Treasury accounts through the Automated Clearing House; initiated automated payment processing, including electronic certification, to facilitate direct deposit of receipts to tribal accounts; conducted a user survey and developed a systems user guide; established a help desk to assist system users by providing information on the new system, including a remote communication package for tribal dial-in capability; and provided system access to Area and Agency Offices and tribal personnel.", "While the new system has eliminated the need for manual reconciliations between the general ledger and investment system and facilitates reporting and account statement preparation, tribes and Indian groups have told us that the new account statements do not provide sufficient detail for them to understand their account activity. For example, they said that because principal and interest are combined in the account statements, it is difficult to determine interest earnings. They told us that the account statements also lack information on investment yields, duration to maturity, and adequate benchmarking. For tribes that have authority to spend interest earnings, but not principal amounts, this lack of detail presents accountability problems.

While current OTR backlogs are somewhat less than in 1994, BIA\u2019s Land Records Officer estimates that over 104 staff years of effort would be needed to eliminate the current backlog.

For example, BIA\u2019s IRMS subsidiary and IIM system may contain unverified and potentially incorrect information on land and lease ownership that some BIA offices may be using to distribute trust fund receipts to account holders. According to a BIA official, some of BIA\u2019s Agency Office staff update IRMS ownership files based on unverified information they have developed because LRIS information is significantly out-of-date. Our September 1994 report stated that without administrative review and final determination and certification of ownerships, there is no assurance that the ownership information in BIA\u2019s accounting system is accurate. Our report also stated that eliminating redundant systems would help to ensure that only official, certified data are used to distribute trust fund revenue to account holders.", "Although Interior formed a study team to develop an IIM subsidiary system plan, the team\u2019s August 1995 report did not include a detailed systems plan. Further, BIA and OTFM have not yet performed an adequate user needs assessment; explored the costs and benefits of systems options and alternatives; or developed a systems architecture as a framework for integrating trust fund accounting, land and lease ownership, and other trust fund and asset management systems.", "However, even if OTR resolves its ownership determination and recordkeeping backlogs and OTFM acquires reliable IIM and subsidiary accounting systems, IIM accounting will continue to be problematic due to fractionated ownerships. Under current practices, fractionated ownerships, which result from inheritances, will continue to complicate ownership determinations, accounting, and reconciliation efforts because of the increasing number of ownership determinations and trust fund accounts that will be needed.", "Our April 1994 testimony stated that BIA lacked an accounts receivable system. Interior officials told us that developing an accounts receivable system would be problematic because BIA does not have a master lease file as a basis for determining its accounts receivable. As a result, BIA does not know the total number of leases that it is responsible for managing or whether it is collecting revenues from all active leases. BIA has not yet begun to plan for or develop a master lease file.", "In addition, BIA and OTFM have not developed a comprehensive set of trust fund management policies and procedures.

We have criticized Interior\u2019s past planning efforts as piecemeal corrective action plans which fell short of identifying the departmentwide improvements needed to ensure sound trust fund management. Our June 1992 and September 1994 reports and our April 1994 testimony recommended that Interior\u2019s strategic plan address needed improvements across Interior agencies, including BIA, BLM, and MMS. We endorsed the American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act of 1994, which established a Special Trustee for American Indians reporting directly to the Secretary of the Interior. The act made the Special Trustee responsible for overseeing Indian trust fund management across these Interior agencies and required the Special Trustee to develop a comprehensive strategic plan for trust fund management.", "The Senate confirmed the appointment of the Special Trustee for American Indians in September 1995. In February 1996, the Special Trustee reported that the $447,000 provided for his office for fiscal year 1996 is insufficient to finance the development of a comprehensive strategic plan for trust fund financial management. Despite the funding limitations, using contractor assistance, the Special Trustee has prepared an initial assessment and strategic planning concept paper. However, the concept paper focuses on one potential system solution for addressing critical OTFM and BIA financial management information requirements and does not address other alternatives. It also does not address programs across Interior agencies or all needed improvements. In addition, the concept paper does not explain the rationale for many of the assumptions that support the detail for the $147 million estimate to implement the specified improvements.", "In contrast to the concept paper, a comprehensive strategic plan would reflect the requirements of the Department, BIA, BLM, MMS, OTFM, and other Interior agency Indian trust programs. It would also address the relationships of the strategic plans for each of these entities, including information resource management, policies and procedures, and automated systems.", "In addition, a comprehensive strategic plan would address various trust fund related systems options and alternatives and their associated costs and benefits. For example, the concept paper proposes acquiring new trust fund general ledger and subsidiary accounting systems but, unlike a strategic plan, it does not analyze the costs, benefits, advantages, and disadvantages of enhancing OTFM\u2019s current core general ledger and investment system or contracting for services instead of acquiring new systems.", "Further, since 1993, OTR has been planning for LRIS upgrades, including automated chain-of-title, which would facilitate ownership determinations and recordkeeping. Because it is planned that LRIS will provide a BIA link to Interior\u2019s core Automated Land Records Management System (ALMRS), a comprehensive strategic plan would need to consider the merits of LRIS in determining how trust ownership and accounting information needs can best be addressed. ALMRS is being developed by BLM at an estimated cost of $450 million. Because ALMRS and LRIS were costly to develop and they contain interrelated data, a comprehensive strategic plan would also need to consider the advantages and disadvantages of linking LRIS to the trust fund accounting system, as compared with acquiring a new land records and ownership system, in determining the best way to manage Indian trust funds and assets.", "The Special Trustee and OTFM Director told us that they currently lack the resources to adequately plan for and acquire needed trust fund system improvements. However, without accurate, up-to-date ownership and subsidiary accounting information, trust fund account statements will continue to be unreliable.", "The Special Trustee told us that due to limited resources and the need for timely solutions, he is considering ways to use changes in policies and procedures to deal with some trust fund management problems. Many of the problems identified in his concept paper are not strictly systems problems, and they do not necessarily require systems solutions.", "We agree that certain changes should be considered that would not require systems solutions. For example, centralizing management functions could help resolve the problems of inconsistent ownership determinations and inconsistent accounting practices. The centralization of some functions, such as handling trust fund collections through lock box payments to banks, could also result in management efficiencies. Similarly, ownership determination and recordkeeping backlogs might be better addressed by centralizing the five Land Title and Records Offices and using contractor assistance or temporary employees until system improvements are in place.
