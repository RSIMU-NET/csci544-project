Timeliness improved for taxpayers making one offer to 5.8 months in 2005 but stayed constant, at an average of two years, for those making repeat offers. Quality goals have been met but IRS does not routinely track compliance and accessibility. Further, cost per offer has increased in that IRS has not decreased staffing since fiscal year 2003 in proportion to declines in offers. Improving the program depends on how well IRS management understands the reasons for the program's performance. One step in understanding performance is measuring it. However, IRS does not measure timeliness from the perspective of the taxpayer--for taxpayers with repeat offers IRS measures the time to decide each offer but not the overall time to resolve the taxpayer's liability. IRS lacks compliance and accessibility trend data useful for assessing performance. Another step in understanding performance is setting goals. IRS set numeric goals for timeliness and quality, but IRS's timeliness goals do not have a rationale and are not based on taxpayer needs or other benefits. A third step in understanding performance is analysis. While IRS has done some analyses that led to program changes, IRS has not analyzed the effect of repeat offers on timeliness to determine whether it would be less costly to deal once with a taxpayer rather than have to process repeat offers. IRS also has not analyzed whether the decrease in offers accepted since fiscal year 2003 reflects a decrease in program accessibility, or whether the efforts to improve the compliance of program participants have been successful. IRS's regulations for exceptional circumstance offers, intended for taxpayers who can fully pay, are consistent with statute. However, most exceptional circumstance offers are granted to taxpayers who cannot fully pay. These offers are not meaningfully distinct from the more common offers based on inability to fully pay. The lack of distinction causes unnecessary program complexity and confusion. Taxpayers are faced with the paradoxical process of proving that they can pay their tax liability and then explaining why they cannot."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2005, the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s (IRS) Offer in  Compromise (OIC) Program reached agreements with taxpayers to accept  over 14,000 offers. An OIC is an agreement in which IRS and a taxpayer  agree to settle or compromise the taxpayers\u2019 federal tax liability for less  than the full amount owed. Generally, IRS accepts offers in cases in which  taxpayers cannot afford to pay their full tax liability. In 2005, the OIC  Program accepted offers in which taxpayers paid on average 16 percent of  their tax liability. IRS wrote off the rest of the liability, about $1 billion, for  those taxpayers.", "For years, Congress has been concerned about the performance of the OIC  Program. In 2002, we issued a report that you requested on the inventory of  OIC cases and the quality and timeliness of decisions. Since that time,  concerns about performance, including the timeliness of offer processing,  the quality of offer decisions, and the accessibility of the program to  taxpayers, have persisted. Other concerns include whether offer mills (tax  practitioners that consistently use negligent or deceptive practices to  exploit taxpayers and the OIC Program by making misleading claims and  submitting unrealistic offers) have been affecting program performance,  whether taxpayers have been accorded their appeal rights granted in  statute, and whether IRS has been using its authority to grant offers for  exceptional circumstances as Congress intended. Offers are most  commonly accepted when taxpayers cannot pay the full amounts they owe.  These offers are called doubt as to collectibility (DATC) offers. According  to IRS regulations, offers for exceptional circumstances, called effective  tax administration (ETA) offers, are granted in cases where taxpayers can  fully pay their tax liabilities but where collecting the full amount would  create economic hardship or where compelling public policy or equity  reasons provide sufficient basis for compromise. Because of these  concerns about the program, IRS instituted a number of initiatives intended  to reduce unrealistic offers from taxpayers and improve program  performance, including centralized processing of less complex cases, a  revised application form, an offer application fee of $150, and increased  emphasis on taxpayer communication.", "Because of your continuing interest in ensuring that IRS is administering  the OIC Program as efficiently and effectively as possible, you requested  this review. As agreed, the objectives of our review were to (1) describe the  trends in OIC program size; (2) describe the trends in program  performance and assess the extent to which IRS has researched the  reasons for the trends; (3) assess whether offer mills affect taxpayers and  OIC processing; (4) assess how well IRS ensures that taxpayers are  provided the right to appeal a rejected offer; and (5) determine whether  Treasury\u2019s ETA regulations are consistent with the provision of the IRS  Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 (Restructuring Act). Near the end of  our review, your staff asked that we comment on a legislative proposal that  would require OIC applicants requesting an offer in compromise to make a  partial payment.", "To address these objectives, we reviewed the Internal Revenue Manual  (IRM) and an IRS policy statement to determine the OIC Program\u2019s  objectives; obtained a copy of IRS\u2019s Automated Offer in Compromise  (AOIC) database, the primary management information system for the  program; and used that database to develop trend data on the program. We  performed various data reliability analyses and determined that the AOIC  database was sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our work.

The purpose of the OIC  Program is to (1) collect what can be fairly and reasonably collected from  taxpayers who cannot fully pay their delinquent tax liability, (2) collect the  tax in a timely and cost-effective manner, and (3) provide taxpayers with a  fresh start toward complying with all future tax filing and payment  requirements. Generally, IRS views the OIC Program as a last resort after  taxpayers have explored all other available voluntary payment options,  such as installment agreements. IRS resolves less than 1 percent of all  balance due accounts through the OIC Program.", "In recent years, the OIC Program underwent numerous program changes  intended to reduce the number of inappropriate offers submitted by  taxpayers and improve its operations. The changes include the following.  In 2001, IRS established the centralized OIC (COIC) processing centers in  Brookhaven, New York, and Memphis, Tennessee, to reduce inventory and  processing times and reduce costs. Process examiners, lower-grade staff at  the COICs, perform the initial processing of new offer applications, which  includes determining whether taxpayers\u2019 applications meet IRS\u2019s  processability criteria. Offer examiners, higher-grade staff at these COICs,  process less complex offers to completion by reviewing taxpayers\u2019  financial information and making decisions about whether to accept the  offers. COICs primarily examine offers involving wage and investment  income. Based on a pilot test, IRS plans to have COIC staff work some  offers from taxpayers with self-employment income starting in the summer  of 2006. More complex offers are sent to IRS field offices around the  country where offer specialists, who are higher graded than offer  examiners, work the offers to completion. These offers take longer to  investigate and may require face-to-face meetings with the taxpayers. In  2003, IRS implemented an offer application fee requirement. Taxpayers  submitting offer applications must include a $150 fee unless they qualify for  a fee waiver. In 2004, IRS revised the OIC application form to make it more  user-friendly to taxpayers. In that same year, IRS management put more  emphasis on communicating with taxpayers while processing offers. In  addition to these program changes, the Restructuring Act also mandated a  new basis for accepting offers ETA.", "Three Types of Compromise According to IRS regulations and guidance, compromises can be granted  for one of the following three reasons:  Doubt as to liability (DATL)\u2014Doubt exists that the assessed tax liability  is correct.", "DATC\u2014Doubt exists that the taxpayer could ever pay the full amount of  tax owed.", "Effective Tax Administration (ETA)\u2014No doubt exists that the taxpayer  can fully pay the taxes owed, but exceptional circumstances  nonetheless lead IRS to compromise.", "IRS has two categories of ETA offers, hardship and non-hardship.  According to IRS\u2019s regulations, hardship ETA offers are those that IRS  grants because collecting the full liability would create economic hardship  for the taxpayer, while non-hardship ETA offers are granted on a basis of  equity and public policy. (How economic hardship qualifies a taxpayer for  an ETA offer will be addressed later in the report.) According to IRS, equity  and public policy considerations may be used to accept an offer when  doing so would not adversely affect voluntary compliance for taxpayers in  general.", "While an offer is being reviewed, the statute of limitations for collection  and collection actions are suspended. The statute of limitations for  collection generally restricts the time IRS has to collect delinquent taxes to  10 years from the date of assessment. The statute of limitations for  collection and collection actions continues to be suspended if IRS rejects  an offer through the 30-day period that a taxpayer has to make a decision  on whether to appeal the rejection decision.

The offer must be supported by a  current statement of the taxpayer\u2019s financial condition, including data on  assets, liabilities, and monthly income and expenses.", "IRS typically receives and begins the processing of offers in one of two  COICs. The first step is screening out offers based on DATL. DATL offers  involving trust fund recovery penalties and personal liability for excise  taxes are processed by the OIC Program and all others are referred to IRS  examination staff. IRS then screens the remaining offers for processability,  using five criteria:  1. current version of OIC application form used, 2. $150 application fee included,3. all required federal tax returns filed, 4. employment taxes current, and 5. taxpayer not in bankruptcy proceeding.", "Generally, if any of the five requirements are not met, the application is  returned to the taxpayer as \u201cnot processable.\u201d According to IRS officials,  since fiscal year 2003, the requirement to use the current application form  has not been enforced although it remains part of IRS\u2019s processability  criteria. Program officials said that they do not want to return offer  applications to taxpayers solely because the most current form was not  used.", "Next, IRS screens out taxpayers who, based on their self-reported financial  data, can fully pay their tax debts. The financial data include income,  assets, and living expenses. If, after subtracting the taxpayers self-reported  living expenses from their income and assets, IRS determines taxpayers  can fully pay their tax debt and no exceptional circumstances exist, the  offers are rejected without further processing.", "IRS then sorts offers by complexity. Complex offers, such as those that are  business related or those from individual taxpayers required to file  Schedule C (Profit or Loss from Business), are generally sent to field  offices. The less complex offers remain in COIC for processing. Next, IRS  reviews each offer to determine whether the taxpayer provided enough  financial information for a decision to be made about whether to accept the  offer. If not, IRS requests more information from the taxpayer. If the  taxpayer does not provide the information, the offer is returned and the  offer is closed. A returned offer has not been rejected.", "When IRS has sufficient financial information to make a decision, it first  determines whether an offer can be accepted on the basis of DATC. If not,  IRS considers the offer under ETA rules. At any point during the process,  taxpayers may withdraw their applications.", "The step of rejecting an offer includes an administrative review. When OIC  staff propose rejecting an offer, IRS is required by the Restructuring Act to  conduct an independent administrative review. If the offer is rejected, the  taxpayer has the right to appeal the decision. Offers that are returned,  withdrawn, or deemed unprocessable do not have appeals rights.

Furthermore, IRS has not analyzed the effect of the  number and growth of repeat offers on timeliness. An analysis of the extent  timeliness could be improved, if at all, by reducing repeat offers could help  program managers make decisions about whether program changes to  improve timeliness would be justified. For example, it might be less costly  for IRS to deal once with a taxpayer, even if it takes more time to work the  single case, rather than have to process repeat offers.", "Another issue is that IRS does not have a rationale for its numeric goals for  processing times. In 2002, after we recommended that IRS set a timeliness  goal for the offer program based on taxpayer needs, other benefits such as  compliance, and program cost, IRS retained its old goal of 6 months for  COIC offers and established a separate goal of 9 months for field offers.  However, the two current goals still are not based on a documented  analysis of taxpayer needs, other benefits, and program costs.", "Without measuring timeliness from the perspective of the taxpayer and  without a rationale for timeliness goals set for taxpayers, IRS may be  missing an opportunity to effectively drive program improvements from a  taxpayer\u2019s perspective. As we discussed in other reports, industry guidance  for customer service recommended setting goals based on how long  customers were willing to wait for the service, the value of the service to  the organization, and the costs of providing the service.

In terms of feasibility, the officials  said because it does not know whether or when a taxpayer whose offer is  not accepted would submit another offer, it would be difficult to develop a  timeliness goal from the perspective of taxpayers. While it may be difficult  to predict individual taxpayers\u2019 behavior, IRS has historical data that may  be helpful for establishing timeliness goals from the perspective of  taxpayers. For example, average timeliness for taxpayers from previous  years might be a benchmark useful for setting goals for future average  timeliness. In terms of desirability, IRS officials said a measure of  timeliness from the perspective of taxpayers might be interpreted by some  as an indication that offer policies might be compromised in order to meet  the goal.

The study found that follow-up collection  actions had not been completed in many cases, even though the taxpayers  had submitted offer applications stating a willingness and ability to pay  part of their delinquent tax debt and even though IRS had concluded for  rejected offers that the taxpayers could pay more than the amount they  offered. For example, 42 percent of rejected offers during the study period,  calendar years 1998 to September, 8, 2003, were pending collection action,  and 15.7 percent had been declared currently not collectible (see table 7).", "IRS created a new unit called the Hand-Off Unit partly because the 2004  study concluded that rejected offers languished without further collection  action. The Hand-Off Unit takes the rejected or withdrawn cases and  initiates appropriate collection procedures with taxpayers using the  financial information gained during the OIC process. Like MOIC, the Hand- Off Unit currently does not analyze compliance trends on a routine basis,  although officials told us that IRS would eventually have that capability but  has not set a date. To properly assess IRS performance on achieving its  compliance objective, IRS also would need to collect and assess such trend  information on a periodic basis.", "The 2004 study represents a useful assessment of OIC\u2019s compliance  benefits for one time and uses an appropriate measurement unit\u2014the  taxpayer. However, it is no longer useful for ongoing management  decisions because the data in the study are now about 3 to 11 years old. The  study period predated many of IRS\u2019s recent program changes, which might  affect the program\u2019s performance with respect to compliance. For example,  the new Hand-Off Unit, which was started after the 2004 report, may help  achieve greater compliance of taxpayers with rejected or withdrawn offers,  but IRS will not know whether it works if it does not track overall  compliance trends.", "The OIC Program Manager said that IRS found the 2004 study too costly to  repeat, requiring thousands of staff hours from the OIC Program and  expertise from OPERA. However, only a portion of the work for the 2004  study was devoted to studying compliance; the Program Manager said that  he did not know how much it would cost to repeat the compliance portions  alone. Further, IRS does not use alternatives for the kind of compliance- benefit information the 2004 study provided, although such alternatives  exist and some are lower cost. For example, IRS could repeat only the  compliance portion of its OPERA study or use the existing status reports  collected by MOIC, which cover taxpayers who default on their offers but  are not routinely aggregated for OIC managers, to monitor trends on the  compliance of taxpayers with accepted offers. The only additional costs to  use the MOIC reports would be aggregating the data. The Treasury  Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) also conducted a file  review of accepted offers to assess aggregate compliance performance,  which the OIC Program could use as a model. According to a TIGTA audit  manger, the TIGTA study was something IRS should be able to do at a  lower cost than the OPERA report. Using the MOIC data that are already  available or employing the TIGTA approach would not yield as elaborate a  study as IRS\u2019s 2004 study, but the alternative methods would provide  information more useful to managers than having no information at all.", "We previously concluded that having the proper performance measures in  place is critical for successful program adjustments and in assessing  achievement of objectives. Because aggregate compliance trends are not  tracked and analyzed periodically, IRS does not know the effects that  recent program changes have had on taxpayer compliance; furthermore,  IRS will have greater difficulty determining what additional program  changes may be needed to ensure its best performance on achieving its  compliance objective.", "Trend information on compliance also is necessary to assess the  performance of IRS\u2019s new Hand-Off Unit.

As the inventory of offers, which  affects the number of offer closures, declined in fiscal years 2004 and 2005,  IRS did reduce FTEs, particularly in the field. However, the number of  offers closed declined more rapidly than the number of FTEs, hence the  decline in productivity. In January 2006, IRS officials told us that they  anticipate making additional staff reductions in fiscal year 2006.", "OIC officials provided some possible reasons for the decline in  productivity, including an increase in offer complexity and a plan to keep  more staff working on offers than might have been necessary to ensure that  service to taxpayers was maintained. Over the fiscal years 2003 to 2005,  however, there is some evidence that offers have not grown more complex.  Figure 3 does not show a noticeable change in case complexity. For  example, the percentage of not processable offers, the simplest and fastest  cases to close, was somewhat higher in fiscal year 2005 than in fiscal year  2003. With respect to the desire to maintain service to taxpayers, IRS has  shifted collections staff from one type of case to another.

We  continue to believe measuring timeliness from the perspective of taxpayers  and setting goals based on taxpayer needs would inform IRS management  of any gaps between actual timeliness and the goal of providing a better  basis for making decisions about program improvements.", "The commissioner agreed to analyze the causes of the growth in repeat  offers.", "He also agreed to study how repeat offers affect timeliness.", "As already noted, the Commissioner agreed to study accessibility using a  customer satisfaction survey of taxpayers who participated in the OIC  Program. While such a survey may be informative, its benefits may be  limited because it does not question nonparticipants.

Specifically, we developed independent statistical trend analyses for four of  five key performance objectives\u2014timeliness of case processing, quality,  accessibility, and cost. We reviewed OIC Program data primarily from fiscal  years 2000 through 2005. To determine how well IRS understands the  reasons for the trends, we interviewed key officials in IRS\u2019s SB/SE Division  responsible for collection policy and the OIC Program. We also reviewed  available evaluations IRS had conducted in examining these trends.", "To develop trend information on the timeliness of case processing, we  (1) separated offers disposed by the OIC Program from those disposed by  the Appeals function (Appeals), and (2) identified the number of onetime  and repeat offers and developed statistics on processing times for those  offers. Some taxpayers make only one effort to compromise a tax liability.  We call these offers onetime offers. Other taxpayers make multiple  attempts to compromise a tax liability. We call the first of these attempts an  initial offer and each subsequent attempt a repeat offer. To generate  statistics on processing times for the various disposition types, we  developed disposition categories by aggregating disposition categories  from the AOIC database. For more information about how we developed  repeat offers and disposition categories, see appendix II.", "To assess trends in the quality of the OIC Program, we collected  information and interviewed IRS officials on the accuracy rates from IRS\u2019s  embedded quality measurement system (EQMS) for the centralized  processing centers. Field locations only recently implemented EQMS;  consequently, we used accuracy rates from IRS\u2019s collection quality  measurement system for the field locations. We compared the program\u2019s  accuracy rates against accuracy goals to assess the extent to which IRS  staff followed procedures and made appropriate decisions. We also  compiled and analyzed data on offer decisions by Appeals from the AOIC  database to determine trends by year.", "Regarding the OIC Program\u2019s accessibility, we compiled statistics on offer  receipts and the dispositions of these receipts from the AOIC database. To  develop information on the pool of potentially eligible taxpayers for the  program, we obtained data on IRS taxpayer delinquent accounts. We  interviewed IRS officials about the measures they used to determine  accessibility and also interviewed representatives of tax practitioner  organizations and the National Taxpayer Advocate of the Taxpayer  Advocate Service for their views about the program\u2019s accessibility.", "To assess IRS\u2019s efforts to measure compliance, we reviewed IRS\u2019s reports  on compliance by IRS\u2019s Office of Program Evaluation and Risk Assessment  (OPERA). We used IRS policy statement P-5-100 and information on the  OIC Program objectives from the Internal Revenue Manual as criteria for  defining compliance, which the OIC Program Director generally confirmed.  We also drew on our 2002 study of IRS\u2019s OIC program, in which we  recommended that IRS make plans to conduct evaluations of initiatives  that affect the program\u2019s performance. To learn about possible alternatives  for measuring compliance, we consulted an official with the Treasury  Inspector General for Tax Administration to learn about its methods for  studying compliance in one of its reports. We interviewed IRS officials who  were knowledgeable about the Monitoring OIC (MOIC) Unit and with the  OIC Hand-Off Unit to gather information about how post-OIC compliance  was tracked.", "We developed data on the productivity of the OIC Program by obtaining  information from IRS on the number of full-time equivalent staff working in  the OIC Program and compared this to the number of case closures from  the AOIC database.

Also  using the AOIC database, we measured how long IRS took to process those  cases. We interviewed IRS officials with the OIC Program in Austin, Texas,  and in Brookhaven, New York, and officials at the Office of Professional  Responsibility (OPR), who investigate practitioner misconduct, in  Washington, D.C. We also interviewed officials with OPERA about its work  on abuse of the OIC Program. We reviewed reports on potential OIC abuse  by IRS and internal IRS guidance on handling suspected cases of  practitioner misconduct. We interviewed officials with the Federation of  Tax Administrators (FTA), the state of Maryland OIC Program, and the  Connecticut Attorney General\u2019s Office and compared their experiences  with practitioner and offer mill misconduct with those cited by IRS  officials. We selected FTA because its membership includes tax  administration officials from states that have OIC programs. An FTA  official referred us to the Maryland OIC Program. OPR cited the state of  Connecticut\u2019s involvement with investigating offer mills during an  interview. Finally, we conducted literature reviews for information about  offer mills.", "To assess how well IRS ensures that taxpayers are provided the right to  appeal rejected offers, we analyzed the AOIC database to determine  whether these taxpayers were sent the rejection letter notifying them of  their appeal right. We reviewed IRS publications containing information  about taxpayers\u2019 rights to appeal rejected offers and searched the IRS Web  site for similar information. We performed limited testing of the AOIC  database to determine whether appropriate entries were being made that  ensured that a computer-generated rejection letter with appeals  information had been sent to each taxpayer whose offer was rejected from  fiscal years 2000 to 2005. We did not contact taxpayers to determine  whether they actually received the letters. We interviewed OIC Program  officials about the offer appeals process and followed up with Appeals  officials, including Appeals staff at the Brookhaven, New York, campus  who review and process rejected offers.", "To determine whether IRS\u2019s regulations on effective tax administration  (ETA) were consistent with the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998  (Restructuring Act), we reviewed the Restructuring Act, its legislative  history, OIC regulations that were in place before the Restructuring Act,  and the regulations issued to address the Restructuring Act changes. We  met with representatives of the IRS Chief Counsel\u2019s Office who were  involved in drafting the new and revised regulations on ETA offers. In  addition, we reviewed their project files to gather documentation on how  the ETA regulations evolved. The files contain documentation, such as  internal memorandums, early draft of the regulations circulated to internal  stakeholders, and public comments received after the proposed regulations  were issued. In addition, we compared IRS\u2019s internal guidance on ETA and  doubt as to collectibility (DATC) and IRS\u2019s regulations on ETA to determine  whether they were distinct. We discussed ETA and DATC procedures,  guidance, and rules with OIC Program officials and staff in Austin, Texas  and staff in IRS\u2019s centralized processing center in Brookhaven, New York,  who processes offer applications. To gain perspective from some external  OIC Program stakeholders on how IRS implemented ETA rules, we  interviewed professional tax practitioners and representatives of the  National Association of Enrolled Agents (NAEA) and the American  Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). We selected NAEA and  AICPA because they had previously testified or commented about IRS\u2019s  OIC Program.

For example, IRS\u2019s analyses aggregates offer  disposition statistics from both IRS\u2019s Collections function (i.e., the offer  program) and its Appeals function. We wanted to separate these data in  order to examine the OIC Program\u2019s performance.", "We separated offer processing time between the Collection and Appeals  functions by examining available date fields in the AOIC database and  creating our own starting and ending processing dates. For our Collections  function start date, we used the earlier of the dates IRS received an offer  from a taxpayer, the IRS Received Date, or the date the offer was initially  entered into the AOIC database, the Area Office Opening Date. For our  Collections function end date, we used the Area Office Closing Date except  for rejected offers. For rejected offers, we checked to see if a rejection  letter had been generated and the date on which this occurred. If this date  was earlier than the Area Office Closing Date, then we used the rejection  letter date. Offers that were still being processed in the Collections  function are considered open offers and do not have ending dates.", "The Appeals function start date was also based on the earlier of two dates:   (1) the date in the AOIC database, known as the Sent to Appeals Date,  when it was present, or (2) our Collections function ending date plus 30  days when the Sent to Appeals date was not available or succeeded this  date on offers known to have been appealed. The Collections ending date  plus 30 days is the legal limit on the amount of time given a taxpayer to  appeal a rejected offer. The Appeals function ending date was always the  official Area Office Closing date.", "We also segregated offer disposition types between the Collection and  Appeals functions. The AOIC database contains 10 disposition types, of  which 3 represent Appeals function dispositions. Offers that are appealed  by taxpayers remain open on the AOIC database pending Appeals function  disposition decisions. We segregated the dispositions by creating five GAO- derived Collections function dispositions and three Appeals function  dispositions. For example, we collapsed all of the offers contained in five of  the program\u2019s disposition types, as well as certain offers still open on AOIC,  into our \u201cRejected\u201d offers disposition category. This showed the  Collections function had rejected 247,780 offers during the program\u2019s  history. These offers were as follows: (1) the 25,054 offers accepted by  IRS\u2019s Appeals function, (2) the 43,511 offers where the Appeals Function  sustained the Collections function, (3) the 42,880 offers rejected by the  Collections function without appeal rights, (4) the 116,787 offers rejected  by the Collections function where the taxpayer did not exercise appeal  rights, (5) the 7,955 offers withdrawn in Appeals, and (6) the 11,593 offers  rejected by the Collections function but not yet closed on AOIC pending  possible Appeals function activities. We combined all of these offers to  demonstrate that the Collections function had rejected 247,780 offers over  the history of the OIC program. Tables 12 and 13 reflect this roll-up and  compare other GAO-derived disposition types for the Collections and  Appeals functions to IRS\u2019s disposition types.

In order to track these multiple  offer submissions, we coined the term offer sets. Offer sets may contain  one or many offers. We defined an offer set with only one offer as a onetime  offer. For offer sets containing two or more offers, we defined the first offer  in the set as an initial offer and the second and subsequent offers in the set  as repeat offers. An offer set with two or more offers was also known as a  repeat offer set.", "Our criteria for calling a subsequent offer a repeat offer depended on  whether tax liability information was available for comparison between  two offers. For cases where tax liability information for one or both of two  chronological offer dispositions had not been migrated from IRS\u2019s Master  File to the AOIC database, a common occurrence when offers were closed  not processable, we set a 1-year time limit for designating the subsequent  offer as a repeat offer. Where the tax liability information was available for  two offers, we compared it to see if any one tax liability matched. If it did,  we called the subsequent offer a repeat and the length of time between  offer submissions did not matter. Finally, any time an offer that was part of  a repeat offer set was accepted, we assumed that offer was the last offer in  the offer set. Any subsequent attempt by a taxpayer to compromise the  same tax liabilities started a new offer set.", "We believe a 1-year time limit is reasonable as a criterion for establishing  repeat offers because most tax modules are 1 year in length corresponding  with a taxpayer\u2019s annual filing requirement (for example, a tax module for  an individual or corporate taxpayer would represent a calendar year period  that they were required to file an income tax return). Taxpayers submitting  offers must include all outstanding tax liabilities in the offer submissions,  and we believe taxpayers who have not successfully compromised tax  liability are not likely to have fully paid that tax liability and at the same  time incurred a new tax liability, which they attempt to compromise within  that 1-year period.", "The actual number of repeat offers and the average duration of time it takes  taxpayers to compromise tax liabilities are estimates because (1) taxpayers  continue to submit offers in the future for current tax liabilities for which  prior offers were not accepted, (2) some taxpayers may fully pay  outstanding tax liabilities then immediately incur new liabilities, and   (3) some taxpayers filing jointly simultaneously attempt to compromise  separate tax liabilities, and it was not always possible to separately  identify the two sets of offers. In the first situation, we underestimated the  average time it takes to compromise tax liabilities when taxpayers extend  that period by making future attempts to compromise their liabilities. In the  second situation, we overestimated the number of repeat offers and the  average time, but we believe such occurrences are rare. In the third  situation, scenarios existed where we could have either underestimated or  overestimated the actual number of repeat offers or the average duration  times. On balance, we believe the first situation is the most common and  that our estimates of the actual number of repeat offers and the average  time duration are conservative."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Generating Other OIC Program Statistics", "paragraphs": ["We also used our GAO-derived dates and disposition types to develop  additional statistics using the AOIC database. For example, when OIC  Program staff believe one of the reasons a taxpayer submitted an offer was  an attempt to delay the collections process, they will enter one of several  codes designating the offer as such in the AOIC database and return the  offer to the taxpayer. We analyzed AOIC data by these codes and  determined how frequently offers were returned for each code, the  percentages of all offers submitted that were solely to delay collection  activities, and how many offers involved professional practitioners. We also  determined how long it took the OIC Program to return solely to delay  offers involving professional practitioners.", "In addition, we used the AOIC database to estimate how many ETA offers  were processed over time. Before October 2005, IRS did not make a  distinction between ETA offers on the AOIC database and offers accepted  based on doubt as to collectability with special circumstances. These offers  were commingled and categorized as offers where an alternative basis was  used for compromise. However, an agency official told us that we could use  all offers designated as alternative basis offers as a proxy for the number of  ETA offers processed by IRS. The agency added a data field beginning in  October 2005 to specifically track ETA offers.", "Furthermore, we calculated the Collections function\u2019s inventory levels for  fiscal years 2000 through 2005.
