Specifically, EPA collects data on whether sites are on tribal property or have Native American Interest (a data variable indicating sites where tribal members or tribal land would be directly affected by the release of hazardous substances), as well as which tribes are associated with NPL sites. However, EPA's data are not always accurate or complete for a number of reasons. For example, EPA can have difficulty identifying some tribal property boundaries, and NPL site boundaries may evolve as the site is investigated and remediated. EPA does not have a regular review process for its data on whether an NPL site is on tribal property. In addition, EPA's guidance for determining whether a site has Native American Interest is unclear, and regions may not interpret it consistently. Without improving its review process and clarifying its guidance, EPA will not have reasonable assurance that its data on tribes that are affected by NPL sites are accurate or complete.", "EPA consults with tribes when actions at an NPL site may affect tribal interests, but the agency does not have reliable data on its consultations with tribes. Data from EPA's system for tracking consultation did not include documentation of some consultations that GAO confirmed had occurred. One possible reason that EPA data are incomplete is that the agency's policy is unclear on which interactions are considered consultation and are therefore to be documented in EPA's system of record, which is not consistent with federal standards for internal control. EPA's policy provides a broad definition of consultation and specifies which staff are responsible for determining when consultation may be appropriate. However, the policy does not provide further guidance on the circumstances under which consultation should be considered. For example, it does not specify any specific points in the hazardous substance cleanup process at which consultation should be considered or provide further detail on which tribal interests should be considered when determining if tribal interests on NPL sites are affected. Without clarifying guidance to clearly define circumstances under which consultation with tribes should be considered, EPA cannot have reasonable assurance that it is applying its consultation policy consistently.", "EPA has taken various actions to address the unique needs of tribes when making decisions about cleanup actions. These actions include minimizing tribal members' exposure to contaminants because of tribal lifestyle (e.g., greater consumption of local fish and game) and limiting potential damage to culturally important sites. For example, EPA officials said that at one site, they altered the design and route of the roads used to remove contaminated materials to minimize the impact of cleanup activities' on cultural resources. EPA also published a memorandum in 2017 with recommendations on considering tribes' traditional ecological knowledge in the cleanup process if tribes offer it."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making four recommendations to EPA, including that it take actions to improve the data it collects and to clearly define circumstances under which consultation with tribes should be considered.

According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),  more than 300,000 Indians\u2014roughly 12 percent of the approximate total  Indian population of the United States\u2014live within 3 miles of a site that  has released or may release a hazardous substance. For example, in  upstate New York, elevated levels of polychlorinated biphenyls, which  were released into the St. Lawrence and Grasse Rivers by an aluminum  manufacturing facility and an aluminum die casting plant, have posed a  threat to the health and traditional cultural practices of members of the  Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe since at least 1954, according to officials from  the tribe. According to these officials, fish consumption restrictions  associated with the contamination in the St. Lawrence and Grasse Rivers  disrupted the tribe\u2019s subsistence lifestyle and the role that fishing plays in  tribal members\u2019 lives. In addition, in 2014, we reported that for more than  30 years, the Navajo people have lived with the environmental and health  effects of uranium contamination resulting from the extraction of millions  of tons of uranium ore from mines on the Navajo reservation to support  the development of the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile.", "The federal government\u2019s principal program to address sites with  hazardous substances\u2014the Superfund program\u2014was established by the  Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability  Act (CERCLA) of 1980 and is administered by EPA. EPA assesses  contaminated sites using a Hazard Ranking System that considers  several factors, such as exposure pathways, to determine a site\u2019s relative  threat to human health or the environment. Sites with sufficiently high  scores under this system are eligible to be proposed for listing on the  National Priorities List (NPL), which includes some of the most seriously  contaminated sites that EPA identifies for long-term cleanup. After a site  is listed on the NPL, or a release or threatened release of a hazardous  substance is identified, EPA or a potentially responsible party can begin  the multi-phase remedial cleanup process, which we refer to as cleanup  actions. Potentially responsible parties are liable for conducting or paying  for the cleanup of hazardous substances.", "In certain circumstances involving Superfund sites, EPA is required or  directed to consult with federally recognized Indian tribes. Specifically, for  Superfund sites on land where a tribe has jurisdiction, CERCLA requires  EPA to give tribes \u201csubstantially the same treatment as a state\u201d for, among other things, consultation on remedial actions. In addition, in 2011,  EPA issued a general, agency-wide policy for consultation and  coordination with tribes when EPA actions and decisions may affect tribal  interests. The policy outlines a four-phase consultation process that  includes EPA notifying tribes sufficiently early in the process to allow for  meaningful input by tribes and providing formal, written feedback  explaining how EPA considered tribes\u2019 input in its final action.", "You asked us to examine Superfund sites that are located on tribal  property or that affect tribes, and EPA\u2019s consultation with tribes regarding  cleanup actions at these sites.

We limited our review  to NPL remedial cleanup sites\u2014proposed, final, and deleted\u2014because  they represent sites with the highest national priority due to the  significance of releases, or threatened releases, of hazardous  substances. To assess the reliability of EPA\u2019s data, we worked with  officials from EPA headquarters and each of its 10 regional offices to  perform data quality checks and identify any errors or omissions. We also  interviewed EPA officials about selected sites of interest that, according to  EPA, may be located within 1 mile of tribal property, but that EPA had not  identified as having NAI. Additionally, we reviewed documents and  interviewed officials from EPA headquarters and regional offices to better  understand the agency\u2019s management and use of the database of record  for collecting and maintaining data on all Superfund sites, the Superfund  Enterprise Management System (SEMS). We worked with agency  officials to correct errors in order for us to report on the number of NPL  sites known to be on tribal property or that affect tribes as of December  2017, and we identified 87 sites of the total 1,785 NPL sites that were  proposed, final, or deleted at that time. In addition, in their comments on a  draft of this report, the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the  Flathead Reservation identified an additional site that was not included in  EPA\u2019s data, bringing the total to 88 NPL sites known to be on tribal  property or affect tribes. We recognize there may be additional sites that  may be of interest to tribes; however, we determined that the data were  sufficiently reliable for the purpose of providing information on NPL sites  known to affect tribes or to be located on tribal property. Appendix I  provides information on and cleanup status for these 88 sites.", "To examine whether EPA has reliable data regarding its consultation with  tribes about NPL sites, we reviewed data from EPA\u2019s Tribal Consultation  Opportunity Tracking System (TCOTS) regarding consultations that had  taken place since 2011 and related agency documentation, interviewed  knowledgeable agency officials, and compared TCOTS data with other  data EPA provided on tribal consultation in support of our first objective.  We worked with agency officials to correct errors and omissions to reach  a final set of data that were sufficiently reliable to report, as of May 2018.  These data provide the total number of consultations that EPA officials  have had with tribes regarding NPL site cleanup decisions since 2011.  We also interviewed EPA headquarters and regional officials to obtain  their perspectives on how and when EPA consults with tribes.", "In addition, using the number of NPL sites known to be on tribal property  or affecting tribes that we developed for objective one, we selected a  nonprobability sample of six final or proposed NPL sites to use as case  studies. We selected these sites to reflect different EPA regions, listings  on the NPL before and after EPA\u2019s 2011 consultation and coordination  policy went into effect, and sites that have had at least two assessments  or inspections performed, according to EPA data. While we selected six  NPL sites EPA has identified as affecting tribes or located on tribal  property, our interviews with tribal and EPA officials covered a broader  spectrum of sites and included officials\u2019 views regarding any Superfund  program activities in which they had been involved. For each case study,  we requested information about EPA\u2019s consultation with tribes as well as  any documentation that demonstrated whether and how EPA took into  account unique tribal needs associated with the site when making  cleanup decisions. We also interviewed officials from the tribe or tribes  involved with the cleanup at each of our six selected NPL sites, as well as  EPA regional officials for the region in which the site is located.

Under CERCLA, potentially responsible parties  are liable for conducting or paying for the cleanup of hazardous  substances at contaminated sites. Under the Superfund program, EPA  and potentially responsible parties can undertake two types of cleanup  actions: removal actions and remedial actions. Removal actions are  usually short-term cleanups for sites that pose immediate threats to  human health or the environment. Remedial actions are generally long- term cleanups\u2014consisting of one or more remedial action projects\u2014that  aim to permanently and significantly reduce contamination; these actions  can take a considerable amount of time and money, depending on the  nature of the contamination and other site-specific factors.", "The Superfund process begins with the discovery of a potentially  hazardous site or notifications to EPA regarding the possible release of  hazardous substances that may threaten human health or the  environment. EPA delineates the Superfund remedial cleanup process in  nine phases:  1.  Preliminary Assessment and Site Investigation. EPA\u2019s regional  offices may discover sites with releases of hazardous substances or  potential for releases of hazardous substances, or such sites may  come to EPA\u2019s attention through notifications\u2014either reports from  state agencies or citizens. As part of this first phase of the process,  EPA\u2019s regional offices use a screening system called the Hazard  Ranking System to guide decision making and, as needed, to  numerically assess the site\u2019s relative potential to pose a threat to  human health or the environment.  2.  NPL Site Listing Process. EPA may propose sites that score at or  above an established level for listing on the NPL. EPA regions  submit sites to EPA headquarters for possible listing on the NPL  based on a variety of factors, including the availability of alternative  state or federal programs that may be used to clean up the site.  Sites that EPA proposes to list on the NPL are published in the  Federal Register. After a period of public comment, EPA reviews the  comments and makes final decisions on whether to list the sites on  the NPL.  3.  Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study. EPA or a potentially  responsible party will generally begin the remedial cleanup process  for an NPL site by conducting a two-part study of the site: (1) a  remedial investigation to characterize site conditions and assess the  risks to human health and the environment, among other actions and  (2) a feasibility study to evaluate various options to address the  problems identified through the remedial investigation.  4.  Record of Decision. At the culmination of the remedial investigation  and feasibility study, EPA issues a record of decision that identifies  EPA\u2019s selected remedy for addressing the contamination. A record of  decision typically lays out the planned cleanup activities for each  operable unit of the site.  5.  Remedial Design and Remedial Action. EPA or a potentially  responsible party plans the implementation of the selected remedy  during the remedial design phase, and then, in the remedial action  phase, EPA or a potentially responsible party carries out one or more  remedial action projects.  6.  Construction Completion. EPA generally considers the construction  to be complete for a site when all physical construction at a site is  complete, including actions to address all immediate threats and to  bring all long-term threats under control.  7.  Post-Construction Completion. The potentially responsible party or  the state generally conducts operation and maintenance to maintain  the remedy, such as operating a groundwater extraction and  treatment system. EPA generally performs reviews of the remedy at  least every five years to evaluate whether it continues to protect  human health and the environment.  8.  NPL Deletion. EPA may delete a site, or part of a site, from the NPL  when the agency and the relevant state authority determine that no  further site response is needed.  9.  Site Reuse and Redevelopment. EPA works with communities to  ensure that site cleanups are consistent with the site\u2019s future use and  to make sure sites or portions of sites are used safely."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Relationship between Federally Recognized Tribes and the Federal Government", "paragraphs": ["The federal government recognizes Indian tribes as distinct, independent  political communities that possess certain powers of self-government and  sovereignty.

These officials told us that they have  worked over the past year to correct these errors and to verify the  accuracy of site coordinates.", "Second, EPA officials told us that accurately documenting which sites  are on tribal property can be complicated due to difficulties identifying  tribal property boundaries and evolving site boundaries. For example,  tribal property boundaries may be difficult to establish without  reviewing land titles and other documents. Further, EPA officials told  us they use the best available data to identify tribal property but there  are limitations in that data. In addition, EPA officials we interviewed  told us that site boundaries can be difficult to define or change over  time. For example, an agency official told us NPL sites may not have  clearly delineated boundaries until after the remedial investigation is  complete and the full extent of contamination has been determined.  Further, the official said that site boundaries may change during the  cleanup process or during post-cleanup reviews if EPA discovers new  or more widespread contamination. According to EPA headquarters  officials, EPA regional officials are responsible for tracking changes to  site boundaries in their respective regions, but specific information on  the location of site boundaries is not documented in SEMS.  Additionally, for one site\u2014the Tar Creek site in Oklahoma (Region  6)\u2014EPA\u2019s publicly-available information states that there are no clear  site boundaries. One EPA regional official we interviewed told us that  he was not aware of guidance for regions regarding changing tribal  property information in circumstances in which site boundaries  change to include land that is tribal property.

When responding to our request to verify the  accuracy of data in SEMS, EPA regional officials identified 10 sites  that were incorrectly included in SEMS as having NAI when there was  no actual tribal interest. For example, officials from Region 4 stated  that they removed the NAI designation from three sites because the  sites are situated more than 100 miles from the nearest federally  recognized tribe\u2019s property and the officials were not aware of any  tribal interest in the sites. Similarly, EPA regional officials determined  that two other sites\u2014Eielson Air Force Base in Region 10 and Seneca  Army Depot in Region 2\u2014were incorrectly identified as having NAI.  These officials told us that these sites should not have been  designated as NAI because no tribes had expressed interest in either  site.", "EPA inconsistently identified sites with prior NAI in SEMS. We  found that EPA regional officials inconsistently used the NAI variable  in SEMS when tribes were no longer interested in a site. For example,  Region 2 officials stated that they maintained the NAI designation for  the Hooker Hyde Park site in order to preserve the historical record  after EPA identified that the Seneca Nation of Indians no longer had  an interest in the site. Conversely, Region 8 officials indicated that  they removed the NAI designation for the Arsenic Trioxide site when it  was determined that the relevant tribe no longer had interest in the  site.", "Based on our review of EPA guidance and data provided by EPA officials,  we identified several possible reasons that the agency\u2019s data for  identifying tribal interests are not accurate or complete. One possible  reason that NAI data in EPA\u2019s SEMS may be inaccurate and incomplete  is because EPA\u2019s guidance for making NAI determinations is unclear,  resulting in EPA regional officials inconsistently determining and  documenting sites with NAI. EPA\u2019s Superfund Program Implementation  Manual, which provides guidance to EPA regional officials for identifying  sites as having NAI, contains one sentence regarding how EPA regional  officials are to determine when to designate a site as having NAI. The  manual states that EPA regional officials should designate NAI in SEMS  when a site \u201cmay be of interest to tribes whose members or land are  directly affected\u201d by the release of hazardous materials from the site, but  the manual does not specify criteria EPA regional officials should  consider for determining what constitutes NAI. For example, the manual  does not specify whether ancestral lands, areas where tribes have treaty  rights, or areas otherwise of interest to a tribe but that are not tribal  property should be considered in making this determination. It also does  not specify what types of tribal interests to consider. However, officials  from tribes we interviewed for our case studies told us that tribal interests  in NPL sites may be related to a variety of factors, including  contamination potentially affecting tribal members living in or around the  contaminated area or land where the tribe has treaty hunting or fishing  rights. Furthermore, EPA\u2019s Superfund Program Implementation Manual  does not specify whether officials should remove the NAI designation if  officials determine tribes no longer have interest in a site. In the case of  the Petoskey Manufacturing Company Groundwater site in Michigan,  EPA Region 5 officials we interviewed told us that they were uncertain as  to whether they should identify the site as having NAI, because they were  unsure if the level of the tribe\u2019s interest was significant enough.", "EPA officials we interviewed provided additional reasons for the lack of  accuracy and completeness in the agency\u2019s data regarding sites with NAI.  EPA headquarters officials told us they periodically, but infrequently,  review SEMS data on Superfund sites identified as having NAI. In  addition, EPA officials told us that, in some cases, they did not identify  sites as having NAI where there was tribal interest or incorrectly identified  sites as having NAI when no tribal interests were involved due to errors.  Additionally, some regional officials expressed that identifying NAI can be  complicated by the fact that tribes may have interest in sites not located  near their current property due to historical interest or treaty rights.", "Under federal standards for internal control, management should design  control activities to achieve objectives and respond to risks, such as by  clearly documenting internal control in management directives,  administrative policies, or operating manuals.

We identified eight sites for which EPA did not identify in SEMS  all the tribes that had interest in the site. For example, for the Smurfit  Stone Mill Frenchtown site in Missoula, Montana, EPA data listed the  Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead Reservation  as having an interest in the site. However, after speaking with EPA  Region 8 officials, we learned that the Kalispel Indian Community of  the Kalispel Reservation also has an interest in the site but could not  be included in SEMS because the tribe resides in the state of  Washington, and the site is located in Montana.

For the Velsicol Chemical  Corporation site in Michigan, EPA identified in SEMS the interested  tribe as the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians, when the  actual interested tribe was the Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe of  Michigan. Additionally, in providing technical comments on a draft of  our report, EPA also made corrections to the tribes originally listed for  the Tar Lake site and clarified the tribe originally listed for the St.  Louis River site.", "EPA officials we interviewed told us that a possible reason for the  inaccuracies in the data regarding the tribe or tribes interested in NPL  sites that have NAI is that, until recently, regional officials could not enter  the names of additional tribes to a SEMS site record that was created in  the agency\u2019s previous database of record. In addition, officials from two  EPA regions told us that they could not record tribes as having an interest  in a site when the tribe is headquartered in a state other than the state  address on file for the site. EPA headquarters officials told us they  submitted a request in August of 2017 to have the issue resolved and  that, as of April 2018, the issue had been corrected and that regions can  now add additional tribes, or tribes from other states outside of the state  where the site is headquartered.

EPA headquarters  officials told us that invitations to consult should be entered in TCOTS,  because the database has a specific field for this information. Officials we  interviewed from EPA Regions 6 and 10, the two regional offices that  combined manage nearly half of Superfund sites that EPA identified as  having NAI, told us that they do not document all invitations to consult in  TCOTS.

EPA\u2019s  revised hazard exposure assessment for the General Motors Central  Foundry site assumed a higher rate of exposure to contaminants for  tribal members, given that they, on average, live on the reservation  longer than an adult non-tribal member may live in the same place for  most of his or her life. Specifically, EPA\u2019s exposure estimate was  based on an exposure duration of 64 years for an adult tribal member  and an exposure duration of 30 years for adult non-tribal member.", "EPA Region 9 incorporated tribal information into risk  assessments for some NPL sites.
