His associate was seeking a job with the project\u2019s management contractor, TRW; and TRW had requested assurances of the Deputy Project Manager\u2019s impartiality. Despite a DOE general counsel\u2019s statement to him that there was no need for the recusal that the then Acting OCRWM Director had suggested, the deputy recused himself. His recusal removed him from decisions regarding the transition of work from SAIC to TRW; TRW\u2019s contract award fee evaluation; and any decisions regarding his associate\u2019s salary, bonuses, and benefits.

The SAIC Assistant Vice President responsible for licensing support activities, including work that was to be subcontracted to IRG, told us he doubted that SAIC would have contracted with IRG had it not been for the political contacts of IRG\u2019s president and the Project Manager\u2019s desire to have IRG in the project. He said that when SAIC considered IRG for a subcontract, it looked at IRG\u2019s corporate capabilities, i.e., IRG had considerable expertise in nuclear facility licensing support and regulatory commitment tracking systems. He added, however, that the Project Manager\u2019s expressed desire was the motivation behind SAIC\u2019s consideration of IRG and except for that expressed desire, SAIC probably would not have subcontracted the work.
