Law enforcement investigations and prosecutions of bank and credit card fraud also provide data. GAO found no comprehensive estimates of the cost of identity theft to the financial services industry.

Generally, as noted in our May 1998 report, identify theft or identity fraud involves \u201cstealing\u201d another person\u2019s personal identifying information\u2014such as Social Security number (SSN), date of birth, and mother\u2019s maiden name\u2014and then using the information to fraudulently establish credit, run up debt, or take over existing financial accounts. Later that year, Congress passed legislation\u2014the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act of 1998 (the Identity Theft Act)\u2014which separately made identity theft a specific federal crime and recognized that victims include individuals, as well as financial institutions and other business entities. Also, since 1998, most states have enacted laws that criminalize identity theft.", "Specifically, in response to your request, this report provides information on the extent or prevalence of identity theft;  the cost of identity theft to the financial services industry, including  direct fraud losses, staffing of fraud departments, and effect on consumer  confidence in online commerce;  the cost of identity theft to victims, including victim productivity losses,  out-of-pocket expenses, and cost of being denied credit; and  the cost of identity theft to the federal criminal justice system.", "To address these topics, we interviewed responsible officials and reviewed  documentation obtained from relevant federal agencies\u2014the Department  of Justice and its components, including the Executive Office for U.S.  Attorneys (EOUSA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI);  Department of the Treasury and its components, including the Secret  Service and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS); the Social Security  Administration\u2019s (SSA) Office of the Inspector General (OIG); the Postal  Inspection Service; and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Also, we  contacted representatives of the three national consumer reporting  agencies and two payment card associations (MasterCard and Visa).  Furthermore, at our request and with the consent of the victims, FTC  provided us with the names and telephone numbers of a small cross  section of victims (10 total) to interview. According to FTC staff, the  sample of 10 victims was selected to illustrate a range in the extent and  variety of the identity theft activities reported by victims. The experiences  of these 10 victims are not statistically representative of all victims. We  conducted our work from March 2001 to January 2002 in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards. Appendix I presents  more details about the scope and methodology of our work."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Results", "paragraphs": ["No single hotline or database captures the universe of identity theft  victims. Some individuals do not even know that they have been  victimized until months after the fact, and some known victims may  choose not to report to the police, credit bureaus, or established hotlines.  Thus, it is difficult to fully or accurately quantify the prevalence of identity  theft. Some of the often-quoted estimates of prevalence range from  one-quarter to three-quarters of a million victims annually. Usually, these  estimates are based on limited hotline reporting or other available data, in  combination with various assumptions regarding, for example, the number  of victims who do not contact credit bureaus, the FTC, the SSA/OIG, or  other authorities. Generally speaking, the higher the estimate of identity  theft prevalence, the greater the (1) number of victims who are assumed  not to report the crime and (2) number of hotline callers who are assumed  to be victims rather than \u201cpreventative\u201d callers. We found no information  to gauge the extent to which these assumptions are valid. Additionally,  there are no readily available statistics on the number of victims who may  have contacted their banks or credit card issuers only and not the credit  bureaus or other hotlines.", "Nevertheless, although not specifically or comprehensively quantifiable,  the prevalence and cost of identity theft seem to be increasing, according  to the available data we reviewed and many officials of the public and  private sector entities we contacted. The following presents summary  information for each of the topics that we addressed. More detailed  information is presented in appendixes II through V, respectively."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Prevalence of Identity Theft", "paragraphs": ["As we reported in 1998, there are no comprehensive statistics on the  prevalence of identity theft. Similarly, during our current review, various  officials noted that precise, statistical measurement of identity theft trends  is difficult due to a number of factors. Generally, federal law enforcement  agencies do not have information systems that facilitate specific tracking  of identity theft cases. For example, while the amendments made by the  Identity Theft Act are included as subsection (a)(7) of section 1028, Title  18 of the U.S. Code, EOUSA does not have comprehensive statistics on  offenses charged specifically under that subsection. EOUSA officials  explained that, except for certain firearms statutes, docketing staff are  asked to record cases under only the U.S. Code section, not the subsection  or the sub-subsection. Also, the FBI and the Secret Service noted that  identity theft is not typically a stand-alone crime; rather, identity theft is  almost always a component of one or more white-collar or financial  crimes, such as bank fraud, credit card or access device fraud, or the use  of counterfeit financial instruments.", "Nonetheless, while recognizing measurement difficulties, a number of data  sources can be used as proxies or indicators for gauging the prevalence of  such crime. These sources can include consumer complaints and hotline  allegations, as well as law enforcement investigations and prosecutions of  identity theft-related crimes such as bank fraud and credit card fraud.  Each of these various sources or measures seems to indicate that the  prevalence of identity theft is growing:  Consumer reporting agency data. Generally, in the view of consumer  reporting agency officials, the most reliable indicator of the incidence of  identity theft is the number of 7-year fraud alerts placed on consumer  credit files. Generally, fraud alerts constitute a warning that someone may  be using the consumer\u2019s personal information to fraudulently obtain  credit. Thus, a purpose of the alert is to advise credit grantors to conduct  additional identity verification or contact the consumer directly before  granting credit. One of the three consumer reporting agencies estimated  that its 7-year fraud alerts involving identity theft increased 36 percent  over 2 recent years\u2014from about 65,600 in 1999 to 89,000 in 2000. A  second agency reported that its 7-year fraud alerts increased about 53  percent in recent comparative 12-month periods; that is, the number  increased from 19,347 during one 12-month period (July 1999 through June  2000) to 29,593 during the more recent period (July 2000 through June  2001). The third agency reported about 92,000 fraud alerts for 2000 but  was unable to provide information for any earlier year. Also, due largely  to increased public awareness about identity theft, the number of inquiries  received by the fraud units of consumer reporting agencies is at an all-time  high. However, an industry official opined that the number of inquiries is  not a reasonable measure of the incidence of identity theft because  virtually all individuals whose wallet or purse is lost or stolen will now call  the consumer reporting agencies as a precautionary measure.", "FTC data. From its establishment in November 1999 through September  2001, FTC\u2019s Identity Theft Data Clearinghouse received a total of 94,100  complaints from victims, including 16,784 complaints transferred to the  FTC from the SSA/OIG. In the first month of operation, the Clearinghouse  answered an average of 445 calls per week. By March 2001, the average  number of calls answered had increased to over 2,000 per week. In  December 2001, the weekly average was about 3,000 answered calls.", "However, FTC officials noted that identity theft-related statistics may, in  part, reflect enhanced consumer awareness and reporting.", "SSA/OIG data. SSA/OIG has reported a substantial increase in call-ins of  identity theft-related allegations to its Fraud Hotline in recent years.  Allegations involving SSN misuse, for example, increased more than  fivefold, from about 11,000 in fiscal year 1998 to about 65,000 in fiscal year  2001. To some extent, the increased number of allegations may be due to  additional Fraud Hotline staffing, which increased from 11 to over 50  personnel during this period. However, SSA/OIG officials attributed the  trend in allegations partly to a greater incidence of identity theft. Also,  irrespective of staffing levels, SSA/OIG data indicate that about 81 percent  of all allegations of SSN misuse relate directly to identity theft.", "Federal law enforcement data. Generally, although federal law  enforcement agencies do not have information systems that facilitate  specific tracking of identity theft cases, the agencies provided us case  statistics for identity theft-related crimes. Regarding bank fraud, for  instance, the FBI reported that its arrests increased from 579 in 1998 to  645 in 2000\u2014and was even higher (691) in 1999. The Secret Service  reported that, for recent years, it has redirected its identity theft-related  efforts to focus on high-dollar, community-impact cases. Thus, even  though the total number of identity theft-related cases closed by the Secret  Service decreased from 8,498 in fiscal year 1998 to 7,071 in 2000, the  amount of fraud losses prevented in these cases increased from a reported  average of $73,382 in 1998 to an average of $217,696 in 2000. The Postal  Inspection Service, in its fiscal year 2000 annual report, noted that identity  theft is a growing trend and that the agency\u2019s investigations of such crime  had \u201cincreased by 67 percent since last year.\u201d (See app. II.)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cost of Identity Theft to the Financial Services Industry", "paragraphs": ["We found no comprehensive estimates of the cost of identity theft to the  financial services industry. Some data on identity theft-related  losses\u2014such as direct fraud losses reported by the American Bankers  Association (ABA) and payment card associations\u2014indicated increasing  costs. Other data, such as staffing of the fraud departments of banks and  consumer reporting agencies, presented a mixed and/or incomplete  picture. For example, one consumer reporting agency reported that  staffing of its fraud department had doubled in recent years, whereas  another agency reported relatively constant staffing levels. Furthermore,  despite concerns about security and privacy, the use of e-commerce has  grown steadily in recent years. Such growth may indicate greater  consumer confidence but may also have resulted from an increase in the  number of people who have access to Internet technology.", "Regarding direct fraud losses, in its year 2000 bank industry survey on  check fraud, the ABA reported that total check fraud-related losses against  commercial bank accounts\u2014considering both actual losses ($679 million)  and loss avoidance ($1.5 billion)\u2014reached an estimated $2.2 billion in  1999, which was twice the amount in 1997. Regarding actual losses, the  report noted that the 1999 figure ($679 million) was up almost 33 percent  from the 1997 estimate ($512 million). However, not all check fraud- related losses were attributed to identity theft, which the ABA defined as  account takeovers (or true name fraud). Rather, the ABA reported that, of  the total check fraud-related losses in 1999, the percentages attributable to  identity theft ranged from 56 percent for community banks (assets under  $500 million) to 5 percent for superregional/money center banks (assets of  $50 billion or more), and the average for all banks was 29 percent.", "The two major payment card associations, MasterCard and Visa, use very  similar (although not identical) definitions regarding which categories of  fraud constitute identity theft. Generally, the associations consider identity  theft to consist of two fraud categories\u2014account takeovers and fraudulent  applications. Based on these two categories, the associations\u2019 aggregated  identity theft-related losses from domestic (U.S. operations) rose from  $79.9 million in 1996 to $114.3 million in 2000, an increase of about 43  percent. The associations\u2019 definitions of identity theft-related fraud are  relatively narrow, in the view of law enforcement, which considers  identity theft as encompassing virtually all categories of payment card  fraud. Under this broader definition, the associations\u2019 total fraud losses  from domestic operations rose from about $700 million in 1996 to about  $1.0 billion in 2000, an increase of about 45 percent. However, according  to the associations, the annual total fraud losses represented about 1/10th  of 1 percent or less of U.S. member banks\u2019 annual sales volume during  1996 through 2000.  Generally, the fraud losses are borne by the respective  financial institution that issued the payment card.", "To reiterate, regarding direct fraud losses involving payment cards, we  contacted MasterCard and Visa only. We did not obtain information about  losses involving other general-purpose cards (American Express, Diners  Club, and Discover), which account for about 25 percent of the market.  Also, we did not obtain information about losses involving  merchant-specific cards issued by retail stores. Furthermore, we did not  obtain information from various other entities, such as insurance  companies and securities firms, which may incur identity theft-related  costs.", "Regarding staffing and cost of fraud departments, in its year 2000 bank  industry survey on check fraud, the ABA reported that the amount of  resources that banks devoted to check fraud prevention, detection,  investigation, and prosecution varied according to bank size. For check  fraud-related operating expenses (not including actual losses) in 1999, the  ABA reported that over two-thirds of the 446 community banks that  responded to the survey each spent less than $10,000, and about  one-fourth of the 11 responding superregional/money center banks each  spent $10 million or more for such expenses.", "One national consumer reporting agency told us that staffing of its Fraud  Victim Assistance Department doubled in recent years, increasing from 50  individuals in 1997 to 103 in 2001. The total cost of the department was  reported to be $4.3 million for 2000. Although not as specific, a second  agency reported that the cost of its fraud assistance staffing was \u201cseveral  million dollars.\u201d And, the third consumer reporting agency said that the  number of fraud operators in its Consumer Services Center had increased  in the 1990\u2019s but has remained relatively constant at about 30 to 50  individuals since 1997.", "Regarding consumer confidence in online commerce, despite concerns  about security and privacy, the use of e-commerce by consumers has  steadily grown. For example, in the year 2000 holiday season, consumers  spent an estimated $10.8 billion online, which represented more than a  50-percent increase over the $7 billion spent during the 1999 holiday  season. Furthermore, in 1995, only one bank had a Web site capable of  processing financial transactions but, by 2000, a total of 1,850 banks and  thrifts had Web sites capable of processing financial transactions.", "The growth in e-commerce could indicate greater consumer confidence  but could also result from the increasing number of people who have  access to and are becoming familiar with Internet technology. According  to an October 2000 Department of Commerce report, Internet users  comprised about 44 percent (approximately 116 million people) of the U.S.  population in August 2000. This was an increase of about 38 percent from  20 months prior.

For instance, some victims reported being able  to file a police report in their state of residence but were unable to do so in  other states where the perpetrators committed fraudulent activities using  the stolen identities. Only 2 of the 10 victims told us they were aware that  the perpetrator had been arrested.", "In a May 2000 report, two nonprofit advocacy entities\u2014the California  Public Interest Research Group (CALPIRG) and the Privacy Rights  Clearinghouse\u2014presented findings based on a survey (conducted in the  spring of 2000) of 66 identity theft victims who had contacted these  organizations. According to the report, the victims spent 175 hours, on  average, actively trying to resolve their identity theft-related problems.  Also, not counting legal fees, most victims estimated spending $100 for  out-of-pocket costs. The May 2000 report stated that these findings may  not be representative of the plight of all victims. Rather, the report noted  that the findings should be viewed as \u201cpreliminary and representative only  of those victims who have contacted our organizations for further  assistance (other victims may have had simpler cases resolved with only a  few calls and felt no need to make further inquiries).\u201d (See app. IV.)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Criminal Justice System Costs", "paragraphs": ["Regarding identity theft and any other type of crime, the federal criminal  justice system incurs costs associated with investigations, prosecutions,  incarceration, and community supervision. Generally, we found that  federal agencies do not separately maintain statistics on the person hours,  portions of salary, or other distinct costs that are specifically attributable  to cases involving identity theft. As an alternative, some of the agencies  provided us with average cost estimates based, for example, on workyear  counts for white-collar crime cases\u2014a category that covers financial  crimes, including identity theft.", "In response to our request, the FBI estimated that the average cost of an  investigative matter handled by the agency\u2019s white-collar crime program  was approximately $20,000 during fiscal years 1998 to 2000, based on  budget and workload data for the 3 years. However, an FBI official  cautioned that the average cost figure has no practical significance  because it does not capture the wide variance in the scope and costs of  white-collar crime investigations. Also, the official cautioned that\u2014while  identity theft is frequently an element of bank fraud, wire fraud, and other  types of white-collar or financial crimes\u2014some cases (including some  high-cost cases) do not involve elements of identity theft.", "Similarly, Secret Service officials\u2014in responding to our request for an  estimate of the average cost of investigating financial crimes that included  identity theft as a component\u2014said that cases vary so much in their  makeup that to put a figure on average cost is not meaningful.  Nonetheless, the agency\u2019s Management and Organization Division made its  \u201cbest estimate of the average cost\u201d of a financial crimes investigation  conducted by the Secret Service in fiscal year 2001. The resulting estimate  was approximately $15,000.

Under U.S. Sentencing Commission guidelines\u2014even if  (1) there is no monetary loss and (2) the perpetrator has no prior criminal  convictions\u2014a sentence as high as 10 to 16 months incarceration can be  imposed. Regarding state statutes, at the time of our 1998 report, very few  states had specific laws to address identity theft. Now, less than 4 years  later, a large majority of states have enacted identity theft statutes.", "In short, federal and state legislation indicate that identity theft has been  widely recognized as a serious crime across the nation. As such, a current  focus for policymakers and criminal justice administrators is to ensure  that relevant legislation is effectively enforced. Given the frequently  cross-jurisdictional nature of identity theft crime, enforcement of the  relevant federal and state laws presents various challenges, particularly  regarding coordination of efforts. Although we have not evaluated them,  initiatives designed to address these challenges include the following:", "After enactment of the 1998 Identity Theft Act, the Attorney General\u2019s  Council on White Collar Crime established a Subcommittee on Identity  Theft. Purposes of the Subcommittee are to foster coordination of  investigative and prosecutorial strategies and promote consumer  education programs.

Such task forces enable law enforcement  to more effectively pursue cases that have multijurisdictional elements,  such as fraudulent schemes that involve illegal activities in multiple  counties or states. At the time of our review, the Secret Service was the  lead agency in 37 task forces across the country that were primarily  targeting financial and electronic crimes, many of which may include  identity theft-related elements.", "Also, under the 1998 Identity Theft Act, the FTC established a toll-free  number for victims to call and is compiling complaint information in a  national Identity Theft Data Clearinghouse.

ABA staff did not conduct any follow-up analyses to find out whether the  banks that responded were different from the banks that did not respond.  ABA staff said that they were not concerned about the survey\u2019s response  rate because they believed that the survey had adequate coverage of  banking industry assets and losses by virtue of having a good  representation of large banks (i.e., regional banks and  superregional/money center banks).

Primary types of this information include names, dates of birth,  and SSNs. With the proliferation of computers and increased use of the  Internet, many identity thieves have used information obtained from  company databases and Web sites.  Identity theft is not typically a \u201cstand alone\u201d crime. Rather, identity theft is  almost always a component of one or more crimes, such as bank fraud,  credit card or access device fraud, or the use of counterfeit financial  instruments. In many instances, an identity theft case encompasses several  different types of fraud.", "In further response to our inquiry, Secret Service officials said that they  believe that identity theft continues to occur at a seemingly increasing  pace. The officials cautioned, however, that the incidence of identity theft  is difficult to measure on the basis of available statistics (such as number  of investigations or arrests) for a variety of reasons. Among others, the  reasons cited were lack of reporting by victims, classification of identity  theft in other crime categories (e.g., theft or forgery) or perhaps as a civil  matter, and different levels of law enforcement (federal, state, and local)  having concurrent jurisdiction with respect to many aspects of identity  theft. Given these limitations, the officials suggested that any assessment  of overall trends regarding identity theft perhaps should be based on  statistics from FTC\u2014the agency designated to be the primary point of  contact for victims.", "Nonetheless, we obtained available statistics from the Secret Service  regarding its identity-theft related cases for fiscal years 1998-2000 (see  table 11).
