In fact, airports of all sizes have lost capacity in the number of available seats, and largely for flights as well. However, medium-hub and small-hub airports have proportionally lost more service than large-hub or nonhub airports (see figure).", "The two primary programs, designed to help small communities retain air service, administered by the Department of Transportation (DOT), face challenges.", "The Essential Air Service (EAS) program, which received about $232 million in 2013, provided subsidies to airlines that served 117 eligible non-Alaskan communities in 2013. For the most part, only airports in eligible communities that received EAS-subsidized service have experienced an increased number of flights since 2007. However, the service may not always be the most cost-effective option for connecting people to the national transportation network, and the total and per-community EAS subsidies have grown since 2008. Legislation to control costs was recently enacted which limited access to EAS, for example by changing eligibility requirements.", "The Small Community Air Service Development Program (SCASDP) is a grant program to help small communities enhance air service at small-hub or smaller airports. DOT can award no more than 40 grants a year, thus SCASDP assists fewer communities than does EAS. Further, unlike EAS, funding for SCASDP\u2014$6 million in 2013\u2014has decreased since the program was created in 2002. Past reviews of SCASDP's effectiveness have found mixed success, with about half or less of the grants achieving their goals.", "Multimodal and community-based approaches can be used to help small communities connect to the nation's transportation network.

However, the  economics of the airline industry has traditionally made it difficult to  establish or sustain viable air service in smaller communities.", "Many small communities have struggled with limited air service since  Congress deregulated commercial air service in 1978 to allow a  competitive market for passenger air service to develop. Since  deregulation, airlines have largely been free to decide where in the United  States they want to operate, how often they want to fly there, the type of  aircraft, and how much they want to charge. Small and rural communities  have found it difficult to retain and enhance their air service. Anticipating  this difficulty, Congress created the Essential Air Service (EAS) in 1978  and, later in 2002, the Small Community Air Service Development  Program (SCASDP)\u2014both under the U.S. Department of Transportation  (DOT)\u2014to help small communities maintain air service. Since 2000, the  overall aviation industry has experienced significant turmoil\u2014including the  two economic downturns, the terrorist events of September 11, 2001, and  rising fuel costs\u2014which has curtailed passenger demand and led to  numerous bankruptcies and restructurings.

The airport categories in  figure 1 also determine the allocation of Airport Improvement Program  (AIP) grants for airport capital improvements. FAA awarded nearly $3  billion in grants to all airports in fiscal year 2013, for safety, capacity, and  environmental capital improvements. The grants offset the fees that  airports charge users, so they are critical for small airports hoping to  retain or attract airport users. For example, any airport with at least  10,000 passengers is assured at least $1 million in annual grant funding.", "The EAS program has historically provided the most direct support to  small community air service. Anticipating that airlines would focus their  resources on generally more profitable, high-density routes, Congress  established the EAS program as part of the Airline Deregulation Act of  1978. Under the EAS program, if an airline cannot provide air service to  eligible communities without incurring a loss, DOT provides an airline a  subsidy to serve those communities. The program was initially enacted  for 10 years, it was then extended for another 10 years, and in 1996, the  10-year time limit was removed. Congress has, over time, revised  eligibility requirements, such as maximum subsidy amounts per  passenger, and operating requirements, such as providing service with  two-engine, two-pilot planes. The program now provides subsidies to  airlines to serve small airports that are (1) at least 70 driving miles from  the nearest medium- or large-hub airport, or (2) requires a per-passenger  EAS subsidy less than $200 unless such point is greater than 210 miles  from the nearest medium- or large-hub airport. The amount of subsidies  varies by location. Operating airlines receiving the subsidies must provide  direct service to a nearby medium- or large-hub airport so that  passengers can connect to the national air transportation network. Our  discussion of EAS in this testimony does not include communities in  Alaska receiving EAS-subsidized air service since the requirements for  communities in Alaska are different and are not representative of the  program in the rest of the country.", "Congress also established SCASDP as a pilot program in 2000 in the  Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century  (AIR-21), to help small communities enhance their air service. AIR-21 authorized the program for fiscal years 2002 and 2003, and subsequent  legislation reauthorized the program through fiscal year 2008 and  eliminated the \u201cpilot\u201d status of the program. Further, the FAA  Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 reauthorized funding for SCASDP  through fiscal year 2015. The law establishing SCASDP allows DOT  considerable flexibility in implementing the program and selecting projects  to be funded. Grant funds can be used to cover various projects that can  be reasonably related to improving air service to the community, such as  any new advertising or promotional activities, or for studies to improve air  service and traffic. The law defines basic eligibility criteria and statutory  priority factors, but meeting a given number of priority factors does not  automatically mean DOT will select a project. SCASDP grants may be  made to single communities or a consortium of communities, although no  more than 40 grants may be awarded in a given year and no more than  four grants each year may be given in the same state."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Airline Industry Is Adapting to Economic Pressures that Creates Challenges to Maintaining Air Service to Small Communities", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Service to Small Communities Has Declined since 2007", "paragraphs": ["Air service to small airports as measured by the number of flights and  seats available has mostly declined since 2007, but so has service to  airports of all sizes.

In previous work, we have found that population movement  has decreased demand for air service to small communities.  Geographic areas, especially in the Midwest and Great Plains states,  lost population between 1980 and 2010, as illustrated in figure 3  below. As a result, certain areas of the country are less densely  populated than they were 35 years ago when Congress initiated the  EAS program. For small communities located close to larger cities  and larger airports, a lack of local demand can be exacerbated by  passengers choosing to drive to airports in larger cities to access  better service and lower fares.", "The effect of industry consolidation on the level of service to small  communities is reflected in \u201ccapacity purchase agreements\u201d\u2014 agreements between mainline airlines and their regional partners. Under  these agreements, a mainline airline pays the regional airline  contractually agreed-upon fees for operating certain flight schedules. In  recent years, according to a 2013 MIT study, mainline airlines have  shifted a larger percentage of their small community service to regional  airlines.

In 2009, we found  that planes serving airports in 2008 with EAS service were only about 37  percent full versus an industry average of about 80 percent. This was  due, in part, to EAS subsidized service not having the destinations,  frequency, or low fares that passengers prefer.

The OIG found that 70 percent of the grants in the  review failed to fully achieve their objectives; specifically, 50 percent of  the grants were unable to achieve any of their articulated grant objectives  or were unable to sustain grant benefits beyond the grant completion and  20 percent were either partially able to obtain or achieve all of their grant  objectives or were voluntarily terminated. The remaining 30 percent of the  grants were successful in achieving their grant objectives and sustaining  the resulting benefits for at least 12 months. The OIG made  recommendations to improve the grant award process by (1) giving  priority to communities with better developed grant applications, (2)  requiring communities requesting non-marketing grants to use a part of  the funding awarded to them to implement a marketing program, and (3)  evaluating the impact of the \u201csame project limitation\u201d on program  effectiveness and seek legislative changes, if necessary. According to the  OIG\u2019s report, DOT concurred with each of the recommendations and took  the appropriate actions to implement them.

In another example, the officials stated that one recipient of a  2002 grant reported in 2011 that while unable to establish air service prior  to receiving its grant, the grant enabled the community\u2019s airport to  establish and sustain air service to the area and has resulted in  substantial economic benefits for the community."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Legislation, Regulations, and Airport Policies Affect Service to Small Communities", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the federal programs previously discussed, other legislative  and regulatory policies could affect the provision of air service to small  communities.", "Perimeter rules.

Regional airlines\u2014most likely to provide air service to  small communities\u2014have been disproportionally affected by the new  rule because, prior to the new rule, more of their pilots did not meet  the new minimum qualifications compared to their larger, mainline  airline counterparts. Earlier this year, we found that 11 of the 12  regional airlines that were interviewed reported difficulties finding  sufficient numbers of qualified pilots over the past year. Furthermore,  five of these regional airlines reported to us that they were limiting  service to some smaller communities because they did not have pilots  available to provide that service. For instance, Great Lakes Airlines  recently canceled service to ten small communities reportedly due to  a lack of available pilots. Similarly, Silver Airways provided DOT with  the required notice of its intent to discontinue scheduled service to five  small communities reportedly for the same reason.
